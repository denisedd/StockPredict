{"Headline": "They Promised Us Jet Packs. They Promised the Bosses Profit.", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byIf the project had been successful \u2014 and this was always a big if \u2014 it would have changed the definition of green energy and potentially undercut some of the most important industries in the world, not least the oil business. But after two years of trying, and an undisclosed research budget, Foghorn died during a January staff meeting.The result: Everyone on the team received a bonus (they won\u2019t say how much).X, formerly called Google X, cheekily refers to itself as \u201cthe moonshot factory.\u201d They are the people behind Google\u2019s self-driving car, along with various out-there projects like Loon, an attempt to beam internet access from stratospheric balloons, and Wing, a drone delivery service. Those efforts sit atop dozens of aborted projects \u2014 some just ideas, others that consumed years \u2014 like a never built jet pack and giant blimps that would haul cargo with the same efficiency as an ocean liner.What all these efforts have in common, besides imaginative power, is that they do not make any money. X\u2019s budget and head count are a secret, but shareholders\u2019 perceptions about the division were aptly summed up by a poster board in its Mountain View, Calif., offices. It had a picture of a burning $100 bill followed by, \u201cInvestors think we do this.\u201dThat poster points to a central question for both X and Alphabet: What exactly is X\u2019s business? And how does a public company invest in such speculative ideas, most of which will never work, without irritating investors or wasting a ton of money?Building a research division is an old and often unsuccessful concept. For decades, corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Xerox have tried, in varying ways, to organize research-oriented groups in hopes of finding ways to cash in on emerging technologies before their competitors.Those efforts played a role in creating some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant innovations. For instance, Bell Labs, then a division of AT&T, invented the transistor, the foundation of modern electronics. But in many cases these research arms did little for the companies that financed them.Xerox pioneered the graphical interface for computers \u2014 the idea that people could navigate with a mouse rather than typing obscure commands on a screen. But it was a young company named Apple that turned that idea into a giant business.\u201cIn general, the model of having a central research lab that the corporation funds for research into new technologies has not produced much for these companies,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, a professor at the Arizona State University School for the Future of Innovation in Society. \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t see many of the successful young companies today thinking about building them.\u201dX is trying to make corporate research systematic by borrowing working ideas from the past, while adding a few wrinkles \u2014 like giving people a financial incentive to admit when something is not working out \u2014 in hopes of not making the same mistakes.This effort comes at a time when Alphabet is trying to enforce financial discipline over a broad empire that was famous for not worrying about nickels and dimes.Next month will be the first anniversary of Google\u2019s surprise announcement that it would remake itself as a holding company. All the ad-driven and highly profitable businesses like search would still be called Google. The assumption was that the other divisions would have to prove they could stand on their own financially \u2014 at least over time.While investors still do not know X\u2019s budget, they at least have a sense of the limits. In the first quarter, Alphabet lost about $800 million on what it called \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 everything outside Google\u2019s core search and advertising businesses \u2014 and it will update the figure when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.At the same time, now that X is spinning off new companies that will either stand on their own or die, investors are getting something of a yardstick to judge the division\u2019s progress. If one of those new companies starts to rival search advertising as a revenue stream, X will be considered a success. If that never happens, it will be a failure (and not the good kind).For instance, X\u2019s self-driving car project, known internally as Chauffeur, recently hired a chief executive and is poised to become a stand-alone company. Another, called Verily, is a life sciences company that has developed, among other things, a glucose-sensing contact lens for people with diabetes, and has licensed that technology to Novartis. Verily became its own company shortly after Google announced the Alphabet reorganization.\u201cThe thing we created \u2014 our product \u2014 was Verily, and at the highest level we are being paid as an organization to do that somewhat regularly,\u201d said Astro Teller, X\u2019s chief executive, though his actual title is \u201ccaptain of moonshots.\u201d \u201cI would not want to promise anyone internally or externally that we\u2019re going to do it once a year.\u201dThere are two main differences between X and the corporate research arms of the past. While operations like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC worked on problems that were at least nominally related to their parent companies\u2019 core businesses, X employees can work on anything they like. In fact, they are discouraged from straying into Google\u2019s main business because Google has its own research group that focuses on machine learning and other computer science topics.And while Bell Labs and others made huge contributions to basic, university-style research, X projects are conceived as moneymaking enterprises, or things that at least seem as if they could make money sometime in the next few years. With Foghorn, the goal was to turn seawater into gasoline for no more than $5 a gallon \u2014 enough that it could conceivably find a market in some European nations where high taxes make gasoline more costly.Kathy Cooper, an engineer who led the project, said of the goal, \u201cI think we could meet it, but it would be more like 15 to 20 years.\u201d That was too far away, which was why she recommended killing it.X employees avoid talking about money, but it is not a subject they can ignore. They face financial barriers that can shut down a project if it does not pan out as quickly as planned. And they have to meet various milestones before they can hire more people for their teams.The point, several executives said, is to encourage employees to think big while staying away from creating technology for technology\u2019s sake.\u201cIf you actually want to make the world better, focus on what would actually make the world better, and the technology will take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Teller said. In other words, great ideas that solve real problems will bring in real money.One of the more public examples was a recent overhaul of a Google robotics effort whose best-known project is a robotic cheetah. The division was recently dismantled, and its disparate technologies are being re-evaluated so they can either be sold off or streamlined for a specific moonshot idea, like \u201cbuild a car that can drive itself.\u201dOver the last year, X has hardened project milestones and created an intermediate step, called Foundry. The group\u2019s leader, Obi Felten, said her job was to hone new technologies into a concrete product and to work with engineers like Ms. Cooper to help them write business plans.The idea is to create a conveyor-belt-like process that encourages employees to quickly jettison projects that seem unlikely to work and to avoid technologies that are neat ideas but would never make money.One of the best ways to save money, Mr. Teller said, is to encourage employees to kill projects before they become expensive \u2014 hence the bonus for the Foghorn team. X staff meetings begin with a \u201cpremortem\u201d process in which people predict how various technologies might fall short. Employees\u2019 laptops are decorated with stickers of crumpled-up paper that represent the end of past efforts.When Mr. Teller speaks at events like South by Southwest and TED, he ruminates so deeply on the word \u201cfail\u201d that successes are sometimes framed as \u201cfailing to fail.\u201dThe idea of celebrating failure is a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9, but Mr. Teller talks about it in the practical terms of a management consultant. Say you have a team of 20 people working on a project that is not going anywhere, he said in a recent interview. In a year those 20 people will be 30 people. The company has to pay their salaries and health insurance, and the team will inevitably hire a few consultants. Worse, they will have wasted a year.How much money could the company save if you could get them to cut bait a year earlier?\u201cThat\u2019s the magic,\u201d Mr. Teller said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do it. They will not raise their hands and say, \u2018This project is just not what we should be working on,\u2019 unless you start bonusing them, unless they can get a promotion for ending their project.\u201dFailure bonuses are also an example of how X, which was set up independent of Google from the outset, is a leading indicator of sorts for how the autonomous Alphabet could work. In Alphabet, employees who do not work for Mother Google are supposed to have their financial futures tied to their own company instead of Google\u2019s search ads. At X, that means killing things before they become too expensive.Mr. Teller\u2019s decision to start paying bonuses to employees who kill their own projects happened long before the Alphabet transition, and it was met with skepticism from Google\u2019s chief culture officer. Mr. Teller got what he wanted anyway.\u201cThey were just offended by the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t even talk about it anymore.\u201dX was founded in 2010, and it was originally in a brick building on the edge of Google\u2019s main campus. At the beginning, it felt like an extended 20 percent project \u2014 the extra projects Google employees are encouraged to work on outside of their main job \u2014 with little in the way of process.Former Google employees said this led to a temptation to overhype projects long before they were ready. The most notorious example of this was Google Glass, the much maligned computer glasses.The glasses were supposed to have a marketing scheme to match, and X employees hatched an idea for floating showrooms. Later, when mysterious barges showed up in Portland, Me., and San Francisco Bay, they kicked off months of speculation and conspiracy theories until finally they were towed away without a word from Google.Mr. Teller said he shut down the barges idea the first day it was his decision to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of agonizing about that,\u201d he said.Today, the company\u2019s offices are a few miles from Google\u2019s main campus. They are full of electric vehicles and people riding skateboardlike contraptions. Mr. Teller appears to be always on Rollerblades.Beyond the main lobby and offices, behind key-card-protected doors, sit various labs, as well as an open warehouse floor that houses a division called the Design Kitchen, which appears to be a cross between a machine shop and a cool dad\u2019s garage. Some items spotted on a recent tour included climbing rope; lots of tools; oversize plugs; a set of skateboard wheels attached to a block, wires and a 9-volt battery; a plastic ear; and beer.Unlike Google, where software engineers are kings, X is run by an eclectic batch of scientists and tinkerers whose backgrounds range from math, physics and chemistry to design, fashion and public art. The line \u201cI\u2019m not an engineer\u201d seems to be a point of pride. Rich DeVaul, who heads a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d team whose job is to hatch and kill ideas in short order, guessed that fewer than half the employees have engineering degrees (he doesn\u2019t).\u201cI would argue that the great strength of X, in fact, is that basically we aren\u2019t just a bunch of techies,\u201d he said.The combination of big ideas, lofty rhetoric and a strict code of secrecy has made X a source of endless speculation and conspiracy theories. The one you hear most frequently, usually from competitors and venture capitalists, is that X is a giant public relations plan to distract regulators from Google\u2019s search business, which is under scrutiny around the world.Cynical though that sounds, it points to something that seems fundamentally true: Many of history\u2019s great corporate research efforts, like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, have come from companies that were monopolies or close to it.Failure bonuses notwithstanding, no normal person would walk away from X thinking it looked frugal. There is a free cafeteria whose recent menu included sushi and pork tri-tip. The bathrooms have Japanese toilet seats with buttons for warmth and spritz. Listening to X executives talk about saving money is a bit like having billionaires tell you they built a $30 million house for $30 million and not a penny more.But X\u2019s success will be less about money saved than the creation of a new Google-size business whose profits wash away all the losses. And while the division has already had some successes, it has yet to produce the \u201cmoonshot\u201d Mr. Teller is hoping for.Arguably the biggest success, Google Brain, is the one people know the least about. It was an artificial intelligence effort that was spun back into core Google in 2012 and is now embedded in products like voice search and the Google Photos app, in which users can search their albums for images like \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmountains.\u201dInvestors would prefer a shiny new business that does not rely on advertising. Mr. DeVaul hopes that if X can deliver a big hit, it will encourage other companies to copy the entire concept. Management science is a lot less interesting than moonshots, but until X hits the moon, that is what it is selling.\u201cWe could have five or 10 other world-class organizations doing this, and we would not be able to scratch the surface of the crazy big hard challenges out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist: I believe that there is an endless supply of huge problems affecting humanity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dennis Green, Pioneering Coach of the Vikings and the Cardinals, Dies at 67", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byDennis Green, a pioneering head coach who led the Vikings to a consistent run of excellence in the 1990s, died on Thursday. He was 67.When he took over as coach of the Vikings in 1992, Green was only the second black head coach in the modern era of the National Football League; Art Shell had become head coach of the Raiders in 1989. Though he was a consistent winner in Minnesota, Green was let down by his teams\u2019 postseason performances and never made it to a Super Bowl as head coach.Green was born on Feb. 17, 1949, into a working-class family in Harrisburg, Pa., the youngest of five boys. \u201cWe didn\u2019t live in the projects,\u201d he once told The Minneapolis Star Tribune, \u201cbut we lived where people who had just moved from the projects lived.\u201dHis father, Penrose, a postal worker, died of a ruptured appendix when Dennis was 11, and his mother, Anna, a beautician, died of cancer when he was 13. Thereafter, he was raised by his grandparents.He played football at Iowa for three seasons, 1968-70, as a halfback, and graduated in 1971 with a degree in finance. After briefly playing for the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League, Green started his coaching career as an assistant at Dayton in 1973, earning $6,000 a year before moving his way up the ladder to jobs at Iowa and Stanford.When Bill Walsh, Stanford\u2019s head coach, was hired by the San Francisco 49ers, he gave Green a first taste of the N.F.L., bringing him along as a special teams coach in 1979.Green landed his first head coaching job at Northwestern, whose teams were perennial losers, in 1981. He coached there for four years without ever winning more than three games in a season. Still, he was named Big Ten coach of the year in 1982 for engineering upsets of Minnesota and Michigan State.He had more success as the head coach at Stanford, where he turned around a struggling program in three years, culminating in a bowl appearance. When he took over there, he was one of only four black head coaches at the 104 top-division colleges.That success landed him his first N.F.L. head coaching job, at Minnesota, replacing Jerry Burns.\u201cI am a product of the civil rights movement and came along at a time when doors were opening,\u201d Green said.But he played down his distinction as one of the few black head coaches in the N.F.L.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody considers me a black coach,\u201d he told The Star Tribune. \u201cI don\u2019t think a player is concerned what my race is. I think he wants someone who will teach him something.\u201dHe took over a Vikings team in a state of malaise, still reeling from trading away five players and eight draft picks for running back Herschel Walker. Green shipped Walker out and brought in a staff that included the future head coach Tony Dungy as defensive coordinator.In a league with little job security for coaches, Green lasted 10 seasons in Minnesota, making the playoffs eight times and posting a stellar regular-season record of 97-62. He was coach of the year twice, including in his first season. His teams struggled to make a mark in the postseason, though, going just 4-8 in the playoffs.His crowning achievement was a 15-1 season in 1998. The team\u2019s potent offense, led by quarterback Randall Cunningham and the rookie receiver Randy Moss, scored 556 points, a league record at the time. That team, too, disappointed in the playoffs, losing the N.F.C. championship game at home to the Atlanta Falcons in overtime after leading by 20-7.When the Vikings slumped to 5-10 with one game left to play in 2001, Green was fired.After working as a television analyst, Green got another chance in 2004, with the Cardinals. He never managed to get that team on track, completing three seasons without a winning record.\u201cMy whole football career is predicated on what he did for me,\u201d Fitzgerald said on Friday. \u201cHe hired me as a ball boy for the Vikings and then he drafted me in the N.F.L. So he\u2019s directly responsible for everything I\u2019ve done in my life.\u201dGreen finished his career with three seasons as a head coach in the fledgling United Football League.It ended with the emphatic line \u201cAnd we let them off the hook!\u201d He then stalked out of the news conference.Green had a sense of humor about the episode, allowing video of it to be used in a beer commercial.An obituary on Saturday about Dennis Green, head coach of the Minnesota Vikings in the 1990s, referred imprecisely to a distinction he held. While he was the second black coach in the modern era of the National Football League, he was the third in N.F.L. history overall. (Fritz Pollard, who coached N.F.L. teams in the 1920s, was the league\u2019s first black head coach and Art Shell was the second.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Try to Lower Racial Bias, but Under Pressure, It Isn\u2019t So Easy", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byThe recent string of racially charged police shootings, and the deadly response on Thursday in Dallas, have come despite efforts by police departments across the United States to train officers to recognize and reduce the effects of racial stereotypes in potentially violent situations.Whether these bias reduction programs can lead to lasting change in policing is an unanswered question. Their effect on split-second decision making is extremely hard to measure \u2014 and experts say some programs may even backfire.\u201cThis is contrary to what people assume,\u201d Dr. Correll said, \u201cbut it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are simulations, in a lab, where everyone knows it\u2019s a game.\u201dOut in the real world, a different dynamic takes hold.\u201cWhen people are out on the street, in high-pressure situations, we suspect they\u2019re much more likely to fall back on gut reactions,\u201d Dr. Correll said. \u201cA simulation can\u2019t capture all the factors involved in the real-life encounter \u2014 the fear, the behavior of the other person, all that.\u201dMetropolitan police departments have employed various approaches to improve officers\u2019 judgment in threatening situations.\u201cThe science clearly shows that the first step in reducing your bias is recognizing that it exists,\u201d she said.One part of the training that Dr. Fridell said was based on studies of implicit bias is directed at countering stereotypes. As an example, she said, an officer might be confronted with a series of situations in which people from a variety of races and ethnicities either present a threat or do not present a threat.\u201cIf we did that over and over again, the officers would learn that \u2018I need to not focus on demographics,\u2019\u201d she said, because the threat was just as likely to come from a white person or a woman as it was from a black person or a man.Dr. Fridell said one of the central messages of the training was that \u201cpolicing based on stereotypes and biases is unsafe, ineffective and unjust.\u201d\u201cMaybe some officers are concerned about being unjust,\u201d she said, \u201cbut let me tell you, they are all concerned about being effective and safe.\u201dWhile police officers have reported in written evaluations that the training helped them, no studies have examined its success in reducing bias or whether officers who have taken the training are less likely to be involved in shootings or other uses of force.An increasing number of departments around the country also train officers on ways to defuse volatile situations before force is needed. Such training teaches officers to use time and distance to de-escalate tense interactions and reduce the likelihood that force will be used rashly.One approach that does not work very well, Dr. Fridell said, is traditional diversity or \u201csensitivity\u201d training, which teaches officers about other cultures and how to deal with them, but does not address implicit bias.Dr. Correll, the Colorado researcher, said such programs could even backfire. \u201cSome interventions you think would work, like having officers try really hard not to use bias, not to think of race \u2014 well, in the split-second in which they have to a make a decision, all they think about is race: \u2018Ah, he\u2019s black,\u2019 and there\u2019s no time to correct it. They exhibit more stereotyping behavior, not less.\u201dBias reduction programs, in short, are at this point like experimental drugs, Dr. Correll said.\u201cThey may work to reduce biased violence, they may do nothing, and they may cause harm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, because we haven\u2019t really tested them in a rigorous way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Five other defendants were named Friday in the case, including Andr\u00e9 Esteves, a billionaire banker who Mr. Amaral said had been prepared to finance Mr. Cerver\u00f3\u2019s escape.The plan to spirit Mr. Cerver\u00f3 out of Brazil never materialized; instead, Mr. Amaral was stripped of his seat in Congress. And while Mr. da Silva\u2019s other legal problems were intensifying, Ms. Rousseff tried to name him as her chief of staff in March, a move that would have given him legal protections.Amid the upheaval, Mr. da Silva contends that Sergio Moro, the judge overseeing the Petrobras investigation, unfairly targeted him by releasing intercepts of his telephone conversations. Mr. da Silva filed a petition this week with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, arguing that Mr. Moro had abused his power in the case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats, Looking Past Obama, Are a Party Without a Cause", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 When President Obama takes the stage here this week to begin his monthslong political farewell, it will mark a bittersweet moment for Democrats.But without the unifying presence of Mr. Obama in the White House, or the organizing aim of expanding health care, it is unclear who will hold the party together and what will be the next great project of liberalism.For the moment, Hillary Clinton and her party have an industrial-strength adhesive: keeping Donald J. Trump out of the Oval Office. But interviews with a range of Democrats indicate that, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she will lead a party that is unified around social tolerance, but sharply divided over how to achieve economic justice in an era of upheaval.There is still a shared view that broadening opportunity for all remains at the heart of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe bumper sticker is now \u2018income fairness,\u2019\u201d said Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman.Yet there is no consensus over how to address the country\u2019s persistent wage stagnation, or even if any sweeping legislation can be achieved at all in a time of deepening polarization and when the Republican Party has little desire to compromise.For now, many in the party whose presidents ushered in Social Security, the G.I. Bill and civil rights seem most focused on infrastructure.\u201cWho\u2019s against infrastructure?\u201d Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said.Yet beyond this short-term objective, there are clashing views about how to further the cause of economic equality at a moment of technological transformation. Centrist Democrats are focused largely on changes to the tax code, work-force development and other incremental steps to help people adjust to a shifting workplace.Last week in Cleveland, New York Times photographers covered the Republican National Convention at \u2014 and outside of \u2014 Quicken Loans Arena.\u201cWe all believe in economic opportunity for everybody,\u201d Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said. \u201cThe difference between myself and Senator Sanders and Senator Warren,\u201d he added, referring to Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, \u201cis they think that\u2019s not happening because the system is rigged, and I think it\u2019s not happening because the system is changing.\u201dThe strength of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, however, has emboldened liberals and made them unwilling to settle for small-bore changes to the political system.\u201cMany working people were inspired by his message of aiming higher, not for continuity,\u201d said Larry Cohen, the former president of the communications workers\u2019 union and a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders. Echoing the former candidate, Mr. Cohen said major changes were needed to the country\u2019s campaign finance laws, banks and trade laws.\u201cThe way we put food on the table and higher education within reach is to create a democracy where working people count as much as wealthy people,\u201d he said.Mary Kay Henry, the president of the service workers\u2019 union, said the party\u2019s liberal platform reflected Democrats\u2019 \u201cchoice to meet the moment\u201d and the pressure that progressive activists have applied to the party elite.\u201cWe think that government now has to play a role in backing the collective action happening all across the progressive movement,\u201d Ms. Henry said, pointing to efforts to organize fast-food workers as one example.But for Democrats facing re-election in two years, especially in more competitive parts of the country, there is more of an appetite for conciliation than for confrontation.\u201cIt\u2019s important to show the American people that Washington can work,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \u201cI personally feel urgency about getting some things done.\u201d\u201cPurity tests,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, \u201care not a recipe for getting things done.\u201dEven if Democrats could agree on their next grand ambition, it would be difficult to push through a Congress where at least one chamber is likely to still be controlled by Republicans.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, as Ms. McCaskill ruefully noted, is unlikely to take up legislation to make college tuition-free. (Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act at a time when his party had overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate.)So what to do when facing the demands of an energized left in a period of divided government?Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies say they expect she would compromise to make what progress she can.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine are making their debut after she named him her running mate. Times reporters provided real-time analysis.\u201cIn a second,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s willingness to make deals. \u201cShe is a pragmatic leader who will work with anybody to push the ball forward.\u201dEven some progressives acknowledge that the near term will require patience.\u201cIncrementalism has always been embedded in the zeitgeist of being a Democrat,\u201d said Stacey Abrams, minority leader of the Georgia House. \u201cOur grand monuments took decades to build. We remember the victories, but too often we forget the game.\u201dMs. Abrams pointed to a need for progress on crucial quality-of-life issues, made more urgent by changes in the family and workplace that she said highlighted the need for expanded family leave and child-care benefits.\u201cDemocrats are the architects of health care and Social Security,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now that we\u2019ve got the foundation in place, we need the caulking that holds society together.\u201dMr. Warner has also been focused on the passing of laws to better reflect the country\u2019s shifting economy. \u201cThirty-five percent of the work force is at some level of contingent work status,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the social contract is set up on the basis of the full-time worker. So we need portable benefits now.\u201dIf it is all something of a scattershot approach, that is in part because if reflects both the political limitations of the moment and the thorny nature of addressing economic opportunity at a time of persistent wage stagnation.But Democrats take solace in what has taken place in this most unlikely of elections, with an avowed democratic socialist emerging as a political force in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party being seized by a candidate who ran explicitly against key elements of the party\u2019s free-market orthodoxy.\u201cIf you look at Trump voters and you look at our primary, there seems to be willingness for bolder answers,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cWe can\u2019t reach Trump voters on nativism, but we can reach them on bolder answers to economic challenges.\u201dIndeed, many Democrats believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s populism has sent a shudder through Republican ranks, driving home the need to respond to economic anxieties with something more potent than tax cuts.Or as Mr. Frank put it: \u201cEvery time we used to bring up income inequality, we were dismissed with two words: class warfare. Well, that ended this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Can Fix Its Student Loan Crisis. Just Ask Australia.", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewBorrowing for college is common across the globe. Even in Sweden, where tuition is free, most students borrow. What\u2019s exceptional about the United States is that so many borrowers are behind on their loans.So what do other countries do that makes their systems work better than ours?Even though their tuition is zero, Swedish students borrow to pay living expenses. In Sweden, college students are considered independent adults, with no societal expectation that their parents will support them financially. The overwhelming majority of students borrow to cover these living costs.Yet despite this widespread borrowing, there is no student debt crisis in Sweden, because payments are spread out over 25 years. They also start out low, rising slowly over time. In the United States, the typical repayment period is just 10 years.All the international student loan experts I have spoken with are shocked by how little time American students are given to pay their loans. In Germany, students pay their loans over 20 years; in England, it\u2019s 30 years.This makes sense. A core principle of finance is that the length of debt payments should align with the life of the asset. We pay for cars over five years and homes over 30 years because homes last a lot longer than cars. An education pays off over a lifetime, so it makes sense that student loans should be paid off over a long term.The generous Swedish welfare system and low income inequality help keep borrowers out of default. With a strong social safety net, even recent graduates with low earnings can meet their small monthly loan payments.But even in countries without Sweden\u2019s welfare state, student loans function better than in the United States.In Australia, income inequality is much higher than in Sweden. Yet while students borrow about as much as they do in the United States (30,000 Australian dollars, or about $22,000), the system works smoothly because borrowers pay nothing until their earnings reach about $40,000. Above that threshold, borrowers pay 4 percent of their income until the debt is paid off. Payments rise and fall automatically with earnings, just as our Social Security payments do.But in the standard American plan, payments don\u2019t vary over time. Borrowers face the same payments when they first get out of college as they will years later, when their earnings are higher and more stable.Just like Social Security contributions, student loan payments in Australia are automatically withheld from pay. Some critics argue that payroll withholding gives student loans primacy over other expenses: Why should a student loan get paid before more basic needs \u2014 food, rent \u2014 are met?But prioritizing basic needs is exactly what the Australian system does. The idea is that no one facing economic hardship should have to choose between paying student debt and paying for basic necessities. When earnings drop, loan payments drop immediately, allowing borrowers to devote their reduced budgets to essential needs. Borrowers don\u2019t have to fill out an application, or even make a phone call, to get the payments stopped.Payroll withholding is the only way to provide an immediate link between fluctuations in earnings and loan payments. Any other system delays the protections that low-income borrowers desperately need.In the income-based plans available in the United States, payments do not adjust automatically; they are based on the previous year\u2019s income and are flat for a year. If borrowers\u2019 earnings fluctuate during the year and they want to adjust payments, they must fill out new paperwork, and that can take months. This is no way to protect borrowers \u2014 especially young, low-income workers \u2014 against shocks to their earnings. When a boss cuts hours, a borrower needs a loan payment to drop now \u2014 not a year or more later.Staying in an income-based repayment requires filling out an annual application. Many who successfully enter an income-based plan find themselves kicked out the next year, when they (or their loan servicers) don\u2019t complete the required paperwork on time.While income-based repayment protects low-income borrowers, it also speeds repayment by high earners. The typical Australian graduate discharges student debt within eight to 12 years. Those with very high earnings (for example, lawyers) finish in as few as five years. That\u2019s because payments rise automatically when earnings do. As a result, high earners pay down their debt more rapidly than they would in a system of flat repayments.What\u2019s special about the United States is not how much we borrow. What\u2019s exceptional is that we have turned manageable debt into a financial disaster for millions.The repayment system in the United States was built when students borrowed little; many did not borrow at all. Other countries have overhauled their loan systems to reflect changing times. The United States has not, and borrowers are paying the price.Advertisement"}

Each multinational battalion will be in position for six months, but will not depart before replacements have arrived.Britain has agreed to take command of a battalion to be based in Estonia and Germany and one in Lithuania. American troops are expected to make up the bulk of a force to be stationed in Poland and commanded by the United States.While NATO struggled for months to find a country to take command of the fourth battalion, to be based in Latvia, Canada is now widely expected to emerge during the summit meeting as that group\u2019s leader.\u201cSince 1999, when Poland joined NATO, this is the most important summit for us,\u201d said Tomasz Szatkowski, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of defense. \u201cIt provides for the actual presence of Western allies in Poland.\u201dIn addition, under the plan agreed to in advance of the summit meeting, an entire brigade comprising four more battalions would operate on a roaming basis throughout the front line from the Baltics to Bulgaria \u2014 though the details, including where such a force would be based, remain to be hammered out.Of course, another topic sure to be discussed is the American presidential election campaign, in which the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has expressed doubts about the continued need for NATO and questioned whether the United States was being properly compensated for the military forces it has stationed across the globe.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone will say it publicly, but I cannot imagine it will not be part of the private discussions,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cA world with both Brexit and Trump? Holy moley, hold onto your pants.\u201dBut with Russia\u2019s continued belligerence, front-line governments, spearheaded by Poland and the Baltic states, pushed for a more robust posture this time around.What they are getting, while below their fondest hopes, does elevate NATO\u2019s strategy to what is being called \u201cenhanced forward presence.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been described as a speed bump,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cBut what it does is raise the price for the Russians.\u201dThe Russians would still have a massive advantage in troops \u2014 five or six times the number \u2014 and weaponry. But any incursion into the Baltics or Poland would put the Russian military in immediate contact with multinational NATO troops.Polish officials have said they would have preferred a larger NATO force, but are content with this for the time being. \u201cThis is a good compromise between what is desirable and what is possible,\u201d Mr. Szatkowski said.With some NATO states preferring a more diplomacy-based approach toward Russia and several countries still balking at financing the alliance at the agreed-upon level, this was as far as the front-line states believed that they could push.\u201cWhat Poland needs and what is realistic to expect are different things,\u201d said Roman Kuzniar, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the University of Warsaw and a former adviser to the president on foreign affairs under a previous Polish government. \u201cThe figures are fairly symbolic but, obviously, it is very important that these troops will be here.\u201dHow to enhance forces along what is being called the \u201csouthern flank,\u201d in response to the terrorism threat from the Middle East and the massive migrant wave from the region, will also be discussed at the summit, as will concerns about Russia\u2019s development of low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons.While the NATO meeting is the reason for the Warsaw gathering, other meetings will occur here over those two days. Senior European Union and NATO officials will get together, as will union leaders and American officials.\u201cUsually, that E.U.-U.S. meeting at these summits is fairly low key,\u201d Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cBut now, because of Brexit, it\u2019s a much bigger deal.\u201dThe larger question, Mr. Kuzniar said, is how Poland and other front-line states will respond to this \u201cnew strategic reality,\u201d with NATO troops stationed in their territory, though not in the numbers they desired.\u201cWill they develop more effective territorial defense forces and capabilities of their own?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill they seek offensive weapons to threaten Russian assets?

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Pulls Back from Deals in Coal Mining Sector", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byPressured by environmentalists and worried about big losses from a troubled industry, many large banks and other lenders have made a hasty retreat from coal mining in recent years.But even in these dark times, there was one bank that many coal miners could still count on for financing and advice: Deutsche Bank.Not any longer.The German banking giant is pulling back from the embattled coal sector, another sign of the increasing risks for banks that finance industries that contribute to climate change.Last week, six senior members of Deutsche Bank\u2019s metals and mining investment banking team, which was responsible for overseeing deals in the coal industry, said they were decamping for Jefferies, a smaller, scrappy New York investment bank that has a knack for scooping up investment bankers who increasingly feel out of place at larger, more heavily scrutinized global banks.A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the bankers\u2019 exodus. But industry analysts said the move was partly related to Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to back away from working on certain coal projects.Deutsche Bank has no immediate plans to replace the six bankers, who helped the German bank secure the largest market share of metals and mining revenue in the Americas among banks last year. That ranking was up from sixth place in 2011, when many of them joined Deutsche from the Swiss banking rival UBS.Dan Chu, a prominent coal banker at Deutsche Bank, will be global head of metals and mining investment banking at Jefferies.\u201cThe large banks are under significant pressure from environmental groups to limit their activity in fossil fuels and mining across the board,\u201d said Ted O\u2019Brien, chief executive of Doyle Trading Consultants, which focuses on the coal sector. \u201cThis move might reflect an investment banking team that was no longer that important to a large bank and that will now be able to practice their niche under somewhat less scrutiny.\u201dOnce a precious and sought-after resource, coal has fallen on hard times. Earlier this year, environmental groups like the Rainforest Action Network faulted Deutsche Bank for not going far enough in shunning coal.Banks are leaving coal for economic reasons, too. Just a few years ago, coal was surging, swept up in a global commodity craze, as mining companies sought to satisfy a seemingly insatiable demand from China.As recently as 2011, the top 10 investment banks in the sector took in more than $1.6 billion in investment banking revenue from metals and mining deals globally, including coal deals. By 2015, that total had fallen to just $820 million, according to Dealogic.The American coal industry, in particular, is now suffering a plague of bankruptcies. Power utilities are increasingly turning to cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to replace coal. Demand for coal from China has also cooled as its economy slows and the Chinese government tries to shift to cleaner energy sources.In the first three months of the year, American coal production plummeted to the lowest levels in 35 years, in large part because the winter was so warm. And the spring brought no respite. May\u2019s production of 50 million tons represented a 28 percent decline from May 2015, according to the Energy Department.In recent days, Murray Energy, a coal giant based in Ohio, sent notices to its employees that said it could be forced to lay off 80 percent of its work force, or roughly 4,400 employees, across six states because of the widespread depression in the industry.On Thursday, Alpha Natural Resources \u2014 which acquired the former Massey Energy in 2011 \u2014 received a judge\u2019s approval to exit bankruptcy. As part of a deal in the bankruptcy with the Sierra Club and other environmental groups in West Virginia, Alpha agreed to give 53 million tons of its coal to a nonprofit group for the purpose of its never being mined or burned \u2014 a sign of just how little value this commodity holds at the moment.As the coal industry undergoes what many analysts and investors expect to be a permanent downsizing, environmental groups have faulted Deutsche Bank for helping to sustain some life in the sector.In recent years, Deutsche has assisted one of mining\u2019s few durable operators, Blackhawk Mining, based in Lexington, Ky., which has been snapping up some of the best mines of bankrupt or nearly bankrupt companies such as Patriot Coal and Arch Coal.Blackhawk declined to comment.In more recent months, Deutsche Bank, which prides itself on being one of the top financiers of renewable energy projects in Europe, has taken a tougher stance against coal.At the annual general meeting in May, Deutsche Bank executives said the bank would not expand its activities in the coal sector, adding to an earlier pledge to \u201cphase out\u201d debt and equity underwriting to companies that engage in mountaintop removal.\u201cDeutsche Bank supports a well-balanced overall energy mix that takes account of economic conditions as well as environmental and health and safety considerations,\u201d a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement.Such considerations can go against the very grain of investment bankers, who are conditioned to work on as many deals as possible, not to cap activity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Coup Leader Must Be Held Accountable", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOn July 15, a rogue faction within Turkey\u2019s military attempted to suspend the Constitution, impose martial law and enforce a nationwide curfew. As troops and tanks blocked traffic crossing from Asia to Europe over the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, a number of government buildings including the Parliament, the Presidential Palace and the intelligence headquarters were heavily assaulted. During a series of coordinated attacks, more than 240 civilians and police officers in Istanbul and Ankara were shot by snipers, run over by tanks, shelled by assault helicopters and killed by bombs dropped from hijacked aircraft. Meanwhile, the rogue faction seized a public broadcaster and held an anchorwoman at gunpoint to announce that they were now in charge.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim called the coup illegal and, in consultation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ordered the police and other security forces to stop the coup plotters. Soon afterward, President Erdogan appeared on television to call on the people to resist the power grab. When Mr. Erdogan\u2019s message was aired live on CNNTurk, a private TV channel, the junta soldiers invaded its premises as well. Millions heard the call and defied the rebels. Opposition leaders also deplored the coup and called for resistance.In the meantime, an elite military squad was sent to the hotel on the Turkish Riviera where President Erdogan was vacationing, to kill him and his entire family. Having survived the assassination attempt, Mr. Erdogan escaped on his official jet, which reached Istanbul safely after the pilot deceived rogue F-16s patrolling the airspace.In the wake of the bloody coup attempt, the government, acting on the recommendations of civilian and military leaders, exercised its constitutional mandate to declare a three-month state of emergency. Adopted by countries like France and Belgium in response to terror attacks, this measure is intended to expedite the legislative process and provide the authorities with legal tools necessary to bring those responsible to justice.Several thousand military officers and their accomplices in law enforcement and the judiciary have been suspended or arrested for having links to the coup. Their removal from public posts makes the Turkish government stronger and more transparent. At least 1,200 rank-and-file soldiers, who weren\u2019t charged, have already been released from custody. A team of 70 prosecutors is investigating the case. The claim that this was a fake coup is no more credible than the laughable claim that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated by the United States.Testimony and evidence obtained from coup plotters point to Fethullah Gulen as the leader of the coup attempt, which was planned and staged by his followers within the army. Levent Turkkan, aide-de-camp to the chief of staff for Turkish armed forces, Gen. Hulusi Akar, confessed to being a member of the Gulenist group after he was arrested, adding that he executed orders from his Gulenist superiors. Generals leading the coup also urged General Akar to speak to Fethullah Gulen, who runs a covert empire from his mansion in rural Pennsylvania, hoping to persuade him to join in their rebellion, according to General Akar.Since the 1980s, the Gulenists, a religious cult whose members present themselves as peaceful educators, have always had a dark side. They have infiltrated the Turkish judiciary and security forces and manipulated the system to their advantage. They also fabricated evidence, engaged in illegal wiretapping and leaked government documents to smear their opponents.They own a number of charter schools and companies across America and have been accused of engaging in financial fraud and violating immigration and campaign finance laws.The United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish citizen, to Turkey, as is allowed under an existing treaty. Turkey has already provided a number of legal documents to American authorities and will send more as further evidence is collected. The United States should not let this man exploit its laws to avoid facing a fair and legitimate accounting in Turkey.Fethullah Gulen\u2019s claim that he has had nothing to do with this coup attempt is as credible as his claim that he has had nothing to do with hundreds of Gulenist schools, banks, companies and media outlets that operate under his direct orders. A due legal process will establish his role in this failed rebellion. It does not make sense for any country to condemn the coup without taking action against the lead putschist.Today, the people of Turkey are more united than at any time in recent history. In any democracy, citizens are bound to disagree. But our nation\u2019s response to the July 15 assault proved that democracy, freedom and the rule of law are nonnegotiable in Turkey. As the Turkish people mourn the dead, nurture the wounded and take pride in what we accomplished together, they also demand justice, closure and reassurances that never again shall we witness such a crisis.Ibrahim Kalin is the spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV News: Truth Squad or Trump Infomercial?", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byMediatorCLEVELAND \u2014 In the months since he began pursuing the presidency, Donald J. Trump has exhibited a command over the national news media that is without parallel in modern times.The can\u2019t-look-away quality of his public persona and his media awareness have frequently pushed much of our national journalism into an unsavory corner where the imperatives of equal time, hard scrutiny and adherence to traditional standards have given way to the business lure of the huge television ratings and internet clicks that Mr. Trump uniquely provides.Still, nothing will test the news media like the next few days in Cleveland, where the Republican convention gets underway on Monday. Mr. Trump will have something that even he has never had; something that only presidents and major party nominees get. And that is nearly full control of the national media stage for four straight evenings in prime time, across not only cable news, but, at least for one hour every night, the broadcast networks as well.He has been planning to make full use of his time in his trademark way, with daily themes that will weave in staples of hot-button topics from talk radio and the Fox News Channel\u2019s opinion programs: Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity, Hillary Clinton\u2019s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, and immigration.Truth will not come to the fore without hard work and, potentially, a fight.The situation puts a whole new twist on the quadrennial question about how news organizations should cover the national political conventions, which were once conclaves for the real work of nominating presidents and vice presidents but went on to become mere media messaging pageants.With that turn, a certain cat-and-mouse game developed between the networks and the convention planners over how much of the action on the main convention stage would be beamed directly into Americans\u2019 living rooms unfiltered, especially in earlier, prime-time hours, before the top-billed speaking slate begins. That segment \u2014 guaranteed full coverage on the broadcast networks \u2014 now represents only a single hour on television.The networks will usually cut away to their own anchors and analysts \u2014 their stars \u2014 when they deem the convention doings to be ratings downers. The top goal of the campaigns, then, is to \u201chold the cameras,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist who spearheaded convention planning for the Mitt Romney and George W. Bush campaigns.Of course, no candidate has been able to hold the cameras quite like Mr. Trump. And, given his reality show and self-marketing background, it has stood to reason that he would have a convention filled with television ratings bait.In a hopeful sign, the networks have made it clear to both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton that the same rules apply to the conventions that have applied to their coverage all year: The cameras will go to the ratings draws.\u201cBoth campaigns know that keeping the attention of the networks \u2014 and keeping the attention on their podium \u2014 is their job, not the networks\u2019 job,\u201d said Chuck Todd, who is host of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC and \u201cMTP Daily\u201d on MSNBC, and also serves as NBC News political director. (NBC will team up with PolitiFact for the convention.)I wondered aloud to Mr. Todd what networks like his would do if the Trump campaign goes ahead with prime-time programming around the Clinton-era sex scandals, which would certainly be a first in televised convention history. There would be an element of \u201cWow, we haven\u2019t seen that before,\u201d he told me, \u201cSo it fits the definition of \u2018new\u2019 in the word \u2018news.\u2019\u201dBut, he added, \u201cEvery network\u2019s going to make a different decision.\u201dThis is where the big test comes in.Even as Jay Wallace, Fox News Channel\u2019s executive vice president for news and editorial, told me that Mr. Trump\u2019s convention slate appeared to be \u201cplaying to some portions of our audience\u201d \u2014 those who tune in to the likes of Sean Hannity, whose show features many of the same themes \u2014 he said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re going to blow out our programming at certain hours for stuff like that.\u201dIn fact, all of the network executives I spoke with last week repeated what Sam Feist, the CNN Washington bureau chief, told me \u2014 that they would make decisions on the spot, on a \u201ccase-by-case basis,\u201d and that regardless they would do aggressive fact-checking, for both conventions. That could prove vital, especially after the big post-10 p.m. speeches that will most likely be shown in full.You could imagine seeing Mr. Trump exhort the convention crowd against the news media if he is displeased with its coverage, which would be its own sort of spectacle.Mr. Schriefer, the Republican strategist, said Mr. Trump \u2014 as well as Mrs. Clinton \u2014 would be wise to remember that conventions are the first time many people \u201cturn on the television to decide, Can this man or woman be president of the United States?\u201d Those are the stakes.The news media would be wise to remember it, too.Advertisement"}

However, he maintains firm control over his governing party and has successfully stifled opposition with the firing of critics from party posts, the closing of online news outlets and the criminal prosecution of social media detractors and political opponents.Mr. Najib, who has acknowledged receiving the money but said he broke no laws and took nothing for personal gain, told reporters on Thursday that his government would \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Justice Department action.\u201cAllow the process to take its course,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want to say categorically that we are serious about good governance.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Najib, reached late Thursday, said that the prime minister had not changed his position that the money he received was a gift from a Saudi donor and that he gave most of it back because he did not need it.The Justice Department complaint alleges in 136 pages of blow-by-blow detail that huge sums were diverted from the government fund, routed through bank accounts in various countries and then spent on high-end real estate, artwork, gambling and various luxury goods by Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson, friends and associates.The Justice Department filed a complaint on Wednesday in federal court in California to seize $1 billion dollars in assets said to be stolen from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund. Here is the complete court filing.The court filing seeks to recover more than $1 billion in assets bought with money that prosecutors say was stolen from the fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.Those assets, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Wednesday, \u201care just a portion of the more than $3 billion that was stolen from 1MDB and laundered through American financial institutions in violation of United States law.\u201dThe case, she said, should be seen as a sign of the country\u2019s \u201cfirm commitment to fighting international corruption\u201d and the department\u2019s determination \u201cto protect the American financial system from being used as a conduit for corruption.\u201dWhile the federal complaint does not identify Mr. Najib by name, it cites $731 million in funds that came from 1MDB that were deposited into accounts belonging to a government official identified as \u201cMalaysian Official 1.\u201dHowever, Mr. Najib is clearly recognizable in the descriptions and actions attributed to that official.Large transactions by \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d described in the complaint are identical to those previously acknowledged by Mr. Najib. The complaint describes the official\u2019s role in managing the fund, which matches Mr. Najib\u2019s role. And it says \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d is a relative of Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson.A person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d was Mr. Najib.The complaint does name Mr. Aziz, and a family friend, Jho Low, who played a key role in establishing the fund. Both are cited as possessing assets bought with money stolen from 1MDB.Mr. Najib\u2019s advisers have said Mr. Najib received about $1 billion in 2013, most of it donations from a member of the Saudi royal family to help him fight a tough election campaign that year.On Thursday, Mr. Apandi issued a statement asserting that no investigation had found evidence that 1MDB funds had been misappropriated. He said he had \u201cstrong concerns at the insinuations and allegations\u201d against Mr. Najib in the Justice Department complaint.The Saudi gift was also confirmed by Saudi Arabia.Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in April that Mr. Najib had received a \u201cgenuine donation\u201d from a Saudi donor. He did not specify the amount or provide any details.A Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman did not respond Friday to requests for comment.The Justice Department complaint mentions no such gift.The complaint says that $681 million transferred to Mr. Najib in 2013 came from a Singapore bank account held in the name of Tanore Finance Corporation. It says the money originated from $3 billion in bonds underwritten for 1MDB by Goldman Sachs.The Singapore account was controlled by Tan Kim Loong, also known as Eric Tan, an associate of Mr. Low, the complaint says.Four months after receiving the $681 million, Mr. Najib transferred $620 million back to the same Tanore account, according to the complaint.The complaint offers no explanation for why the prime minister received the money, held it for four months, then returned part of it. It is also unclear what happened to the $61 million he kept, although advisers have said he needed money for parliamentary elections that year.Mr. Low and Mr. Tan used money from the Tanore account to buy expensive artwork and an interest in the Park Lane Hotel, a luxury hotel overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, the complaint says.The complaint also says that \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d received $20 million in stolen 1MDB funds in 2011. The money, the first he received from the fund, was transferred from an account held in the name of a Saudi prince, the complaint says. It does not identify the prince.He received $30 million in 1MDB money in 2012 from a separate account, the complaint says.The prime minister\u2019s office did not respond to inquiries about those two deposits.The two transactions bring to $731 million the amount of money Mr. Najib is said to have received from the government fund he oversaw.Mr. Najib created 1MDB in 2009 to promote Malaysia\u2019s economic development. He oversaw the fund as chairman of its advisory board, a position he recently relinquished, and as finance minister, a position he still holds. The fund is wholly owned by the Finance Ministry.The fund\u2019s goal was \u201cimproving the well-being of the Malaysian people,\u201d Ms. Lynch said in announcing the civil action. \u201cBut unfortunately, sadly, tragically, a number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account.\u201dThe F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service took part in the investigation and relied in part on bank transfer data, 1MDB memos and internal emails. Special Agent Darryl Wegner, chief of the F.B.I.\u2019s International Corruption Unit, said that leaders of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission showed \u201ctremendous courage\u201d in pursuing the investigation.The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission\u2019s investigation was shut down by Malaysia\u2019s attorney general.In Washington, the White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that President Obama had discussed the scandal with Mr. Najib during a visit to Malaysia last fall.\u201cThe president reiterated how important it is, particularly for a fast-growing country like Malaysia, to be transparent, to demonstrate a commitment to fair play and good government and a business climate that will allow that country\u2019s economy to continue to succeed,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Louise Story contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton: Victim of Her Own Success", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDurham, N.H. \u2014 One of the most powerful ironies in a political season full of perversities is a paradox that now defines Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign: The first female presidential candidate to overcome the obstacles that sank every single woman before her now confronts criticism for overcoming those very same difficulties.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has twice built a sizable war chest through prodigious fund-raising from Wall Street donors and \u201csuper PACs,\u201d just as her male counterparts and opponents have always done. But her success in doing so has fueled charges that she is a captive of financial interests and all too willing to exploit a corrupt system of campaign financing.Part of what made fund-raising so difficult for women were the prevailing doubts that they could secure the nomination of their party, let alone win a national campaign. There were good reasons for such skepticism. When Senator Smith ran for president, over 40 percent of Americans said they would not vote for a woman for president even if she was \u201cwell qualified\u201d and nominated by their own political party.Mrs. Clinton decisively changed that assumption with her strong showing in 2008. Yet the confidence invested in her by party leaders and elites now stokes criticism that she is \u201ctoo establishment,\u201d too cozy with Washington insiders and too comfortable with those who have sought to leash insurgent forces within the Democratic Party. Her determined effort to overcome the impediments that waylaid other women who have sought the presidency now offers fresh evidence to critics that she is driven by a craven thirst for power.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.Then there is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s career in public service, unrivaled by any female presidential candidate \u2014 and almost any male president. Even Mrs. Smith, who served in the Senate longer than any woman in the 20th century, never acquired such clout or standing within her party.Yet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pathway through public life has also tied her to what some consider the mistaken domestic policies of her husband\u2019s administration \u2014 a forestalled health care reform initiative, a crime bill that contributed to mass incarceration, and an overhaul of welfare that further impoverished some of the poorest Americans. The first woman to be truly competitive as a presidential candidate is thus tagged as an old school insider more often than as a path breaker.One of the most insidious obstacles confronting female candidates, historically, has been the belief that they lack by nature or experience the capacity to oversee foreign policy. Mrs. Clinton broke through in 2008, when primary voters, according to polling, said she would be a better commander in chief than her opponents in the Democratic race. As secretary of state, she played a central role on the Obama foreign policy team.In the current campaign, however, her critics blame her for what they portray as failures in the foreign policy of the Obama administration. Their dismay over her handling of her email supposedly demonstrates that she cannot be trusted with national security. One doesn\u2019t have to defend her decisions to suggest that men who have made similar choices in similar situations \u2014 former Secretary of State Colin Powell comes to mind \u2014 have been spared this sweeping judgment.Time and again, Americans have deemed men worthy of the White House if they could succeed on the national political stage, raise sufficient money, rally the support of party leaders, appeal to voters and point to domestic and foreign policy experience. That these assets are suddenly negatives, at the very moment that a woman finally achieved them, is curious, to say the least.In 1872, Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to seek the presidency. Her campaign was greeted with curiosity, enthusiasm and a firestorm of complaints from her critics. Among them was Harriet Beecher Stowe, who asked if a woman who survived the rigor of a campaign \u2014 \u201can ordeal that kills a man\u201d \u2014 was the \u201ckind of a woman that we would want to see at the head of our government?\u201d A century and a half later, we may have a woman running for president, but she continues to face that same question in 2016.Advertisement"}

In a blog post late on Wednesday, the electric carmaker\u2019s boss laid out his vision for the next decade or so. He has some compelling ideas: building more vehicle types and increasing autonomous-driving capabilities for a sharing economy. The trouble is that plenty of rivals want a piece of that business, too. And his missive fails to address several more immediate concerns \u2013 not least how to finance his ambitions.Mr. Musk titled his post \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the \u201cSecret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d that he wrote almost 10 years ago to the day. That detailed how he was building an electric sports car to raise money to manufacture family-friendly vehicles. He has largely succeeded, which lessens the conceit of drafting a new outline for the next decade.Unlike in 2006, though, Mr. Musk\u2019s ideas are now mainstream. Larger carmakers have caught on to the appeal of both electric and self-driving vehicles \u2013 as have the likes of Google and Apple. Everyone is grappling with the concept of people sharing private vehicles or using a taxilike fleet.Tesla may have an advantage in some areas. It is, after all, solely committed to electric and autonomous cars while traditional players still concentrate on gasoline engines. But Daimler, Ford, Toyota and others have deep pockets, whereas Tesla is still losing money and has to raise capital just to make sure it has the cash to develop its more affordable Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk\u2019s vision also includes electric passenger buses and heavy-duty trucks. Those are not just expensive propositions; they\u2019re also technologically tough at present as batteries powerful enough to propel them are not yet commercially viable.In the more immediate future, shareholders have another concern: Mr. Musk\u2019s desire to combine Tesla with SolarCity, his home solar panel company. The plan does nothing to allay fears about the motives for the tie-up or the governance issues it raises.Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to think far ahead is a positive and infectious antidote to short-term financial markets. But it is also a stark reminder that shareholders are not even riding shotgun.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Kuala Lumpur", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate17 Photos$3.13 MILLION (12.5 MILLION RINGGIT)This contemporary house with five bedrooms and four and a half baths is in Seputeh Heights, a gated residential enclave in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Built in 2010, the house was designed by the current owner, Greg Dall, the director of Pentago, a local architecture firm.The house, which is called Penta Cinque, covers 10,122 square feet and has an infinity lap pool and views of the city. There are three levels: the top floor, with four of the bedrooms; the ground floor, with the living areas; and the basement, with the main entry, the covered parking area and the driveway.The garage-level entry leads to a glass-enclosed elevator to the upper levels. The house has an open-style layout, with steel and glass walls. The floors are a mix of black marble, black terrazzo and hardwood. The wood throughout the house is Malaysian teak, merbau and chengal, and many of the beams and pillars have been recycled from older homes, Mr. Dall said.On the ground level, there are a large open-air dining area, a covered terrace and a guest bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. The dining area and living room overlook a fish pond and the walled garden, decorated with large urns. The furniture is included in the price, except for select antique pieces, the owner said.There are two kitchens in the house, which is typical of modern Malaysian homes, said Jeffri Rahim, the vice president of project marketing for Savills Malaysia, the agency listing the property. There is an indoor kitchen used for large tasks and a smaller, outdoor, lanai-style kitchen for everyday meals. The Bosch kitchen appliances are all new, and there is a serving counter for casual meals in the indoor kitchen.The master bedroom includes an en-suite bathroom and a walk-in dressing room, as well as a lounging area. One of the other top-floor bedrooms has an en-suite bathroom; the other two bedrooms share a bath. There is also a separate family room/sitting area on the top floor.Current renovation work is focused on redesigning the fish pond and adding a new lounging deck in the garden.The infinity pool is off the terrace next to the main living area. The enclosed and private garden has a manicured lawn, native trees and a large gazebo. The land parcel is a little over a quarter-acre. The property is freehold, which means a buyer will own the property (not lease it, which is common in many parts of the city).MARKET OVERVIEWSales in the Kuala Lumpur market are \u201csubdued,\u201d said Christopher Boyd, the executive chairman of Savills Malaysia. The number of residential sales dropped 16 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016, he said.Political uncertainty, limits imposed on bank financing in 2013 and the year-old scandal over Prime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s involvement in 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government investment fund, have dampened buying activity in Malaysia, agents say.\u201cThe political developments surrounding the 1MDB saga have had a profound impact on investors\u2019 sentiment,\u201d said Khalil Adis, a Singapore-based consultant.Prospective buyers are taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude, according to a recent report from Knight Frank, the real estate company. As of March, prices in Kuala Lumpur were down 1.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Knight Frank\u2019s Prime Global Cities Index. In contrast, overall prices in the 35 cities tracked by Knight Frank recorded a 3.6 percent increase in the same period.The recent \u201cchallenging\u201d market is a contrast to steady growth in recent years, said Sarkunan Subramaniam, the managing director of the Malaysia office of Knight Frank, the real estate company.\u201cMalaysia has a very investor-friendly climate,\u201d Mr. Subramaniam said. Initiatives such as the Malaysia My Second Home program, which offers a 10-year renewable visa for people who meet financial requirements, give the country \u201can edge over many other overseas investment destinations,\u201d he said.Most of the sales activity in Kuala Lumpur in recent years is centered on new apartments in the city center, agents said. In a competitive market, developers have started offering rebates, furniture vouchers and other incentives to woo buyers, Mr. Adis said.\u201cThe resale market is where most of the buying activity is occurring,\u201d he said, with prices often as much as 30 percent below those for new developments.WHO BUYS IN KUALA LUMPURInternational buyers account for less than 10 percent of sales in Malaysia, agents say. \u201cThe majority of buyers are owner-occupiers, but sales for investment are also prevalent, particularly in the upmarket condo sector,\u201d Mr. Boyd said.Singaporeans are the largest group of foreign buyers, although there has been an increase in activity in recent years from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Korea, local agents said.While the Malaysia My Second Home program has attracted international interest, its effect on sales has been relatively small, agents said. Since 2002, about 30,000 applications have been approved, Mr. Subramaniam said.BUYING BASICSForeigners can buy only property worth more than 1 million ringgit, or about $250,000, in most areas of Malaysia, although the threshold varies in different states. The government must approve any property purchase by a nonresident, but that is often little more than a formality, agents said.\u201cThe process itself is quite seamless and quick compared to many other countries,\u201d Mr. Subramaniam said.Property is offered as freehold or leasehold, usually with a 99-year lease. There are generally no restrictions on what kind of property foreigners can buy, but some states have their own restrictions. Buyers usually hire a lawyer to oversee the transaction.\u201cThere is local bank financing available for foreigners, and the market is far more open than in most other Southeast Asian countries,\u201d Mr. Boyd said.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYBahasa Malaysia; ringgit (1 ringgit = $0.25)TAXES AND FEESThere is a stamp duty on property purchases ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent, depending on the value. Legal fees can be as much as 1 percent of the purchase price.For foreigners, the real property gains tax, the Malaysian form of capital gains tax, is 30 percent of the profit from the sale, if the home is sold within five years. The tax falls to 5 percent if the property is owned for more than five years.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Cavendish Makes It Three Tour Stage Wins, and It\u2019s Early", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byMONTAUBAN, France \u2014 The minds of many people at the Tour de France were elsewhere Thursday. Their focus was on the European Championships semifinal soccer match between France and Germany in Marseille scheduled for Thursday evening.The indifference of many of the riders came from another source: The hot, 190.5-kilometer (118.3-mile) slog here from Arpajon-sur-C\u00e8re came one day before the race moves into the high mountains. With that in mind, much of the field was content to leave the day\u2019s work to the sprinters.Mark Cavendish happily seized the opportunity. He took his third stage of this year\u2019s Tour, or half of the six stages raced.Greg Van Avermaet, Wednesday\u2019s solo winner, remained the holder of the yellow jersey as the overall race leader.The stage win also meant that Cavendish, who is a former world champion on both the road and the track, has now sprinted his way to 29 stage victories at the Tour de France. Only Eddy Merckx, who dominated the race in the early 1970s and was known as the Cannibal because of his hunger for victory, has won more stages, 35.Cavendish made it clear that he was not finished.\u201cThere are still a few more stages to go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even a third the way through.\u201dCavendish, who is from the Isle of Man, worked as a banker in the tax haven to finance his cycling. While his career has had the usual high and low points since he became a professional 11 years ago, Cavendish became proficient in the often dangerous, always terrifying, art of sprinting.The team is now sponsored by Dimension Data. Cavendish\u2019s results at the Tour show that joining it was not an unwise career move.After Thursday\u2019s race, he predicted that African riders for the team, not just its European imports, would post victories.\u201cWithin 10 years, I think there could be a great rider from the continent of Africa,\u201d he said, declining to name the candidate he had in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not lack of talent.\u201dNear the finish in Montauban, the local government set up a display to support the unusual claim that it is the source of the common French expression \u201cfaire les 400 coups.\u201d While it translates to \u201cmake 400 blows,\u201d its current meaning is more along the lines of \u201csow your wild oats,\u201d and the city holds an annual festival which appears to be a celebration of high living.But its historical meaning, assuming the city is correct, had more in common with the riders\u2019 experience Thursday. As part of an effort to eliminate Montauban\u2019s Protestants in 1621, Louis XIII ordered his troops to fire 400 cannon shots at its citizens. Rather than terrorize them, however, legend has it that the Protestants not only survived but, like Cavendish, celebrated.Heat and a series of minor, yet steep, hills were not really what any of the riders wanted. As is generally the case in such situations, an ultimately doomed break was allowed to continue up the road. It contained Yukiya Arashiro, the only Japanese rider at the Tour, who rides for the Italian Lampre team; and Jan Barta, a Czech rider with the Bora-Argon 18 team from Germany. Their moment in the limelight ended with about 20 kilometers remaining after Britain\u2019s Team Sky, the employer of Chris Froome, the race favorite and last year\u2019s winner, forced a seemingly reluctant pack into racing.Froome will be closely watched Friday when the race moves into the Pyrenees. The final climb of the day will go up to the 4,885-foot summit of the Col d\u2019Aspin, one of the Tour\u2019s great legends since its introduction in 1910.In 1913, Eug\u00e8ne Christophe broke his forks on a descent while headed for the Aspin. The rules at that time did not allow any mechanical assistance. He eventually found a forge, repaired his forks and set off again. He was, however, given a time penalty of 10 minutes, later reduced, because a boy worked the bellows during this foray into blacksmithing.While many riders will suffer Friday on the climb of the Aspin, none of them needs to fear sharing Christophe\u2019s experience with race officials.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Ryan\u2019s Worst Ally", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWHATEVER drama plays out when Republicans meet in Cleveland next week to nominate their party\u2019s presidential candidate, the most consequential story line might well be the nationally televised debut of the awkward political partnership between Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party\u2019s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally \u2014 on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should \u201cjust be quiet\u201d and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House\u2019s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues (and even a few Democrats when necessary)?That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law? Many in both parties have come to doubt it after 17 years in which the 46-year-old congressman from Wisconsin has held increasingly influential positions in the House, with Republicans holding a majority for all but four of those years.This is, after all, someone whose self-described bold ideas have never gained liftoff; he has rarely taken the really bold step of writing them into legislation, with specifics. \u201cHe has actually proposed three \u2014 total, three \u2014 bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,\u201d said David T. Canon, chairman of the political science department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on \u201cevidence-based policy making.\u201d\u201cPaul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been,\u201d Professor Canon said. \u201cHe is an ideas guy. He\u2019s not Lyndon Johnson \u2014 \u2018let\u2019s crack heads and get stuff done and actually pass some laws.\u2019 \u201dAs he promised on becoming speaker in January, Mr. Ryan recently rolled out a series of aspirational ideas, packaged with help from his Republican colleagues \u2014 on poverty, health care, taxes, government regulation and national security \u2014 not to vote on but to take to voters. He calls the agenda \u201cA Better Way.\u201dWhile Mr. Ryan means a better way than Democrats, he has left little doubt he also means to define a better way than Mr. Trump. Yet he is not simply reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s heresies and negativism. For years, especially in even-numbered election years, Mr. Ryan has espoused similar conservative agendas of ideological red meat, served up with his Reaganesque civility and optimism, as both a platform for Republicans to run on and a mandate for action if they win.Republicans did recapture control of the House after President Obama\u2019s first two years with a Democratic-controlled Congress, and the Senate, too, in 2014. But few achievements followed. Mr. Ryan and his defenders say that reflects the reality of facing a Democratic president unwilling to sign his signature ideas into law without unacceptable compromises.Yet suppose that Mr. Trump is elected and Mr. Ryan gets the Republican presidential partner he has pined for. He can hardly claim a mandate for \u201cA Better Way\u201d when it is not the Trump way.Start with Medicare: Mr. Trump opposes spending less on that program and on Social Security; Mr. Ryan has long argued that only by sharply throttling back spending on entitlement benefits can the nation cut its debt. Mr. Ryan has called Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to bar Muslims unconstitutional, opposes deporting the 11 million people in the country illegally and has advocated for immigration changes offering legal status. Approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact with 11 other Pacific Rim nations, could be punted to the next president and Congress; Mr. Trump has called it \u201ca horrible deal\u201d while Mr. Ryan has been supportive. Mr. Ryan is an internationalist who favors solidifying alliances like NATO, checking Russia\u2019s expansionism and assuming a greater role in East Asia; none of that describes Mr. Trump.Whatever the election outcome, it \u201cis sure to put him in a bad place,\u201d said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. \u201cIf Trump wins, it will be because he will have found a way to campaign by marginalizing the core party and its leaders. Trump will conclude he doesn\u2019t need Ryan\u2019s ideas.\u201d\u201cIf Clinton wins,\u201d Mr. Kettl continued, \u201cit will be because Trump has made a shambles of the party and Ryan will have had to spend months diminishing himself by distancing himself from Trump. Either way, Ryan will face a massive rebuilding job. It\u2019s conceivable that his wonky agenda will provide an ideological keel on which to rebuild the party. But that\u2019s not likely.\u201dAnd as Mr. Ryan\u2019s troublesome first year as speaker has shown, his challenges in passing legislation stem as much from Republicans\u2019 divisions as from who is president. Congressional Republicans failed to agree on a budget resolution, which does not require a president\u2019s signature. Efforts to pass appropriations bills to finance government operations have collapsed; Republican leaders are considering simply extending current funding into 2017.Republicans divide not only over policy details but also over the very act of compromising. Mr. Ryan is speaker because his predecessor, John A. Boehner, was considered too inclined toward making deals and resigned under pressure from conservatives.\u201cI think it\u2019s neither in Ryan\u2019s temperament nor is it the sentiment of a lot of his colleagues to have a speaker who is like that,\u201d said Matthew N. Green, a political scientist at Catholic University and author of \u201cThe Speaker of the House: A Study of Leadership.\u201dMr. Ryan has known for years that legislative details would expose the intraparty fault lines behind his big ideas. Now Mr. Trump has shown that even some ideas themselves \u2014 like on trade and immigration \u2014 have become anathema to Republicans\u2019 angry base.\u201cHe has tried to burnish his political brand as the carrier of a conservative, ideological torch,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University. \u201cThat reputation would come crashing down very quickly if he actually had to write and negotiate a bill with trade-offs, compromises, \u2018pay-fors,\u2019 etc. That would open up fissures within his G.O.P. conference, let alone with Democrats who could filibuster in the Senate.\u201dThat is why Mr. Ryan has wanted to wait until Republicans again control both the White House and Congress, Ms. Binder said. A like-minded Republican president would minimize the need for compromises and help enforce support for those deals that were required.\u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cthe ascendancy of Trump iced over that plan.\u201dJackie Calmes is a national correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times who formerly covered Congress and the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "7 Teenage Deaths, but No Answers for Aboriginal Canadians", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byTHUNDER BAY, Ontario \u2014 They were teenagers from tiny indigenous Canadian communities, isolated by a maze of lakes and forest. Thunder Bay, a metropolis by comparison, offered them their only opportunity for a high school education.Instead, the students met death.Starting in 2000 and over the span of more than a decade, the bodies of Jethro Anderson, Curran Strang, Reggie Bushie, Kyle Morrisseau and Jordan Wabasse were found, one by one, floating in the rivers that meander past Thunder Bay\u2019s grain elevators, shopping malls and rail lines, emptying into Lake Superior. Bodies of two other indigenous students, Robyn Harper and Paul Panacheese, were found elsewhere in Thunder Bay, a predominantly white city of 121,000.Indigenous leaders and parents of the dead had long called for investigations, suspecting the students were victims of hate crimes. But among the broader population, the deaths largely went unnoticed until last year, when the Ontario coroner\u2019s office opened an inquest.Despite months of testimony, the inquest\u2019s jury, which released findings and recommendations in June, was unable to reach a conclusion as to what had led to the deaths of four of the students, and found the others to be accidental.But unlike many tragedies involving indigenous Canadians, these victims were linked by important common denominators: All were young people from remote towns. All were unaccustomed to city life. All were forced to stay in privately run boardinghouses \u2014 a lonely, unsupervised life for students as young as 14.The inquest became a window into broader questions over how Canada handles education for such a vulnerable population. Testimony underscored that despite Canada\u2019s national pride over inclusiveness, a racial line often separates indigenous Canadians from the rest of society.\u201cThere\u2019s racism here,\u201d said Sara Brady, an Ojibway teacher who runs a team of workers who assist indigenous students at a high school in Thunder Bay. \u201cYou have kids who have never experienced racism before, and that\u2019s a big thing for some of them. They don\u2019t understand what that is until they get here.\u201dAmong the statistics offered at the inquest, a calculation by Dr. David Eden, the presiding coroner, stood out. Two of the students, Kyle Morrisseau and Robyn Harper, came from Keewaywin, population around 300, about 350 miles northwest of Thunder Bay. For Thunder Bay to suffer a proportionally similar tragedy, he said, 700 high school students would need to die.Kyle Morrisseau\u2019s death offers a glimpse into his failed jump from one world into another, and its devastating effect on his family.He was a celebrity in Keewaywin, which consists of little more than an airstrip, nursing station, school, general store and post office. He was the third generation of his family to find success in selling art. He and his father, Christian Morriseau (some family members use a single \u201cS\u201d in the surname), painted aboriginal mythology images sold in galleries in Ottawa and elsewhere. His grandfather Norval Morrisseau was one of Canada\u2019s best-known aboriginal painters.Since Kyle\u2019s death, Christian Morriseau\u2019s marriage has dissolved and his house has burned down. He now lives part time in another house, condemned and filled with mold, in between annual trips to paint in Toronto.When his son started attending high school in Thunder Bay, Mr. Morriseau said in an interview, he had little concern. Two cousins worked at the high school, and an uncle coordinated programs for indigenous students in the city.\u201cWe had family there,\u201d he said.Mr. Morriseau planned trips to Toronto and Ottawa to meet with art collectors so that he could change planes in Thunder Bay and spend time with Kyle.One night in October 2009, while they shared a hotel room, Kyle told his father that he wanted to return to Keewaywin, only to abruptly reverse himself the next day, promising to \u201ctough it out,\u201d Mr. Morriseau said. Kyle was found dead less than a month later.Mr. Morriseau said he has agonized over Kyle\u2019s change of mind ever since. \u201cHe was just lonely, I guess,\u201d he said.He said the evidence at the inquest showed that there were bruises on Kyle\u2019s body, suggesting that his son may have been attacked. The jury also heard how at least one other indigenous student had been assaulted by young white men and thrown into the river. That student, fearing for his life, left Thunder Bay and returned home.The inquest jury listed the means of Kyle\u2019s death as \u201cundetermined.\u201dAsked what he thought had happened, Mr. Morriseau, 46, looked down, replying: \u201cWho knows, man. Only he does \u2014 him and the creator knows what happened.\u201d\u201cSomebody else does know something out there,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it will ever come up, or maybe it\u2019s too late to come up.\u201dToday, schooling for most Canadians is financed with a mix of provincial and local taxes, and the federal government is responsible for educating only indigenous children who live on reserves.The result is a stark disparity. The inquest found that Thunder Bay\u2019s Roman Catholic French-language school board has a budget of roughly 27,000 Canadian dollars, or about $20,000, per student. Dennis Franklin Cromarty High School, where six of the dead students were enrolled, gets 11,000 Canadian dollars per pupil. Not every high school student on a reserve in northwestern Ontario attends Cromarty, or D.F.C., as it is commonly known. Many attend the Pelican Falls First Nations High School, a boarding school nearer to the reserves.But Jonathan Kakegamic, the principal at D.F.C., said that he believes its location provides greater learning opportunities and makes it easier to attract and retain good teachers.The school partly compensates for the budget disparity with fund-raising that helps pay for extra teachers, student meals and after-school sports.But as he used a stationary bicycle late one afternoon in the school\u2019s weight room, Mr. Kakegamic said that what the school really needed was a dormitory.\u201cWhen you have 150 kids staying in private citizens\u2019 boarding homes throughout the city, that\u2019s a difficult thing to maintain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many injustices at every level.\u201dMr. Kakegamic\u2019s home community is Keewaywin. He taught elementary school there, and is a cousin of Kyle Morrisseau\u2019s family. As he recalled the school\u2019s searches for each of its students who were ultimately found dead, tears mixed with the sweat on his face.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle losing another kid,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Capital of Car Culture, Los Angeles Warms to Mass Transit", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byCitiesLOS ANGELES \u2014 When the extension of the Expo rail line opened here in May, it was almost as if the city had stepped into another century. Suddenly, it was possible to go from downtown to the Santa Monica beach by train, escaping a drive that could take two hours. The inaugural runs were packed with people, carrying beach chairs and recording the 15-mile, 45-minute long ride with cellphones.The $1.5 billion, aboveground Expo project is not the only piece of the transit transformation unfolding here. An 11.5-mile extension of the Gold Line, running from Pasadena to Asuza, just northeast of downtown, opened this spring. If not as glamorous as a train to the Pacific Ocean, it was certainly appreciated by people in the San Gabriel Valley, who otherwise have to navigate the traffic of Interstate 210.And all of that is likely to be dwarfed by an initiative that is expected to go before the voters in November, pending a final vote by the county Board of Supervisors, that would impose a countywide 1-cent transit sales tax, raising $860 million a year. The tax would finance 40 major transit projects over the next 40 years, including 100 miles of new rail lines and what has been a touchstone for mass transit advocates (and frustrated commuters) for decades: A train tunnel under the Sepulveda Pass, connecting the Los Angeles basin with the San Fernando Valley.There may be no part of America more identified, for better and for worse, with the automobile than this city. But this burst of activity, and the considerable interest it has stirred here, suggests that a fundamental reconsideration of Los Angeles may be at hand, a shift to an era when mass transit \u2014 subways, light rail, buses \u2014 could be as central to getting around, and perhaps even to this region\u2019s image, as the car.\u201cFor the car capital of America, if not the world, this is a bold new chapter,\u201d said Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor, who has been pushing the sales tax measure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t ignore cars. But it really builds out a mass transit network that gets you from Point A to Point B.\u201d\u201cNew York has opened one new station in the past five years,\u201d said Mr. Garcetti, a Democrat. \u201cWe opened a dozen. We have a lot of catching up to do. But we are finally saying we are going to do it.\u201dBrian D. Taylor, the director for the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, noted the attention received by what was in the end a modest expansion: 13 new stations along the Expo and Gold lines. \u201cIn incremental terms, these new lines aren\u2019t revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are more revolutionary in symbolic terms. They are a very public and specific commitment to spending on public transit.\u201dThe obstacles are considerable, starting with the sheer size of Los Angeles County \u2014 a collection of 88 cities scattered over 4,000 square miles.Still, this region has never tried anything quite this ambitious. And while drivers here have long revered their cars, for every Jan-and-Dean moment of rolling up the Pacific Coast Highway, sun glistening off the waves, there is the punishing attempt to cross town on Wilshire Boulevard at rush hour. There is reason to think that what once might have seemed implausible could happen.\u201cWe want to once and for all solve the transportation infrastructure challenges in Southern California,\u201d said Phillip A. Washington, the head the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge. Los Angeles is the car capital of the county. And it\u2019s getting worse with 2.3 million more people expected in the county in the next 40 years. The roads are not built to accommodate the influx of people.\u201dThere are signs of interest. Downtown is bustling with development, filled with people who make a life without cars, relying on walking, bicycles and mass transit. The city\u2019s last mayor, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, also championed mass transit, passing a half-cent transit sales tax increase and pushing for an ambitious housing development now rising along a subway that runs under Hollywood Boulevard.Dan Goldberg, 46, a film marketing executive who moved from New York a year ago, lives here without a car, commuting from his apartment in downtown to his office on Sunset Boulevard on the Red Line. He did not have a car when he lived in New York and said he does not miss having one here, even given the limitations of the mass transit system.\u201cI take the subway every day to work because it\u2019s extremely convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cThe subway to the beach is just an amazing new addition, which I\u2019ve been taking every weekend.\u201cI think one can credibly have a Los Angeles existence without a car,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible. The train system is very modern. It feels very well-run and efficient, certainly compared to New York. It\u2019s a credible existence in Los Angeles, if not the most convenient.\u201dUnder California law, a tax initiative needs the support of two-thirds of voters to win. Mr. Garcetti said he would make campaigning for it a top priority this fall; its prospects of passing are enhanced, city officials said, because it will be on the ballot during a high-turnout presidential campaign.Mr. Taylor said the importance of mass transit had long been underestimated here. Ridership here is the second-highest in the nation. And on a per-capita basis, people in Nashville and Houston drive more miles a day than people in Los Angeles. There are now 105 miles of rail, drawing 1.5 million riders a day.\u201cThe thing to understand about public transit in the U.S. is there is metropolitan New York and there is everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that influences what everyone thinks the base line is.\u201dThe latest additions to the system are far from perfect. There is hardly any parking at the new station stops for people who want to drive from their homes to the train; part of the reason for that is the idea that development will cluster along the lines, but part was to save money. Because the train runs at grade and has to stop at red lights, again to save money, it can take as long to get from downtown to the beach as making the trip by car.\u201cBut I was unprepared for just how slow \u2014 and painful \u2014 a commute via light rail could be,\u201d he said.Mr. Washington, who came here from a similar job in Denver, acknowledged the obstacles. But he said he expected that within 20 years, 25 percent of the population here would be using mass transit, compared with about 7 percent of the population now. \u201cThat\u2019s taking a hell of a lot of cars off the road,\u201d he said\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a cultural shift out here in the West,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a while for Denver, Los Angeles, to develop the culture. But that is coming.\u201dDenny Zane, the executive director of Move LA, a transit advocacy group, said he thought that the changes would permanently alter the city.\u201cIt\u2019s truly transformational,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean freeways and highways will become obsolete, not at all. But we will be seeing a gradual shift to transit over the next 25 years. That\u2019s not very long.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Under the Sun,\u2019 a Documentary Masked and Unmasked", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byThe new documentary \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d follows an 8-year-old North Korean girl named Zin-mi as she prepares to join the Korean Children\u2019s Union, run by the Workers\u2019 Party. Zin-mi and her parents \u2014 her mother works in a soy-milk plant, her father is an engineer at a garment factory \u2014 share abundant family meals, ride Pyongyang\u2019s spotless subways and pay their respects at a bronze statue of North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung.There\u2019s just one problem: The action is fake. The North Korean government cast the film, wrote the script and provided guides to feed the actors their lines while managing every detail of the project. In reality, Zin-mi\u2019s father is a journalist, and her mother a cafeteria worker. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you\u2019re acting in a movie,\u201d a guide scolds the girl at one point. \u201cAct naturally, like you do at home.\u201dSo, why did the director Vitaly Mansky, a documentary maker in the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 tradition of Frederick Wiseman and D. A. Pennebaker, agree to such an awkward, not to mention morally dubious, arrangement? \u201cMy dream of visiting North Korea,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the desire to understand something about the past of my country, my family.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Mansky met a North Korean delegation at a Vladivostok film festival and spent the next two years negotiating with the government for access. Under the final contract, in addition to providing the script, the actors and the guides, North Korea censors would vet daily footage and retain final approval over the finished film. Mr. Mansky would not be allowed to talk to the actors or film anything other than sanctioned scenes.Mr. Mansky, though, persevered in the face of such absurdity. \u201cI saw my illusions dissolve into thin air,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then I believed I could make the film I wanted to. I\u2019ve had lot of experience working in confined spaces, whether it is filming the army, in a prison or inside the Kremlin. One way or the other, I\u2019ve always managed to reveal the true essence of the situation.\u201dHe took as his model Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s \u201cTriumph of the Will,\u201d her film about the 1934 Nazi Party Congress, which is considered both a masterpiece of propaganda and an important documentary. \u201cI thought this would satisfy the North Korean regime on the one hand,\u201d he said, \u201cand give the world a view of the real North Korea on the other.\u201dExtreme limitations called for extreme measures, so Mr. Mansky employed the techniques of undercover journalism. Unknown to the North Koreans, he left his cameras running all day, documenting each scene being set up, rehearsed and reshot. We watch a North Korean guide put workers through several takes at the milk plant until they display the proper level of enthusiasm.\u201cComrades, today our workshop beat the government quota with 150 percent!\u201d a seamstress announces at the garment factory. By the next take, production has risen to \u201c200 percent over quota.\u201d When Zin-mi is asked how she feels about joining the Children\u2019s Union, she is clearly overwhelmed by her new responsibilities, and two fat tears roll down her face. \u201cStop her crying,\u201d a guide says off camera.How did Mr. Mansky get these scenes through the censors\u2019 daily edit? His cameras held two memory cards, and at the end of each day, one crew member would create a delay so that another had time to copy it. Mr. Mansky then handed the card to the censors, who overnight removed anything they found objectionable.Such close state scrutiny reminded Mr. Mansky a bit too much of life in the Soviet Union. He grew paranoid, he said, and every night blocked the doors of his hotel room with furniture to prevent someone from stealing the footage while he slept. Crew members suspected their rooms were bugged and discussed the project in code, he said. As a final precaution, Mr. Mansky hired a Russian expert in Korean and trained her to run the sound equipment. \u201cShe was our spy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped us know what they were planning for us.\u201dMr. Mansky\u2019s inventiveness was inspired by the methods used by Dziga Vertov, an early-20th-century Russian documentary maker, in \u201cMan With a Movie Camera\u201d (1929).The formal principles that guide Mr. Mansky can be found in a manifesto he published in 2005. North Korea might have done well to read its first line: \u201cScript and reality are incompatible.\u201d The contract between North Korea and Mr. Mansky broke down in 2014, as he prepared for his third trip to North Korea. The visas didn\u2019t arrive, and Mr. Mansky couldn\u2019t reach his North Korean partners. With no more access, Mansky was left to edit hundreds of hours of footage into a finished film.After \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d won the best director award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in Estonia, the North Koreans invited Mr. Mansky back to discuss an \u201curgent issue.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew what would happen if I returned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Effective Brain Fitness, Do More Than Play Simple Games", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byRetiringWHEN a \u201cbrain fitness\u201d course was introduced at her retirement community, Connie Cole was eager to sign up. After joining, she learned how to use an Apple iPad and work more complex tasks verbally and on paper.\u201cMy father had dementia, so I\u2019ll do anything I can,\u201d said Ms. Cole, 86, a former elementary schoolteacher who also plays Sudoku puzzles every morning. \u201cIf I can give my kids anything, it\u2019s to stay away from having it.\u201dTruth is, there is no known cure for dementia, or any evidence that exercising the brain in different ways can delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s. But such classes still offer useful skills to older people and are seen as helpful by many experts in improving the overall health and quality of life for participants.The class at her Gayton Terrace community in Richmond, Va., Ms. Cole said, has forced her to think deeper and read more. Best of all, she has learned that regular habits like exercising and laughing and socializing, including talking to strangers, are engaging and perhaps even helpful in extending her life. They certainly help make it more enjoyable.The theory of this more holistic approach, which goes beyond reliance on popular computer-based brain games, is that the brain thrives on continuous stimulation.\u201cYour brain doesn\u2019t know how old it is,\u201d said Paul Nussbaum, president of the Brain Health Center in Pittsburgh, which helped design the program used at Gayton Terrace and other communities that are part of the Brookdale Senior Living network. \u201cAnd what it wants to do is learn.\u201dBrain exercises should rely on novelty and complexity, he added, including board games that are played with others. All kinds of concentrated activities, like learning a foreign language or how to play a musical instrument, can be fulfilling for older people. But along with exercising and good nutrition, a brain that is fully engaged socially, mentally and spiritually is more resilient, Mr. Nussbaum argues.The worst thing for older adults, he said, is isolation.\u201cWe all have the ability to shape our brains for health,\u201d Mr. Nussbaum said, \u201cand the earlier the better.\u201dLegions of baby boomers already use games on computers or apps to stimulate the brain, but they should be thought of as part of a larger engagement with the world, Mr. Nussbaum said.Dakim BrainFitness, for example, is a computer program aimed at sharpening memory and language abilities, which some retirement communities offer. \u201cIt won\u2019t necessarily delay Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Alvaro Fernandez, chief executive of the market research firm SharpBrains.But he says he believes that Dakim and similar programs like Saido Learning, which was developed in Japan to address working memory in the prefrontal cortex through handwriting, math and reading out loud, offer other benefits and may help slow memory loss and other normal symptoms of aging. There is no magic pill, he cautioned, adding that aerobic exercise is especially important to good health for older people.\u00c1egis Living on Madison, an assisted living community in Seattle, offers brain games in its brain fitness center. Earl Collins, 90, has been playing brain games there a few times a week for the last two years.\u201cI keep using my brain,\u201d said Mr. Collins, a retired YMCA executive. \u201cAnd the game makes me remember, decide and observe.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Collins plays a trombone in bands and is socially active, including going to a church group in his neighborhood, attending lectures and keeping in touch with former colleagues.When playing brain games, you get better at playing games, said Laura Carstensen, founding director of the center. But there is no evidence that you will get smarter and fitter.Still, new learning is helpful, she added, especially interacting rather than passively listening. One good exercise is learning to be a photographer, she said, which translates into better performance on spatial tests.Another study, financed by the National Institutes of Health, suggests that cognitive training that uses thinking, such as problem solving and learning, like reading a newspaper article and discussing it with a friend, has staying power in the brain \u2014 even 10 years after the training ends. In a study published in 2014, the 2,832 participants who did this training had less difficulty performing everyday tasks, such as preparing meals or shopping. Memory training itself, the researchers concluded, does not have long-lasting results.\u201cThis is a very hopeful message,\u201d said George Rebok, a professor in the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who worked on the study. \u201cEven a modest investment in cognitive training pays dividends up to a decade later. And you can impact everyday functions.\u201dFinding new ways to challenge yourself every day, Mr. Rebok said, is a good idea. This can include lots of ordinary activities like doing mental calculations rather than reaching for a calculator or taking a new driving route or eating with the opposite hand.\u201cIt goes against what we\u2019ve gotten used to doing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you must continue doing these exercises seamlessly. They will increase brain neuro plasticity.\u201dWendy Suzuki, professor of neural science and psychology at New York University, offers similar advice. \u201cEvery time you learn something new, the brain changes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the most lasting physical changes are from psychical exercise.\u201dMarty Donovan, 83, signed up for a four-week brain fitness course at her South Port Square retirement community in Port Charlotte, Fla. There she did mental workouts like tossing up a handkerchief with one hand and catching it with another, doing puzzles and learning about nutrition.\u201cI learned that my brain didn\u2019t need to deteriorate,\u201d said Ms. Donovan, whose parents had dementia. \u201cBut I need to stimulate it on a daily basis to keep me out of trouble. The ball is in my court.\u201dMs. Donovan has been a lifelong exerciser. She leads a water aerobics class, does yoga and is learning to meditate. \u201cI tend to be a loner, though,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m working on that.\u201dCarol Watkins, 78, signed up for the brain waves program at Asbury Methodist Village in Maryland. Besides covering nutrition and exercise, the program encouraged her to choose a new project that she had never done. So she made a photo essay using the photo editing program Picasa. At the end of the class, she brought dragon fruit, which she had never purchased before, to the party.\u201cI try to do something different every day,\u201d said Ms. Watkins, a former federal government employee. \u201cWhen I walk, I go on different paths to get there or use different stairwells.\u201dMr. Fernandez of SharpBrains said he would like to see a more systematic way to measure cognition, such as annual mental health checkups. \u201cIf we had better assessments, we could empower consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the next frontier.\u201dMs. Cole is planning to learn sign language, which is novel and complex. \u201cWhen you have to move into a facility, you think your life is over,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I want to read more on my Nook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.A big part of what has made Amazon\u2019s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon\u2019s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers \u2014 the warehouses from which it processes customer orders \u2014 in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year.Amazon plans to nearly double its spending on digital video during the second half of the year as it expands the offerings of its Netflix-like streaming service, he said. That spending increase reflects a nearly tripling in the number of original television shows and movies financed by Amazon.\u201cI would not take our financial results as an indication we\u2019re running out of investment opportunities,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. The results were well above the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters of $1.11 a share in earnings and $29.55 billion in revenue.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to really prove out their profitability,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Amazon\u2019s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results.The company reported operating income of $718 million from its Amazon Web Services business, up from $305 million a year ago. That is slightly more than the profit it showed from its North American retail business.The North American retail business, though, brought in $17.67 billion in revenue compared with $2.89 billion for Amazon Web Services, an indication of the significantly higher profit margins in cloud computing.Amazon first began renting access to computers and software in its data centers over a decade ago. While it was dismissed by many for straying from its focus on electronic retailing, it is now the leader in cloud computing, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Google.Still, the retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company\u2019s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.The company\u2019s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\u201cThey are defying the laws of gravity,\u201d said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. \u201cIt shows their level of market share gains is increasing.\u201dAn article on Friday about Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings misstated the number of consecutive quarters in which Amazon has shown a record profit. It is three, not two.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan Sends a Text Across Turkey, Urging Loyalty", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byUrging his supporters to maintain their presence in public squares, where they have flocked each evening since the coup attempt failed, he wrote, \u201cDo not abandon the heroic resistance you have put up for your country, homeland and flag.\u201dEven as Turkish officials were more broadly trying to assure the public on Thursday that individual freedoms would not be threatened by the state of emergency, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s message to nationwide cellphone customers struck a more martial tone.In his nationwide text message, Mr. Erdogan cast the nightly gatherings of his supporters in places like Taksim Square, in central Istanbul, as necessary to protect the country from Mr. Gulen.He wrote: \u201cTo teach the traitor, the terrorist\u201d \u2014 a reference to Mr. Gulen\u2019s following, which the Turkish government calls the Fethullah Terrorist Organization \u2014 \u201ca lesson, continue your resistance and duty to guard democracy. The owners of our squares are not tanks, but the people.\u201dMr. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup plot, and insists that his movement within Turkey is peaceful.Now that Mr. Erdogan has declared a state of emergency, giving the state the power to bypass Parliament and pass laws that could possibly limit individual freedoms and suspend the rule of law for issues like pretrial detentions, many Turks are worried that the purge of suspected enemies will broaden. The concern is that Mr. Erdogan will target any and all opponents, not just those who are suspected of being followers of Mr. Gulen or of being linked to the coup.On Thursday, many saw a strong signal that that was already happening, as a prominent and widely regarded human rights lawyer, Orhan Kemal Cengiz, was detained in Istanbul, outraging human rights activists. The exact reason for his detention was unclear, but Mr. Cengiz has been a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government.\u201cOrhan Kemal Cengiz is a respected human rights lawyer,\u201d said Andrew Gardner, the Turkey researcher for Amnesty International. \u201cHe\u2019s a columnist, and a lot of his work is about human rights issues.\u201dSome speculated that it was Mr. Cengiz\u2019s work in the past for newspapers affiliated with Mr. Gulen, like Today\u2019s Zaman, seized this year by the government, that led to his detention. If that was the case, it suggested that the government was using a very wide definition of who may be affiliated with Mr. Gulen.\u201cHe had worked for Today\u2019s Zaman and other Gulen-affiliated newspapers,\u201d Mr. Gardner said. \u201cBut he is in no way pushing editorial lines in his columns that are supportive of Fethullah Gulen.\u201dMr. Cengiz, who was challenging in court the seizure by the government of Today\u2019s Zaman and its Turkish-language sister publication, Zaman, was detained at the airport on his way to London for a conference. Earlier in the week, Turkey effectively barred academics from traveling abroad.Still, Turkish officials on Thursday moved to assure the public that the state of emergency would not lead to the widespread curtailment of individual freedoms, and that the government would focus only on targeting suspected coup plotters.\u201cI want to guarantee that fundamental rights and freedoms and normal daily life will not be affected by this,\u201d Numan Kurtulmus, a deputy prime minister, told reporters in Ankara, the capital.Officials also sought to contain the economic fallout from Turkey\u2019s crisis, even though the value of the Turkish lira has already plunged against the dollar.\u201cLife of ordinary people and businesses will go unimpacted, uninterrupted, business will be as usual,\u201d Mehmet Simsek, a deputy prime minister and former finance minister, said in an interview with NTV, a private broadcaster.Also on Thursday, a court in Alexandroupolis in northern Greece sentenced eight Turkish military officers who fled to Greece on a helicopter after the failed coup to two months in prison, finding them guilty of illegal entry into the country.The Turkish officers\u2019 sentence was suspended for three years, but the eight were detained pending the outcome of their requests for political asylum in Greece. Turkey has called on Greece to swiftly extradite the officers, who have claimed that they were not involved in the coup but that they fled the country in fear of their lives.Earlier in the week, a banner seen flying over Taksim Square, seemingly a message from Erdogan supporters to Mr. Gulen and his followers, promised as much: \u201cWe will hang you and your dogs by your own leashes.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plan to Curb Tax-Inversion Deals Could Go Too Far", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThere\u2019s a harmful flip side to the push against tax-inversion deals in the United States. The Treasury Department\u2019s latest plan to curb tax-motivated overseas mergers takes aim at inter-company loans. It is a good idea to curb this so-called earnings stripping. The proposed rule is broad, however, and could hurt normal funding practices.The Obama administration developed the rule as a wave of corporate emigration by way of acquisition surged, including Pfizer\u2019s $150 billion attempt last year to buy Allergan. The Treasury\u2019s proposal, for which public comments are due on Thursday, specifically aims at the practice of American companies borrowing from their foreign parents in a lower tax region, leaving interest payments to be deducted when calculating their annual tab to Uncle Sam.The practice is called earnings stripping because it essentially ships the profit overseas. Often, an American company does not even actually borrow the money. It just makes interest payments to its corporate overlord. Sometimes subsidiaries are created exclusively for this purpose. The Treasury Department is long overdue in focusing on such schemes.The trouble is that, as written, the new rule also might capture legitimate cash-management activities. Companies often take a surplus from one division to finance activities at another carrying a deficit. This might be prohibited under the proposal, forcing companies to borrow more from banks.In other cases, companies could in a way wind up facing a double tax bill. Consider the example of a German company that has its British financing arm lend money to an American operation to, say, build a new plant. The interest expense would no longer be deductible in the United States while the interest income would be taxed in Britain.The Treasury Department has asked whether exceptions should be made for such activities, but it is also eager to proceed with measures to block inversions. The Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Treasury Department, has said it hopes to complete a plan by September. The plan was just put forward in April, there will be thousands of pages of suggestions to review and a hearing on the matter next week. It is rare for such a complex tax proposal to be finished in a year, much less six months.The government is to be applauded for trying to advance swiftly a sharp piece of useful policy. It just would be wise to pause, however briefly, to avoid any detrimental unintended consequences.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping Bedbugs at Bay", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byAsk Real EstateFour years ago, my daughter bought a townhouse. Soon after she moved in, she had an infestation of bedbugs, which she treated. When my daughter asked the next-door neighbors if they had bedbugs, they said no. But my daughter\u2019s exterminator saw evidence of an infestation on items left at the curb in front of their house. Just a few weeks ago, my daughter again saw furniture on the curb in front of the neighbor\u2019s house. If the problem has returned, there is no guarantee that the neighbor will treat it. Does my daughter have any recourse? How can she keep the infestation from spreading to her house?Prospect Park, BrooklynAnyone who has battled bedbugs knows that the experience can be grueling, expensive and traumatic. Finding someone to blame for the misfortune might give your daughter some measure of comfort, but it will not protect her from another infestation.Bedbugs are hardy travelers that hitch rides on clothes, luggage and blankets. They sometimes take refuge in moving vans, hiding in the blankets that movers use to wrap furniture. I say this because her neighbors could easily blame your daughter for the first infestation. It is also possible that the previous owners of her townhouse had bedbugs. (She might want to reach out to them and ask.)\u201cThe daughter won\u2019t be able to prove that her neighbor is the cause of her bedbug infestation,\u201d said Jonathan H. Newman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.Your daughter can try to reduce any risk, Mr. McGowan said, by sealing all cracks and crevices along her baseboards and electrical outlet covers. A pest-control expert could chemically treat the walls. She could put her mattresses and box springs in bedbug-resistant encasements, and use bedbug glue monitors on the floors to help her spot bugs.She could also get in touch with her neighbors and express her anxiety that should a bedbug problem recur, it could easily spread from one rowhouse to the next. A collective response could help reduce that risk.\u201cYour daughter won\u2019t be able to get rid of them on her own,\u201d Mr. Newman said. \u201cShe and her neighbors, with the assistance of licensed pest-control professionals, will have to work together in a coordinated effort.\u201d\u2022A private entity bought several smaller buildings in front of our co-op building with plans to knock them down and build a large tower. While some shareholders oppose a new tower, others support it. The board, however, is leading \u2014 and financing \u2014 a fight to change neighborhood zoning rules to prevent the tower (or any new tower) from being built. It has funded this effort with hundreds of thousands of dollars from our building\u2019s reserve fund. Can reserves be used to support neighborhood issues? Or must a co-op\u2019s funds be used only to improve the building and its property? If the board is using those funds improperly, what can other shareholders do to get the money back? Midtown East, ManhattanGenerally, a reserve fund is supposed to pay for capital improvements, like a new boiler. But boards sometimes tap this pot of money to cover emergency expenses. So if your board sees the new tower as a threat to the building, it might argue that financing a neighborhood fight is a good use of that money.But if the money was earmarked for a specific project, like a new roof, and the board instead funneled it to a pet project, then the board has overstepped its bounds. \u201cIf you have a reserve fund that is set aside to put a new roof on the building and all of a sudden the board is dipping into it to pay a lobbyist, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Andrew I. Bart, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.Because not all shareholders see this as a battle worth waging, review your governing documents to see if you have any power to stop the board. Are there restrictions about how the board can spend the co-op\u2019s finances? The rules may say that shareholders are required to vote on this sort of discretionary spending. Or the board might need approval from a special committee, or a vote by a majority of the board members. Review the books and records, including board minutes, if you can, to figure out where and how the money was spent and to make sure the board followed the rules.You may be able to organize other shareholders and call a special meeting to confront the board. If the board did violate co-op rules or acted in bad faith, shareholders could take the board to court to force it to stop spending the money. And if any board members violated their fiduciary duty, they could be held personally liable, Mr. Bart said.\u2022I rented a first-floor apartment in 2015. The previous tenant left two Adirondack chairs, a plastic outdoor table and a large pot filled with soil in the backyard. Now I am about to move out. Am I responsible for getting rid of these items?Upper East Side, ManhattanWhen you move out of an apartment, you are usually supposed to return the apartment to the landlord in the same condition it was in when you rented it, except for reasonable wear and tear. So unless your lease says otherwise, you are not responsible for disposing of furniture that was there when you moved in, said David E. Frazer, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taliban\u2019s New Leader, More Scholar Than Fighter, Is Slow to Impose Himself", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The early tenure of the Taliban\u2019s new leader, a low-key religious scholar seen as a potential unifier, has been notable for lacking the drama his predecessor seemed unable to shake.Despite that, some commanders have refused to pledge allegiance to Mawlawi \u2014 a title reserved for Islamic scholars \u2014 Haibatullah, according to interviews with Taliban commanders and officials.From the first days of the hasty leadership meetings that elevated Mawlawi Haibatullah, it was clear that the Taliban\u2019s decision-making power was returning to the insurgency\u2019s senior council based in Quetta, Pakistan \u2014 a politburo of about two dozen clerics and commanders split between the older generation that founded the Taliban and newer members who were empowered more recently.Mawlawi Haibatullah\u2019s perceived strengths, and the very traits that made him attractive as a potential unifier, lie in a slower kind of influence: his shunning of the limelight and his deep ties to the radical religious schools that for years have provided the Taliban with an ideological core of committed fighters.How Mawlawi Haibatullah fares will depend on the space he can carve with the dozen influential members of the senior council, or shura, who \u201ccall the shots,\u201d Mr. Osman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will be left to his own ideals \u2014 maybe to express, but not to enforce.\u201dIn some ways, Mawlawi Haibatullah\u2019s selection is a return to the roots of the Taliban insurgency. In those years, little was known about the Taliban\u2019s top echelon. Rarely photographed or filmed, they amounted to myths, their vague identities exploited by local warlords and politicians to report rivals as insurgents.\u201cMawlawi Haibatullah is calm and understanding, a symbol of politeness who has always led a humble lifestyle,\u201d said Hajji Saifidad Aka, an elder from the new leader\u2019s birth village of Rigi, in Kandahar Province.Both for his modest upbringing and for his quiet ways, Mawlawi Haibatullah, now in his 50s, is sometimes compared to the movement\u2019s founding leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, who abhorred publicity, in part out of a belief that he derived his legitimacy from a connection to God and not from a popular mandate.\u201cMansour was the money man; that was his key strength. What other insurgency makes their accountant the top guy?\u201d said Franz-Michael Mellbin, the European Union\u2019s ambassador and special representative to Afghanistan. \u201cIt will be important to see what happens to the money flow.\u201dSome of the individual financing streams may have been disrupted after Mullah Mansour\u2019s death, but Afghan and American officials say they believe that the larger flow will remain unaffected because there is a robust bureaucracy overseeing it.In addition to his uncharacteristic enjoyment of a rich lifestyle, Mullah Mansour showed contradictory impulses.Mawlawi Haibatullah, on the other hand, has been seen as a more constant personality: a disciplinarian, scholar and judge who has lived a modest life of religious studies and court appointments, according to details of his life pieced together from interviews with friends and fellow Taliban.Mawlawi Haibatullah\u2019s father was a village imam in the Panjwai district of Kandahar. Not owning any land or orchards of their own, the family depended on what the congregation paid the imam in cash or crops. Young Haibatullah began his studies under the gaze of his father, and when the family migrated to Quetta after the Soviet invasion, he continued at one of the first seminaries established in the Sarnan neighborhood, according to villagers and Taliban figures who know him.After the Taliban swept to national power in 1996, one of his first jobs was in Farah Province, as part of the feared \u201cvice and virtue\u201d police who doled out punishments to those who had short beards or long hair, for example. But Mawlawi Haibatullah was soon moved to Kandahar and was made an instructor at the Jihadi Madrasa, the seminary of about 10,000 students that Mullah Omar personally looked after.As a shaper of the Taliban ideology in Quetta, Mawlawi Haibatullah had a high enough profile to be targeted for assassination. Mullah Ibrahim, a student of Mawlawi Haibatullah, recalled an attempt on his life about four years ago, for which the Taliban later blamed the Afghan intelligence agency.\u201cDuring one of his lectures in Quetta one day about four years ago, a man stood among the students and pointed a pistol at Mawlawi Haibatullah from a close range, but the pistol stuck,\u201d Mullah Ibrahim recalled. \u201cHe was trying to shoot him, but he failed, and the Taliban rushed to tackle\u201d the man, he said, adding that Mawlawi Haibatullah did not move in the chaos.In the years since the insurgency moved its leadership to Quetta, Mawlawi Haibatullah rose to become a trusted adviser to Mullah Omar. Yet he remained largely in the background. He contributed to the Taliban\u2019s internal guidelines on education and discipline.\u201cThree years ago, I remember him speaking to about a dozen Taliban shadow governors, and he asked them, \u2018Do you know why people support the government militias?\u2019 \u201d recalled Hajji Saifidad Aka. \u201cHe pointed fingers at the governors and said, \u2018It\u2019s because you people cut off their heads for receiving minor help from an aid agency.\u2019 \u201dAfter his promotion to the deputy leader of the Taliban last summer, Mawlawi Haibatullah put in place a system under which a commission would be formed under the shadow governor in every province that could investigate abusive commanders or fighters, according to Mullah Abdul Bari, a Taliban commander in Helmand Province.Yet for all that, the Taliban\u2019s brutality has seemed to continue unchecked in the field this year, perhaps a cautionary example for those who expected the insurgency to change its ways under Mawlawi Haibatullah.And as the insurgents\u2019 offensive against the Afghan government continues its intense pace this summer, Afghan civilians are still being killed at record rates. The United Nations has said that antigovernment forces, particularly the Taliban, are responsible for the majority of those deaths.Mujib Mashal reported from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton, Hoping to Unify Democrats", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byPORTSMOUTH, N.H. \u2014 After 14 months of policy clashes and moments of disdain, Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, clearing away the last major obstacle to a united front for the party heading into its convention this month and the fall election.Yet for all the smiles and hugs between the former rivals here at their first joint rally, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s next challenge was on vivid display as some Sanders supporters jeered her name and held signs saying \u201cWon\u2019t Vote Hillary\u201d while Clinton partisans hissed \u201cshhhh\u201d and others chanted \u201cunity.\u201dIn the coming weeks, from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s choice of a running mate to her convention speech, campaign commercials and overtures to Republicans, the 13 million voters who backed Mr. Sanders in the primary contests will be watching her for any hint of wavering from their progressive causes.Mrs. Clinton needs to convert many of these liberals and independents in states like New Hampshire and Wisconsin, which Mr. Sanders won and she wants to carry in November. And Mr. Sanders, in his remarks at the rally, signaled what may be her best hope of attracting them: drawing sharp contrasts between her and Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, so his admirers feel they have no choice but to support Mrs. Clinton.Dropping his portrayal of Mrs. Clinton as a captive of Wall Street billionaires and big-money interests, for instance, Mr. Sanders redirected those sorts of accusations to Mr. Trump, saying his proposed tax cuts would be a windfall to wealthy Americans.\u201cHis reckless economic policies will not only exacerbate income and wealth inequality, they would increase our national debt by trillions of dollars,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Standing beside him at Portsmouth High School, Mrs. Clinton beamed and applauded at first as Mr. Sanders spoke, but the two exuded little warmth and looked stiff \u2014 especially Mr. Sanders \u2014 as they waved to the audience and cameras. When he finished speaking, he reached out his hand to her, but Mrs. Clinton went in for a hug and a microphone caught her saying, \u201cYou were great, so great,\u201d and \u201cthank you so much.\u201dThen, in her appeal to his supporters, Mrs. Clinton sought to pick up his political mantle and pledged to overhaul Wall Street and the campaign finance system, two issues that Mr. Sanders largely left for her to address.\u201cIt is past time to end the stranglehold of wealthy special interests in Washington,\u201d she said as Mr. Sanders smiled and clapped.Mrs. Clinton did not promise to forgo major donations herself, however: After the endorsement event she flew to New York for a private matinee performance of the hit Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d for donors who gave $2,700 to $100,000 to her campaign or the Democratic National Committee. She tried to strike the right notes, though, such as pledging to uphold \u201cour progressive values.\u201d\u201cYou will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House,\u201d she said to Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers.\u201cI\u2019m a Bernie guy,\u201d explained Noah Levin, a college student in Hampstead who wore an \u201cH\u201d for Hillary sticker on his T-shirt but said he wasn\u2019t sure he would support Mrs. Clinton in the fall. \u201cI won\u2019t vote for Trump, but November is a long way away,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has been focused on winning over independents and Republican-leaning women who are turned off by Mr. Trump, exuding confidence that the young voters and liberals who backed Mr. Sanders will get in line and support her when faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency instead.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.But behind the scenes, her senior campaign aides have been in frequent contact with Sanders advisers while also trying to build bridges to a wing of the party skeptical of Mrs. Clinton and the brand of moderate politics her husband advanced.Taking the stage together in the high school gymnasium, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders stood before a giant American flag and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s motto, \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The clashes in the audience quickly subsided, and Mr. Sanders drew some of his strongest cheers as he described his unexpectedly competitive challenge against Mrs. Clinton and his primary and caucus victories in 22 states. In an odd passage for a concession speech, Mr. Sanders said that Mrs. Clinton had \u201c389 more pledged delegates than we have, and a lot more superdelegates\u201d \u2014 a reference to party leaders that drew boos from the audience and a steely look from Mrs. Clinton.One person close to Mr. Sanders said that the senator and his wife, Jane, were \u201cputting on a good face\u201d on Tuesday, but that they were disappointed that his campaign had not been more successful after he gave it so much of his energy and rallied millions of people around his ideas.The person, a longtime top political adviser to Mr. Sanders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the private views of the couple, also said that the senator had resolved to keep his word to endorse the Democratic nominee and that he had been told by some high-ranking Democrats that he could become chairman of the committee that would work on trying to carry out a proposed $15 federal minimum wage.Still, Mr. Sanders uttered the words that Mrs. Clinton needed him to say \u2014 \u201cI am endorsing Hillary Clinton\u201d \u2014 and aligned himself with her on creating more jobs, raising the minimum wage, expanding access to government-run health care, combating climate change and offering relief to college students in deep debt.\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate,\u201d he said.As Mr. Sanders delivered his endorsement, the Trump campaign, hoping to appeal to disaffected Sanders supporters, sent out a statement saying, \u201cBernie is now officially a part of a rigged system\u201d for \u201cendorsing one of the most pro-war, pro-Wall Street, and pro-offshoring candidates in the history of the Democratic Party.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton would not be deterred from her unity message, urging Democrats to come together against Mr. Trump.\u201cWith your help, we\u2019re joining forces to defeat Donald Trump, win in November and build a future we can all believe in,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI am proud to be fighting alongside you because, my friends, this is a time for all of us to stand together.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Portsmouth, Patrick Healy from New York, and Yamiche Alcindor from Cleveland.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Party Conventions Seem More Like Infomercials, Blame Nixon", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byHistorySourceWith only this scene to go on, someone might have concluded that President Richard Nixon was the idol of young voters and African-Americans, which was just the intention of his handlers.It was the night of Tuesday, Aug. 22, 1972. Strolling about the stage at the outdoor Miami Marine Stadium, Sammy Davis Jr., was warbling his own slightly hipper version of the president\u2019s newly unveiled campaign anthem (\u201cNow more than ever, baby, Nixon now!\u201d).After a long dry spell, Davis had just returned almost to the top of the charts with his anodyne song \u201cThe Candy Man\u201d (which he detested) and, despite his history as a Kennedy Democrat, this Rat Pack alumnus had come out for Nixon. Behind Davis were young people with Afros and wearing bell-bottoms, there to remind TV viewers that it was Nixon who had prodded Congress to stop the military draft and lower the voting age to 18.Republican delegates in Miami Beach had just nominated Nixon for a second term. Striding into view, Nixon pulled out a camera, awkwardly pretending to photograph Davis as he sang. \u201cI don\u2019t think the youth vote is in anybody\u2019s pocket,\u201d Nixon told the crowd. Then, noting Davis\u2019s Democratic lineage, the president insisted that no one could \u201cbuy\u201d Davis\u2019s support with a White House invitation, adding, \u201cYou are going to buy him by doing something for America!\u201d Davis startled the president by hugging him.This month, operatives for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have said they will try to mold each of their conventions into something of an infomercial for each of their candidates. For most of American history, this would have been impossible, because usually nominees were not anointed until the delegates met, often after many ballots. But in modern times, with nominations so often locked up in advance, campaigns would be foolish not to try to turn those days of exposure into a major marketing opportunity.The first to do this with serious forethought was Nixon\u2019s now infamous Committee to Re-elect the President, in 1972. During the convention\u2019s planning, the committee was led by Nixon\u2019s former attorney general, John Mitchell, and featured marketing recruits like the 37-year-old Jeb Stuart Magruder, once of Jewel Food Stores.Also on the team was H. R. Haldeman, the White House chief of staff. Haldeman had formerly worked at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in Los Angeles, where he was known for his deft touch with customers deemed \u201chorror clients,\u201d like Walt Disney. After the Miami youth rally, Haldeman wrote in his diary that Nixon had \u201chandled it perfectly\u201d and \u201cI think we scored maybe the major coup of the week.\u201dIn public, Nixon professed to care only about substance, but in private, he often micromanaged his future appearances. Before the Wednesday evening acceptance speech, Haldeman told his journal that Nixon \u201cwants to do his makeup in the trailer\u201d and didn\u2019t want his family mingling onstage with that of Vice President Spiro Agnew, whom he disdained. In a June conversation that he taped, Nixon had warned his chief of staff that his wife, Pat, and their daughters should not take a helicopter to the convention hall because \u201cit destroys their hair.\u201dThe 1972 Republican convention was the first to make major use of the first lady, whom the president that week lauded as \u201cthe best campaigner in the Nixon family.\u201d Introduced by the actor Jimmy Stewart and California\u2019s governor, Ronald Reagan (wearing a white suit), Mrs. Nixon took the rostrum (which had been created by the set designer for the television show \u201cThe Dating Game\u201d) and charmingly used her slender arms to swing an enormous wooden gavel. She pronounced her long audience ovation (complete with mass-produced signs saying, \u201cWe love Pat\u201d) \u201cthe most wonderful welcome I\u2019ve ever had\u201d and reproached \u201cthose who say that we don\u2019t have young people\u201d supporting her husband.Nixon\u2019s campaign was the first to give prominence to biographical films, which have since become a mainstay of conventions. \u201cNixon the Man,\u201d produced by the documentarian David Wolper, was narrated by the basso-voiced Richard Basehart, star of the TV science fiction show \u201cVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea.\u201d In the film, Basehart professed to reveal \u201cthe private man, at work and in his relaxed moments \u2026 a man of compassion, courage and conscience,\u201d who urged the nation to \u201cwalk without fear.\u201d With his mid-Atlantic accent, Basehart closed portentously, \u201cAnd America will hear him!\u201d Other films that week showcased Mrs. Nixon and Mamie and Dwight Eisenhower.Nixon\u2019s well-scrubbed, carefully staged convention was a contrast to that of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, held the previous month in the same Miami Beach hall \u2014 as different as Up With People was from Led Zeppelin. From the Republican stage, Governor Reagan joked that there had been \u201csmoke-filled rooms\u201d at McGovern\u2019s convention, but that \u201cthe smoke smelled a little funny.\u201dReality was not entirely excluded from this scene. As shown in the 1989 film based on Ron Kovic\u2019s memoir \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d starring Tom Cruise, the Vietnam veteran made his way into the hall with comrades to remind delegates, in protest, that the Southeast Asian conflict was still raging.Over all, though, James Reston of The New York Times marveled that week \u2014 with a sense of surprise that would be unimaginable nowadays \u2014 that Republicans had \u201ccontrolled this gathering here like a TV show\u201d and called Nixon\u2019s convention \u201ca model of how to use modern political and advertising techniques to win an election.\u201dBut behind the facade were some of the makings of the Watergate scandal, including the Nixon campaign\u2019s secret Operation Gemstone, which envisioned kidnapping, wiretapping, and using prostitutes and additional plots to discredit the Democratic opposition and keep \u201cradicals\u201d and other Nixon critics from disrupting the proceedings. The convention\u2019s financing also caught the eye of federal prosecutors, who later found evidence of secret slush funds, money laundering and quid pro quos.By the time Nixon left Miami Beach, although he was headed for a landslide, his best days as president were already behind him. During that conversation of June 1972 in which he worried about the impact of helicopters on his wife\u2019s hair, he also ordered Haldeman to obstruct an investigation of that week\u2019s break-in at the Democrats\u2019 Watergate headquarters. Ultimately his recording of this exchange became known as the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape.Almost two years after that night with Sammy Davis, that recording helped force Richard Nixon to resign his presidency and send Haldeman and Mitchell to prison.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to the time frame between the 1972 Republican National Convention and the resignation of President Richard Nixon. It was just under two years, not two years and two weeks.MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, a presidential historian, is the author of nine books.Advertisement"}

In the 1990s, when I started writing about technology, the company was a central pillar of the internet. Yahoo was referred to as a \u201cweb portal,\u201d and millions of people began their explorations of the online world through its home page. Internet connections were generally slow and unreliable, and there were no iPhones or Androids. It might sound terribly antiquated now, but it felt new and exciting then.Yahoo categorized and brought order to the fast-growing forest that was the web. Its curators carefully hacked through the weeds and jumped across the ravines to bring us to the digital equivalent of exotic plants and wildlife. Search technology was in its infancy, and people needed someone to help them find what this new, or new to them, world had to offer.Google, Facebook, Twitter and other sites gradually displaced Yahoo because they offered better ways to find information and interact with others. I still have a Yahoo email account, but I rarely check it.

{"Headline": "Leader\u2019s Poems Grip Brazilians, but Not in a \u2018Fiery Flames\u2019 Way", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byMemo From BrazilBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 Before becoming Brazil\u2019s interim president, Michel Temer had a bit more free time on his hands. As a lawmaker shuttling between Bras\u00edlia and S\u00e3o Paulo a few years ago, he found himself jotting his musings on cocktail napkins in airport lounges.He brooded about the demise of letter-writing in the text-messaging era. He described a rookie lawyer\u2019s pride in winning a case. Then there was his septuagenarian\u2019s lustful ardor \u2014 after all, he had courted a new bride 42 years his junior.In \u201cRed,\u201d he wrote:With Mr. Temer now in the spotlight, his poetry is drawing renewed attention as Brazilians try to decipher the man at the helm after a bare-knuckle power struggle that ousted President Dilma Rousseff in May. Parodies of his oeuvre are flourishing, a sign that Brazilian satire is keeping pace with the country\u2019s political upheaval.\u201cThis small diversion makes things kind of bearable,\u201d said Mr. Ramos, who also publishes an independent poetry magazine.Catering to more than 32,000 followers, Mr. Ramos updates the feed, called Poet Temer, with his own poems as often as three times a day. He riffs on everything from Mr. Temer\u2019s stilted, formal writing style to the graft scandals plaguing the interim president\u2019s two-month-old administration.Some scholars want to know why Mr. Temer decided to make a late-in-life foray into poetry.There is a precedent of Brazilian political leaders who aspired to polish their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with some literary production. For instance, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a literary society in Rio de Janeiro inspired by the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, counts numerous Brazilian political figures among its long list of so-called immortal inductees.Supporters of Mr. Temer, who has also written books on constitutional law, nevertheless sing the praises of his poetry.At the launch of his poetry collection, Mr. Temer revealed that he was inspired largely by Brazilian Romantic writers of the 19th century. He cited \u00c1lvares de Azevedo, a poet whose popularity has recently grown among Brazil\u2019s goth subculture.In \u201cAnonymous Intimacy,\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s choice to occasionally err on the side of concision led Sensacionalista, a website that satirizes Brazil\u2019s political class, to question whether the author of some of the verses might actually be his 7-year-old son, Michelzinho.No. Never again!In a statement, Mr. Temer\u2019s office said he was open to such reviews. \u201cIn a democratic country, such criticism is received naturally,\u201d it said.But on previous occasions, Mr. Temer showed himself to be sensitive to such scrutiny.After the anthropologist and political commentator Roberto DaMatta questioned Mr. Temer\u2019s forays into verse in a newspaper column, Mr. Temer responded by sending Mr. DaMatta a copy of his book and a letter taking issue with the criticism.\u201cI doubt that you\u2019re one of those people who discourage the tenderfoots from daring to experience sentimental writing,\u201d Mr. Temer wrote.The exchange moved Mr. DaMatta to consider whether Brazil needed more politicians like Mr. Temer writing verse, with the hope that such writing might enlighten a political establishment soaked in scandal.\u201cI beg now that his poetry can illuminate, with the agony and uncertainty of every poem, this Brazil of ours, where the political stage produces such vulgar dramas without any embarrassment,\u201d Mr. DaMatta wrote in a subsequent column.Of course, Mr. Temer faces an array of other challenges that have little to do with how his poetry is pilloried. His government has already faced one scandal after another, prompting the resignations of top aides including his planning minister, his anticorruption minister and his tourism minister.Mr. Temer\u2019s own credibility also remains in question.More political instability may also be on the horizon. Ms. Rousseff, the suspended president, is preparing for her impeachment trial in the Senate over claims of budgetary manipulation. If Ms. Rousseff succeeds in changing the votes of fewer than 10 senators, she could reclaim the presidency.All the drama is pushing Mr. Temer \u2014 and his poetry \u2014 further out of the shadows.\u201cIt\u2019s all just too ridiculous: the poetry, the way he became president, the much younger wife,\u201d said Gabriel Gianordoli, 34, an information design consultant.\u201cIf Temer can proclaim he\u2019s a poet,\u201d Mr. Gianordoli said, \u201cthen he can deal with the reactions his work has spawned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To Kansas Conservatives, They\u2019re \u2018Government Schools\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byLEAWOOD, Kansas \u2014 Erica Massman, a moderate Kansas Republican, refers to the building where her daughter attends fourth grade as a public school.Ms. Massman\u2019s mother, whose politics tilt further to the right, calls it something else: a government school.\u201cMy mother, who is a Tea Party person, started saying \u2018government schools\u2019 all the time,\u201d said Ms. Massman, recalling when she first heard the phrase around 2010. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201dSomewhere along the way, the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d entered the lexicon in place of references to the public school system.The intent was obvious to her, Ms. Massman said. \u201cThey are trying to rebrand public education,\u201d she said.The use of the term has set off alarms even among some Republicans, who fear that it signals still less support, financially and otherwise, for the public schools in a state that had long felt pride over the quality of its education system. The recent adoption of a school finance plan that was acceptable to Mr. Brownback, the Legislature and the Kansas Supreme Court has not entirely assuaged those concerns.\u201cSome have begun to call public schools \u2018government schools,\u2019 a calculated pejorative scorning both education and anything related to government,\u201d he wrote.\u201cIt is surprising to me that liberals and progressives object to the term \u2018government schools,\u2019\u201d he said on the show. \u201cThey like government, don\u2019t they? These people want more taxation and government spending, don\u2019t they? Well, when we think about our public schools, we find they have all the characteristics of government programs.\u201dIt would not be the first time that conservatives have used semantics to sway public opinion, experts said.Besides coining phrases, Dr. Lakoff said, the right has co-opted certain words \u2014 a practice that was demonstrated, he said, in President George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, which used \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cliberty\u201d 49 times in 20 minutes. \u201cThe right has taken over the words \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018liberty,\u2019\u201d Dr. Lakoff said.\u201cPeople tend to trace the demonization of government to Reagan,\u201d Dr. Tannen said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of iconic, how he was using it. He set the government up as the enemy.\u201dConservatives in Kansas have extended the semantical positioning of \u201cgovernment\u201d to education, conveying the message that public schools are a form of government imposition, Dr. Lakoff said.The phrase \u201cgovernment schools,\u201d a common reference overseas to national school systems, has been around for decades as a way to differentiate them from privately financed schools. It has also been a label for schools on Native American reservations, and long used to influence debate.Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York used the phrase in 1978 to make the case for federal aid to private schools. \u201cWe have succeeded in providing equality only to those who enroll in government schools,\u201d he said in a speech in New York. \u201cWe have failed the parents who prefer to send their children to the schools that are descended from the older, private school systems.\u201dBut only recently \u2014 and mostly in reliably conservative Kansas \u2014 has the term been used regularly and clearly as a political wedge. Education advocates in Kansas said they had heard it in conversations with state legislators (though few use it in public statements), in discussions about public schools on Facebook and on some conservative news sites.The use of the term \u201cgovernment schools\u201d is part of a broad education agenda that includes restraining costs. The far-right and libertarian wings of the Republican Party are pushing the state to loosen its laws to allow more charter schools. They oppose programs that offer free or reduced-price breakfasts and lunches, believing that schools have become part of the \u201cnanny state\u201d \u2014 another politically charged term \u2014 and are usurping the role of parents.He suggested, somewhat tongue in cheek, that swapping \u201cgovernment\u201d for \u201cpublic\u201d could become a trend, with references to \u201cgovernment libraries,\u201d \u201cgovernment parks\u201d \u2014 even \u201cgovernment universities.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s austere,\u201d Dr. Locke said. \u201cIt has an oppressive ring to it.

{"Headline": "Study Finds Chinese Students Excel in Critical Thinking. Until College.", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese primary and secondary schools are often derided as grueling, test-driven institutions that churn out students who can recite basic facts but have little capacity for deep reasoning.A new study, though, suggests that China is producing students with some of the strongest critical thinking skills in the world.The unexpected finding could recast the debate over whether Chinese schools are doing a better job than American ones, complementing previous studies showing Chinese students outperforming their global peers in reading, math and science.The study, to be published next year, found that Chinese freshmen in computer science and engineering programs began college with critical thinking skills about two to three years ahead of their peers in the United States and Russia. Those skills included the ability to identify assumptions, test hypotheses and draw relationships between variables.Yet Chinese students showed virtually no improvement in critical thinking after two years of college, even as their American and Russian counterparts made significant strides, according to the study.\u201cIt\u2019s astounding that China produces students that much further ahead at the start of college,\u201d said Prashant Loyalka, an author of the study. \u201cBut they\u2019re exhausted by the time they reach college, and they\u2019re not incentivized to work hard.\u201dThe findings are preliminary, but the weakness in China\u2019s higher education system is especially striking because Chinese leaders are pressing universities to train a new generation of highly skilled workers and produce innovations in science and technology to serve as an antidote to slowing economic growth.The government has built hundreds of universities in recent years to meet soaring demand for higher education, which many families consider a pathway into the growing middle class. Enrollment last year reached 26.2 million students, up from 3.4 million in 1998, with much of the increase in three-year polytechnic programs.But many universities, mired in bureaucracy and lax academic standards, have struggled. Students say the energetic and demanding teaching they are accustomed to in primary and secondary schools all but disappears when they reach college.\u201cTeachers don\u2019t know how to attract the attention of students,\u201d said Wang Chunwei, 22, an electrical engineering student at Tianjin Chengjian University, not far from Beijing. \u201cListening to their classes is like listening to someone reading out of a book.\u201dOthers blame a lack of motivation among students. Chinese children spend years preparing for the gaokao, the all-powerful national exam that determines admission to universities in China. For many students, a few points on the test can mean the difference between a good and a bad university, and a life of wealth or poverty.When students reach college, the pressure vanishes.\u201cYou get a degree whether you study or not, so why bother studying?\u201d said Wang Qi, 24, a graduate student in environmental engineering in Beijing.The Stanford study, based in part on exams given to 2,700 students at 11 mainland universities, has its own limitations. It does not account for people who are not enrolled in universities, a large swath of Chinese youth. It looks exclusively at students in computer science and engineering programs. And while it measures critical thinking, it does not offer insight into creativity, a topic often hotly debated in discussing the Chinese education system.Still, the researchers found stark differences when they compared Chinese students with their overseas counterparts.In addition to examining critical thinking skills, the study looked at how Chinese students compared in math and physics. While testing for the United States is not yet available, the researchers found that Chinese students arrived at college with skills far superior to their Russian counterparts.After two years of college, though, the Chinese students showed virtually no improvement while the Russians made substantial progress, though not enough to catch up.The Stanford researchers suspect the poor quality of teaching at many Chinese universities is one of the most important factors in the results. Chinese universities tend to reward professors for achievements in research, not their teaching abilities. In addition, almost all students graduate within four years, according to official statistics, reducing the incentive to work hard.\u201cThey don\u2019t really flunk anyone,\u201d said Scott Rozelle, an economist who has studied Chinese education for three decades and a co-author of the study. \u201cThe contract is, if you got in here, you get out.\u201dThe problems plaguing the higher education system have taken on new urgency as China\u2019s ruling Communist Party tries to navigate a difficult transition from an economy fueled by manufacturing and assembly-line work to one led by growth in fields such as information technology and clean energy.Eric X. Li, a venture capitalist in Shanghai who helped finance the Stanford study, said the success of Chinese secondary schools in teaching critical thinking could mean more innovation among younger Chinese that would help the economy.\u201cThe common narrative that we hear is that Chinese educational system kills creativity and kills innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut China is probably one of the most entrepreneurial societies in the world.\u201dThe slowing economy has made it difficult for university graduates to find work, with about one-fifth remaining unemployed immediately after graduation and many settling into low-paying jobs.Lu Jiawei, 22, who studies engineering management at Beijing Information Science and Technology University, said the gloomy job market was to blame for a lack of motivation among students.\u201cSome students just give up, because no matter how hard they work, they still will never get their dream jobs,\u201d she said.The shortcomings of the higher education system have left students struggling to find programs that match their aspirations.Niu Fuzhi, an aspiring computer scientist at Harbin University of Commerce, had high hopes when she enrolled in 2014. But she was quickly disappointed. Professors focused on teaching high-level theories, she said, and classrooms were chaotic.\u201cI feel like the past two years were a waste,\u201d said Ms. Niu, 20, who ranks near the top of her class.But Ms. Niu is hoping to make up for the skills she failed to learn in college \u2014 by enrolling in graduate school.Zhang Tiantian and Karoline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}

He was 83.His son, Brett, said the cause of death was pneumonia, a complication of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Mr. Anderson, an Olympic silver medalist in ice hockey, won a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives when he was just 25 and still in law school. He was 37 when he was first elected governor in 1970. He was re-elected in a landslide, winning by a 2-to-1 ratio.Besides his efforts to improve education in his six years as governor, Mr. Anderson oversaw the enactment of a state minimum wage, legislation to protect the environment and enforce federal safety standards for workers, and state investments in affordable housing.Gov. Mark Dayton, a fellow member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said in a statement that Mr. Anderson would be remembered most for reaching a bipartisan agreement with the State Legislature that \u201cwon national acclaim by replacing regressive local property taxes with more-progressive state taxes, increasing funding for K-12 education and reducing disparities between property-rich and property-poor school districts.\u201dFeatured on the cover of Time magazine in 1973 brandishing a trophy fish and described as a \u201cMidwestern Kennedy,\u201d Mr. Anderson was even mentioned as a potential vice-presidential or presidential candidate.Instead he made what proved to be a politically fatal mistake that transformed him from a promising national prospect into an evanescent also-ran.In the last days of 1976, he resigned as governor with the understanding that his successor, Lt. Gov. Rudy Perpich, would name him to the United States Senate seat vacated by Walter F. Mondale, who had just been elected Jimmy Carter\u2019s vice president. Mr. Perpich did so, and Mr. Anderson went to Washington.But the move rankled Minnesota voters, and in 1978 they punished the entire Democratic-Farmer-Labor ticket by denying Mr. Anderson a full six-year term, electing two Republican senators and a Republican governor, and delivering half the seats in the Minnesota House to Republicans.\u201cI think the people of Minnesota felt they had elected me as governor for four years and wanted me to stay there,\u201d Mr. Anderson told Minnesota Public Radio in 2003. \u201cI think that\u2019s fair. I don\u2019t disagree with the decision they made.\u201dAfter his defeat by Rudy Boschwitz, Mr. Anderson ran for the Senate again in 1984 but lost. He went on to practice law and to serve as a regent of the University of Minnesota.\u201cI was privileged to be governor when people were nice to one another,\u201d he said in the radio interview. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats got along, were able to do significant things for the state of Minnesota, because they liked one another. They respected one another.\u201dWendell Richard Anderson was born in St. Paul on Feb. 1, 1933, a grandson of Swedish immigrants. His father, Theodore, drove a sausage delivery truck. His mother was the former Gladys Nord.He received a hockey scholarship to the University of Minnesota and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1954. He served as an Army infantry officer and was a member of the United States hockey team that won the silver medal at the 1956 Winter Olympics in the Italian Alps. He was a student at the university\u2019s law school when he was elected to the Minnesota House in 1958.His marriage to the former Mary McKee ended in divorce. In addition to their son, Brett, he is survived by their two daughters, Amy Anderson and Elizabeth Crow; five grandchildren; and two brothers, Orv and Rod.After serving in the State Senate, Mr. Anderson mounted a successful campaign for governor against a liberal Republican. Time magazine described him as \u201ca startlingly effective TV performer, one of the best since John Kennedy.\u201dAs governor he persuaded the Legislature to raise taxes on corporate and personal income, sales, liquor and cigarettes, accounting for most of a $560 million increase in revenue. He then increased state aid to education, which decreased local property taxes, resulting in what a federal agency on intergovernmental relations called \u201cthe Minnesota Miracle.\u201dTwo years later, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party carried both houses of the Legislature for the first time. In 1974, when he successfully sought re-election, Mr. Anderson became the first candidate for governor to carry all 87 of Minnesota\u2019s counties.\u201cHere, then, was a governor with high popularity, a tremendous output of legislation and national recognition for his leadership,\u201d Daniel Judah Elazar, Virginia Gray and Wyman Spano wrote in \u201cMinnesota Politics and Government,\u201d a book published in 1999. \u201cDespite all that, few would rate Wendell Anderson as among Minnesota\u2019s greatest governors. The reason: his so-called self-appointment to the U.S. Senate.\u201dA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hubert H. Humphrey Jr., the former vice president and Minnesota senator, Mr. Anderson helped rejuvenate the Democratic-Farmer-Labor coalition and emerged looking \u201cyoung enough to be a graduate student or even agile enough to be a tight end on the Minnesota Vikings,\u201d James Reston of The New York Times wrote in 1972.\u201cThe politicians come to power early in Minneapolis,\u201d Mr. Reston wrote presciently. But, reeling off a litany of Mr. Anderson\u2019s predecessors, including the perennial presidential candidate Harold E. Stassen, he added, \u201cOddly, the principal figures of Minnesota politics all rose and faded fast, except Humphrey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dick Bellamy: The Man Hiding at the Center of Everything", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byNo one knew why Dick Bellamy nicknamed himself after a loser, but perhaps it was a reminder that he was a child of the Depression who had no fear of losing. In every respect, with his deep connections to the world of the Beat poets, writers and jazz, to the artists of Provincetown and the Lower East Side in Manhattan, Bellamy was a free spirit, a quiet catalyst behind the art of the \u201960s.I met him by chance because I lived above the Hansa Gallery, an artists\u2019 cooperative he directed with Ivan Karp in the late 1950s. From there, he went on to open the Green Gallery, where leading Pop, Minimal and Color Field painters, from Claes Oldenburg to James Rosenquist to Robert Morris, from Donald Judd to Dan Flavin to Larry Poons and Kenneth Noland, all showed between 1960 and 1965. Their names are now history, but who remembers the dealer who understood and promoted their art before they became famous?Ms. Stein\u2019s evocative portrait of Bellamy recreates in stunning, touching and often humorous detail the chaotic, creative, still bohemian art scenes of Provincetown, Mass., in the \u201950s, and New York in the \u201960s, when Abstract Expressionism was replaced by the aggressive imagery of Pop Art, the cool geometry of Minimalism and the lyrical abstraction of Color Field painting.Richard Townley Bellamy was easily as odd and outlandish as the artists he championed and whose meager, often desperate, lifestyles he shared. Money in those days was not an issue, since no one in Bellamy\u2019s crowd had any and survival depended on improvisation. But even in that motley crew, Bellamy seemed more comfortable in the outsiders\u2019 community of dreams and illusions than in the world of bourgeois cash and carry. Perhaps the exoticism of Bellamy, who was half-Chinese, stemmed from his oblique manner of presenting his very sensitive nature.Ms. Stein met Bellamy in 1986 \u2014 12 years before he died in bed, apparently while reading Proust, at 70 \u2014 when she curated a Franz Kline exhibition. \u201cHe had frayed cuffs,\u201d she remembered. \u201cHis eyeglasses were broken in the middle and Scotch-taped together.\u201d In truth, Bellamy\u2019s role was more like that of the French poet Apollinaire, who accompanied Marcel Duchamp on his famous trip to the Jura Mountains. He was the artist\u2019s friend, always ready to embark on the most extreme adventures.The unpaid bills for materials ordered by Judd and Flavin piled up, and in the spring of 1965, the gallery was forced to close; its most successful artists joined Leo Castelli. Later, Castelli acknowledged that \u201cDick Bellamy was younger than I, but my teacher.\u201d As Castelli\u2019s fame increased, however, Bellamy was gradually forgotten, except by the artists he discovered and whose careers he nurtured.Some, primarily Mark di Suvero, would never have another dealer as long as Bellamy was alive. I remember Bellamy\u2019s powers of persuasion were so great that when he told me I had to go to Venice because Mark, who had left the United States in protest against the Vietnam War, was depressed, I got on the next plane. When Bellamy arrived, we went out on the lagoon in Mark\u2019s rowboat, which had a hole in the bottom. Dick accidentally set the flag on the makeshift mast on fire \u2014 we were burning and sinking at the same time. For me, that experience summed up Bellamy\u2019s essence \u2014 his capacity to convince you that somehow you would survive any crisis as long as he was with you as a guiding spirit radiating truth and grace.When I asked Robert Morris recently what he remembered best about Bellamy, who dared fill the Green Gallery with his installation of minimal plywood objects the public did not recognize as sculpture in 1964 \u2014 art that Dia:Beacon will permanently install this fall \u2014 Mr. Morris said it was Bellamy sitting alone behind a desk in the back room of the Green Gallery. It was also where artists often collected to joke and horse around. He recalled Mr. Poons getting a broom from the closet to sweep the front gallery floor and Mr. Samaras in morose silence, but hiding a barely contained mirth.\u201cI think,\u201d Mr. Morris said, \u201cit had to do with the fact that we \u2014 the artists and Bellamy himself, who we regarded as more of an artist than a \u2018director\u2019 \u2014 were sitting in a space on 57th Street, when we all belonged downtown in our ratty lofts. There was something slightly ridiculous about occupying that zone where the serious, moneyed New York galleries were located.\u201dI often visited that back room where Bellamy presided with the calm of a bodhisattva bestowing blessings but rarely speaking. Mr. Morris recalls that he had the sense that Bellamy existed in some space removed from ordinary existence and that when he spoke he was still preoccupied with thoughts from that other space.In the late 1960s and early \u201970s, Bellamy had a small office in the Noah Goldowsky gallery on Madison Avenue, where he organized exhibitions of work by Richard Artschwager, Keith Sonnier and Richard Serra. In 1980, he opened a space in TriBeCa where he showed Alfred Leslie, Jo Baer, Michael Heizer, Neil Jenney, Richard Nonas and Mr. di Suvero. By 1985, Bellamy moved to Long Island City, near Mr. di Suvero\u2019s huge studio, which fronted the East River.An article last Sunday about Dick Bellamy misidentified the location of the art scene described by the art historian Judith E. Stein in her new book about Mr. Bellamy. It is Provincetown, Mass., not Providence, R.I.An article on July 24 about Dick Bellamy misstated the location of the Green Gallery, which he opened and where many leading Pop, Minimal and Color Field artists showed their work between 1960 and 1965. It is on West 57th Street, not East 57th Street.Barbara Rose is an art historian and curator. Her show \u201cPainting After Post-Modernism\u201d opens Sept. 14 in Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mexico, Narco Films vs. Narco Reality", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byMexico City \u2014 It was a television executive\u2019s nightmare: Not only was someone threatening to sue over a TV series, but that person was reputedly the biggest drug trafficker on the planet and the head of a cartel behind a long string of mass executions and torture videos.The declarations put the show\u2019s producers in a predicament. If they go ahead with the series, due in 2017, they could face a legal battle \u2014 and the possibility that, should he lose, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n might seek retribution out of court. But if they get into negotiating with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, they face other problems. Would they be cooperating with organized crime? El Chapo\u2019s lawyer suggested that he could help make the TV series better by giving details no journalist had yet dug up. But could that mean acting as a propaganda instrument for a crime boss?The quandary reflects bigger dilemmas in the growing world of narco fiction. Dramatic portrayals of Mexican crime kings, which began as zany B-grade movies, have evolved into wildly popular soap operas, best-selling novels and major Hollywood productions. They are part of a wider narco culture, ranging from pop-music ballads to fashion trends. Meanwhile, from 2007 to 2014 more than 80,000 Mexicans were killed by cartel-related violence, according to a government count. May was the most murderous month in Mexico in almost four years.Mexico\u2019s narco-films took off with the straight-to-video technology of the 1980s, often shot in a couple of weeks and starring real-life strippers, real guns and real criminals firing them. Titles like \u201cThe Big Bazooka Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Elite Narco Commando\u201d and \u201cScarface Reborn\u201d are popular in Mexican communities in the United States. Some traffickers finance their own biopics: When Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as La Barbie, was arrested in 2010, he told the police that he had given producers $200,000 to make a movie about him.The narco action film first made its way into the more popular and better-produced telenovelas in Colombia in the mid-2000s, before expanding to Mexico at the end of the decade. Local TV networks made hits like \u201cSin Tetas No Hay Paraiso\u201d (\u201cWithout Breasts, There Is No Paradise\u201d) and \u201cEl Cartel de Los Sapos\u201d (\u201cThe Cartel of the Snitches\u201d), which was based on a book by a real Colombian trafficker who was imprisoned in the United States. They worked well, featuring a gritty realism while maintaining the glamour and entertainment value of Latin soaps.Last year, the drug war made its big break into the mainstream American media market with the release of the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cSicario,\u201d the Netflix series \u201cNarcos\u201d and the best-selling novel \u201cThe Cartel,\u201d by Don Winslow. All have been commercial and critical hits, despite protests by the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez against \u201cSicario\u201d for portraying his city in a bad light. The success of \u201cNarcos,\u201d which paints a largely true picture of the Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar, paved the way for Netflix to work on production of the \u201cEl Chapo\u201d series.Mexican politicians slam narco culture for glamorizing, and even feeding, the blood-soaked trade. Writers, producers and singers retort that they are merely documenting reality. But increasingly, the line between life and art is blurring.The line between fact and fiction may have disappeared entirely when it emerged that Ms. del Castillo had brought the actor Sean Penn to meet Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, a trip that Mr. Penn later recounted in Rolling Stone. Pundits speculated that Ms. del Castillo had become consumed by her role on \u201cLa Reina del Sur,\u201d or that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had fallen in love with her telenovela character. It was also revealed that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had promised the exclusive film rights of his story to Ms. del Castillo, raising further questions about Netflix\u2019s effort.But just because it makes for a good story, is it one that Netflix should be telling? There\u2019s certainly a risk of glorifying narco life; I have interviewed several gang members, and they will often say they watch narco soaps and movies. I even went into a prison in the border city of Nuevo Laredo to find that a crime boss being held there had a life-size photo of Al Pacino from \u201cScarface\u201d on his wall. But it\u2019s harder to say whether narco fiction contributes to the violence in Mexico \u2014 millions of people watch these same films and don\u2019t go around decapitating victims on video.Still, producers of narco fiction do struggle with this question. \u201cOh, my God, do I wrestle with that,\u201d Mr. Winslow told me last year. \u201cAt the end of the day, I tilt toward the side of, \u2018By informing people, we are doing good.\u2019 But in the day by day writing of some of these things, I would wonder, \u2018Am I tripping across a line? And am I simply doing a pornography of violence? Is this just voyeuristic?\u2019 \u201dIt\u2019s a question that Netflix and Univision need to ask themselves over the coming year. Assuming Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is extradited to the United States, he could also go on trial or make a deal, a real-life drama that could play out while the series airs. With so much in flux, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n could well come out a celebrity, a modern-day Al Capone or John Dillinger. Even if it inspires only a handful of people to follow his lead, is that worth the ratings?Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Alavi, managing partner at the Akrivis law group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s very consistent with past efforts by Congress to undermine the nuclear deal.\u201dBoeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, speaking this month at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain, an important annual industry event, may have added to the skepticism. He said that if his company could not sell planes to Iran Air, the state-run airline, under a memorandum of agreement reached in June, then \u201cnobody should.\u201dMr. Muilenburg was alluding to the Airbus deal, which was publicized to great fanfare when President Hassan Rouhani of Iran visited France, where Airbus has its headquarters, in January.The Iranians are also finding it difficult to find financing from foreign banks still skittish about doing business with the country. The depressed price of oil, Iran\u2019s main export, is not helping matters.Iran is also warily contemplating the possibility that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States, whose disdain for the nuclear accord is well known, could win in November. Whether he would try to withdraw from the accord is unclear.The delayed aircraft deals have sent ripples of uncertainty through the aviation industry, potentially affecting anticipated work by financial institutions, suppliers, service providers, insurers, reinsurers and others, according to lawyers knowledgeable about how large aircraft purchase contracts are handled.Iranian aviation officials, impatient to begin rejuvenating the country\u2019s aging fleet of 250 aircraft \u2014 of which more than a third are said to be grounded \u2014 have hinted they may go elsewhere to buy planes.The Iranians have expressed interest in a midsize jet under development by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi conglomerate, Reuters reported recently. In another possible sign of reduced expectations, there is speculation that the Iranians may cancel orders for 12 Airbus A380 jumbo jets, part of the 118-plane deal with Airbus that Mr. Rouhani announced seven months ago.Doubts also have emerged about whether Iran can lease new planes as an alternative, or a supplement, to buying them.Industry analysts say leasing companies could have difficulties repossessing the planes in the event Iran is found to have violated the nuclear accord or to be using the planes for purposes other than civilian transportation.Iran has not signed the Cape Town Convention, an agreement on international procedures for recovering \u201cmobile assets\u201d like aircraft.\u201cA lot of people who lease planes will look at that and say, \u2018No, thank you,\u2019\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.Mr. Aboulafia also expressed skepticism about the possibility of Iran\u2019s becoming an important customer to either Boeing or Airbus. Most of the international routes to Iran have been claimed by airlines in neighboring Persian Gulf states, with service and reliability that Iran will have trouble matching.\u201cIran\u2019s jetliner requirements could be real, but only if Tehran also agreed to reform its miserable state-owned economy, create private-sector airlines and adhere to international finance norms,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia wrote in an opinion piece published July 7 in Aviation Week, an industry magazine. \u201cThere are no plans to do anything like this.\u201dEven under a newly relaxed sanctions regime stipulated by the nuclear accord, both Boeing and Airbus need licenses from the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control to sell aircraft to Iran. Airbus planes use American parts that are subject to United States government approval.Both Boeing and Airbus have repeatedly said they are awaiting the licenses and cannot proceed without them. Treasury officials have declined to comment on when the licenses might be issued.Boeing has rejected accusations by some congressional critics that its desire to sell airplanes to a country hostile to the United States is wrongheaded.\u201cBasically what we\u2019ve told them is, \u2018Look: The U.S. government and five other governments negotiated this agreement. Airplanes were a part of it,\u201d Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said in a telephone interview.He also suggested that Boeing was not prepared to relinquish any competitive opportunity to Airbus concerning the Iranian market. Iranian aviation officials have said they will need 500 planes in coming years.\u201cIf Airbus were able to go into that market and we weren\u2019t able to be in there, too, and if Iran stays on the straight and narrow path and the moderates prevail politically and the market really grows in years ahead,\u201d Mr. Neale said, \u201cthey would have that market to themselves.\u201dNicola Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Firms Offer Cash to Help New Lawyers Pay Student Debt", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byYoung lawyers, struggling with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, are finding relief from a new source: their employers.Some law firms are starting to contribute cash to help their newly hired lawyers meet monthly payments on education loans that can be as large as a mortgage payment on a house. That is a step beyond what some law firms now do in helping their junior lawyers refinance with lower-interest loans.People \u201chave an emotional reaction to carrying debt, and they like it when employers show that they appreciate the financial challenges that people are facing,\u201d said Beth Akers, an economist at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on Children and Families.On a more practical level, \u201cmore firms are likely to adopt this benefit because they need to compete to attract and retain lawyers and to present themselves in ways that attract and retain clients,\u201d said Jack Zaremski, founder and president of Hanover Legal Personnel Services.Such law firms will join a growing wave of other workplaces that offer student loan repayment programs to attract and retain millennial employees, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity. In December, the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers set up a loan repayment program that pays $1,200 annually toward an employee\u2019s student loans.Orrick, which has more than 1,000 lawyers, is offering $100 a month for starting lawyers for 18 months. After that, the junior lawyers will be eligible to receive a bonus from the firm. The program, which starts Sept. 1, is being offered to associates who are on the track to becoming partners as well as to those who choose the less intensive career associate track.\u201cWe expect that quite a few of our lawyers will use the plan,\u201d said Siobhan A. Handley, Orrick\u2019s chief talent officer, who worked with Social Finance Inc. to devise the firm\u2019s tuition benefit, which will be offered to the about 40 lawyers hired each year. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare that someone comes here with no debt.\u201dThe firm views the debt relief as another benefit, along with flexible work arrangements and parental leave, to attract young lawyers.\u201cWith fewer students choosing law schools, fewer law school grads choosing big firms, and women leaving the profession faster than men, we wanted to distinguish ourselves in the market,\u201d Ms. Handley said.\u201cThis will help our associates reduce the level of financial stress so they can focus on their training, development and client service,\u201d she added.Financial stress is evident even as new recruits at the nation\u2019s elite law firms can earn as much as $180,000 in salary.Yet they represent less than 9 percent of the typical recent graduating law school class, said Deborah J. Merritt, a law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law.Graduates arrive at law firms with an average of $185,000 in student debt, Mark Kantrowitz, a higher-education expert who tracks student debt, estimates. That compares to $75,000 a decade ago, he found.It is not just big law firms that are reacting to the higher debt loads being carried by their young lawyers.Ward and Smith, a 91-person regional law firm based in New Bern, N.C., is introducing a similar student loan repayment benefit to help its new lawyers tackle their debt. The firm is working with Gradifi Inc., a Boston company that tailors student loan payment programs for companies and, increasingly, for law firms.\u201cSummer associates that we wanted to hire began mentioning what a big burden student debt was,\u201d said Mike Epperson, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThey could have more than $100,000 in debt and they were worried. The firm already has a profit-sharing plan, but we decided that student loan repayment help was one more way we could show our younger attorneys that we wanted to help them from the very beginning.\u201dThe program, which starts this fall, will help Devon D. Williams, 29, pay off the loans she took out for her law degree from the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law at Campbell University in Raleigh, N.C. She is in her second year practicing labor and employment law at Ward and Smith.According to Gradifi\u2019s debt calculator, if Ward and Smith contributes $200 a month, a graduate like Ms. Williams with $45,000 in debt borrowed, for example, at 6 percent interest, could save $5,518 in interest over the life of a 10-year loan and shorten the repayment period.Conscious of their debt, Ms. Williams and her husband \u2014 who works for a health insurance company \u2014 watch their budget. Their top monthly debt is her loan repayment, which is more, she said, than the mortgage on their home in Cary, a suburb of Raleigh. One reason, she said, is that she borrowed money when loan rates were high.And, she added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough equity in our house to consolidate our loans yet. But we\u2019re trying to be pretty aggressive about paying them off.\u201dA major consideration is that they want to have a family.\u201cOf course, you want to get your debt down before you think about having children,\u201d Ms. Williams said.At Orrick, James M. Fee, 27, of Needham, Mass., owes $150,000 he borrowed to earn his degree from Boston College Law School. He joined the firm\u2019s New York office in September. His monthly loan repayment is the second-highest expense he has after his apartment rent.\u201cI\u2019m not complaining,\u201d he said. \u201cI make a good salary, but I watch what I spend and what I save.\u201d When he applied to law school, he chose schools that he thought were the best value.Boston College Law School had a good reputation. Plus, he said, \u201cliving costs were lower, because the law school is in the suburbs rather than a big city like Boston or New York.\u201dTim DeMello, the founder and chief executive of Gradifi, said the loan payback program was likely to spread, noting that an additional 20 law firms are looking at starting the benefit this year.\u201cOur clients see it as a way to attract, and retain, new talent,\u201d he said.Social Finance, based in San Francisco, also has more than a dozen law firms interested in setting up a debt benefit program.But there are drawbacks to such programs. Law firm contributions are taxed as earnings. Several proposals are percolating in Congress to exempt taxation, up to a yearly maximum, on company tuition debt contributions \u2014 but none have passed.Economists like Ms. Akers at Brookings question the wisdom of such plans. She points out that they benefit one class of employees \u2014 the debtors \u2014 over others, and draw from the same employee benefit pool that could be used to augment other universal benefits like health insurance.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like serving sushi in the workplace cafeteria,\u201d Ms. Akers said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for those who want it, but not so much for those who don\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Did It Take to Make \u2018Equity,\u2019 a Film About Women on Wall Street?", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m so glad we can sit here, as women, and talk about ambition,\u201d the character, played by Anna Gunn of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d continues. \u201cBut money doesn\u2019t have to be a dirty word. We can like that, too.\u201d\u201cFor women, you always had to prove you could to do the job before they give you the job, and for men, they would give them that opportunity before they proved themselves,\u201d said Barbara Byrne, an investment banker. Covering the energy industry at Lehman Brothers in 1980, she contended with outright sexism. \u201cThere was always this view that \u2018she would run off and marry one of the Goldman partners\u2019 and be gone,\u201d Ms. Byrne said. Her compensation, too, was unequal. \u201cPeople are paying you for your potential, but if they think you\u2019re going to leave, they can justify giving that 10 percent to someone else they think of as a long-term player,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet, I\u2019ve outlasted all those long-term players. I\u2019ve now been doing this career for 36 years.\u201d\u201cEquity\u201d had its premiere at Sundance, where Sony Pictures Classics bought distribution rights for $3.5 million. Ms. Thomas and Ms. Reiner declined to reveal the budget, except to say that it was small. Investments came in at different amounts, starting at $25,000, said Candy Straight, an investor and the executive producer. \u201cIf the question is, will we make money on this movie, the answer is yes,\u201d she said.Ms. Thomas and Ms. Reiner were also clear on one other point: \u201cThe women in this movie made more money than the men, as a whole,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.\u201cEquity\u201d follows Ms. Gunn\u2019s Naomi Bishop, a high-flying investment banker with one recent stumble, as she jockeys for a tech firm\u2019s big initial offering. \u201cI like that we meet her when she has her first sort of epic failure,\u201d Ms. Gunn said. Ms. Thomas plays the vice president helping her score the deal, and Ms. Reiner is investigating hedge funders for the Justice Department. Motherhood and its place in career-building is a notable part of the story \u2014 there\u2019s a hidden pregnancy, a detail the investors vouched for as authentic. But Naomi is single and childless, a departure from Ms. Gunn\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d character, Skyler, whose fate was bound up with her family\u2019s. \u201cEquity\u201d is Ms. Gunn\u2019s first leading feature role, and she wanted it to be a leap, so the workplace focus \u201cfelt like a real gift,\u201d she said.Part of her research involved speaking to the investors, like Ms. Byrne. \u201cShe talked a lot about the balance, and the hours that are put in, and the dedication it takes, and the fact that you have to be twice as prepared, and twice as sharp, and twice as strong,\u201d Ms. Gunn said, all while making sure not to seem either too tough or too pliable. \u201cIt\u2019s a real dance that women have to do.\u201dMs. Byrne said among her favorite moments in the film was one in which Naomi was told she was perceived as being difficult. \u201cThat has certainly been said about me,\u201d Ms. Byrne said. \u201cWhat was I told a couple of weeks ago? \u2018You were overbearing.\u2019 That\u2019s mostly because I\u2019m expressing an opinion.\u201dFor the investors, the appeal of the film was, in some ways, that spark of recognition, of seeing aspects of their professional lives onscreen. Linnea Roberts, who recently retired as a partner at Goldman Sachs, said her decision to invest came when \u201cI read the first page of the script \u2014 that moment where she\u2019s watching a competitor take a company that she covered public. That happens all the time.\u201dPregnancy and maternity leave also loomed large. When Ms. Roberts entered the business, in the 1990s, she said, \u201cno one overtly told you this, but it was understood that you didn\u2019t have a child until you were managing director.\u201d Now, younger female associates have children, she said, but the timing is \u201cstill, sadly, in the dialogue\u201d when bosses decide who to promote, as a character in \u201cEquity\u201d fears.Though the status of women in the field has improved, \u201cit still has a long way to go,\u201d said Ms. Straight, who started her career in 1969, at Bankers Trust, and is now an independent director of Neuberger Berman mutual funds.That is a reality that \u201cEquity\u201d does not shy away from. \u201cThis film might not necessarily be the marketing piece to get women onto Wall Street,\u201d said Ms. Roberts, who spent the last few years of her career spearheading initiatives to get women up the ladder. \u201cBut I do think it raises a lot of the right questions. You have to own the problems and the questions first, before we can do anything about them.\u201dA lot of the investors were brought together by Ms. Straight, a corporate veteran, who held meet-and-greets with Ms. Thomas and Ms. Reiner for groups of high-ranking Wall Street women, many of whom already knew and supported one another.\u201cWhat resonates the most is the title, \u2018Equity,\u2019\u201d Ms. Byrne said. \u201cWhen do we get our fair share, when do we get a seat at the table? There\u2019s a lot of great stories that aren\u2019t being told, because the women can\u2019t get a stake. I backed them because I could.\u201d\u201cThose who can, do,\u201d she added. \u201cMy mother always told me that. So we could, and we did.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Erdogan Loyalists and the Syrian Refugees", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "FeatureFaced with an influx of new Arab neighbors, a conservative neighborhood in Istanbul struggles with the question of what it means to be a Turk.Supported by\u201cWe\u2019re very sad,\u201d Murat said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much else to feel. The terrorists hit the international terminal. It\u2019s not against us.\u201dKaragumruk lies within the larger district of Fatih, an AK Party stronghold, intensely loyal to its leader and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. During the recent coup attempt against Erdogan\u2019s government, after the Ministry of Religious Affairs sent texts to imams to issue a special call to prayer, all of Fatih exploded out onto the wide-laned Vatan Avenue, a couple blocks from Karagumruk. Murat put down his newborn child to join the crowd, which included men of all ages, even little boys. When a helicopter began to hover near the AK Party headquarters in Fatih, 10 minutes from Karagumruk, the protesters rushed it, preventing it from landing. As it pulled away, it fired into the crowd, killing at least one protester and injuring others. When I asked Murat why he and his neighbors took to the streets \u2014 for Islam? for Erdogan? \u2014 he replied, \u201cErdogan is Islam, and Islam is Erdogan.\u201dThe AK Party runs the municipality, and Fatih residents abide by Erdogan\u2019s Islamic lifestyle. Islamist demonstrations often take place at the grand Fatih mosque. Turks in Fatih tend to take Erdogan\u2019s side in all his knotted-up foreign and domestic entanglements, not just the failed coup but his disputes with Russia, his tortured relations with America, his brutal conflict with the Kurds, his leniency toward jihadist fighters passing through Turkey to take part in Syria\u2019s civil war, his horse trading with the European Union over refugees fleeing Syria. This dangerous new role for Turkey in the Middle East had further alienated the political opposition, including elements in the military.Over the last five years, Erdogan wound up allowing millions of Syrians, most of whom are Arabs, into Turkey. The newcomers seem foreign to most Turks, but the two peoples have memories of an ancestral divorce: One hundred years ago, the Turks ruled the Arabs as part of the Ottoman Empire, and when the empire split up, Ataturk, Turkey\u2019s founder, in part defined the new country in opposition to the Arab world. He famously regarded Arabs as beneath Turks, and Arabs probably felt little affection for the Turks\u2019 enduring imperiousness. Today they can barely communicate with each other: Turks don\u2019t speak Arabic, and Syrians don\u2019t speak Turkish. They live together but also apart.Since 2012, Professor Naci Sensoy Street had filled up with Syrian shops, perhaps a third of the total. I knew by then, having spent months visiting Karagumruk, that some Turks living there weren\u2019t happy about it. I asked those in the barbershop whether attacks in Turkey spurred any Turks in the neighborhood to take out their anger on the refugees, as had happened in the West.A Syrian barber had been cutting hair silently, too wary to talk, but now the rest of the barbershop fell silent. Then Murat exclaimed: \u201cThe Syrians have nothing to do with this, ya! A people driven from their homeland \u2014 how can they be a terrorist? One or two people do something and it\u2019s attributed to a whole nation, ya. This kind of mindlessness must stop.\u201dI began spending time in Karagumruk because I wanted to understand how ordinary Turks were dealing with a refugee crisis far greater, in terms of numbers, than what was roiling politics throughout the rest of Europe. Whether the Syrians wanted to stay or not, it seemed the Turks were preparing to let them: Not long before the failed coup, Erdogan said he was considering a plan to offer citizenship to at least some refugees. Somehow the Syrians fit into Erdogan\u2019s vision of Turkey, and his people seemed willing to consider it. The influx of refugees, I found, was making the Turks of Karagumruk rethink how they viewed their country, their history and even themselves.\u201cThis was a Greek neighborhood, ya!\u201d Altintoprak said. \u201cPeople say Christians were the Muslims\u2019 enemies? What are you talking about? There are good guys and bad guys. I am coming from the Ottoman era! If someone is human, they are human, what can you do? In my time, the Greeks gave a Turkish guy in the neighborhood the nickname of Aleko, a Greek name, and he didn\u2019t care! Today, if you said, \u2018Hey, Petro!\u2019 someone would shoot you.\u201dIn the 1950s, riots, attacks and prejudice drove away nearly all of the remaining Greeks and Armenians, just as millions of Turkish migrants were arriving in Istanbul from the eastern part of the country. External migrants came too: Bulgarians, Bosnians, Macedonians. At least all these newcomers could, according to the rules of the imagined community of the time, be considered \u201cTurks.\u201d But it has been a different story when it comes to the new Arab arrivals, the latest of the former Ottoman subjects to seek shelter in the old imperial home.Syrians who made their way to Karagumruk told me it reminded them of Damascus. Many of them settled nearby in an area that had once been the site of one of the oldest Roma settlements in the world, Sulukule, before it was torn down amid controversy in the 2000s and replaced with state-subsidized townhouses. These looked fancy but were deficient \u2014 windows that didn\u2019t open, finicky plumbing, oddly dangerous patios \u2014 and failed to attract Turkish renters. When the Syrians came, the landlords increased the rents unfairly, but some tenants crammed a dozen beds into single apartments and made Sulukule home.A crowd in Istanbul watched President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey,\u00a0speaking on July 1, several days after suicide bombers attacked Istanbul Ataturk Airport, killing at least 44 people and wounding hundreds of others.In 2012, a year after the civil war in Syria began, a young Syrian man opened a coffee shop on Professor Naci Sensoy Street. From one bin, he sold the shiny black beans favored in Syria; from the other, the dry brown beans preferred in Turkey. Each month he paid a small bribe to local toughs to let him stay. Then came the Zain barbershop, the Syrian sweets shop El Nour, the Syrian chicken-kebab place and a Syrian secondhand furniture store. In Istanbul, it is common to see shops proclaiming where in Turkey the owners come from: the Van Breakfast House (the city of Van), the Erzincan Meat and Chicken Market (the city of Erzincan). Hometown is important \u2014 \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d is one of the first questions Turks ask one another \u2014 but you don\u2019t very often see references to places outside Turkey: the Sofia Coffeehouse, say, or, heaven forbid, Athens Baklava. And yet in just three years, almost every other shop on the long Professor Naci Sensoy Street was strung with Arabic script. The Syrian coffee shop called itself Al-Helebi, for the city of Aleppo.\u201cA lot of them started businesses,\u201d the muhtar told me one October day in his office. Turks seemed both impressed and miffed by the Syrians\u2019 confidence, when they weren\u2019t complaining about the Syrians who were begging. \u201cThey don\u2019t help each other! Instead, they\u2019re always asking for help from Turks. ... Go outside: There are five children asking for money.\u201dAltintoprak\u2019s comments seemed to liberate a woman who was waiting for him. \u201cThey are dirty,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do their washing before prayers in the kitchen. I live next to a Syrian family. And in the same place they eat and prepare food, they wash their feet before prayers.\u201dTurks have high standards of cleanliness. Kitchen rags cannot be put in washing machines; cleaning women risk their lives on the ledges of fifth-floor apartments to scrub the windows. All of which is to say, calling something dirty is inordinately common in Turkish commentary. But it also connotes backwardness, and thus you hear nasty comments about the \u201cdirty\u201d Kurds or the \u201cdirty\u201d Arabs \u2014 that is, the Middle Eastern peoples whom the Turks imagine they left behind when Ataturk came along and pushed them westward.The woman was still going on about the feet when a well-dressed boy walked in speaking perfect Turkish. He had the bravado of someone who had drawn up his courage only recently.The muhtar sized him up. \u201cAre you Syrian?\u201d\u201cIraqi.\u201dThe muhtar stared at him blankly for a moment before he snatched the paper, scribbled and gave precise and patient directions.\u201cThank you, brother, I\u2019ll do as you say,\u201d said the boy, using all the correct Turkish expressions that it took me many years to learn.Down the street from Altintoprak\u2019s office, a shopkeeper joked, \u201cIf the Syrians keep coming here, pretty soon we\u2019re going to have to go live there!\u201d Then he continued seriously: \u201cI hired some Syrians once. They are lazy. Why don\u2019t they work harder? If they come to a foreign country and you\u2019re supposed to feed your family, you should be ambitious. And they\u2019re not. They are always checking their watches, asking how long they have to work.\u201dA customer of indiscernible origin asked if he could join the conversation. \u201cThey are not all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting a terrible war. How can a Muslim do this to a Muslim? And then we try to cheat them. They try to work here and are never justly paid.\u201dThe shop owner mulled this over. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they send their families here and stay in Syria to defend their country?\u201d he asked.The customer seemed to take this notion very seriously, and in fact it is a common one in Karagumruk: Many Turkish men believe that, because Turks fought and liberated their country from the Western powers after World War I, Syrian men should have stayed behind and fought for their nation, too.\u201cYou say that, but we ourselves have had a war within our country for 30 years,\u201d the customer countered, though it had being going on closer to 40. \u201cHave you ever fought for your country against the Kurds?\u201dSilence followed. After the stranger walked out, the shop owner and his employee whispered. One said, \u201cI guess he might be Syrian?\u201d\u201cMust be,\u201d the other said.\u201cLook, let me tell you,\u201d another customer piped up. \u201cI am from Mardin\u201d \u2014 a Turkish city near the Syrian border that is Arabic, Kurdish and Turkish \u2014 \u201cArabs are the worst. You can\u2019t trust them. If we went to their country, they would take everything from us! Remember during the period between the Ottoman and Republican eras?\u201d He meant when the Arabs fought for their independence. \u201cThey stabbed us in the back! I know them. You can never trust Arabs. They are traitors.\u201dErdogan changed all that. He brought with him a more critical view of old-style secular nationalism and a more positive one of Islamic identity, of Middle Eastern integration, of Turkey\u2019s supremacy within the region. In many ways, Erdogan\u2019s policies were overdue: nationalistic impulses prevented peace with the Kurds, who had demanded the freedom to be Kurdish, precluded discussions about the Armenian genocide and buttressed a kind of High Turkish snobbery when it came to its former Ottoman subjects, the Arabs. Turkey had never really been the \u201cbridge\u201d between West and East during the 20th century; it was the wall keeping them apart. But around 2009, friendly rhetoric and an easing of visa restrictions began drawing thousands of Arab businessmen and tourists to Turkey. In the 21st century, Turkey opened itself up to a region it had feared. In 2011, Erdogan declared that Turkey would open its borders to the Syrian refugees, \u201cour brothers.\u201dBy the end of that year, 24,000 refugees lived in Turkey. Only five years later, there are three million, including non-Syrian refugees. (Lebanon and Jordan have absorbed more Syrians relative to their population than Turkey, whose population is 80 million.) The 2.7 million Syrians are everywhere. Only 300,000 are in refugee camps; the rest are looking for homes, jobs, husbands and wives throughout the country. Syrians outnumber the Turks in border cities like Kilis and equal their numbers in larger ones like Gaziantep and Urfa, where they are both visible and vulnerable: ISIS has killed Syrian journalists in their homes. Syrians even live in tiny Anatolian towns, on the coast and in the ethnically volatile East.Erdogan\u2019s has been a laissez-faire humanitarianism. There is little support offered outside the refugee camps. Syrians register for \u201ctemporary protection.\u201d Until recently they did not get work permits, which are still hard to obtain. Many Syrians, often children, ended up in one of Istanbul\u2019s thousands of basement textile ateliers, sewing buttons and gluing shoes, working 12 hours a day, sometimes without being paid. Like Turks, they can go to hospitals and schools free, but enforcing this access is difficult; Syrians are at the mercy of the doctors and principals who don\u2019t speak Arabic, who are already contending with crowded conditions and who often discriminate against the refugees. A great number of Syrians have fled to Europe. Turkey is a kind of frontier when it comes to capitalism: It can be hard for anyone to make it there. So two groups of Syrians will remain in Turkey, those too poor to leave and those rich enough to stay.In Istanbul, a makeshift society has taken hold. About 50 private Syrian schools have opened in the city alone, either in rented office buildings or in public-school buildings at night after the Turkish children are done for the day. Walking in the Fatih neighborhood, I once passed an empty storefront in which a Syrian woman was sitting with three students at a table. She had turned the vacant spot into a school, as if it were a pop-up art gallery. I have heard countless stories of tiny Turkish donations: bread, old clothes, money. These are the one-man nongovernmental organizations of daily life, the gifts that make life bearable.But there\u2019s only so much that individuals can do. Every week there are lurid headlines in the newspapers: \u201cFour-year-old Syrian Boy\u2019s Body Found in the Bosporus.\u201d \u201cIn Eskisehir 13 Syrians Poisoned by Carbon Monoxide.\u201d \u201cSyrian Shepherd Shot in the Leg.\u201d \u201cSyrian Woman Killed in Batman.\u201d Stories are filled with prostitution, Turkish men taking Syrians as second wives, babies dying in the cold. This year, a cleaner in a refugee camp was convicted of raping 30 boys. In the summer of 2014, two incidents in particular shook the city of Gaziantep. In one instance, a Syrian driver \u2014 Syrians have license plates with \u201cS\u201d on them \u2014 struck a Turkish family on the street. In another, an angry Syrian tenant stabbed his landlord, who was evicting him, to death. Angry Turkish youth rioted, attacking \u201cS\u201d cars and throwing rocks through Syrian shop windows.Syrians went to Syrian shops, and Turks still went to the Turkish ones. They didn\u2019t like each other\u2019s food. The cuisines were similar enough that the minor differences struck people as if they were different cuisines entirely. \u201cI used the best ingredients, the best oil, the best wheat!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they wouldn\u2019t eat it! In Damascus they come and say congratulations and best of luck and buy stuff and encourage you. Here they did not.\u201dAnd the Turks took advantage of him, putting him through what sounded like a kind of hazing. \u201cIn the beginning I wanted to buy flour from someone and make a small amount of prepayment,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t pick up the flour the night I was supposed to, so I came the day after.\u201d Not surprisingly, the Syrians have to endure an obstacle course to survive each day: how to get the bus, who will watch the kids, how to get to a specific address, is there enough money to get there? They missed appointments, couldn\u2019t find offices. \u201cThe owner said, \u2018I sold the flour to someone else,\u2019\u2009\u201d Majed told me. \u201cIt took two days to get my prepayment back.\u201dMajed had not believed he would survive. But now, two years later, El Nour had a staff of eight. His two younger sons went to a Turkish religious school in the neighborhood and received high marks; the family found an apartment that was small, but spotless. Two of his daughters married in Turkey. Majed wanted to go home to Syria, but he imagined he might have to stay in Istanbul. His desserts are incredible.His friend, who had been sitting with us, joined the conversation. He planned to stay in Turkey as well. He was Turkish and Syrian but grew up in Syria and had the air of someone who liked to tell it like it is.\u201cTurkey is good at welcoming us, but there are underage kids working in factories here,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is better in that sense; they have more humanitarian values.\u201d He paused before adding: \u201cThough of course they are bombing us. My father was killed by one of these warplanes. The Europeans blame ISIS and they present themselves as humanitarian, but they have not a trace of humanitarianism when they bomb Syria.\u201dFrom this perspective, who looked better than the Turks, who saved Syrian lives? I asked Syrians in Fatih if any of them blamed Erdogan for leaving the border open to jihadists who were passing through to join Al Qaeda or ISIS. They \u2014 these Syrian Arabs, anyway \u2014 did not. \u201cWe are happy,\u201d the Turkish-Syrian from Syria said. \u201cGod bless the Turks. If Islam disappears on earth, then you should follow the Turks, because the Turks\u2019 morality is the morality of god.\u201dThere is also a shared religious identity: the majority of Syrians are, like Erdogan\u2019s people, Sunni. Syrians are foreign, but not the \u201cother\u201d in the way that, for many Europeans and Americans, all Muslims are the \u201cother.\u201d Unlike Western leaders, Erdogan could (and did) at first treat the Syrian refugee crisis as a humanitarian issue, rather than a security one.Perhaps more remarkable was Erdogan\u2019s seeming disinclination, at least before last year, to regard anything as a security issue. Refugees came in from the south; jihadists hoping to fight against the Syrian government regularly flew into Istanbul\u2019s main airport. The borders were open. During those years I routinely asked Erdogan supporters whether they feared the jihadists flooding into Syria through Turkey. Were they afraid of ISIS? They usually shrugged and said Erdogan could handle them. No one in the world was stronger than Erdogan, they said, and he seemed to believe this, too.Little of this mattered in last November\u2019s election, won by Erdogan\u2019s party for the fourth time; at the time of the attempted coup, some suggested his support was decreasing, but the fury in the streets that night indicated otherwise. His effect on the populace is sometimes called a cult of personality, but his popularity was originally built on competence. I recently met a man in his 40s, no fan of Erdogan, who recalled that in Istanbul in the 1980s they had water only a few times a week. \u201cAnd you know what changed that?\u201d he said with a sigh. It was when Erdogan became mayor of the city in 1994.For Erdogan\u2019s supporters, a force field surrounds him, powered by megaprojects, Islamic identity, prosperity and honor. The logical progression for the man who brought water to the largest city in the country would be more and better services, bridges and airports. Erdogan himself is an expansionist power, of sorts, and his actions have been reminiscent of what any aspiring imperial power often does when it requires more land, more resources and more proof of its own achievements: It goes to war.\u201cWe are a Muslim country,\u201d a Karagumruk butcher told me. \u201cSpiritually we are progressing, morally. The government stands with the Muslims who are being attacked unjustly. They defend our religious values. They stand with Muslims and Turks.\u201dStill, Erdogan consolidated his power, and to an alarming degree. Even before the attempted coup, he made a worrisome habit of jailing his enemies: journalists who claimed he supported Islamist rebels, academics for criticizing his Kurdish policy. Turkey\u2019s European neighbors and American allies didn\u2019t seem to care. Erdogan had a powerful bargaining chip with which to scare the West: millions of Arab refugees. The West promised Erdogan three billion euros to keep them there. Over time, though, it became much harder to go to Turkey if you were Syrian. At the border, some were even shot by Turkish soldiers. In arguing that Europe should not be closing its doors, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders have declared Turkey an unsafe country for refugees, which means, as a legal definition, that they require protection.Inside the Golden Scissors barbershop, though, they were still extolling another kind of protection, that of the Ottomans. \u201cWe Turks, the children of the Ottomans, we welcome the world,\u201d Murat said in late June. \u201cWe protect foreigners. It\u2019s not just Muslims, foreigners included. And we listen to Tayyip Erdogan. We obey Tayyip Erdogan. He said everyone must look after at least one Syrian. According to the votes he received, 52 percent obey him like that,\u201d he said, referring to the results of Erdogan\u2019s last election.The man getting his haircut turned around, excitedly, trying to get my attention. His name was Sahin. \u201cI am 30 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three daughters. The reason I have three daughters? Re-cep. Tay-yip. Er-do-gan.\u201d For years Erdogan had been advising Turks to have three, or maybe five, children.\u201cI\u2019m 40!\u201d Murat said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m about to have my fourth child. Four.\u201d I asked if Erdogan was the reason. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said.\u201cThe president said we have to increase the Muslim population,\u201d Sahin said.\u201cWe believe one Turk is worth the world,\u201d Murat said, quoting a well-known slogan. \u201cTurkish Muslims think this way. We don\u2019t abandon our homeland. This is the love for our country. ... This came upon the Syrians because they abandoned Islam. Because they became European.\u201d (He added that foreign powers were also to blame for Syria\u2019s plight.)I asked, \u201cDo you mean you would fight for your homeland or you would fight for Erdogan?\u201d\u201cGreat question! Amazing question!\u201d Sahin said. \u201cLook, I grew up in Tayyip\u2019s generation. I would fight for Tayyip.\u201dMurat said: \u201cMuslims are Turks. It doesn\u2019t matter. We are of the Ummah. Kurds too. We\u2019re talking about the Ottoman state here. We fight for Islam.\u201d I could see why the Syrians might fit more easily into this worldview than that of others.Everyone in Karagumruk was nostalgic. Ismail Altintoprak, the muhtar, and many men like him longed for the European cosmopolitanism of an earlier Istanbul. Those in the barbershop saw the Ottoman Empire as the true manifestation of Muslim brotherhood. The one group held onto Ataturk\u2019s secular vision; the other celebrated Erdogan\u2019s Islamic one. But the two did seem to agree on what they rejected: this roiling, bizarre, terrifying modern mess of the present day.During one visit, he was upset about how on the state-sponsored channel, TRT, a professor of religion had said that those who didn\u2019t pray during Ramadan were animals, which created a stir.\u201cThe people these days have spider brains!\u201d Altintoprak said. On the wall, above his head, hung a plastic mold of the face of Ataturk. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t pray are animals? Yeah, your heart is rotten. Real Muslims don\u2019t speak this way.\u201dTwo young Arab men in pink shirts, hightops and trendy flat-visor baseball hats walked in together, asking for directions. The muhtar looked at the paper. \u201cFrom here, turn right, then left, then right again on the second street.\u201dI asked them where they were from. In Turkish, they said Syria and Morocco and winked at me. \u201cWere they refugees?\u201d I asked Altintoprak when they left. \u201cYes, refugees,\u201d he said smiling. It was very likely that everywhere in Turkey, the administrative tasks of a refugee crisis of several million people were falling to people like him.The rooster walked into the office and crowed. The muhtar brought up again how much he missed the time of the Greeks. \u201cLook at this bazaar we have,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past there were Arabs from Siirt,\u201d a city in Turkey, \u201cthey sold watermelon and fruit. There were Albanians, they sold grapes and curly lettuce and onions.\u201d\u201cThey sold fish too,\u201d his friend said.\u201cThey weren\u2019t fish sellers, they were vegetable sellers,\u201d Altintoprak said. \u201cThe Tatar sold rice. Then the Kurds came. Now you can\u2019t find an Albanian selling cucumbers or onions anywhere. The people from Nevsehir were here, they sold potatoes. They also left. The Kurds came. They sell shoes, they sell pickles, they sell peppers. Look, over there is a lemon seller, he sells lemons. A Syrian helps him. If the lemon seller, a Kurd, goes to the mosque, the Syrian watches his stand. Pretty soon the whole bazaar, you know what will happen. It will be Syrian.\u201dThe last time I saw the muhtar, he spent 15 minutes helping someone find the office of social services. He was Syrian, too.For a full century, the Turks had been arguing over what it meant to be a Turk. The intensity of this debate divided the secular from the religious, led to war between the Turks and the Kurds. Would the new Arab Turkish citizens be Arabs or would they be Turks? Would the Arabs fit into Erdogan\u2019s version of the imagined community? Would the Kurds? Would the West continue to watch as Erdogan used three million vulnerable people as moral credit to do what he wanted \u2014 subdue the Kurds, jail the dissenters, replace a parliamentary system with a presidential one? In one sense, little has changed since World War I. Peace doesn\u2019t come without violence, one population is not saved without sacrificing another and the peoples of the Middle East remain something with which the West can barter, in pursuit of the grand old imperial illusion of prosperity and order, however impossible that seems right now to attain.The illusion, however, is a beautiful one. In Karagumruk, on bazaar day, one day a week, the hawkers set up wooden tables and stack pyramids of unmarred oranges, sea bass flayed red at the gills, olives from five cities glistening in bins. The Syrian girls shopping with their mothers wear head scarves in white. The strawberry guys are Kurdish, the pepper guys are Turkish, the white-cheese guys are from Turkey\u2019s far east. As they work, Istanbul\u2019s light glows around their faces like a spectral caress. Nearby, inside the little white playhouse, the muhtar is dreaming of Constantinople, still giving directions to anyone who asks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doping Watchdog Answers Questions From United States Senate", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe global regulator of doping in sports, responding to questions about why it did not respond more aggressively to whistle-blowers\u2019 accusations of a government-run doping program in Russia, has told United States lawmakers that it did not have the authority to investigate such claims.The antidoping agency insisted that competing interests within the organization had not contributed to what senators called a yearslong delay in investigating Russian sports.The agency repeated its explanation for not taking action for at least four years, after multiple whistle-blowers from within Russia had contacted the agency and offered to cooperate. Two of them turned to the news media to make their story public before WADA initiated an independent inquiry in 2015.\u201cThere was no clear authority vested in us to undertake investigations,\u201d Craig Reedie, WADA\u2019s president, wrote in the five-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Reedie told The Times last month that he saw the agency as a passive coordinator of national antidoping efforts rather than an active policing authority. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn to people and say, \u2018These are the rules; obey them,\u2019\u201d he said.In its reply, WADA referred to a single initial whistle-blower, Vitaly Stepanov, who lived in Moscow and whom the agency wanted to protect. \u201cThe initial data, which can be revealed by the exchange of emails, was from one individual,\u201d Mr. Reedie wrote.The agency \u2014 which is partly funded by United States taxpayers \u2014 replied on July 5 to questions that Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, had posed on behalf of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.Mr. Stepanov, an employee of Russia\u2019s antidoping agency at the time, provided WADA with his own perspective and that of his wife, Yuliya Stepanova, a Russian runner who said she had taken performance-enhancing drugs at the direction of sports officials.\u201cTo forward any information that had been provided by him to the Russian authorities, as WADA would have done in other circumstances, would have been a grave lack of judgment on our behalf,\u201d the WADA letter said.In late 2012, WADA received an appeal from a Russian Olympic medalist, Darya Pishchalnikova, who confessed to cheating, pleaded for help and offered to cooperate with the agency. The agency forwarded Ms. Pishchalnikova\u2019s email to Russian sports officials \u2014 the very people she said were running a doping program.Mr. Reedie acknowledged to Mr. Thune that WADA needed to improve its processes going forward. \u201cWADA is in the process of developing a whistle-blower policy to clarify what it can and cannot do,\u201d he wrote. He said the agency planned to approve such a policy at a November board meeting.WADA, which is headquartered in Montreal but legally incorporated in Switzerland, has also said in recent weeks that it plans to bolster the agency\u2019s investigative capabilities. Last month, it hired a director of intelligence and investigations, G\u00fcnter Younger, who formerly led the cybercrime unit in a division of the German criminal police.Mr. Reedie himself has come under scrutiny for his dual leadership roles in WADA and the International Olympic Committee, of which he is a vice president.Mr. Thune raised concerns about the conflicts of interest such overlapping positions presented, with Olympics officials possibly less inclined to root out drug violations that could tarnish the Olympic brand and affect revenue streams.Responding to Mr. Thune\u2019s specific questions, Mr. Reedie said top WADA officials had signed a conflict of interest policy, and he pointed to the fact that he was not the first I.O.C. executive to act as head of WADA; the antidoping agency\u2019s first and longest-serving president, Richard W. Pound, had the same ties.\u201cAt no time during his presidency was there any suggestion that he had a conflict of interest, perceived or real,\u201d Mr. Reedie wrote.Mr. Reedie also expressed appreciation for the more than $25 million the United States had contributed to WADA over the last 14 years. \u201cThe agency has been very grateful for the support given to us by the United States,\u201d Mr. Reedie said.WADA is jointly financed by sports organizations and national governments. After the I.O.C., the United States government is the largest single contributor to WADA.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert B. Morgan, Senator Undone by His Panama Canal Votes, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byRobert B. Morgan, a former United States senator from North Carolina whose votes for treaties to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama in 1978 cost him his seat after only one term, died on Saturday at his home in Buies Creek, N.C. He was 90.His death was confirmed by Carroll Leggett, his former chief of staff.Mr. Morgan was a moderate Democrat whose Senate voting record was ranked higher by the American Conservative Union than by the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. But his votes on the Panama Canal were his undoing. As he sought re-election in 1980, his Republican challenger, John P. East, attacked him on the issue throughout the campaign, largely through television commercials.Mr. East\u2019s campaign was run by allies of Senator Jesse Helms, the state\u2019s senior Republican and an intense foe of giving up the canal, and the attacks were sometimes personal. In one ad, Mr. Helms questioned Mr. Morgan\u2019s Christian faith.Mr. East\u2019s victory, by only 10,401 votes out of more than 900,000 cast, was one of at least five Senate elections that turned on the issue of the Panama Canal and helped give President Ronald Reagan the first Republican majority in the Senate since 1955 as he entered office, having turned back Jimmy Carter\u2019s bid for re-election. The Republican votes in the Senate were a critical element in Mr. Reagan\u2019s legislative successes.One treaty gave the canal to Panama through a series of steps concluding in 1999. The other asserted that the canal would remain neutral in perpetuity and authorized the United States to intervene if that neutrality was threatened \u2014 a provision to calm fears of a takeover by China or some other hostile power.By the time they came to votes in March and April 1978, Mr. Morgan had no doubt that the treaties would be unpopular in his state. He said he had received 60,000 pieces of mail about the canal, only 3,000 backing the treaties. But he did not expect the issue to defeat him.The treaties passed, 68 to 32, only one vote more than the two-thirds required for the Senate to approve treaties.In an interview for this obituary in 2010, Mr. Morgan said he was sure his decision to back the treaties was the correct one. \u201cI think if I had not done it, there wouldn\u2019t be a Panama Canal,\u201d he said.Robert Burren Morgan was born on Oct. 5, 1925, in Lillington, N.C., where he lived all his life. He was drafted into the wartime Navy in 1944 during his sophomore year at East Carolina Teachers College in Greenville, N.C., now East Carolina University. He was recalled to duty in the Korean War and saw combat as an officer on the aircraft carrier Valley Forge.On leaving the Navy, he practiced law and served in the State Senate for 14 years before being elected state attorney general, a post he held from 1969 to 1974.As attorney general, he took a strong role in furthering consumer protections, creating a law enforcement training academy and expanding the State Bureau of Investigations. After he left the United States Senate, he headed the investigations bureau from 1985 to 1992.He also led the North Carolina Center for Voter Education, which campaigned for public financing in the election of appellate judges. When the proposal became law in 2002, Mr. Morgan said that \u201cjudges will no longer be forced to raise money like politicians\u201d and praised the legislature for acting \u201cto make sure that money and politics have no place in a court of law.\u201dBefore the Panama Canal issue, the most controversial aspect of Mr. Morgan\u2019s career was his role as campaign manager for I. Beverly Lake, who ran for governor of North Carolina in 1960 as the most segregationist candidate in a field of candidates who all opposed school integration \u2014 as anyone who wanted to be elected did then, when very few blacks voted.\u201cAt that time,\u201d Mr. Morgan said in 2010, \u201cnobody was integrating.\u201dHe said he had taken the position of campaign manager because Mr. Lake, a professor, had been a beloved mentor in law school.Mr. Morgan is survived by his wife, the former Katie Earle Owen, whom he married in 1960; two daughters, Margaret Morgan Holmes and Mary Morgan; a foster son, Rupert C. Tart Jr.; and five grandchildren.Some of the personal attacks of the 1980 campaign rankled him, especially the role of Mr. Helms, whom Mr. Morgan had not campaigned against in 1978 during Mr. Helms\u2019s own re-election run. Mr. Helms said in a television commercial that the election of Mr. East, a Methodist, was necessary so that the state would be represented by \u201ca real Christian.\u201dIn the spring of 1978, Mr. Morgan, an active Baptist, had urged his coreligionists to remain true to their commitment to separation of church and state and not to invoke religion \u201con matters on which reasonable men may differ.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.O.P.\u2019s Moneyed Class Finds Its Place in New Trump World", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byThough Mr. Trump promises to topple Washington\u2019s \u201crigged system,\u201d the opening rounds of his party\u2019s quadrennial meeting accentuated a more enduring maxim: Money always adapts to power.At a downtown barbecue joint, lobbyists cheerfully passed out stickers reading \u201cMake Lobbying Great Again\u201d as they schmoozed on Monday with Republican ambassadors, lawmakers and executives. At a windowless bar tucked behind the Ritz-Carlton hotel, whose rooms were set aside for the party\u2019s most generous benefactors, allies of Mr. Trump pitched a clutch of receptive party donors on contributing to a pro-Trump \u201csuper PAC.\u201d\u201cIt is the business of Washington,\u201d said Michael J. Anderson, a Democratic lobbyist who represents American Indian tribes, after watching Mr. Gingrich speak. \u201cMr. Trump is talking about changing the paradigm. It\u2019s not changing one bit. The political and influence class is going on as before.\u201dIn Cleveland, even some of those who had worked against Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy now saw opportunity.In dozens of private receptions, behind a scrim of barricades and police officers, they inspected their party\u2019s new Trump faction with curiosity and hope. There were spheres of influence to carve out. There was money to raise and money to be made, whether or not Mr. Trump ended up in the White House. There were new friends to make and old relationships to nurture.And so, far above the din of protesters and delegates, on the 49th floor of the Key Tower, Squire Patton Boggs, a lobbying and legal powerhouse, held packed receptions honoring Ohio and Florida officials. Not far away, Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor turned consultant for pharmaceutical companies and health insurers, was slated to lead a panel on policies to spur the development of prescription drugs. As Speaker Paul D. Ryan helped tamp down anti-Trump efforts on the convention floor, his political operation ran a daily series of receptions and hospitality lounges for members of the \u201cSpeaker\u2019s Council,\u201d the top donors to House Republicans.\u201cYou have these two worlds colliding a little bit here,\u201d said David Tamasi, a lobbyist at the firm Rasky Baerlein and a top Republican fund-raiser on K Street, who joined Mr. Trump\u2019s team after his preferred candidate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, went down to defeat. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to be interesting: How do the establishment guys make those folks feel at home?\u201dThey are doing so, in part, by footing the bill.While some of the party\u2019s elite donors have shunned Mr. Trump\u2019s coronation this week, they are still paying for it. Roughly 500 wealthy Republicans poured close to $16 million into the Republican National Committee\u2019s convention account leading up to this week, according to disclosures made to the Federal Election Commission through last Friday. The biggest donors, giving more than $100,000 each, are also a veritable roll call of the stop-Trump movement, among them the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer and Marlene Ricketts, who bankrolled early efforts to deny Mr. Trump the nomination.Mr. Singer did not attend, though his political advisers made the rounds in Cleveland, as did representatives for other megadonors who remain opposed to Mr. Trump. And there were growing signs that at least some of the party\u2019s biggest givers were warming to him: Co-hosts of Monday\u2019s super PAC reception at the Ritz-Carlton included Harold Hamm, a billionaire oil tycoon and former energy adviser to Mitt Romney, and Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota television station owner and prominent donor.Among the guests was Foster Friess, the Wyoming-based mutual fund investor and super PAC donor, who expressed optimism at his party\u2019s prospects. \u201cI think it could be a landslide,\u201d Mr. Friess said in an interview. \u201cDonald Trump has the ability to reach all the plumbers and carpenters and factory workers who usually vote Democratic.\u201dMr. Trump, of course, remains unpopular among many Republican donors, and it is unclear how many will ultimately open their wallets to help fund his campaign. Some events were more sparsely attended than they would have been four years ago, Republicans said. It was a little easier to get tickets to concerts in Cleveland, a little easier to get bumped up to the premium hotel rooms.And there is no question that Mr. Trump\u2019s blasts against unfettered trade and Wall Street banks have unsettled powerful business interests \u2014 and are now, to some extent, reflected in the party\u2019s own DNA. In recent days, Trump activists have helped install new planks in the party platform calling for tougher trade negotiations and for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that walled commercial banking off from investment banking.Yet those same power brokers won a more consequential victory even before the convention started, when Mr. Trump\u2019s team helped them quash a rule proposed by some conservative delegates that would have banned lobbyists from serving as Republican National Committee members. The proposal by supporters of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas pitted Tea Party conservatives against the party\u2019s business wing; the conservative delegates were soundly defeated.\u201cIt is disappointing,\u201d said Mary Anne Kinney, a New Hampshire state representative and Cruz delegate, who was among those who pushed for the ban. \u201cSome of us had heard things that maybe Donald Trump was not a fan of the lobbyists. They are not always for the interest of the people.\u201dIn fact, many of them are for the interests of Mr. Trump, at least this week. Among the floor whips prowling the convention floor in Cleveland in neon yellow baseball caps, managing and corralling delegates, were a number of volunteers from Washington government affairs firms or Capitol Hill. Many had supported other candidates during the primary. Now they were working for their party\u2019s nominee.One of them was Robert Hoffman, a Republican lobbyist at Heather Podesta and Partners. Earlier in the week, the firm hosted a barbecue brunch for friends and delegates, where Mr. Hoffman and his colleagues handed out \u201cMake Lobbying Great Again\u201d stickers.Mr. Hoffman seemed to see Mr. Trump\u2019s policy agenda more in terms of possibilities than threats. The convention, he noted, was a chance to learn more about Mr. Trump\u2019s still-vague plans, and perhaps to help shape them.\u201cWe want to be a sounding board,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cNot just for our clients, but for our campaign.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s about access and whose phone calls get answered.\u201dFor many Clinton donors, particularly those from the financial sector, the convention is a time to shed what one called the \u201chypersensitivity\u201d that had previously surrounded their appearance at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fund-raisers or at her political events, during a period when Mr. Sanders repeatedly attacked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s connections to Wall Street and her six-figure speaking fees from financial institutions.\u201cI think we\u2019re past that,\u201d said Alan Patricof, a longtime donor to Mrs. Clinton, when asked about the need to lie low during the primaries.In Philadelphia, donors were handed preferred suites at the Ritz-Carlton and \u201cFriends and Family\u201d packages created for longtime Clinton hands \u2014 some of them also longtime benefactors. Some were granted time backstage or in the Clinton family box with former President Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton. Blackstone, the private equity giant, scheduled a reception at the Barnes Foundation on Thursday with its president, Hamilton E. James, one of the leading Wall Street contenders for an economic policy post in a future Clinton administration.The railway giant CSX brought in old railroad cars for a reception led by Rodney E. Slater, the former United States transportation secretary turned lobbyist, who also headlined a panel on transportation policy in a future Clinton administration. At the Loews Hotel bar on Tuesday night, old Clinton hands, some now working as lobbyists, caught up with Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime family friend and one of the party\u2019s most prolific fund-raisers.At a private luncheon on Wednesday at El Vez, a Mexican restaurant, over a dozen Democratic governors mingled with representatives from a host of labor unions and companies, among them the Apollo Education Group, an operator of for-profit colleges that has faced a series of state and federal investigations into allegations of shady recruiting, deceptive advertising and questionable financial aid practices.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s business as usual,\u201d said Libby Watson, who monitored lobbying events in Philadelphia on behalf of the Sunlight Foundation, a group devoted to government transparency.The biggest players gathered at the Ritz-Carlton, where a line of sport utility vehicles and limousines deposited waves of men in suits but no ties and elegantly dressed women bearing expensive handbags.At first-come-first-served seats near the bar, assistants huddled around lengthy spreadsheets, figuring out which donors were entitled to which passes to which events. Outside, a protester walked with a sign denouncing big money. Inside, two stocky men could be heard debating the merits of the different ambassadorships they hoped to earn under Mrs. Clinton. Even a low-ranking posting meant having \u201cambassador\u201d on a child\u2019s wedding invitation, the two agreed, and would be helpful in wrangling invitations to sit on corporate boards.Occasionally, as bellhops leapt to open the lobby doors for another guest, the chants of protesters outside could be dimly heard.John Graham, a New Jersey insurance executive and Clinton backer, said that after seeing the demonstrators outside the hotel, he had taken his daughter for a walk to meet some of them.\u201cIt\u2019s a little awkward, because guys like me are in here,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cAnd we need to do something for the young people who are out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Personal Sort of Time Travel: Ancestry Tourism", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byRetiringIN April, Sheila Albert, 78, a retired psychotherapist from Santa Rosa, Calif., and her niece, Terry Pew, who is 60, found themselves standing in front of the ruins of a stone house in Ireland where Ms. Albert believes her great-great-grandmother once lived.\u201cI felt like I came home,\u201d she said.Ms. Albert, whose ancestors emigrated to the United States during the potato famine of the late 1840s, found the house with the help of a genealogy and touring company called My Ireland Family Heritage, which arranged a two-day tour. It was not the first time the two women had pursued their roots: In 2014, they took a weeklong car trip through Minnesota and Wisconsin, where they toured cemeteries researching their family tree.America is a nation of immigrants, and as many people age they grow interested in tracing their family heritage and group traditions back to their origins.\u201cAncestral travel is a way of connecting oneself with their progenitors and finding one\u2019s rootedness in a confusing and fast-paced world,\u201d Dallen J. Timothy, a professor at Arizona State University and editor of The Journal of Heritage Tourism, wrote in an email. The sentiment crosses many ethnic groups.The motivations of those who make these trips vary, as does what they find. Travelers usually combine such trips with other forms of sightseeing, but along the way they may gain a greater appreciation of the obstacles their ancestors faced and a deeper sense of who they are and where they come from.For some, long-ago stories propel wanderlust. Growing up, Maryann Rosenbaum, 67, a retired schoolteacher in the Chicago area, heard stories from her grandmother about a house next to a pond where her mother was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia.She found that house on Richardson Avenue 20 years ago by following her grandmother\u2019s description. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a detective,\u201d Ms. Rosenbaum said.More recently she received a trove of letters and photos from a distant relative that reignited her curiosity about her maternal grandfather, who emigrated from Scotland to Nova Scotia and then to the United States. Last September she and her husband, Frank, booked a 10-day trip.They toured Edinburgh, Inveraray Castle and the Isle of Skye, but she was particularly set on visiting Bellshill, an industrial area about 10 miles southeast of Glasgow where her grandfather lived. (It was a mining center until the early 1950s.)\u201cThe tour guide was afraid I was setting myself up for disappointment,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t. She drew similarities between Bellshill, Sydney and Gary, Ind., where the family eventually settled in the early 1920s.Ms. Rosenbaum knew from the letters that her grandfather, a stonemason, played lawn bowling competitively and donated property to the town for that use. The bowling green is no longer there, but Bowling Green Street is. Her grandfather became a superintendent in steel mills, she said.\u201cTravel experiences can show how a family developed, what family traits were dependent on location, why a family chose to migrate and how they made a choice of occupation,\u201d said George G. Morgan, the author of \u201cHow to Do Everything: Genealogy\u201d (McGraw Hill 2015).But not every ancestry tourist is going to find the proverbial Rosetta Stone, he cautioned. They also need to set expectations for what they want to see and to ask a guide, \u201cWhat will you be able to deliver?\u201dCarl Tiedt, 74, is a retired manufacturer from Springfield, Mo., and Civil War hobbyist. He has German ancestry and began searching genealogy sites over two decades ago, looking for relatives who fought in that war. Research on Ancestry.com and other sites turned up three great-uncles who were Union soldiers.Still, \u201cnobody ever recorded where the family lived before they emigrated and why they came,\u201d he said. His parents never taught him German, saying only, \u201cWe had a hard time in America until we learned English.\u201dTwo years ago he visited Germany with his wife, Barbara. His tour company, European Focus, recommended a genealogist who found the house where his great-grandparents lived in Bergen, Lower Saxony. The record of its property transfer indicates they may have sold the house to finance passage to the United States. Mr. Tiedt still doesn\u2019t know why they left.\u201cIn genealogy you never know what you are going to find or if you are going to find what you hoped to find,\u201d said Jeanne L. Bloom, president of the Board for Certification of Genealogists, a Washington-based organization that was not involved in planning Mr. Tiedt\u2019s trip. \u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee results.\u201dHe also met a fifth cousin once removed on his mother\u2019s side, Ida M\u00fcller, now 79, along with her two sons, who are in their 50s. They spent the day together and toured the family winery. Mr. Tiedt saw the church where his grandmother was baptized. He hopes the younger cousins and their children will visit the United States next year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose this connection,\u201d he said.Mr. Tiedt estimates the trip cost about $15,000 for two, including transportation, meals and lodging. He spent an additional $1,500 for a genealogist to complete about 40 hours of research. Ms. Albert said her two-day escorted excursion was $3,000 for her and her niece.Hiring a professional genealogist can be expensive; many searches start online. MyHeritage.com, an Israeli company with offices in Utah, said five years ago that it had 4.6 million baby boomers out of 58 million users. This year that total reached to 9.6 million baby boomers out of 84 million users. A basic package is free; a complete annual package is $175.Genealogy popularity may swell further. In 2012, Global Industry Analysts, a market research company in San Jose, Calif., estimated the global market for genealogical products and services at $2.3 billion in 2014, rising to $4.3 billion by 2018.A May trip to Germany for Audrey Goodman, 67, of Bergen County, N.J., began unexpectedly with a message about some books, left last fall on her husband\u2019s blog.The message was from Antje Strahl, a historian at the University of Rostock who oversees restitution of books that were confiscated by the Nazis and later became part of the university\u2019s library collection.The books bore the name Malzer, the maiden name of Ms. Goodman\u2019s late mother, who left Germany in 1937 at age 20 as a Jewish refugee, living first in England before coming to the United States.Dr. Strahl invited Ms. Goodman to Germany to receive the books in a formal ceremony. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to go,\u201d said Ms. Goodman, who grew up hearing \u201cWe don\u2019t travel to Germany.\u201d Still she felt the journey would close a chapter.At the restitution ceremony, attended by members of the university community, Ms. Goodman accompanied by her husband, Michael, and daughter, Amanda, spoke about her family\u2019s escape from the Nazis and influences she remembered from growing up in Washington Heights in Manhattan, including recollections about German food delicacies.Afterward the family traveled 375 miles south by car to Bad K\u00f6nigshofen, a farming community where her grandparents once owned a grain distribution business. The pastoral atmosphere was a surprise, but again, it had never been discussed. Her son, Brett, joined them there.Through a tour guide, the family gained access to the apartment overlooking the main square where Ms. Goodman\u2019s \u201cmother and her parents sat so many years ago,\u201d she said. The family toured the town and nearby cemetery to learn about the former Jewish community. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have it behind me, \u201c she said of the experience.Ms. Albert, the retired psychotherapist, wants to return to Ireland and is now delving into books like \u201cThe Graves are Walking\u201d by John Kelly and \u201cThe Princes of Ireland\u201d by Edward Rutherfurd. \u201cThese are the stories of my ancestors,\u201d she said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred imprecisely to the owner of some books confiscated by the Nazis. They were taken from the family of Ms. Goodman\u2019s late mother, not necessarily from her mother personally. An earlier version of another caption misidentified whose former home Mr. Tiedt is standing in front of. It is the former home of his great-grandparents, not his grandparents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robert Fano, 98, Dies; Engineer Who Helped Develop Interactive Computers", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byRobert Fano, an electrical engineer who was instrumental in creating a world of instantly responsive computers, died on July 13 in Naples, Fla. He was 98.His daughter Paola Nisonger confirmed his death.As a pioneering computer designer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Fano made fundamental theoretical advances, both in the ways computers handled information and in the design of interactive software that made it possible for the machines to support many simultaneous users.Building on the idea of shared computing proposed in 1961 by John McCarthy, an artificial intelligence researcher, Dr. Fano collaborated with another electrical engineer, Fernando J. Corbato, to develop the first time-sharing computer operating system, known as Compatible Time-Sharing System, or CTSS, to run on an IBM computer.Before the advent of time-sharing, computers were largely walled off from users in glass rooms. Programs were run sequentially, submitted in decks of punched cards. Users then returned later \u2014 often one or two days \u2014 to receive the output as printouts.The system was notoriously frustrating, Dr. Fano recalled in a 1985 lecture: \u201cIf you misplaced a comma in any program, well, those two days were gone!\u201dCTSS marked a fundamental shift leading to a more interactive computing world in which users worked at individual terminals. It also soon led to Project MAC, an M.I.T. computation center for which Dr. Fano was the founding director in 1963. It ushered in a world where computing influenced a wide range of new ideas, ultimately including personal computing.Dr. Fano recalled picking up the challenge because no one else stepped forward.\u201cAt a certain point, I decided if nobody was ready to get the ball rolling, I was going to do it, although my experience with computers was close to nil,\u201d he said in an interview with the filmmaker Errol Morris.He said the project also helped establish the field of computer science apart from electrical engineering.\u201cThe whole concept of Multics was going to be something that revolutionized the way people used computers in a way that was humanistic and friendly,\u201d said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist who was then a Bell Labs researcher who participated in the project.Project MAC was also significant in training a generation of technologists who would spread ideas far beyond the insular community of hackers who built the original system.Two of the early Project MAC designers were Daniel Bricklin and Robert Frankston, M.I.T. students who went on to develop the Visicalc spreadsheet program, which was instrumental in bringing personal computing to the business world.Mr. Frankston recalled that Dr. Fano was interested in the social aspect of computing. \u201cThe Multics project was about interactive computing, which kept people involved,\u201d he said. \u201cContrast that with Google\u2019s goal of a driverless car with people reduced to being passengers.\u201dComputing was one of several fields Dr. Fano pursued. His interest in information theory was piqued one day in 1948 as a young professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T., when Norbert Wiener, a mathematician who coined the term cybernetics, poked his head into Dr. Fano\u2019s office and said cryptically: \u201cYou know, information is entropy.\u201dRobert Mario Fano was born in Turin, Italy, on Nov. 11, 1917. He was a student at the School of Engineering of Torino in 1939 when his family was forced to move to the United States in the face of Mussolini\u2019s anti-Jewish legislation.After getting his undergraduate degree at M.I.T., he worked briefly at General Motors, supervising operators of welding machines, but he quickly returned to graduate studies at M.I.T. During World War II, he joined the Radiation Laboratory there and was involved in the development of microwave radar. He spent a decade in information theory before turning his attention to computing.Besides his daughter Paola, Dr. Fano is survived by two other daughters, Linda Ryan and Carol Fano, and five grandchildren.An obituary on Thursday about Robert Fano, an electrical engineer who was instrumental in creating a world of instantly responsive computers, misspelled the surname of the mathematician who coined the term cybernetics. He is Norbert Wiener, not Weiner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "UnitedHealthcare Sues Dialysis Chain Over Billing", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byPrivate health insurers can pay more than $4,000 for each dialysis treatment. Government health plans like Medicaid pay around $200.That gaping price difference was the motivation for a scheme, orchestrated by a for-profit dialysis chain, that illegally pushed poor people in Florida and Ohio out of inexpensive government programs and into expensive private plans sold by UnitedHealthcare, according to a lawsuit the giant insurer filed in federal court on Friday. UnitedHealthcare says the arrangement needlessly exposed the patients to medical bills.The suit accuses American Renal Associates, a public company that operates nearly 200 dialysis clinics across the country, of fraudulently billing millions of dollars since the beginning of the year. UnitedHealthcare is trying to recoup that money.The insurer argues that the effort was aided by the American Kidney Fund, a nonprofit patient advocacy group, which paid the patients\u2019 premiums for private insurance. The insurer said American Renal Associates \u201cearmarked donations\u201d to the kidney fund to pay for the coverage, violating anti-kickback laws in the process. The lawsuit also says that the company\u2019s patients were not told that the kidney fund would stop paying their premiums if they received a kidney transplant.The kidney fund, which is not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, is overwhelmingly financed by dialysis companies.American Renal Associates said on Friday that the lawsuit was without merit and that the company would vigorously defend itself. \u201cAt all times, we are dedicated to putting patients first, and we structure all of our relationships within that framework,\u201d Michael R. Costa, vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.The American Kidney Fund declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, but said it was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the allegations of what it described as \u201cimproper use\u201d of its program by a dialysis provider.The company says it keeps contributions from providers separate from decisions about whether to offer assistance to patients, an arrangement that it said was \u201caffirmed\u201d by the federal government in 1997.In a statement, its chief executive, LaVarne A. Burton, said that the group did not recommend particular facilities or insurers and that nearly two-thirds of the 79,000 patients receiving assistance from the fund were on Medicare. The assistance the fund provides, she said, \u201cis a lifeline for people who depend on dialysis for their survival.\u201dThe suit, filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, touches on an issue regulators have focused on in recent years: the role of third parties paying for insurance.Federal and state regulators have expressed concern about payments made by outside groups that are closely tied to industry, where the goal appears to be less about helping patients than about generating profits.This week, the top insurance regulator in Idaho said insurers could refuse payments from organizations like the American Kidney Fund. Minnesota made a similar decision in June.\u201cThere are third parties out there just trying to help people,\u201d said Dean L. Cameron, director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, citing religious organizations as an example. But the practice becomes problematic when the funding is tied to the doctor or the facility providing care, he said. \u201cThose kinds of arrangements concern us.\u201dThe dialysis industry has come under scrutiny from federal regulators in recent years for a variety of actions, including overbilling Medicare.Many dialysis centers say they lose money because the government programs pay them so little. People who need dialysis and have end-stage renal disease are eligible for Medicare coverage, even if they are under 65. If they are poor, they may also qualify for Medicaid, which covers nearly all out-of-pocket costs. Patients may be enrolled simultaneously in both programs.At the same time, UnitedHealthcare has a keen financial interest in keeping very ill patients, like those who need dialysis, out of its private plans. Under the federal health care law, insurers must cover everyone, no matter how sick they are.Dialysis removes toxins from the blood when the kidneys do not work properly, and many patients need treatments three times a week for years.According to the lawsuit, American Renal Associates devised a clever plot aimed at converting patients over to private plans.The company identified poor patients in rural areas of Florida who did not have a nearby dialysis clinic in UnitedHealthcare\u2019s network, the suit says. The centers then persuaded these patients to switch to UnitedHealthcare plans, using the American Kidney Fund\u2019s program to pay their premiums.Finally, the centers billed UnitedHealthcare out-of-network prices of about $4,000 per dialysis treatment, compared with just $200 under Florida\u2019s Medicaid program, the suit said.Because the UnitedHealthcare plans required greater out-of-pocket contributions than Medicaid\u2019s coverage, the centers waived any part of the dialysis bill that was not paid by the insurer. UnitedHealthcare says patients remained responsible for bills from other doctors, which they would not have had to pay under Medicaid.Kidney transplants, rather than dialysis, are seen as the best options for most patients with end-stage renal disease, but the American Kidney Fund does not pay for premiums after patients receive a kidney transplant. Patients were not informed of that.Ms. Burton, the kidney fund chief executive, said the fund\u2019s work was focused on people who need dialysis and not on transplant patients.\u201cOur greatest hope is that the people we are assisting will receive transplants, but the reality is that most people with kidney failure have to spend time on dialysis,\u201d she said in the statement.A fast-growing player in the dialysis industry, American Renal Associates enters into partnerships with kidney specialists to run its clinics. A New York private equity firm, Centerbridge Partners, owned the company before it went public in April.In its public filings, the company acknowledges its dependence on treatments paid by private insurers. Those payments cover just 13 percent of the treatments the clinics provide, but account for 40 percent of the company\u2019s operating revenue.This reliance on privately insured patients is typical of the dialysis industry, said Eric R. Havian, who represented a whistle-blower in a 2014 case involving charges of kickbacks against DaVita HealthCare Partners, one of the industry\u2019s biggest players.Even if only a few people receive private insurance at a center, Mr. Havian said, \u201cthey may make enough profit on those two or three patients to wipe out all the losses they are incurring from the Medicaid patients, and make enormous profits on top of that.\u201dUnitedHealthcare said it had already paid about $2 million to American Renal Associates this year. It provided details about 27 patients in Florida and Ohio, but said there could be more.Insurers say that charities with ties to providers are a concern when they pay premiums only for people with a specific health condition, because doing so often raises overall prices.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen happening in the marketplace is some companies have been targeting people who use their services to enroll them in private coverage,\u201d said Alissa Fox, a senior vice president with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a trade group.Those industry ties expose the profit motive that underpins the programs, according to Patrick Burns, executive director of Taxpayers Against Fraud, a whistle-blower advocacy group.\u201cThere is a bottom line here, and the people who manage these programs are well aware of it, on both sides,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside China\u2019s Secret 23-Day Detention of a Foreign Nonprofit Chief", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byCHIANG MAI, Thailand \u2014 On the 10th day of Peter Dahlin\u2019s captivity in a secret Beijing jail, Chinese state security officers sprang one of their big surprises \u2014 something he found even more astonishing than hearing a colleague being beaten in a room above his cell.The internal report laid out how Mr. Dahlin\u2019s small organization had received financing from the nonprofit for the last five years, and it discussed his program in detail. It seemed to have been meant for circulation only among the nonprofit\u2019s top directors.\u201cI realized it must have come straight from N.E.D. itself somehow,\u201d Mr. Dahlin said in an interview, adding that he had never seen the document before.His ordeal, which he described for the first time in an interview with The New York Times, offers an unusually clear view into the suspicion directed toward foreign nongovernmental organizations by the Chinese security apparatus and the lengths to which it goes to police such groups.Mr. Dahlin\u2019s relatively obscure Chinese Urgent Action Working Group, which he helped found in 2009 to promote the development of an independent judiciary in China, is exactly the type of organization that Mr. Xi is trying to stifle.But Mr. Dahlin, 36, who had studied political science and worked in government in Sweden, agreed to an interview after concluding that his Chinese friends would not face retaliation.Mr. Dahlin said he and a Chinese lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, had established their organization in Hong Kong as a private business, because there were no regulations for registering foreign nongovernmental organizations in mainland China before the new law was adopted. They employed about 15 to 20 people, most of them part time and all of them local Chinese except for Mr. Dahlin and an American.The group quietly held seminars for lawyers and others interested in suing officials and agencies, and it offered crisis legal aid. It specialized in explaining China\u2019s freedom-of-information statutes and ran a training program for investigative journalists.Security officers had surveillance photographs of Chinese citizens arriving for a training session the group held last year in southern Thailand, Mr. Dahlin said.Mr. Dahlin was detained on Jan. 3, just hours before he planned to leave the country to renew his visa. More than a dozen officers showed up at his home in an alleyway in Beijing with warrants for him and his girlfriend, Pan Jinling, a Chinese citizen.A look at some men and women whose confessions of crimes were aired on Chinese state television in recent years.They seized computers, phones, hard drives, bank cards, receipts, a safe with about 175,000 renminbi, or $26,000, in cash, and medicine that Mr. Dahlin takes daily for a rare adrenal disease. They rushed him to an unmarked detention center \u2014 known as a black jail by many in China \u2014 near an airport. All the rooms were padded.Mr. Dahlin said he was questioned daily, usually in a single session lasting for hours at night, when he was tired. The interrogations took place in a separate room with a desk and glaring lights.The officers did not beat him, he said, but tried different tactics to pressure him.Early on, they tried to deprive him of sleep, keeping the fluorescent lights on in his cell at night. Mr. Dahlin told a woman running the center that this amounted to torture under international conventions, and the practice soon stopped.Mr. Dahlin said he had deduced that he, Ms. Pan and at least three colleagues were being held in the center but kept in isolation. At one point after the first week, Mr. Dahlin heard loud noises coming from a floor above. It sounded as if the officers were \u201croughing up someone quite badly,\u201d he said, adding that he was almost certain it was a colleague. That continued for a couple of days. (He later learned that the victim had indeed been a colleague.)Mr. Dahlin denied any role in those activities, and the officers eventually focused their questions on the workings of nongovernmental organizations in mainland China and Hong Kong, especially the relationship between international groups and those in China.They appeared intent on gathering information about groups financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, for example, even though the European Union had given more money to Mr. Dahlin\u2019s group, he said.The National Endowment for Democracy said in a statement that it had not determined the origins of the document shown to Mr. Dahlin nor how the Chinese authorities obtained a copy.The officers also mentioned or showed Mr. Dahlin the names of almost every lawyer in China who had worked with his group, as well as recent emails exchanged by the group\u2019s employees.Despite such access, the officers appeared to have a \u201climited understanding of how NGOs operate, how international funding operates, how you transfer funds, what\u2019s the project plan,\u201d Mr. Dahlin said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically trying to understand this field so they can counter it.\u201dAfter two weeks in custody, Mr. Dahlin said, he was told to sit in front of a camera and face a reporter for China Central Television, the state broadcaster. Both were ordered to read from a script.\u201cWhen I saw the questions and answers, it became even more clear that, O.K., this is part of a P.R. campaign. This is going to be on CCTV,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a star.\u201dThe script had seven or eight questions and answers. Mr. Dahlin said he had agreed to cooperate because the authorities already signaled they would deport him, and he wanted to expedite that process and get Ms. Pan released.In less than an hour, Mr. Dahlin said that his group had acted illegally and that he had stolen money. He also said he had \u201churt the feelings of the Chinese people.\u201d But he refused to label three associates as \u201ccriminals\u201d as the officers had demanded.CCTV broadcast the confession the night of Jan. 19. Two days later, Mr. Dahlin was told that he was being granted a medical parole and would be sent home. The police returned almost everything they had confiscated, except about $3,500 that they said they had used to kennel his cats and to buy him a one-way ticket to Stockholm.On Jan. 25, Mr. Dahlin was blindfolded and driven to the airport in a five-car convoy.In a reception hall there, an official read an order barring him from China for 10 years. Then the officers escorted him to the plane and a seat in first class. A flight attendant handed him a glass of Champagne.\u201cI think the era for effecting change in China seems to be over for now for NGOs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems for now that the scope of civil society to try to influence is getting smaller and smaller.\u201dJonah Kessel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lionel Shriver Imagines Imminent Economic Collapse, With Cabbage at $20 a Head", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Florence Darkly suffers from all the typical problems of the middle-class Brooklynite. With cabbage up to $20 a head, the grocery bill is a constant struggle. Owing to chronic water shortages, she and her teenage son can shower only once a week. Her morning ritual no longer includes coffee \u2014 climate change has ruined the arabica bean crop \u2014 or The New York Times, which has long since folded (\u201cGod rest its soul\u201d), along with every other newspaper. As a white woman in an America where Latinos are now the socially dominant ethnic group, she remembers her marginalization every time a robotic voice on the phone instructs her to press 1 for Spanish and 2 for English.But Florence is better off than most. She owns her own house in rapidly gentrifying East Flatbush. After years of being displaced at work by bots (now called robs, \u201cfor obvious reasons\u201d), she knows her job at a homeless shelter in Fort Greene is secure \u2014 \u201cthe one thing New York City was bound never to run out of was homeless people.\u201d She even has a safety net: the fortune amassed generations earlier by the family patriarch, Elliot Mandible, pieces of which trickle down in times of need.This future is only 13 years away, as Lionel Shriver depicts it in \u201cThe Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047,\u201d her searing exemplar of a disquieting new genre \u2014 call it dystopian finance fiction. When the novel opens, America is perched on the cusp of catastrophe, though no one knows it yet. The population is still reeling from the aftershocks of \u201cthe Stonage\u201d (an abridgment of Stone Age), the technology blackout in 2024 that brought the entire country to a halt, an event at least as traumatic for this generation as Sept. 11 was for their parents. China has already established itself as the world\u2019s superpower, a position cemented by its usurpation of the number 1 as its international calling code. (The move is largely symbolic: Phone calls have become so rare that the sound of a ringtone triggers the fear that someone must have died.) The European Union has already dissolved, with the euro replaced by local currencies like the \u201cnouveau franc.\u201d Then the United States defaults on its loans; Treasury bills are rendered worthless. Overnight, the dollar crashes, supplanted on the international market by the \u201cbancor,\u201d a currency controlled by the New IMF. The stock market follows suit, taking the Mandible family fortune with it.Most people assume the crisis is temporary, not unlike the economic downturn that coincided with Florence\u2019s college graduation \u2014 born in the mid-1980s, she\u2019s a millennial. But her son, Willing, watches the business news and has an uncanny sense of how all the pieces fit together. As one character puts it, \u201cComplex systems collapse catastrophically.\u201d Within a few years, Florence\u2019s family will have lost literally everything they once thought they owned.It\u2019s probably already obvious that Shriver isn\u2019t the kind of writer who lets her themes rise gently to the surface. She seizes them with an almost animalistic ferocity and interrogates them for all they\u2019re worth. Her smart, satirical fiction is old-fashioned in that it serves as a vehicle for investigating political and social questions, but it\u2019s also almost uncannily of its moment. A few years after the massacre at Columbine High, \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin,\u201d her breakthrough novel, examined the psychology of a mother whose son \u00adcommitted a school shooting. \u201cSo Much for That,\u201d which appeared just as the Affordable Care Act became law, chronicled the bankruptcy of a family whose health insurance is laughably inadequate to cover their bills for a devastating illness. More recently, \u201cBig Brother\u201d delved into the contradictions surrounding the popular perceptions of obesity and weight loss. Though these books are nominally about very different subjects, they pulse with the same undercurrent of rage at the hypocrisy of American mores and the dysfunction that plagues our broken social contract.Shriver has always seemed to be at least a few steps ahead of the rest of us, but her new novel establishes her firmly as the Cassandra of American letters. Like David Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d or Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cOryx and Crake,\u201d \u201cThe Mandibles\u201d depicts a world that is at once familiar and horribly altered. What\u2019s most disquieting isn\u2019t the disruption of daily life (though it\u2019s devastating) but the ease with which people adapt to their new circumstances. Shriver\u2019s dystopia is imagined as minutely as a pointillist image, with every detail adding another dot to the overall picture. The devolution of civilized society happens slowly at first, then all at once. The niceties of life gradually disappear: citrus fruit, olive oil, toilet paper. Streets are no longer cleaned; once-upscale storefronts are boarded shut; even Zabar\u2019s is vandalized and looted. Florence stops ironing to save electricity and wears a bandanna to disguise her unwashed hair. Willing gives away his beloved spaniel while the family can still afford to feed it, knowing that by the time they won\u2019t be able to, no one else will either. Homeownership, the foundation of the American dream, proves to be the longest-lasting currency. Eventually, most of the Mandible clan will seek refuge with Florence in East Flatbush, including her sister, Avery, and brother-in-law, Lowell, a former economics professor at Georgetown who failed to predict the current situation and still doesn\u2019t comprehend it. (Tenure is among the luxuries that society can no longer afford \u2014 Lowell has been summarily sacked.) Then Florence\u2019s grandfather, Douglas Mandible, appears on the doorstep, now 97 years old and saddled with a wife suffering from dementia. All that remains of Bountiful House, his once-grand estate, is the silver service, each piece engraved with an M.The M stands for Mandible, of course, but it might just as well stand for Money, the novel\u2019s true subject. The Mandible descendants never laid hands on the cash, but it was always there in the background, silently working its mysteries on their psyches. \u201cA family fortune introduced an element of corruption,\u201d we are told early on. Its bite is felt in subtle ways. Back in the old days, Florence\u2019s father, Carter, wondered if it was fair that he and his sister, Enola, would have to divide the fortune equally, considering that he had three children (Florence, Avery and their younger brother, Jarred) and four grandchildren, while Enola, a novelist, remained single, with no dependents. After the Renunciation, as the economic collapse is called, even a small amount of money can be psychologically transformative. When Lowell heads to the supermarket after finally receiving a summer\u2019s worth of back pay, the sensation of \u201ctrouser pockets that bulged with banded cash\u201d makes him feel like \u201ca real man\u201d for the first time in months. But his buoyant mood is pierced by the discovery that, thanks to inflation, the cash won\u2019t even cover the groceries in his cart.Even before the first of the novel\u2019s \u00admultiple allusions to it, I was reminded of \u201cThe Corrections,\u201d Jonathan Franzen\u2019s saga of three siblings struggling to get by at the turn of the millennium. Like Franzen, Shriver is a shrewd social commentator with a fine ear for irony. A marvelous subplot revolves around Florence\u2019s Aunt Nollie, once a best-selling novelist, who returns from voluntary exile in France bearing carton upon carton of her own books and manuscripts, which she insists on holding on to for reasons that become brilliantly clear. But \u201cThe Mandibles\u201d suffers from a common flaw of speculative fiction: Virtually every detail of the narrative serves to communicate some expository element, giving it a didactic tone. The characters sometimes feel less like human beings than figures in a modern morality play. But when the pace slows down and they\u2019re allowed to breathe, they can offer wonderful aper\u00e7us, as when Florence reflects on the value of true generosity, which \u201centails no recompense. It means giving up something you fiercely value and cannot replace.\u201dIf \u201cThe Mandibles\u201d takes the tone of a piercing alarm rather than a reflective family chronicle, that may be a feature, not a bug, as we say these days. In the weeks since I first picked it up, developments in the news have lent unsettling credence to Shriver\u2019s dark vision. This newspaper ran an article about a woman in Pennsylvania who was the first American found to have bacteria resistant to a \u201clast resort\u201d antibiotic. (By 2047, according to \u201cThe Mandibles,\u201d \u201csuperbugs\u201d will be so rampant that the germ-spreading custom of shaking hands will disappear.) NPR reported that the Colorado River is drying up, creating a water crisis that may be a sign of more widespread future scarcities. Most dramatically, the outcome of the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote may spell the beginning of the end for the European Union.As I walk the streets of Flatbush, the rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood where my family recently bought a house of our own, scenes from \u201cThe Mandibles\u201d replay in my head. I don\u2019t remember the last time a novel held me so enduringly in its grip. \u201cThe line between owners of swank Washington \u00adtownhouses and denizens of his sister-in-law\u2019s Fort Greene shelter was perhaps thinner than he\u2019d previously appreciated,\u201d Lowell realizes late in the novel. The line separating us from our dystopian future may be equally thin. The curse of Cassandra, after all, was that she told the truth.Ruth Franklin\u2019s biography \u201cShirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life\u201d will be published in September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Power Broker Who Wants Labor at the Table, Not on the Menu", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe Democratic platform would stay silent on the prospect of a T.P.P. vote in Congress, which the Sandernistas had sought to rule out, but \u201coppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages and improve our national security.\u201dSenator Sanders\u2019s staff deemed the language strong enough to avoid a floor debate, if not strong enough for their liking. The change helped save Mrs. Clinton much stress on an issue that has helped propel Donald J. Trump among white working-class voters in key states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.At a time when Afscme and other public sector unions have come under relentless pressure from conservative activists and politicians \u2014 \u201cprobably the most perilous moment the public sector labor movement has faced since its emergence in the \u201960s and \u201970s,\u201d said Joseph A. McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University \u2014 Mr. Saunders is emerging as an increasingly important Washington power broker.His union\u2019s support for Mrs. Clinton during the Democratic primaries, especially in Iowa, proved crucial to helping her win the nomination. Mr. Saunders is one of the architects of a new \u201csuper PAC\u201d seeded with tens of millions of dollars from unions and the wealthy environmentalist Tom Steyer that aims to help elect progressive candidates this fall and in the future.\u201cWe talked for a long period of time about how to work together to build a stronger progressive coalition,\u201d said Mr. Steyer, adding that he had hosted Mr. Saunders and his wife at his San Francisco home and found him to be \u201ca lot of fun to be around.\u201dNotwithstanding Mr. Saunders\u2019s opposition to the president\u2019s trade agenda, top administration officials regularly solicit his input on economic policy. \u201cLee is a great friend of the president\u2019s and a great friend of mine,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, by email. The president has even been known to quote Mr. Saunders. \u201cHe was very taken with Lee\u2019s observation that if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary.Yet for public sector unions, which count just over one-third of government workers as members, Washington influence may no longer have the same currency it did in earlier decades. Governors in states like Wisconsin, Ohio and Illinois have sought to scale back the public unions\u2019 right to bargain for increases in benefits and, in some cases, wages. Groups financed by right-wing donors have brought a hail of lawsuits threatening the unions\u2019 ability to finance themselves through mandatory fees on workers.Such is the climate that public unions now worry about suffering the same debilitating bleed as private sector unions, whose membership has dwindled from about 25 percent of workers in the early 1970s to under 7 percent today.If Mrs. Clinton wins this fall, Mr. Saunders may gain an even closer ally in the Oval Office. Certainly the Supreme Court would be more favorable than under a President Trump. But given that some of the greatest threats to public unions emanate far from Washington, is someone best known for navigating the city\u2019s corridors of power their most promising savior?On an unseasonably cold afternoon in May, Mr. Saunders was seated next to a bank of tables at a child services facility in Cleveland when one of the workers listening to him discourse on their union piped up suddenly: \u201cI have no idea who you are. Can you introduce yourself?\u201dIf you happen to run one of the largest organizations in the country, you might be tempted to respond to such a question with thinly concealed annoyance. Mr. Saunders\u2019s immediate predecessor, Gerald W. McEntee, who built the union into a Washington force during his three decades as president, was famous for such outbursts.Instead, Mr. Saunders played the situation for laughs. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d he said in mock outrage. Then he deadpanned: \u201cI\u2019m thinking about joining the union. I wanted to hear from you guys as far as why I should do it.\u201dIt is hardly the only way Mr. Saunders differs from his immediate predecessor.Mr. McEntee alienated members with his heavy-handed decision-making \u2014 including ramming through a 2007 endorsement of Mrs. Clinton for president even though many senior officials thought Mr. Obama deserved more time to make his case \u2014 and nursed blood feuds with rival unions.Above all, longtime Afscme officials say, Mr. McEntee grew less interested in nurturing his rank-and-file members, preferring to build the union\u2019s power mostly through political spending. A former aide challenged that view, however, saying Mr. McEntee cared about cultivating the grass roots, but the urgency simply was not as great until the last few years.When Mr. Saunders ran for secretary-treasurer, the union\u2019s second-ranking position, in 2010, his association with Mr. McEntee \u2014 for whom he had worked since the 1980s, ultimately rising to become a top aide \u2014 aroused intense suspicion. He eked out a victory by 4,000 votes out of more than a million cast, then won a fairly close race to succeed Mr. McEntee upon his retirement in 2012. He was re-elected by acclamation last week.But almost from the moment he won that second election, Mr. Saunders made a point of distinguishing himself from his predecessor. He put former dissidents on crucial committees and began a rapprochement with the Service Employees International Union, Mr. McEntee\u2019s onetime nemesis.Most significant has been his attention to the rank and file, which includes people as diverse as school cafeteria workers to corrections officers.It is an ambitious undertaking, requiring an investment of millions of dollars. But labor experts say building such cohesion is essential in an era where public sector unions are under assault by politicians like Wisconsin\u2019s Republican governor, Scott Walker.Shortly after Mr. Walker started his campaign against public unions in 2011, some Madison-area labor leaders realized their options for responding, for example, with a strike, were limited because many public-sector unions in the state had grown so remote from their members they were barely in touch with them.\u201cYou\u2019d have to have an activate-able \u2014 if that\u2019s a word \u2014 rank and file,\u201d said Harry Richardson, a longtime labor activist and member of the Afscme local in Madison. \u201cAnd that just didn\u2019t exist.\u201dMr. Saunders\u2019s new program is already paying dividends in this regard. According to Ben Gordon, the organizing director of the Afscme affiliate in upstate New York, the affiliate is seeing an increase in activism among its members. \u201cWe\u2019ve had big rallies, done smaller work-site meetings, turned it into a way to settle contracts that have been open for a while in a difficult negotiation,\u201d Mr. Gordon said.In late 1998, Mr. McEntee dispatched Mr. Saunders to New York City to become the administrator of District Council 37, the umbrella body for 56 locals in the city with about 120,000 members. Several leaders of the council and the local unions were on the verge of being indicted on charges of taking kickbacks and embezzlement totaling millions of dollars, and fixing a vote on a contract with the city.Though Mr. Saunders\u2019s first priority was to root out corruption, which he accomplished swiftly, his most impressive achievement may have been helping to turn out tens of thousands of municipal workers and community activists in a protest against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki in the spring of 1999.Afscme officials insist the roughly 4 percent annual pay increases he later negotiated would never have been possible had Mr. Saunders not mobilized his members. \u201cThe mayor understood what the mayor needed to understand, that we would not deal from a position of weakness but a position of strength,\u201d said Eliot Seide, Mr. Saunders\u2019s No. 2 at the council.And yet, for all his obvious faith in grass-roots activism, Mr. Saunders remains very much an institutionalist, at ease working within the system.Even the enormous 1999 demonstration reflected a certain established protocol. \u201cIt did not annoy us \u2014 demonstrations are part of the fabric of the city of New York,\u201d said Robert M. Harding, a deputy mayor at the time. To this day, Mr. Harding keeps a photo in his office of himself flanked by Mr. Saunders and Mayor Giuliani announcing their contract.\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t call myself a bomb thrower, but I would call myself someone who wants to effectuate change,\u201d Mr. Saunders said when asked about his method. \u201cI\u2019m willing to go about doing it through a strategy that I feel most comfortable with. And that\u2019s walking with crowds, but it\u2019s also talking with very, very important people.\u201dMuch of Mr. Saunders\u2019s time in Washington has played out in similar fashion, revealing a man whose goals are strongly progressive but who, even if he doesn\u2019t defer to the powers that be, shies away from making life too uncomfortable for them.When I asked whether his intervention had undermined liberals\u2019 last best hope of defeating T.P.P., Mr. Saunders said the language he proposed included \u201cthe strongest standards\u201d a Democratic platform has ever endorsed on trade. He argued that if the president wants to send the Pacific trade deal to Congress between the election and next year\u2019s inauguration, no party platform would stop him.Likewise for some of Mr. Saunders\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate his union. In addition to its more open-ended outreach to members, the union had a market research firm spend several months last year canvassing them through surveys, focus groups and up-close observation, then asked the Washington firm GMMB to translate the findings into a branding effort, known as the \u201cNever Quit\u201d campaign.One crucial insight was that Afscme members want to be treated as individuals, not part of some undifferentiated mass of workers. The union, at GMMB\u2019s recommendation, developed an award program to recognize workers\u2019 commitment to their job.It seemed a reasonable response to an important insight. And yet it was suspiciously Washington-centric: poll-generated, a bit jargon-laden. Jerry Wurf, the leader who arguably did more than anyone else to forge Afscme into its modern form, was famous for inspiring workers to embrace radical means, even striking illegally. It\u2019s a long way from illegal strikes to performance prizes.Which, in the end, brings the story back to Wisconsin.To the Madison-area leaders who advocated responding to Governor Walker with a strike, the mere absence of a more cohesive organization did not, by itself, mean the unions had no hope of pulling it off. Labor leaders could have harnessed the energy of the more than 50,000 people protesting in the streets, the strike advocates said, but many state leaders lacked the fortitude to try.\u201cWho knows what could have snowballed if we could have had a one- or two-day walkout,\u201d said Mr. Richardson, the Madison activist. \u201cIf it had been heavy in some key sectors, it would not have had to be many people. If some prison guards walk out.\u201dRick Badger, a state-level Afscme official, said union leaders believed they stood a better chance of recalling Mr. Walker and Republican legislators than unifying their diverse membership behind a strike, which could have undermined those efforts, and they expected the courts to overturn Governor Walker\u2019s legislation.Mr. Saunders has begun to address one huge vulnerability for public sector unions \u2014 the weakness of members\u2019 personal ties to one another and their leaders. But would he rally his members for a fight that could go disastrously wrong, even if it were the only thing that could save them?Under Mr. Wurf, union officials sometimes calculated that even though the public may initially hate their members if they stopped collecting garbage or manning nursing homes, as a strike went on, voters would begin to hate the politicians even more.Would Mr. Saunders, at a moment of reckoning, ever embrace that radical strategy?\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a fortune teller,\u201d he responded when I asked about the possibility of a statewide strike in Wisconsin. \u201cMaybe it could have been successful. It\u2019s just not that simple.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Adding Classes and Content, Resurgent Libraries Turn a Whisper Into a Roar", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byMatthew Carter\u2019s summer hideaway is not in the Hamptons, the Catskills or on the Jersey Shore. It does not require a car ride or a small fortune to keep up.Mr. Carter, 32, an adjunct professor of music at the City College of New York, simply holes up at the Inwood Library in northern Manhattan with his research books. It is quiet, air-conditioned and open every day.\u201cI\u2019m a total leech of public libraries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my summer hangout. It\u2019s where I spend the majority of my time, and where I\u2019m most productive.\u201dIt is also a place where he has a lot of company.Far from becoming irrelevant in the digital age, libraries in New York City and around the nation are thriving: adding weekend and evening hours; hiring more librarians and staff; and expanding their catalog of classes and services to include things like job counseling, coding classes and knitting groups.No longer just repositories for books, public libraries have reinvented themselves as one-stop community centers that aim to offer something for everyone. In so doing, they are reaffirming their role as an essential part of civic life in America by making themselves indispensable to new generations of patrons.In Queens, which has a large South Asian population, a library in Jamaica offers sewing classes in Bengali for Bangladeshi women, some of whom now earn a living as seamstresses. Libraries in Flushing and South Jamaica teach social media skills to small-business owners.Nationally, public libraries are redefining their mission at a time when access to technology, and the ability to use it, is said to deepen class stratification, leaving many poor and disadvantaged communities behind. Sari Feldman, president of the American Library Association, said library workers had shown people how to file online for welfare benefits and taught classes in science, technology, engineering and math to children who could not afford to go to summer camps.\u201cAll libraries are having a renaissance,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that libraries have really stepped up to take on roles that are needed in a community.\u201dNew York City\u2019s 217 public libraries have rebounded in the past two years amid an infusion of city dollars, after years of budget and service cuts. An outpouring of support from library lovers has served as a reminder that the institutions are a crucial part of many lives.\u201cEver since becoming a member of the Queens Library, I have been bettering my life,\u201d he wrote in his statement.In the past two years, more than 250,000 people, including the author Judy Blume and the musician Patti Smith, have signed on to a letter campaign in support of the libraries. Library workers have held story time on the steps of City Hall, and showed up at budget hearings in bright orange T-shirts emblazoned with the words: \u201cKeep Investing in Libraries, Keep Investing in New Yorkers.\u201dThe message was heard. In the 2016 fiscal year the libraries received $360 million for operating costs, $33 million more than the year before \u2014 the largest increase in recent times. For the 2017 fiscal year, which began on Friday, city financing for the libraries increased slightly to $365 million. But in a more significant victory, city leaders agreed to preserve past increases in future budgets, the difference, say, between getting a one-year bonus or a permanent raise.City Councilman Andy King, who represents northeast Bronx and is chairman of the Libraries Subcommittee, said previous years of budget cuts had left the libraries on life support. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re in a financial position to let the blood flow again,\u201d Mr. King, a Democrat, said. \u201cLibraries are a lifeline, which we can\u2019t afford to ever let fall again.\u201dTony Marx, president of the New York Public Library, which has 92 branches in the Bronx, in Manhattan and on Staten Island, said library officials no longer had to worry about plugging budget holes and could instead focus on building services and programs. They have hired 120 more staff members, including 67 librarians for children and young adult literature alone. They have spent $1.1 million on books and materials and expanded seats in early literacy programs for toddlers.\u201cWe\u2019re a mere year into this reinvestment, and the results are immediate: longer hours, more librarians and thousands more seats for education programming,\u201d Mr. Marx said.Libraries are now open on Saturdays, and in some cases, Sundays, too. At the Queens Library, which has 65 locations, more than 765,000 people visited on Saturdays alone from last November to May. Library officials have hired another 129 staff members and spent more than $2.6 million on new books, including e-books and periodicals.\u201cWe are energized and serving the needs of the people who come through our doors,\u201d said Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the Queens Library and former schools chancellor, who works from a desk on the main floor of the Central Library in Jamaica so he can take questions and complaints in person.The Brooklyn Public Library has hired 95 new staff members, two-thirds of whom are librarians, and bought 50,000 more books and other materials. Last year, about 8.7 million people used its 60 libraries, a 3 percent increase from the year before.Linda Johnson, the president of the Brooklyn Public Library, said 552 satellite libraries had been set up in schools, senior centers and homeless shelters to promote literacy and bring books, technology and other services to those who are unable to visit their branches. Twenty of the satellites are at Rikers Island, the city\u2019s main jail complex, where inmates can now read books to their children at outside neighborhood branches through video conferencing.The library contest that drew so many nominations was the idea of Reynold Levy, 71, a former president of Lincoln Center and a lifelong user of libraries.At the time, budget cuts had forced many branches to eliminate weekend hours. Mr. Levy saw the contest as a way for people to show city leaders how much they valued libraries and to express their appreciation to those who work in them. The contest was sponsored by the Charles H. Revson Foundation and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and awarded a total of $170,000 to 11 winning libraries, including $20,000 to the Inwood branch.Mr. Levy, the chairman of Revson\u2019s board of trustees, recalled that his first job, at age 14, was at the Brighton Beach library in Brooklyn, where he borrowed all his books. Four days a week, he would help check out books, collect fines and troll the aisles to make sure all the edges of the books were neatly lined up, climbing on stools to reach the upper shelves. \u201cIt was a dream of mine to be wealthy enough to build a library and buy books,\u201d he said.The recent gains by libraries have delighted Christian Zabriskie, a librarian and executive director of Urban Librarians Unite, an advocacy and education group that organizes an annual \u201cread-in,\u201d in which people take turns reading nonstop for 24 hours, to support the libraries.\u201cIn New York City, there is somebody using library materials every second, every day of the year,\u201d Mr. Zabriskie said. \u201cIt\u2019s showing that libraries are the fabric of society.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Rich People Make the French Squirm", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byParis \u2014 MY family was once invited to lunch at a chateau owned by a friend of a friend. As we drove our rental car up to the giant castle, my kids gasped and said, \u201cThey must be rich!\u201d\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t mention money,\u201d I warned them.An hour later, I found my 6-year-old walking in circles on the lawn, talking to himself. Up close, I realized that he was muttering \u201cmoney, money, money, money\u201d over and over.Can the French overcome their ambivalence about money to lure bankers from London? Should they?This ambivalence goes back centuries. Aristocrats were guillotined during the French Revolution, and new taxes were based on how wealthy people appeared \u2014 measured in part by the number of doors and windows in their homes. The well-off learned to be discreet.There are still plenty of rich people in Paris, of course. One draw for finance companies is that the city is teeming with high-end restaurants and grand apartments, and that it already has a large business district, La D\u00e9fense, just west of town. Whole neighborhoods of the capital empty out each summer, as residents retreat to their second homes.But there are still rules against showing it off. Parisiennes rarely walk around wearing the giant diamonds that are de rigueur in certain New York neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s more in a private dinner that you see the wealth,\u201d a French friend explained.It\u2019s fine to discuss money in France, as long as you\u2019re complaining that you don\u2019t have enough, or boasting about getting a bargain. No one here appreciates the American thrill I get from overspending, any more than they understand why we have a national holiday (Thanksgiving) during which you\u2019re practically obliged to overeat.The typical \u201cFrench dream\u201d (or at least the one people admit to) isn\u2019t of great wealth, it\u2019s of great security, including a steady income and pension. When you apply for a mortgage here, banks don\u2019t care what stocks you own, because stocks can go down; they want to see a monthly salary and a permanent work contract.I see this principle in daily life. When I told a Paris official that a group of parents was willing to buy a new security camera for our children\u2019s school (the city had been dragging its feet on our request), he was aghast, saying, \u201cWhat about the other schools where parents can\u2019t afford to buy new cameras?\u201dMr. Valls urged executives here to remind their British counterparts that the infamous 75 percent tax is gone: \u201cIf some among you can be patriotic and explain to the British media that it doesn\u2019t exist anymore, I\u2019d be thankful.\u201dBut the welcome is not without reservations. Jean-Louis Missika, Paris\u2019s deputy mayor for urban planning and economic development, told me in an interview this week that Brexit also offers a cautionary tale about what happens when the superrich dominate a city, pricing out practically everyone else. In London recently, I visited friends at the peak of middle-class careers who are living crammed with their children in a one-bedroom rental. There are people in northern England \u2014 many of them voted for Brexit \u2014 who can barely afford a coffee in the capital. Paris isn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s more affordable.Mr. Missika said that France still faced \u201ccomplicated and difficult, but urgent questions\u201d about how much it was willing to cut taxes to attract financial companies. \u201cI say yes to finance, but to an ethical one that respects fiscal rules\u201d and the environment, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said on Wednesday.\u201cI think we have to roll out the red carpet,\u201d said Mr. Missika, who worked in private equity himself. \u201cBut if rolling out the red carpet means aligning French taxes and finances with what was practiced in London or Jersey, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious. It\u2019s not possible. And I hope that neither Germany nor the Netherlands nor any of the other cities that are competing with Paris will make that big mistake.\u201d He predicted that sectors of the financial industry will cluster in different cities.Paris is meanwhile stepping up its efforts to attract technology companies, start-ups and so-called creative-economy jobs, which Mr. Missika said are more connected to the rest of the city and will help develop it over the long term. Paris will no doubt get some finance jobs, too, but I doubt it will ever become the next London. It doesn\u2019t really want to be that. And it\u2019s probably right.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blood on Your Hands, Too", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThere is no question that we should examine incidents of police violence for traces of bias, if for no other reason than to rule it out if it isn\u2019t present. Indeed, we should all search ourselves for manifestations of racial bias.But the current conversation is \u2014 and must be \u2014 larger than that.Interpersonal racism, when it exists, is only one part of the equation. Another part is systemic, structurally racist policies, and yet another is class conflict between the police and the poorest, most dangerous communities they patrol, and between those who are better off and those who are not. That strand is nearly absent from this conversation altogether.\u201cAs a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book. And then we tell the police, \u2018You\u2019re a social worker; you\u2019re the parent; you\u2019re the teacher; you\u2019re the drug counselor.\u2019 We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience; don\u2019t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind. And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.\u201dThe comment underscores that this is not simply a conflict between police departments and minority communities that everyone else can watch from a comfortable distance, convinced that the battle doesn\u2019t belong to them.No, this issue is about everyone. We have areas of concentrated poverty in our cities in part because of a long legacy of discriminatory urban policies. We don\u2019t sufficiently address the effects of that legacy, in part because it is rooted in a myth of racial pathology and endemic poor choice. We choose to be blind to the policy choices our politicians have made \u2014 and that many have benefited from, while others suffered \u2014 while simultaneously holding firmly to the belief that all of our own successes and comforts are simply the result of our and our families\u2019 drive, ambition and resourcefulness. Other people lack physical comforts because they lack our character strength.It is from this bed of lies that our policing policies spring. When the president says, \u201cWe tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs,\u201d who is the \u201cwe\u201d?It\u2019s not the blue-collar civil servants in law enforcement or the working-class and poor communities, which are aggressively patrolled. No. The \u201cwe\u201d is the middle and moneyed classes.While the blue, black and brown groups on the lower end of the spectrum are forced into more interaction \u2014 on one hand to contain disruption within communities, and on the other to finance police departments and civic governance \u2014 everyone else goes about their business unaware and unbothered until something causes \u201cpolitical blowback or inconvenience\u201d and disturbs the more prosperous half\u2019s \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d\u201cThese officers risk their lives for $40,000 a year. Forty thousand dollars a year. And this is not sustainable, not to support these people. We\u2019re not perfect. There\u2019s cops that don\u2019t need to be cops. I have been the first to say, we need to separate employment with those types of cops \u2014 1 percent or 2 percent. The 98 percent or 99 percent of cops come to work, do this job, come to work for 40 grand. It\u2019s not sustainable.\u201dHonor\u00e9 continued:\u201cMatter of fact, their pay would go up if the federal minimum wage was passed, $15 an hour. They make less than $15 an hour. We ask a lot from these young police officers which means, Don, they\u2019ve got to get another job. They have to have a second job to support their families, most of them. We\u2019ve got to take that stress off of them, too. So we got to make sure they\u2019re properly trained and they don\u2019t have to work all this overtime so they can maintain their family. A stressful police officer who\u2019s working another 30 hours overtime a week is coming to work tired. And he\u2019s stressed out. We\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201dWe take this underpaid and highly stressed group of officers, with guns and any biases they may harbor, explicit or implicit, and flood disadvantaged communities with them, where uncivil behavior can often take root, and then \u201cwe feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.\u201dPolice departments can then use these already poor people as a kind of municipal cash machine, plugging budgetary shortfalls by performing an inordinate number of stops, writing an outrageous number of tickets and having the courts impose even more fines.Now where would this revenue come from if it were not being bled from poor people? That\u2019s right, the rest of the population. The tax dollar that your local government refused to exact from you is being exacted from dark flesh. That same city service that your town can\u2019t truly afford but refused to forgo is being paid for by gouging poor people who have almost nothing.You may think that you are not a part of this, but you are wrong. That\u2019s just a lie that your willful ignorance and purposeful blindness perpetuates, to protect your conscience. This is absolutely about you, many, many of you. There are more bloody hands than meet the eye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saudi Morals Enforcer Called for a More Liberal Islam. Then the Death Threats Began.", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byJIDDA, Saudi Arabia \u2014 For most of his adult life, Ahmed Qassim al-Ghamdi worked among the bearded enforcers of Saudi Arabia. He was a dedicated employee of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice \u2014 known abroad as the religious police \u2014 serving with the front-line troops protecting the Islamic kingdom from Westernization, secularism and anything but the most conservative Islamic practices.Some of that resembled ordinary police work: busting drug dealers and bootleggers in a country that bans alcohol. But the men of \u201cthe Commission,\u201d as Saudis call it, spent most of their time maintaining the puritanical public norms that set Saudi Arabia apart not only from the West, but from most of the Muslim world.A key offense was ikhtilat, or unauthorized mixing between men and women. The kingdom\u2019s clerics warn that it could lead to fornication, adultery, broken homes, children born of unmarried couples and full-blown societal collapse.For years, Mr. Ghamdi stuck with the program and was eventually put in charge of the Commission for the region of Mecca, Islam\u2019s holiest city. Then he had a reckoning and began to question the rules. So he turned to the Quran and the stories of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, considered the exemplars of Islamic conduct. What he found was striking and life altering: There had been plenty of mixing among the first generation of Muslims, and no one had seemed to mind.So he spoke out. In articles and television appearances, he argued that much of what Saudis practiced as religion was in fact Arabian cultural practices that had been mixed up with their faith.There was no need to close shops for prayer, he said, nor to bar women from driving, as Saudi Arabia does. At the time of the Prophet, women rode around on camels, which he said was far more provocative than veiled women piloting S.U.V.s.He even said that while women should conceal their bodies, they needed to cover their faces only if they chose to do so. And to demonstrate the depth of his own conviction, Mr. Ghamdi went on television with his wife, Jawahir, who smiled to the camera, her face bare and adorned with a dusting of makeup.It was like a bomb inside the kingdom\u2019s religious establishment, threatening the social order that granted prominence to the sheikhs and made them the arbiters of right and wrong in all aspects of life. He threatened their control.Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s colleagues at work refused to speak to him. Angry calls poured into his cellphone and anonymous death threats hit him on Twitter. Prominent sheikhs took to the airwaves to denounce him as an ignorant upstart who should be punished, tried \u2014 and even tortured.I had come to Saudi Arabia to explore Wahhabism, the hyper-conservative Saudi strain of Sunni Islam that is often blamed for fueling intolerance around the world \u2014 and nurturing terrorism. I spent weeks in Riyadh, Jidda and other cities speaking with sheikhs, imams, religious professors and many others as I tried to peel back the layers of a closed and private society.For the Western visitor, Saudi Arabia is a baffling mix of modern urbanism, desert culture and the never-ending effort to adhere to a rigid interpretation of scriptures that are more than 1,000 years old. It is a kingdom flooded with oil wealth, skyscrapers, S.U.V.s and shopping malls, where questions about how to invest money, interact with non-Muslims or even treat cats are answered with quotes from the Quran or stories about the Prophet Muhammad.Religion is woven into daily life. Banks employ clerics to ensure they follow Shariah law. Mannequins lack heads because of religious sensitivities to showing the human form. And schoolbooks detail how boys should cut their hair, how girls should cover their bodies and how often a person should trim his or her pubic hair.While Islam is meant to be a complete program for human life, interpretation is key when it comes to practices. The Saudi interpretation is steeped in the conservatism of central Arabia, especially regarding relations between women and men.In public, most women wear baggy black gowns called abayas, designed to hide their forms, as well as veils that cover their hair and faces, with only thin slits for their eyes. Restaurants have separate sections for \u201cfamilies,\u201d meaning groups that include women, and for \u201csingles,\u201d which means men.Many Saudis mix in private, and men and women can usually meet in hotel lobbies with little problem. Others do not want to mix and see gender segregation as part of their cultural identity. In some conservative circles, men go their whole lives without seeing the faces of women other than their immediate family \u2014 even their brothers\u2019 wives.Officials I spoke with were upset by the kingdom\u2019s increasingly troubled reputation abroad and said over and over that they supported \u201cmoderate Islam.\u201dBut what exactly did they mean by \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d? Unpacking that term made it clear how wide the values gap is between Saudi Arabia and its American ally. The kingdom\u2019s \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d publicly beheads criminals, punishes apostates and prevents women from traveling abroad without the permission of a male \u201cguardian.\u201dDon\u2019t even ask about gay rights.Instead of calls for jihad, what I heard were religious leaders insisting that the faithful obey the state. The Saudi royal family is terrified that the jihadist fervor inflaming the region will catch fire at home and threaten its control. So it has marshaled the state\u2019s religious apparatus to condemn the jihadists and proclaim the religious duty of obedience to the rulers.And while it was once common, I heard little disparaging talk about Christians and Jews, although it was open season on Shiites, whose faith is frequently bashed as part of the rivalry with Iran.The only Saudis who suggested I was an infidel were children.Once, a Saudi journalist proudly introduced me to his 9-year-old daughter, whom he had put in private school so she could study English.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d I asked.\u201cMy name is Dana,\u201d she said.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cI am 9.\u201d\u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201dConfused, she switched to Arabic.\u201cWe don\u2019t have that in Saudi Arabia,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an infidel holiday.\u201dShocked, her father asked where she had learned that, and she fetched one of her government-issued textbooks, flipping to a lesson that listed \u201cforbidden holidays\u201d: Christmas and Thanksgiving. Birthdays had been part of the same lesson.Another time, I met a religious friend for coffee, and he brought his two young sons. When the call to prayer sounded, my friend went to pray. His sons, confused that I did not follow, looked at me wide-eyed and asked, \u201cAre you an infidel?\u201dThe first thing many Saudis will tell you about Wahhabism is that it does not exist.\u201cThere is no such thing as Wahhabism,\u201d Hisham al-Sheikh told me the first time we met. \u201cThere is only true Islam.\u201dThe irony is that fewer people have a purer Wahhabi pedigree than Mr. Sheikh, a direct descendant of the cleric who started it all.In the early 18th century, Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab called for a religious reformation in central Arabia. Feeling that Islam had been corrupted by practices like the veneration of saints and tombs, he called for the stripping away of \u201cinnovations\u201d and the return to what he considered the pure religion.He formed an alliance with a chieftain named Mohammed ibn Saud that has underpinned the area\u2019s history ever since. Then the Saud family assumed political leadership while Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab and his descendants gave legitimacy to their rule and managed religious affairs.That mix proved potent among the warring Arabian tribes, as Wahhabi clerics provided justification for military conquest in some cases: Those who resisted the House of Saud were not just enemies, but infidels who deserved the sword.The first Saudi state was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1818, and attempts to build another failed until the early 20th century, when King Abdulaziz al-Saud undertook a campaign that put him in control of most of the Arabian Peninsula.But the king faced a choice: to continue expansionary jihad, which would have invited conflict with the British, or to build a modern state. He chose the latter, even crushing a group of his own warriors who refused to stop fighting.Since then, the alliance between the royal family and the clerics has endured, although the tensions between the quest for ideological purity and the exigencies of modern statehood remain throughout Saudi society.Fast forward to 2016, and the main players have transformed because of time and oil wealth. The royal family has grown from a group of scrappy desert dwellers into a sprawling clan awash in palaces and private jets. The Wahhabi establishment has evolved from a puritan reform movement into a bloated state bureaucracy.It consists of universities that churn out graduates trained in religious disciplines; a legal system in which judges apply Shariah law; a council of top clerics who advise the king; a network of offices that dispense fatwas, or religious opinions; a force of religious police who monitor public behavior; and tens of thousands of mosque imams who can be tapped to deliver the government\u2019s message from the pulpit.The call to prayer sounds five times a day from mosques and inside of malls so clearly that many Saudis use it to organize their days.\u201cLet\u2019s meet after the sunset prayer,\u201d they would tell me, sometimes unsure what time that was. So I installed an app on my phone that let me look up prayer times and buzzed when the call sounded.And so it was, after the sunset prayer, that I met Mr. Sheikh, a proud sixth-generation descendant of Mohammed ibn Abdul-Wahhab.He was a portly man of 42 who wore a long white robe and covered his head with a schmag, or checkered cloth. His beard was long and he had no mustache, in imitation of the Prophet Muhammad, and he squinted through reading glasses perched on his nose while peering at his iPhone.We sat on purple couches in the music-free lobby of a Riyadh hotel and shared dates and coffee while he answered my questions about Islam in Saudi Arabia.\u201cI am an open-minded person,\u201d he told me early on.It was clear that he hoped I would become a Muslim.His life had been defined by the religious establishment, but he proved to be a case study in the complexity of terms like \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d in Saudi Arabia. He had memorized the Quran at a young age and studied with prominent clerics before completing his doctorate in Shariah, with his thesis on how technology changed the application of Shariah.Now he had a successful career and a host of religious jobs. He trained judges for the Shariah courts, advised the minister of Islamic affairs, wrote studies for the clerics who advise the king and served on the Shariah board of the Medgulf insurance company. On Fridays, he preached at a mosque near his mother\u2019s house and welcomed visitors who came to see his uncle, the grand mufti.He had traveled extensively abroad, and when he found out I was American he told me that he loved the United States. He had visited Oregon, New York, Massachusetts and Los Angeles. On one trip, he visited a synagogue. On another, a black church. He had also visited an Amish community, which he found fascinating.A relative of his lived in Montgomery, Ala., and he had spent happy months there, often visiting the local Islamic center. The hardest part, he said, was Ramadan, because there were few eateries open late that did not have bars.\u201cAll I had was IHOP,\u201d he said.He said Islam did not forbid doing business or having friendships with Christians or Jews. He opposed Shiite beliefs and practices, but said it was wrong to do as the extremists of the Islamic State and declare takfir, or infidelity, on entire groups.When it came to birthdays, which many Saudi clerics condemn, he said he did not oppose them, although his wife did, so their children did not go to birthday parties. But they had celebrations of their own, he said, showing me a video on his phone of his family gathered around a cake bearing the face of his son Abdullah, 15, who had just memorized the Quran. They lit sparklers and cheered, but did not sing.He was on the fence about music, which many Wahhabis also forbid. He said he had no problem with background music in restaurants, but opposed music that put listeners in a state similar to drunkenness, causing them to jump around and bang their heads.\u201cWe have something better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can listen to the Quran.\u201dSince much of what differentiates Saudi Arabia is the place of women, I wanted to talk to a conservative Saudi woman, which was tricky because most would refuse to meet with any unrelated male \u2014 let alone a non-Muslim correspondent from the United States. So I had a female Saudi colleague, Sheikha al-Dosary, contact Mr. Sheikh\u2019s wife, Meshael, who said she would meet me.But I asked Mr. Sheikh\u2019s permission.\u201cShe is very busy,\u201d he said, and changed the subject.So Ms. Sheikh met Ms. Dosary at a women\u2019s coffee shop in Riyadh, where women can uncover their faces and hair.Her marriage to Mr. Sheikh had been arranged, she said. They met once for less than an hour before they were married, and he had seen her face.\u201cIt was hard for me to look at him or to check him out as I was so shy,\u201d she said.They were cousins. He was 21; she was 16. He agreed to her condition for marriage that she continue her studies, and she was now working on a doctorate in education while raising their four children.She disputed the Western idea that Saudi women lack rights.\u201cThey believe we are oppressed because we don\u2019t drive, but that is incorrect,\u201d Ms. Sheikh said, adding that driving would be a hassle in Riyadh\u2019s snarled traffic.\u201cHere women are respected and honored in many ways you don\u2019t find in the West,\u201d she continued.She, too, is a descendant of Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab and said proudly that her grandfather had founded the kingdom\u2019s religious police. \u201cPraise God that we have the Commission to protect our country,\u201d she said.Their embrace of technology runs counter to the history of Wahhabi clerics rejecting nearly everything new as a threat to the religion. Formerly banned items include the telegraph, the radio, the camera, soccer, girls\u2019 education and televisions, whose introduction in the 1960s caused outrage.For Saudis, trying to navigate what is permitted, halal, and what is not, haram, can be challenging. So they turn to clerics for fatwas, or nonbinding religious rulings. While some may get a lot of attention \u2014 as when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran called for killing the author Salman Rushdie \u2014 most concern the details of religious practice. Others can reveal the sometimes comical contortions that clerics go through to reconcile modernity with their understanding of religion.\u201cPhotography is not permitted unless necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cNot with cats, not with dogs, not with wolves, not with anything.\u201dIt goes on: \u201cSlavery in Islam is like a purifying machine or sauna in which those who are captured enter to wash off their dirt and then they come out clean, pure and safe, from another door.\u201dOnce while we were having coffee, Mr. Sheikh answered his cellphone, listened seriously and issued a fatwa on the spot. He got such calls frequently.The query had been about where a pilgrim headed to Mecca had to don the white cloths of ritual purity \u2014 an easy one. The answer, in this case, was Jidda. Others were harder, and he demurred if he was not sure. Once, a woman asked about fake eyelashes. He told her that he did not know, but thought about it later and decided they were fine, on one condition: \u201cthat there is no cheating involved.\u201dA woman, for example, could put them on before a man came to propose.\u201cAnd then after they get married, they\u2019re gone!\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not permitted.\u201dOne Friday, Mr. Sheikh took me to see his uncle, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh.We entered a vast reception hall near the mufti\u2019s house in Riyadh, with padded benches along the walls where a dozen bearded students sat. In the center, on a raised armchair, sat the mufti, his feet in brown socks and perched on a pillow. The students read religious texts, and the mufti interjected with commentary. He was 75, Mr. Sheikh said, and had been blind since age 14, when a German doctor carried out a failed operation on his eyes.Mr. Sheikh said I could ask him a question, so I asked how he responded to those who compared Wahhabism to the Islamic State.\u201cThat is all lies and slander. Daesh is an aggressive, tyrannous group that has no relation,\u201d he said, using another term for the Islamic State.After a pause, he asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a Muslim?\u201dI responded that I was from a Christian family.\u201cThe religion you follow has no source,\u201d he said, adding that I should accept the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s revelation.\u201cYour religion is not a religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, you will have to face God.\u201dThe first time I met Mr. Ghamdi, 51, formerly of the religious police, was this year in a sitting room in his apartment in Jidda, the port city on the Red Sea. The room had been outfitted to look like a Bedouin tent. Burgundy fabric adorned the walls, gold tassels hung from the ceiling, and carpets covered the floor, to which Mr. Ghamdi pressed his forehead in prayer during breaks in our conversation.He spoke of how the world of sheikhs, fatwas and the meticulous application of religion to everything had defined his life.But that world \u2014 his world \u2014 had frozen him out.Little in his background suggested that he would become a religious reformer. While at a university, he quit a job at the customs office in the Jidda port because a sheikh told him that collecting duties was haram.After graduation, he studied religion in his spare time and handled international accounts for a government office \u2014 a job requiring travel to non-Muslim countries.\u201cThe clerics at that time were releasing fatwas that it was not right to travel to the countries of the infidels unless it was necessary,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said.So he quit.Then he taught economics at a technical school in Saudi Arabia, but didn\u2019t like that it taught only capitalism and socialism. So he said he had added material on Islamic finance, but the students complained about the extra work, and he left.He finally landed a job that he felt was consistent with his religious convictions, as a member of the Commission in Jidda.Over the next few years, he transferred to Mecca and cycled through different positions. There were occasional prostitution cases, and the force sometimes caught sorcerers \u2014 who can be beheaded if convicted in court.But he developed reservations about how the force worked. His colleagues\u2019 religious zeal sometimes led them to overreact, breaking into people\u2019s homes or humiliating detainees.\u201cLet\u2019s say someone drank alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not represent an attack on the religion, but they exaggerated in how they treated people.\u201dAt one point, Mr. Ghamdi was assigned to review cases and tried to use his position to report abuses and force agents to return items they had wrongfully confiscated, he said.He recalled the case of an older, single man who was reported to receive two young women in his home on the weekends. Since the man did not pray at the mosque, his neighbors suspected he was up to no good, so the Commission raided the house and caught the man red-handed \u2014 visiting with his daughters.\u201cOften, people were humiliated in inhuman ways, and that humiliation could cause hatred of religion,\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said.In 2005, the head of the Commission for the Mecca region died, and Mr. Ghamdi was promoted. It was a big job, with some 90 stations throughout a large, diverse area containing Islam\u2019s holiest sites. He did his best to keep up, while worrying that the Commission\u2019s focus was misguided.In private, he looked to the scriptures and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad for guidance on what was halal and what was haram, and he documented his findings.\u201cI was surprised because we used to hear from the scholars, \u2018Haram, haram, haram,\u2019 but they never talked about the evidence,\u201d he said.Realizing the gravity of such a conclusion for someone in his position, he stayed silent and filed the document away.But his conclusions would, soon, emerge.Kaust followed the precedent of Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, which had also been shielded from clerical interference, highlighting one of the great contradictions of Saudi Arabia: Regardless of how much the royal family lauds its Islamic values, when it wants to earn money or innovate, it does not turn to the clerics for advice. It puts up a wall and locks them out.Most clerics kept quiet out of deference to the king. But one member of the top clerical body addressed the issue on a call-in show, warning of the dangers of mixed universities: sexual harassment; men and women flirting and getting distracted from their studies; husbands growing jealous of their wives; rape.\u201cMixing has many corrupting factors, and its evil is great,\u201d said the cleric, Sheikh Saad al-Shathri, adding that if the king had known this was the plan, he would have stopped it.But mixing was in fact the king\u2019s idea, and he was not amused. He dismissed the sheikh with a royal decree.From his office in Mecca, Mr. Ghamdi watched, frustrated that the clerics were not backing a project he felt was good for the kingdom.So after praying about it, he retrieved his report and boiled it down to two long articles that were published in the newspaper Okaz in 2009.They were the first strikes in a yearslong battle between Mr. Ghamdi and the religious establishment. He followed with other articles, went on TV and faced off against other clerics who insulted him and marshaled their own evidence from the scriptures. His colleagues at the Commission shunned him, so he requested \u2014 and was swiftly granted \u2014 early retirement.Once off the force, he questioned other practices: forcing shops to close during prayer times and urging people to go to the mosque, requiring face veils, barring women from driving.Each comment lit a new inferno. A woman once asked him on Twitter if she could not only show her face, but also wear makeup. Sure, Mr. Ghamdi said, setting off new attacks.Harsh responses came from the top of the religious establishment.If the clerical attacks on Mr. Ghamdi were loud, the blowback from society was more painful. His tribe issued a statement, disowning him and calling him \u201ctroubled and confused.\u201d His cellphone rang day and night with callers shouting at him. He came home to find graffiti on the wall of his house. And a group of men showed up at his door, demanding to \u201cmix\u201d with the family\u2019s women. His sons \u2014 he has nine children \u2014 called the police.Before the dust-up, Mr. Ghamdi had also delivered Friday sermons at a mosque in Mecca, earning a government stipend. But the congregation complained after he spoke out, and he was asked to stay home, later losing his pay.Mr. Ghamdi had not broken any laws and never faced legal action. But in Saudi Arabia\u2019s close-knit society, the attacks echoed through his family. The relatives of his eldest son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e called off their wedding, not wanting to associate their family with his.\u201cAre you with your brother or with me?\u201d Mr. Ghamdi said his sister\u2019s husband had asked her. \u201cShe said, \u2018I am with my brother.\u2019\u201d They soon divorced.Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s son Ammar, 15, was taunted at school. Ammar said another boy had once asked him: \u201cHow did your mom go on TV? That\u2019s not right. You have no manners.\u201dSo Ammar punched him.One evening in Jidda, a university professor invited me to his home for dinner. His wife, a doctor, joined us at the table, her hair covered with a stylish veil.They had recently been married and he joked that they were meant for each other because she was good at cooking and he was good at eating. His wife chuckled and gave him more soup.I asked about Mr. Ghamdi.\u201cFrom what I read and what I saw, I think he\u2019s right and he stood up for what he believes in,\u201d the professor said. \u201cI admire that.\u201dThe problem, he said, is that tolerance for opposing views is not taught in Saudi society.\u201cEither follow what I say or I will classify you, I will hurt you, I will push you out of the discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is anti-Islam. We have many people thinking in different ways. You can fight, but you have to live under the same roof.\u201dHis wife had no problem with mixing or with women working, but did not like that Mr. Ghamdi had caused a scandal by making his views public. The royal family sets the rules, and it was inappropriate for subjects to publicly campaign for changes, she said.\u201cHe has to follow the ruler,\u201d she said. \u201cIf everyone just comes out with his own opinion, we\u2019ll be in chaos.\u201dAfter dinner, a young cleric who works for the security services dropped by. He, too, agreed with Mr. Ghamdi, but would not talk about it openly. The response, he said, is part of the deep conservatism in the clerical establishment that is impeding development.He often gave lectures to security officers, followed by discussions, he said, and a common question he heard was, \u201cIsn\u2019t the military uniform haram?\u201d Many Wahhabi clerics preach against resembling the infidels, leading to confusion.He believed that wearing uniforms was fine, and worried that such narrow thinking made people susceptible to extremism.\u201cIt\u2019s like in those American movies when they invent a robot and then they lose control and it attacks them and the remote control stops working,\u201d he said.The next day, the professor thanked me for my visit in a text message.\u201cI\u2019d like to remind u that any story that would uncover the source may hurt us. I trust your discretion,\u201d he wrote, followed by three flowers.All that was left, really, was to to speak with the Commission. What did its leaders and rank and file think about all of this? But for a force portrayed as ever-present and all powerful, it proved surprisingly shy.I could not visit Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s former office because non-Muslims are barred from entering Mecca. So I had multiple contacts ask for interviews with relatives who worked for the Commission, but they all declined to speak. I called the Commission\u2019s spokesman, who told me that he was traveling and then stopped answering my calls.I even dropped by the Commission\u2019s headquarters, a boxy, steel-and-glass building on a Riyadh highway between a gas station and a car dealership. Its website advertised open hours with the director, so I went to his office, through halls filled with bearded men milling about and slick banners proclaiming \u201cA Policy of Excellence\u201d and \u201cTogether Against Corruption.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t come today,\u201d the director\u2019s secretary told me. \u201cMaybe next week.\u201dOn my way out, two men invited me into an office and served me coffee.\u201cHow do you like working for the Commission?\u201d I asked.\u201cEveryone who chooses this job loves it,\u201d one said. It was the work of \u201cthe entire Islamic nation,\u201d and it felt good \u201cto bring people from the darkness into the light.\u201dThe other man had been on the force for 15 years and said he preferred working in the office.\u201cYou rest more in the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cOut there we have problems with people. They call us the religious police. Criminals! Thieves! You never get to rest out in the field.\u201dA scowling man appeared in the doorway and told me that I was not allowed to talk to anyone. The first man soon left. The second offered me more coffee, then tea, then forced me to take a bottle of water when I left.The first irony of Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s situation is that many Saudis, including members of the royal family and even important clerics, agree with him, although mostly in private. And public mixing of the sexes in some places \u2014 hospitals, conferences and in Mecca during the pilgrimage \u2014 is common. In some Saudi cities it is not uncommon to see women\u2019s faces, or even their hair.But there is a split in society between the conservatives who want to maintain what they consider the kingdom\u2019s pure Islamic identity and the liberals (in the Saudi context) who want more personal freedoms. Liberals make cases like Mr. Ghamdi\u2019s all the time. But sheikhs don\u2019t, which is why he was branded a traitor.The second irony is that this year, Saudi Arabia instituted some of the reform Mr. Ghamdi had called for.In April, the government responded with a surprise decree defanging the religious police. It denied them the power to arrest, question or pursue subjects, forced them to work with the police and advised them to be \u201cgentle and kind\u201d in their interactions with citizens.Mr. Ghamdi applauded the decision, although he remains an outcast, a sheikh whose positions rendered him unemployable in the Islamic kingdom.These days, he keeps a low profile because he still gets insults when he appears in public. He has no job, but publishes regular newspaper columns, mostly abroad.Near the end of our last conversation, his wife, Jawahir, entered the room, dressed in a black abaya, with her face showing. She shook my hand, exuding a cloud of fragrance, and sat next to her husband.The experience had changed her life in unexpected ways, she said. And like her husband, she had no regrets.\u201cWe sent our message, and the goal was not for us to keep appearing and to get famous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was to send a message to society that religion is not customs and traditions. Religion is something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Has a Chance to Run a Better Campaign, Not Just a Richer One", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkBill de Blasio came to office in 2014 with the best financial hand dealt to a New York mayor in at least a century, and probably longer, thanks to booms on Wall Street, in real estate prices, in midlevel job growth, in tourism, in population growth and in public safety. This has made everything easier, if not easy; abundance can cause headaches, but it is preferable to scarcity.Yet he has stumbled into one problem after another, some of his own making, while others were the product of mischief by people trying to weaken him.This week, he got word of what must qualify as good political news.The city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board decided on Wednesday that $4 million spent in 2014 and 2015 by political advocacy groups run by the mayor\u2019s allies would not count against the spending limit for his 2017 re-election campaign.Had the board ruled otherwise, that $4 million would have cost him a big chunk of his campaign budget. Under the city\u2019s public financing rules, a candidate can spend $6.9 million in the general election for mayor.Reforming the law was not Mr. Tusk\u2019s aim. He said in an interview on Thursday that a negative ruling would have cut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign budget by more than half.\u201cFor an opponent to start off with 60 percent more money, that would have been attractive,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. Instead, he said, it would be possible to raise \u201ceight figures\u201d from people interested in areas like charter schools and technology that could undermine Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign. The money would consist of independent expenditures and, Mr. Tusk said, would be subject to little regulation by the Campaign Finance Board.These schemes could represent authentic passion for change, or simply be commercial bluster on the part of Mr. Tusk, a former political aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and now a consultant.To date, Mr. de Blasio has not needed any outside help in creating headaches. There are multiple investigations underway of how the mayor and his allies raised money. People who wanted to do business with the city or get favorable hearings on land use were solicited for donations that were not subject to limits. By all appearances it was a pay-to-play operation, with not much in the way of costumes to disguise its purpose. But it may not have been criminal, either, given that the United States Supreme Court recently overturned the bribery conviction of a former governor of Virginia even though he and his wife accepted lavish gifts from a businessman who wanted the governor\u2019s help.In New York, there\u2019s no sign of any personal venality on the part of Mr. de Blasio. Instead, his ambitions, ideals or vanity served as the flywheel for the commerce of consultants.The political advocacy organizations controlled by the mayor\u2019s allies used the money to try to swing control of the State Senate to Democrats (which didn\u2019t work) and to advocate universal prekindergarten (which did go through). If Mr. de Blasio made friends with parents of small children, he made enemies of powerful Republicans in Albany. They have brought complaints now being investigated by the Manhattan district attorney. Maybe there are grounds for prosecution, maybe not.Even without new laws, Mr. de Blasio could cut off lobbyists and tell his own consultants that it\u2019s time to get off the gravy train. The mayor\u2019s spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, said this could hurt people stuck with the scarcities that trailed the abundance.\u201cIf you\u2019re serious about things like offering pre-K to everyone, building affordable housing and helping New Yorkers who need it the most, you cannot unilaterally disarm,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. Forgoing legal fund-raising would \u201clet those who will always have the most money to spend run the city,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio doesn\u2019t need the money. He\u2019s the mayor of Fat City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Private Equity Found Power and Profit in State Capitols", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 3Private equity firms have used sophisticated but indirect political maneuvering with state and local entities to smooth the way for growth and revenue.Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 Inside a cramped committee room on the cactus-dotted campus of Arizona\u2019s Capitol, Kelsey Lundy stepped to the podium to detail new legislation and the higher costs it would impose on struggling borrowers.But Ms. Lundy is not a lawmaker, a government employee or even a statehouse intern.She is a lobbyist for one of the nation\u2019s largest lenders.That lender \u2014 controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful private equity firms \u2014 wrote the bill. Months later, in 2014, the state\u2019s legislators passed the law, making it easier to charge interest of 36 percent to borrowers living on the financial margins.The political access in Arizona was just one component of a broader effort to loosen consumer protection laws, according to emails obtained through public records requests. In nine other states, Ms. Lundy\u2019s client helped win legislative changes, persuading lawmakers that it needed to raise costs to stay in business and serve borrowers.Since the 2008 financial crisis, Fortress and other private equity firms have rapidly expanded their influence, assuming a pervasive, if under-the-radar, role in daily American life, an investigation by The New York Times has found. Sophisticated political maneuvering \u2014 including winning government contracts, shaping public policy and deploying former public officials to press their case \u2014 is central to this growth.Yet even as private equity wields such influence in the halls of state capitols and in Washington, it faces little public awareness of its government activities, The Times found.Private equity firms often don\u2019t directly engage with legislators and regulators \u2014 the companies they control do. As a result, the firms themselves have emerged as relatively anonymous conglomerates that exert power behind the scenes in their dealings with governments. And because private equity\u2019s interests are so diverse, the industry interacts with governments not only through lobbying, but also as contractors and partners on public projects.Fortress, which manages more than $70 billion of investor money, encapsulates this new power dynamic.While little known outside Wall Street, Fortress covers a cross section of American life through companies it owns or manages. It controls the nation\u2019s largest nonbank collector of mortgage payments. It is building one of the country\u2019s few private passenger railroads. It helps oversee a company that manages public golf courses in several states. And it controls Ms. Lundy\u2019s client, Springleaf Financial Services, a huge provider of subprime loans to borrowers with few other options aside from payday lenders often charging 300 percent.The Times\u2019s investigation \u2014 based on thousands of pages of government records, court papers and securities filings, as well as interviews with borrowers, regulators and executives \u2014 pieced together how these seemingly disparate companies fall under the umbrella of one powerful private equity firm. The investigation also shed new light on the tactics these companies have used to reshape laws that hindered their growth.In Texas, Springleaf helped persuade lawmakers to allow for higher administrative fees. Springleaf won permission elsewhere to charge the maximum allowable rates \u2014 36 percent in Arizona and Indiana, higher than some credit cards \u2014 to a greater number of loans than ever before. And it pushed legislation allowing it to sell various insurance policies, including life and accidental death and dismemberment, which it lumps into the balance of its loans.In Arizona, Springleaf forged such cozy ties with lawmakers that the two sides became all but inseparable in the bill-writing process. One legislative official emailed Ms. Lundy: \u201cIf there is a specific statute that you want to mirror, please tell me the statute number. Thank you so much!\u201d Another Springleaf lobbyist, when job-hunting, listed the sponsor of the Springleaf bill as an employment reference.In Florida, where Fortress is building the passenger railroad, the firm took advantage of revolving-door politics: political aides becoming lobbyists, and vice versa. When an adviser to the governor moved into the private sector, he advocated for the train project, then returned to the governor\u2019s office as chief of staff.Fortress\u2019s interaction with Los Angeles County was rockier, and it reflected the firm\u2019s complex web of financial interests. Los Angeles County officials believed that Fortress was buying the company responsible for upkeep of public golf courses. The county, swayed by Fortress\u2019s long track record in owning golf courses, approved the deal.There was one problem: Fortress was not the buyer.The Times investigation found that the buyer was the Newcastle Investment Corporation, a different company with no golf experience and a history of financial problems. County officials were surprised to learn the buyer\u2019s identity from The Times.Fortress said there was no need for county officials to worry. Newcastle pays Fortress to manage its business and investments.Wesley Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who co-founded Fortress and is now its co-chairman, also emphasized the positive effects of Fortress\u2019s companies across the American economy. Fortress has replaced poorly performing banks, he pointed out, and has funded projects that no government could afford.\u201cWe are proud of the impact that Fortress-related companies have provided to the individuals and communities that they serve,\u201d Mr. Edens, who is also an owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, said in a statement.In an interview, Mr. Edens said that Fortress did not create Springleaf\u2019s lobbying campaign, but supported it. Springleaf said it needed to raise costs to modify outdated laws and compete with less regulated lenders. And although Springleaf wants to raise costs on borrowers at a time of historically low interest rates, he said that the company was \u201cso much more humane\u201d than others offering high-interest loans.Some customers agree. Joseph King, a Springleaf customer in Glendale, Ariz., said, \u201cThey\u2019ve done right by me,\u201d offering him credit when few others would.Some public agencies also applaud Fortress for creating jobs \u2014 the firm estimates as many as 10,000 with the Florida railroad alone \u2014 and for investing in fields that others abandoned after the financial crisis.Private equity firms, onetime \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d that made their name taking over distressed companies, have pushed into activities previously dominated by banks and local governments. This shift has upended the definition of private equity as the industry expands into real estate, infrastructure and lending.Although that transformation granted private equity new influence over government, Mr. Edens disputed that political connections generated special favors for the firm.\u201cThere is nothing surprising about support these companies have received, given the benefits they deliver to a broad cross section of Americans,\u201d he said.Surrounded by his business partners and his daughters, Wes Edens stepped onto the balcony at the New York Stock Exchange, rang the opening bell and walked away a billionaire. It was Feb. 9, 2007, the day Fortress became the first Wall Street firm with a big private equity business to go public.It was a pivotal moment for Mr. Edens, a Montana native with a mop of blond hair. For private equity, a relative newcomer to modern capitalism, it showed that the industry had arrived.Everywhere includes the government. The amount the private equity industry spent on lobbying in 2015 was more than triple what it had spent a decade earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At the peak of the financial crisis, the figure was even higher. Political donations have increased nearly sixfold. Former House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s chief of staff is now president of the industry\u2019s lobbying group.That group, the American Investment Council, argues that the public has benefited from private equity. Pension funds have reaped 12 percent net returns from private equity over a recent 10-year period, the group said.\u201cPrivate equity funds have an aligned interest with their investors to produce strong returns,\u201d said Bronwyn Bailey of the American Investment Council.The group also noted that the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, subjected private equity fund managers to additional oversight from regulators. Yet the group is lobbying the House to pass legislation that would unwind some of those requirements, government records reviewed by The Times show, underscoring the industry\u2019s newfound influence.Fortress\u2019s 2010 takeover of Springleaf, the subprime lender, further illustrates private equity\u2019s evolution from niche industry into one of Wall Street\u2019s most influential players. It also shows how a firm\u2019s influence can flow from the companies it owns.Springleaf\u2019s businesses were previously in the hands of the American International Group and Citigroup, two Wall Street powerhouses that needed billions of dollars in government bailouts to survive. Since buying Springleaf, Fortress has turned its $124 million investment into a stake valued at $1.9 billion.The lender\u2019s lobbying underpins some of that growth. In state house after state house, Springleaf lobbyists secured legislative victories, allowing the company to raise costs on borrowers.Springleaf argued that its successes were not particularly sweeping, noting that it lost in at least two states. \u201cBecause many state legislators don\u2019t have sufficient legislative staffs or staff members with subject-matter expertise, if you want something done, you sometimes have to write the first draft yourself,\u201d said John Anderson, an executive vice president at Springleaf. \u201cIt is unusual for legislation we propose to be enacted verbatim.\u201dOne of Springleaf\u2019s arguments to lawmakers has been that, without legislative changes, it would need to close more branches \u2014 driving borrowers to payday lenders. In 2008, Springleaf said, it had 21 Arizona branches, and at the time of the 2014 legislation seven remained.In contrast with higher-cost payday lenders, Springleaf offers installment loans that typically are larger and last longer. After buying its largest competitor last year and rebranding as OneMain Financial, the company is now the nation\u2019s largest installment lender.Springleaf charges more than banks because its customers are riskier bets. According to Mr. Anderson, who says he reads every complaint that customers submit to regulators, Springleaf caps rates at 36 percent. The average Springleaf loan totals about $6,093 and costs 26 percent, plus fees.At a Springleaf branch in a Phoenix strip mall, Gary Hundley agreed to pay nearly 36 percent on much of his roughly $4,500 loan. He also took out unemployment and life insurance policies from Springleaf.Mr. Hundley repaid an earlier Springleaf loan, he said, and planned to chip away at the second, when medical problems forced him to miss work. About a month after taking out the second Springleaf loan, Mr. Hundley filed for bankruptcy, largely because of other debts unrelated to Springleaf.Springleaf then sued him, arguing that he had never intended to repay. As a result, Mr. Hundley is still liable for part of the debt, according to his lawyer, Anthony Clark, who said Springleaf \u201cis no stranger to bringing these kinds of suits.\u201d\u201cI was overwhelmed, but I planned to pay,\u201d said Mr. Hundley, who had no trouble obtaining Springleaf loans despite previously declaring bankruptcy.Springleaf noted that in other bankruptcy cases it has agreed to lower payments. And it is within the company\u2019s rights to sue.But Springleaf has occasionally straddled a legal line, records and interviews show.Consider the company\u2019s insurance business. Although Springleaf\u2019s life insurance and other policies are voluntary \u2014 and the company fully refunds premiums to borrowers who cancel their policies within 30 days \u2014 some policies are opened without customers\u2019 approving them at the time.For instance, if a borrower pledges a car as collateral for a loan, but the auto insurance appears to have lapsed or is insufficient, Springleaf can impose its own insurance. Although Springleaf warns borrowers beforehand, and routinely cancels its coverage once they obtain an adequate policy, Springleaf acknowledged in a public filing that \u201cbecause our customers do not affirmatively consent\u201d to the insurance when it is purchased, \u201cregulators may in the future prohibit\u201d it.Some borrowers have separately complained to regulators that Springleaf embellished the collateral underpinning their loans.Lisa Williams, a 50-year-old administrative assistant in Winston-Salem, N.C., noticed an irregularity after receiving a roughly $3,700 Springleaf loan: A lawn mower she posted as collateral was valued at $800.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that that old thing was worth $800,\u201d she said, giggling. A similar new mower retails for about $300.Loren Finnell, a mechanic in Tempe, Ariz., said he obtained a loan in 2014 after Springleaf listed a Dell computer and accessories worth $2,000. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a Dell. They were making it up.\u201dFor Sheila Fargnoli, of Tucson, getting a loan from Springleaf was like a game of Mad Libs. A Springleaf employee, she recalled, asked questions like, \u201cYou must have a computer, right?\u201d The employee also asked about musical instruments, but Ms. Fargnoli said she had previously sold her guitar for $1 at a yard sale.Nonetheless, Springleaf listed the guitar as collateral in the loan documents, Ms. Fargnoli noticed. She accused Springleaf in court papers of pressuring her to \u201cmisrepresent the value\u201d of collateral, which Springleaf did not dispute.Springleaf said that the problems were isolated and that it had curtailed the use of household items as collateral. It also now prohibits using anything of immaterial value \u2014 say, a $1 guitar \u2014 to secure loans.The complaints have emerged as Springleaf presses its statehouse lobbying campaign.\u201cJust in case you needed a little light reading, attached is the draft legislation that Springleaf would like to move forward,\u201d Ms. Lundy, the Arizona lobbyist, emailed a Republican aide.Springleaf asked Representative T. J. Shope, a Republican, to sponsor the bill. And when a consumer advocate, Cynthia Zwick, published an op-ed article opposing the bill, Ms. Lundy contacted Mr. Shope to say, \u201cYou should do a response.\u201d Later she added, \u201cLet\u2019s work on one tomorrow.\u201dMs. Lundy also testified at hearings alongside Mr. Shope. Unable to answer a question, Mr. Shope deferred to Ms. Lundy. The lobbyist, he added, was \u201chere to answer a lot of the technical questions.\u201dNot all of Ms. Lundy\u2019s statements were accurate. In a \u201cfact sheet\u201d to lawmakers, she claimed that \u201csimilar legislation has passed in numerous states\u201d with \u201conly one state having opposition from one consumer advocacy group, none from AARP.\u201d Yet consumer advocates opposed the legislation in Florida and Indiana, and AARP attacked it in North Carolina.Springleaf said it was unaware of the opposition at the time. Ms. Lundy and Mr. Shope declined to comment.Their bill\u2019s passage coincided with what Representative Debbie McCune Davis, an Arizona Democrat who opposed the bill, called \u201cwining and dining.\u201dSpringleaf\u2019s lobbyists treated Mr. Shope to \u201cfood or beverages\u201d soon after the bill passed, lobbying records show. And about a week after the Arizona bill passed, an email circulated in the House, alerting staff members that \u201cdinner is courtesy of\u201d Ms. Lundy.After similar legislation passed in North Carolina, Springleaf held a dinner for more than a dozen state lawmakers and their staff members. Still, some Democratic officials lamented the bill\u2019s impact on borrowers.\u201cIt\u2019s like needing a life preserver and getting an anvil,\u201d said Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general.Around the country, local officials opened letters from the American Golf Corporation, which managed their public golf courses. Fortress was buying the company, the letters announced.That seemed to be good news.American Golf\u2019s letters, which Fortress helped draft, promoted Fortress\u2019s \u201cconsiderable experience with companies like ours.\u201d Some officials also received a document, stamped with Fortress\u2019s logo, citing the firm\u2019s ownership of other golf courses and its \u201cfirsthand experience\u201d owning companies that form partnerships with local governments. To seal the 2013 deal, the letters included Fortress\u2019s annual report showing its \u201csubstantial resources.\u201dThe pitch worked.Parks department officials in New York City, and in Ventura County and San Dimas, Calif., promptly signed off on the deal. Los Angeles County took longer to scrutinize Fortress\u2019s background before granting approval.But none of the officials had the full story. The buyer was not Fortress, but Newcastle Investment Corporation, The Times found in filings. The distinction \u2014 Newcastle is a different company with a close business relationship to Fortress \u2014 suggests that complex corporate structures can confuse governments and benefit private equity.All four parks departments said they were not told about Newcastle until contacted by The Times. Fortress and American Golf \u201cshould have fully disclosed accurate and complete information,\u201d Los Angeles County officials said in a statement.If they had examined Newcastle, officials might have seen red flags. Newcastle had suffered a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in internal controls two years earlier and received a \u201cfinancial health grade\u201d of D from the independent investment research firm Morningstar. In securities filings Newcastle acknowledged, \u201cWe have never owned or operated a golf business.\u201dUnder Newcastle, American Golf took over some courses from competitors that were failing to pay rent.And yet, during Newcastle\u2019s tenure, American Golf may not always benefit Los Angeles County. If Newcastle again runs into financial trouble, American Golf might have to be sold once more, a process that could eat up more government resources.American Golf, which must pay the county a cut of what it makes on carts and other golfing gear, also recently created a program that effectively minimizes some of those payments. Golfers who join the program do not pay for certain items that would be lucrative for the county. The program classifies the membership fee under driving ranges, which typically require a smaller payment to the county.Fortress, which argues that the program has attracted more golfers to the county, has benefited from the arrangement. Because Newcastle, and not Fortress, was the buyer, Fortress can enjoy the upside of American Golf without much risk. It works like this: Newcastle pays Fortress a fee to manage Newcastle\u2019s business. But Fortress does not own a majority stake in Newcastle. So, if American Golf proves unprofitable, Fortress still collects fees from Newcastle, while avoiding major losses.These deals are a source of revenue for Fortress, whose executives have created five other companies like Newcastle. Last year, Fortress received more than $200 million in revenue from these companies, about a 50 percent jump from the year before.The golf course deal could serve as a cautionary tale for both private equity firms and the growing number of governments doing business with them. Unlike a typical private equity deal, transactions with public agencies call for greater transparency.Fortress, which has not been accused of wrongdoing by the governments, argues that it was transparent in the golf deal. The firm said it was speaking on behalf of Newcastle, which relies on it for day-to-day management. Although Newcastle has its own shareholders and board, Fortress is responsible for the company\u2019s management, investments and other business decisions.In a statement, Fortress said that \u201cthere is no mystery about who owns American Golf\u201d because it \u201cis very clear\u201d in Newcastle\u2019s securities filings.But these filings were published after the local governments approved the deal.Fortress also pointed to a document labeled \u201cdraft,\u201d which it said American Golf emailed to one Los Angeles County official, making reference to \u201cNewcastle Investment Corp. and other funds.\u201dThat official said he had no record of receiving the email. American Golf acknowledged that it had not sent the document to other towns.\u201cIt\u2019s like being told you were getting a big red fire truck and then it turns out you get a little red wagon,\u201d said Eric Preven, a TV producer who ran for public office in Los Angeles. With the help of his brother Joshua, a teacher, he first raised suspicions about the American Golf deal more than two years ago.Still, the quality of golf courses has not suffered since Newcastle bought American Golf, Los Angeles County said. Officials often vote an American Golf course best in the county.Newcastle and American Golf don\u2019t own the courses. Instead, as part of an outsourcing plan, American Golf manages operations, making money every time a golfer tees off.Even before Newcastle bought American Golf from Goldman Sachs, it retained a well-connected local lobbyist: Matt Knabe, whose father is Don Knabe, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. American Golf hosts the Knabe Cup, an annual youth tournament named in honor of the senior Mr. Knabe.His son\u2019s lobbying firm, when questioned by local media about the relationship, has previously said there is no conflict because \u201cMatt does not lobby\u201d his father. There is no indication the Knabes directed American Golf to play down Newcastle\u2019s role.In 2013, Don Knabe and the county board approved the sale of American Golf. At the time, the board appeared impressed with Fortress\u2019s track record in working closely with local governments \u2014 citing in particular a letter from a Florida official praising Fortress.In that letter, the official from Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation said he \u201chad the pleasure\u201d of working alongside Fortress in building a passenger railway known as All Aboard Florida.12 PhotosAlong a 200-mile stretch of Florida\u2019s eastern coast, Fortress is embarking on its boldest project yet: the nation\u2019s only purely private intercity passenger railroad.The project, All Aboard Florida, is expected to take five years and nearly $3 billion to build. At speeds reaching 100 miles an hour, it plans to eventually carry passengers from Miami to Orlando, with stops in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.And if trains start rolling next year, as planned, and prove successful, the project may provide a template for private investment in public infrastructure for years to come.Yet this ambitious private project hinged on the blessing of government officials.The administration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida conditionally agreed to lease out state property to All Aboard Florida, which plans to share the track with an existing freight train company. Federal regulators, after some initial concerns, concluded that the railroad\u2019s safety plans met their standards. And a state-authorized nonprofit approved tax-free bonds that can help finance All Aboard Florida\u2019s business.Fortress, which owns both the passenger train and the freight rail, secured these victories through a mix of negotiations, public support, political power and a revolving door between the government and the private sector.Documents obtained through public records requests pull back a curtain on the lobbying that shaped the project. The documents, many previously unreported, spotlight the role played by Governor Scott\u2019s aides.The governor\u2019s former campaign manager teamed up with one of his former policy advisers to coordinate All Aboard Florida\u2019s media strategy and meetings with the governor\u2019s administration. They found a receptive audience, including an aide to Governor Scott who texted a Fortress employee, \u201cLet me know if I can be helpful.\u201dFortress stands to benefit from the project in several ways.The firm owns All Aboard Florida\u2019s parent company, as well as the freight train operator sharing the track, which means it would profit from All Aboard Florida\u2019s success. Fortress also controls land around the track, where it is developing rental housing. And even if the passenger rail flops, Fortress might benefit from All Aboard Florida\u2019s track upgrades, which would enable its freight operator to carry more cargo at quicker speeds.(Fortress disputes this point, arguing that the upgrades are not needed to improve its freight operations.)Not everyone will benefit.Along Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast \u2014 oceanfront counties that include some of the state\u2019s richest and poorest areas \u2014 some residents worry that the train will disrupt their lives. In one county, the sheriff argued that the trains, 32 each day, \u201ccould have life-threatening implications\u201d if they stranded patrol cars on one side of the tracks as trains passed. A hospital executive warned about ambulances idling at crossings. Two counties sued to halt the tax-free bonds.Some residents also express a deeper concern: The train is literally passing them by. Towns without stops will get the headaches of rail traffic rumbling through, without the economic benefits.In Gifford, a low-income community pockmarked with abandoned homes, residents say they already live on the wrong side of the tracks. Fortress\u2019s freight trains park there to exchange crews, delaying traffic and prompting local outcry.Fortress sees it differently, arguing that the freight trains stop there because it is safe to do so. Mr. Edens, who said the passenger line was open to adding more stops, remarked that \u201cthe handful of opponents of the project are focused on their own narrow self-interests, not the greater good.\u201dWhile critics say All Aboard Florida is unnecessary \u2014 a small number of Amtrak trains already travel from Miami to Orlando \u2014 Mr. Edens said it had the potential to revitalize local economies because mass transit is \u201cone of the real cornerstones of economic growth.\u201d He called it a \u201creal guidepost for how we can actually bring passenger trains back to the United States.\u201dConcerns that the new trains could cause traffic delays are unfounded, he said, citing data estimating that All Aboard Florida trains would take 45 seconds to clear crossings. All Aboard Florida said that it would be the only railroad in the country to operate \u201cin full compliance with the latest and most stringent\u201d federal safety requirements, and that it would help reduce car travel in the state.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about seconds,\u201d Mr. Edens said, adding that it was \u201cnot a meaningful\u201d amount of time.William D. Snyder, the sheriff of Martin County, disagreed. \u201cIn my business, seconds absolutely matter,\u201d he said.The train\u2019s opponents dispute some of All Aboard Florida\u2019s data about how long the trains will block intersections, saying the company\u2019s assessment is based on best-case assumptions. Bob Solari, a commissioner in Indian River County, said that All Aboard Florida did not in \u201cany meaningful way protect the people and property of the Treasure Coast.\u201dThe safety concerns, however, did not ruin the railroad project, thanks in part to some political arm-twisting.All Aboard Florida took shape after Governor Scott rejected $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money for high-speed rail between Orlando and Tampa, saying it made Florida taxpayers liable for losses. That decision, in 2011, effectively helped clear a path for an alternative train, though All Aboard Florida was still in its infancy at the time.Adam Hollingsworth was one of the governor\u2019s aides involved in the decision to reject the stimulus money, emails show. At the time, he was a volunteer policy adviser. Months later, he went to work for one of All Aboard Florida\u2019s sister companies.To push for the Fortress railway, Mr. Hollingsworth initially coordinated with Susan Wiles, Governor Scott\u2019s former campaign manager. The railway also retained a lawyer who had previously worked for a government agency from which it needed a permit.This team\u2019s background was helpful to All Aboard Florida, records show.The day before Mr. Edens of Fortress was to meet with the governor\u2019s office, Mr. Hollingsworth texted a staff member. \u201cYou met Wes at the gov\u2019s Christmas party,\u201d he reminded her, referring to Mr. Edens.After the meeting, Mr. Hollingsworth wrote the aide: \u201cThank you! I am glad you and the gov were favorable inclined.\u201dMr. Hollingsworth followed up when All Aboard Florida was about to announce its plans publicly. The aide responded, \u201cGreat news!\u201dAbout four months later, Mr. Hollingsworth resumed working for the governor\u2019s office, as chief of staff. Ethics rules prevented him from having further involvement with the train.Mr. Hollingsworth did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Wiles praised him, saying he had honored his recusal. All Aboard Florida said it \u201cdid not need nor use Adam\u201d beyond the scope of his duties, noting that it hired Ballard Partners, a prominent Florida lobbying firm.A spokeswoman for Governor Scott added that the state did not finance All Aboard Florida.Still, the company has benefited from government support. In addition to various regulatory approvals, All Aboard Florida has applied for funding from the federal railroad agency. And it accepted about $9 million in federal funds.In the future, it hopes to fund itself through bonds approved by the Florida Development Finance Corporation, a state-authorized nonprofit. The bonds are tax-exempt, but All Aboard Florida, not the government, is responsible for repaying them.Last year, the nonprofit\u2019s board approved the bonds, which All Aboard Florida has yet to issue. Here, too, lobbying was at work.Before the board held a crucial hearing on the bonds, an All Aboard Florida representative emailed one of the board\u2019s new members a reminder to submit the paperwork by close of business the next day \u201cin order to get confirmed by the Senate.\u201dThe email added, \u201cCan I help with this?\u201dBen Protess reported from Phoenix and Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Rachel Abrams reported from New York. Ron Nixon, Peter Eavis and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed reporting.Read more in this series:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Deals Rely on Being Creative With the Truth", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byConfronted in a court case about this last untruth, Mr. Trump was anything but chagrined. \u201cI\u2019m talking to a television station,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do want to put the best spin on the property.\u201dAs Mr. Trump prepares to claim the Republican nomination for president this week, he and his supporters are sure to laud his main calling card \u2014 his long, operatic record as a swaggering business tycoon. And without question, there will be successes aplenty to highlight, from his gleaming golden high-rises to his well-regarded golf resorts, hit TV shows and best-selling books.But a survey of Mr. Trump\u2019s four decades of wheeling and dealing also reveals an equally operatic record of dissembling and deception, some of it unabashedly confirmed by Mr. Trump himself, who nearly 30 years ago first extolled the business advantages of \u201ctruthful hyperbole.\u201d Indeed, based on the mountain of court records churned out over the span of Mr. Trump\u2019s career, it is hard to find a project he touched that did not produce allegations of broken promises, blatant lies or outright fraud.Taken as a whole, though, an examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s business career reveals persistent patterns in the way Mr. Trump bends or breaks the truth \u2014 patterns that may already feel familiar to those watching his campaign.First and foremost is Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency toward the self-aggrandizing fib \u2014 as if it were not impressive enough to be paid $400,000 for a speech. What also emerges is a nearly reflexive habit of telling his target audience precisely what he thinks it wants to hear \u2014 such as promising Trump University students they will learn all his real estate secrets from his \u201chandpicked\u201d instructors. And finally, there is the pattern already deeply familiar to his political opponents \u2014 making spurious claims against adversaries under Mr. Trump\u2019s oft-stated theory that the best defense is a scorched-earth offense.Equally striking is his Houdiniesque ability to wiggle away from all but the most skilled and determined efforts to corner him in an apparent lie. In interviews, lawyers who have tangled with Mr. Trump in court cases are sometimes reduced to sputtering, astonished rage, calling him \u201cborderline pathological\u201d and \u201cthe Michelangelo of deception\u201d as they attempt to describe the ease with which Mr. Trump weaves his own versions of reality.\u201cHe\u2019s a bully, and bullies aren\u2019t known for their veracity,\u201d said Richard C. Seltzer, a retired senior partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer who confronted Mr. Trump in three real estate lawsuits.In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Trump defended his integrity as a businessman \u2014 \u201cI shoot very straight\u201d \u2014 and argued that those who accuse him of acting in bad faith are often the same people he has outmaneuvered in deals.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to quote people that I\u2019ve beat? Are you going to quote people that I out-dealt?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cI\u2019ll give you hundreds of names of people that have dealt with me that say I\u2019m very honest.\u201dThe taxonomy of Mr. Trump\u2019s business deceptions has been the subject of legal and journalistic scrutiny for decades. A Fortune magazine article from 2000 memorably described Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201castonishing ability to prevaricate\u201d this way: \u201cBut when Trump says he owns 10 percent of the Plaza Hotel, understand that what he actually means is that he has the right to 10 percent of the profit if it\u2019s ever sold. When he says he\u2019s building a \u201890-story building\u2019 next to the U.N., he means a 72-story building that has extra-high ceilings. And when he says his casino company is the \u2018largest employer in the state of New Jersey,\u2019 he actually means to say it is the eighth largest.\u201dThe casino magnate Steve Wynn, a sometimes friend and sometimes foe of Mr. Trump\u2019s, took up the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s honesty in an interview with New York magazine. \u201cHis statements to people like you, whether they concern us and our projects or our motivations or his own reality or his own future or his own present you have seen over the years have no relation to truth or fact,\u201d Mr. Wynn said.Some of the earliest documented examples of Mr. Trump\u2019s deceptive business tactics come from none other than Mr. Trump, who in books and in interviews sometimes seems to delight in describing the brazen bluffs and well-timed trickery he used to claw his way to the upper echelons of New York City\u2019s cutthroat real estate world.Mr. Trump was particularly proud of a stratagem he employed in 1982, when he was trying to entice Holiday Inn to invest in a casino he was building in Atlantic City. The board of directors decided to visit Atlantic City, which worried Mr. Trump because he had precious little actual construction to show off. So Mr. Trump ordered his construction supervisor to cram every bulldozer and dump truck he could find into the nearly vacant construction site.\u201cWhat the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn\u2019t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it. If they got some actual work accomplished, all the better, but if necessary, he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other.\u201dA week later, when Mr. Trump escorted the Holiday Inn executives to the site, one board member wanted to know why a worker was filling a hole he had just dug. \u201cThis was difficult for me to answer, but fortunately, this board member was more curious than he was skeptical,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, boasting that weeks later Holiday Inn agreed to invest in his casino.\u201cThat\u2019s called \u2018business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday of the episode.In court cases against Mr. Trump \u2014 USA Today counted 3,500 lawsuits involving Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump estimates he has testified more than 100 times \u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers frequently return to the same two paragraphs from \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\u201cI call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion.\u201dIn depositions, lawyers have repeatedly probed for the limits of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d or, as one lawyer framed it, the distinction Mr. Trump makes between \u201cinnocent exaggeration\u201d and \u201cguilty exaggeration.\u201dNo such dinners ever took place, Mr. Trump acknowledged. In fact, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single one of the instructors he claimed to have handpicked, even after he was shown their photographs. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump was not bothered by the script\u2019s false insinuation of real estate secrets shared over chummy dinners. Asked if this example constituted \u201cinnocent exaggeration,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019d say that\u2019s an innocent exaggeration.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump argued that the script might fall under the legal concept of \u201cpuffery\u201d \u2014 which many legal dictionaries define as an exaggeration or statement that \u201cno reasonable person\u201d would take as factual. And in any event, he continued, the true sinners in the Trump University case are the students who sued him even after giving rave reviews in their written evaluations of the seminars. \u201cI think that\u2019s dishonest,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump has been repeatedly accused of bringing false legal claims to avoid paying debts and evade contractual obligations. As far back as 1983, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump filed a \u201cspurious\u201d lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building.At trial, Mr. Trump was unable to produce a single document showing harm to his business. But his certitude never wavered, even after Ms. Corcoran\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Seltzer, confronted him with article after article in which Mr. Trump himself had discussed with reporters much of the same \u201cconfidential\u201d information he accused Ms. Corcoran\u2019s team of divulging.\u201cThere is something very belligerent about the way he presents facts, as if he thinks nobody will have the balls to stand up to him,\u201d Mr. Seltzer said in an interview. (In dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s suit against Ms. Corcoran, the judge said the only damages he could identify were to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbruised ego.\u201d)In Friday\u2019s interview, Mr. Trump denied filing frivolous court cases, insisting, \u201cI\u2019ve won a massive majority of the litigation I\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d He pointed to the USA Today survey of his 3,500 legal cases. Although the newspaper could not determine who had prevailed in the vast majority of the cases, it did find Mr. Trump the clear winner in 450 suits and the clear loser in 38.And, indeed, for all of the litigation Mr. Trump has attracted or spawned, for all of the times he has been accused of ruinous dishonesty, the legal and regulatory record is surprisingly bare of official findings by judges, juries or regulators that Mr. Trump engaged in perjury or improper deception or actual fraud.A rare exception came after Mr. Trump decided to demolish a department store to make way for his Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Trump\u2019s demolition contractor hired about 200 unauthorized Polish laborers, paying them as little as $4 an hour to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The case ended up in federal court after some workers were shortchanged even these wages.Mr. Trump protested that he knew nothing about the use of unauthorized workers \u2014 even though workers testified that they saw him visiting the site and some witnesses said that Mr. Trump and the executive he assigned to oversee the demolition were well aware of what was going on. In 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr., ruled that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s denials, there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that he and his subordinates and his contractor had conspired to hire the Polish workers and deprive them of employment benefits. He awarded them $325,415 in damages.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.But in case after case, Mr. Trump has displayed a special talent for turning what should be cold hard facts into semantic mush. Perhaps the most famous example of this skill came when Mr. Trump was asked under oath a seemingly straightforward question: Had he ever lied about his net worth? Mr. Trump responded, \u201cMy net worth fluctuates and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.\u201dPart of what makes Mr. Trump such an elusive target is that his paper trail is often minimal. Mr. Trump has repeatedly testified that he does not use computers. He says he also throws away his day planner each month, and just last year he testified that he did not own a smartphone. \u201cUnlike Hillary Clinton, I\u2019m not a big email fan,\u201d he said, leaving open the question of how he posts to Twitter.Mr. Trump is also adept at deflecting blame to his staff. In two of his books, Mr. Trump made the startling and, as it turned out, bogus claim that he had once performed the remarkable feat of climbing out from under more than $9 billion in debt. Mr. Trump blamed his ghostwriter for the mistake. Asked if he reads his books before publication, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI read it as quickly as I can because of time constraints.\u201dMr. Trump is also the beneficiary of miraculously well-timed memory lapses. In suit after suit, the man who claims to possess one of world\u2019s best memories suddenly seems to have chronic memory loss when asked about critical facts or events.Such was the case when Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit against Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, the author of \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.\u201d Among other things, Mr. Trump asserted that \u201cTrumpNation\u201d cost him a \u201cdeal made in heaven\u201d with a group of Italian investors, men he had met and who were on the brink of signing a business partnership that would have made him hundreds of millions of dollars. Their names? He could not recall. \u201cTrumpNation\u201d also cost him a hotel deal with Russian investors, he said. He could not remember their names, either. He was certain the book also ruined a deal with Turkish investors. Again, he could not recall any names. Polish investors also got cold feet after they read Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s book. Their names escaped him, too. The book also scared off investors from Ukraine. Alas, he could not think of their names either.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Solving the Yankee Equation, One Number at a Time", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byMichael Fishman has been on a surfboard once in his life \u2014 and it was fleeting, a lesson he took with his wife on their honeymoon in Hawaii.So when Billy Eppler, an avid surfer and Fishman\u2019s colleague with the Yankees, cajoled some of his office mates into entering Surfer Magazine\u2019s fantasy surfing contest years ago, he had little idea what he was unleashing.Fishman, poring over the rules, discovered a loophole: You could enter as many teams as you wanted as long as you used different email addresses. So Fishman developed a database of scores from the previous five years of competitions and built his own metrics for ranking and valuing surfers. Then he created new email addresses and entered his teams.Among the nearly 18,000 entrants chasing the grand prize of a trip for two to Australia, Fishman finished first.And second.And sixth, ninth, 11th and 18th.\u201cWhen he won, there was a lot of head-shaking,\u201d said Eppler, who is now the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 general manager and has friends on the pro surfing circuit. \u201cThey\u2019re like, This guy doesn\u2019t even surf.\u201dThe result was so unnerving that Surfer Magazine changed the contest rules, invoking what it called the Fishman Clause. Beginning in 2011, entries have been limited to one per person.Meanwhile, that ability to solve problems, and the mastery of data to predict performance, have made Fishman, 37, one of General Manager Brian Cashman\u2019s trusted deputies.As the Yankees confront a major retooling, Fishman, an assistant general manager who oversees one of baseball\u2019s largest analytics staffs, will have a prominent voice \u2014 either in the coming days if they shed some of their more coveted assets, like reliever Aroldis Chapman, or after the season, when they can go about reinvesting the more than $53 million in salary that will be coming off their books.\u201cYou want to make the best, most informed decision you can, so the deeper you can dig on something the better,\u201d Cashman said.When the Yankees hired Fishman in 2005, two years after the publication of \u201cMoneyball\u201d and four years after he graduated summa cum laude from Yale with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics, he was their analytics department.It has since grown to include seven analysts, five system developers and several interns who work under him. Seven former interns have landed analytics jobs with other teams, Fishman said.Baseball\u2019s analytics boom is hardly a secret. The Oakland Athletics, the Tampa Bay Rays and the Pittsburgh Pirates have been the subject of books detailing how losing teams with low payrolls used data to build winners. The Boston Red Sox long ago hired Bill James, the godfather of modern sports statistical analysis, and executives like the Houston Astros\u2019 Jeff Luhnow and the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Andrew Friedman have been closely identified with the use of analytics in multiple organizations.Yet the transformation of the Yankees, rarely known for being discreet about anything, has taken place with little fanfare. Still, when ESPN last year rated every team in the four major professional sports leagues on their commitment to analytics, the Yankees were ranked sixth among 122 teams.\u201cThe perceived motivation for analytics for teams like Tampa is they didn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend, and they were looking for the diamonds in the rough,\u201d said Ben Baumer, an assistant professor of statistical and data sciences at Smith College who previously worked in analytics for the Mets and who wrote the ESPN article. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the Yankees\u2019 problem.\u201dBut, Baumer added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is true anymore.\u201dThough the Yankees still are profligate spenders \u2014 their $226 million payroll is second behind the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 \u2014 baseball\u2019s revenue-sharing program has helped level the playing field in recent years. So, too, have the reams of data that are now available thanks to sophisticated cameras that can track minutiae like the spin rate on a curveball.\u201cPeople off the field can have a legitimate impact on the field,\u201d Yankees third baseman Chase Headley said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re at: Either you embrace it, or you\u2019re not going to be around, because that\u2019s the way the game is going.\u201dThe Yankees\u2019 turn toward analytics has taken many forms. They have used pitch-framing data to evaluate catchers, coveting ones who excel at getting borderline pitches called strikes. They have been among baseball\u2019s most shift-happy teams, placing fielders where their statistical models say balls are most likely to be hit \u2014 not just by a particular hitter, but in a particular count.They have also assembled a pitching staff that leads baseball in strikeout-to-walk ratio and has the highest ground-ball percentage in the American League, categories that are darlings of the statistical set.This season has also seen a profound shift in the Yankees\u2019 approach at the plate. For years, they have been among the most patient teams in baseball, but overnight the Yankees have become one of the most aggressive, going from third in pitches per at-bat last year to 25th this season with virtually the same lineup.As one of their performance-science initiatives, the Yankees have even used eye-tracking devices, which might help predict or improve reaction times \u2014 a potentially useful tool for hitters.In addition, the decisions to acquire players like catcher Brian McCann, Headley, outfielder Dustin Ackley and the former Yankees Brandon McCarthy, Chris Young and Nick Swisher were driven significantly by what the Yankees found by digging deeply into numbers.\u201cIt would be na\u00efve to think we\u2019re all here because of old-fashioned scouting,\u201d reliever Andrew Miller said.Fishman is circumspect in discussing the Yankees\u2019 analytics work in detail.\u201cIf we find an inefficiency to the game that we can exploit and then it\u2019s made public, it\u2019s no longer an inefficiency,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cEverybody knows about it.\u201dHe added: \u201cPeople who do research in baseball are making a choice: I\u2019m going to do something that\u2019s going to the benefit of the team that\u2019s going to help them win games, and my research is not going to be made public. I\u2019m not going to get the glory for my research.\u201dIn fact, it is sometimes quite the contrary.The Hall of Fame pitcher Goose Gossage, a former Yankee, in an expletive-peppered interview with ESPN.com in March, lamented the increasing number of high-ranking baseball executives with elite college degrees who had not played the game.\u201cThe game is becoming a freaking joke because of the nerds who are running it,\u201d Gossage said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what has happened: These guys played rotisserie baseball at Harvard or wherever they went, and they thought they figured the game out.\u201dIn actuality, Gossage said, they did not know anything.When Gossage\u2019s rant was being discussed on a television in the Yankees\u2019 clubhouse during spring training, a team employee called out with a playful laugh to one of the analytics staffers passing by: \u201cHey, nerd: They\u2019re talking about you.\u201dGossage\u2019s comments were met mostly with eye-rolling, just another crank shouting at children to get off his lawn, and they also earned him a scolding from Cashman. Fishman shrugged it off, even if Gossage could have been talking about him.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of randomness in baseball, so sometimes you\u2019re right and sometimes you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cBut for the most part, I think we\u2019ve been right a lot more than wrong.\u201dFishman, who grew up in Fairfield, Conn., began viewing baseball as a game of probability when he was all of 7 years old. That was when he began playing Strat-O-Matic, a game that uses dice, along with cards that contain the statistics of major league hitters and pitchers. Within two years, Fishman was developing his own weighted formulas for evaluating a player\u2019s worth.By the time Fishman and his brother Rocky, who is two years older, were teenagers, they would gather their friends for weekend-long Strat-O-Matic binges at their house, with research notes and cards scattered all over the floor.The cards, noted Rocky Fishman, who now works as an equity derivatives strategist for Deutsche Bank, did not have personalities or hot or cold streaks, except the ones randomly provided by a roll of the dice.Instead, he said, it was all about numbers and \u201cthe ways to maximize your odds of winning a baseball game.\u201d In effect, his kid brother was already acting like a 21st-century baseball executive even though it was still the early 1990s and he was not old enough to vote.By the time Michael Fishman reached high school, he had also found another outlet for a fierce competitive streak: math competitions. He entered a statewide contest in eighth grade in which the top four advanced to a national event in Washington. He finished first.When Fishman arrived the next fall as a ninth grader at the Hopkins School in New Haven, he felt like a hot-shot basketball recruit on a college campus because upperclassmen knew all about him.Naturally shy or reticent, Fishman does not carry himself with the cocksure gait of a former athlete, nor is he compelled to fill lulls in a conversation. Those who have known him describe him as determinedly loyal and with a wry often understated sense of humor.David McCord, a teacher who coached the math team at Hopkins, recalls two things about Fishman: He was rarely seen without a Mets cap, and he became a galvanizing figure within the math team, a captain in the truest sense, drawing in other students who, like Fishman, might have been \u201ca little off kilter in their social progress \u2014 very funny, quirky kids.\u201d\u201cThere is an intensity there that is not at all obvious,\u201d McCord said. \u201cOne of the things about Michael, and this is very rare, is it just all made sense. I don\u2019t think at any point in high school anything in math was trouble for him. It just made sense.\u201dIn many ways, numbers are the prisms through which Fishman sees the world. In college, he and his friends would devise their own formulas to calculate which food at the cafeteria constituted the best deal. And when Fishman was organizing a \u201cSimpsons\u201d marathon before graduation, he ranked dozens of episodes on cassette tapes to determine the viewing order.Sometimes his pursuits conquered campus obstacles. When Fishman prepared for the housing lottery at the end of his freshman year at Yale, he did not like his chances. So he read through the rules and set about improving his odds.Fishman identified the suite he wanted at Yale and canvassed his friends to see who wanted to share it or live in adjacent rooms. Then he studied the selection order, which was weighted by seniority and room type, and contacted those picking ahead of him to gather intelligence. The final domino was persuading an upperclassman to switch rooms.The lottery unfolded precisely as Fishman planned: He got the room, suitemates and neighbors he wanted, and for the next three years his suite became the social center for his circle of friends.\u201cIt was an orchestrated strategy,\u201d said Saul Nabata, who met Fishman in a computer science class when they were freshmen and roomed with him the next three years. \u201cHe took some very creative approaches instead of saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the rules of the lottery, and you go ahead and follow them.\u2019 He was always extremely clever and analytic.\u201dWhen Fishman had earned his degree in math, the use of analytics in sports was nascent \u2014 and baseball was near impossible to break into without having played the game at some level. So Fishman became an actuary at an insurance company.But he also began a side career in the fantasy sports industry, where he became a well-known figure. Then \u201cMoneyball\u201d hit, and suddenly doors into baseball began to fly open.Fishman sent letters to all 30 clubs. He prepared two projects \u2014 on how in-game moves affected win probability and on relief pitcher valuation \u2014 that he hoped would showcase his problem-solving skills. He landed an interview with Athletics General Manager Billy Beane, the protagonist in \u201cMoneyball,\u201d at the 2004 winter meetings, and Beane peppered him with questions.The A\u2019s analyst job eventually went to Farhan Zaidi, now the Dodgers\u2018 general manager, but Fishman was encouraged enough to continue his hunt, touring spring training camps and meeting with more teams. One asked him for a sample project on batting orders, another was interested in hiring him as a computer programmer, and several asked if he was interested in an internship; he was not.By July 2005, the Yankees expressed interest. Cashman brought Fishman in for an interview and, within a week or so, offered him a job.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I expected it to go,\u201d Rocky Fishman said of his brother\u2019s pursuit of a career in baseball. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if he was terribly happy doing what he was doing. It became clear as he started going down that path that he had a pretty sensible plan. He didn\u2019t take on a baseball career haphazardly.\u201dAt the end of that initial season, Eppler, a scout with a degree in finance, became the Yankees\u2019 director of pro scouting. His office was near Fishman\u2019s, and by the time the new Yankee Stadium opened in 2009, their offices were next door to each other.Over the years they developed a near daily routine: Eppler would go into Fishman\u2019s office each morning and they would talk \u2014 about the Yankees, amateur scouting, pro scouting, life in general.\u201cHe was a confidant of mine and I think I was a confidant of his,\u201d said Eppler, who was hired by the Angels after last season. \u201cBrian was so inclusionary that he grabbed opinions from multiple departments and his court, but if he\u2019d come and ask me or Fish something, usually we\u2019d already discussed it with each other.\u201dFishman said his relationship with Eppler was vital in understanding the perspective of a scout, who might see qualities in a player or his character or personality that Fishman would not. He also credited Gene Michael, the team\u2019s special adviser and former general manager, with sharing his vast array of experiences.\u201cI always want to understand things from a different perspective and want the organization to make the best decision possible using all the information possible,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cI can\u2019t go to a high school game and identify what those players are going to be 10 years later the way scouts can. But I want to use what they\u2019re doing to help us make the best decision.\u201dWhile the influence of Fishman and the Yankees continues to grow, there remains a degree of skepticism or indifference in the clubhouse. The bullpen coach Gary Tuck, who was close with Manager Joe Girardi and was lauded for his work with catchers, was fired after last season in large part because of his resistance to analytics.Few players have much direct contact with the data analysts; their reports are often disseminated through the coaching staff. And those reports have an impact. Headley, the third baseman, has been moved further off the line defensively this season and has been encouraged to be more aggressive in certain counts.\u201cIt\u2019s a different dynamic being told by somebody who hadn\u2019t played the game before where you need to stand,\u201d said Headley, who recalled veteran pitchers like David Wells, Greg Maddux and Chris Young yelling at him if he strayed from the line.Headley continued: \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve done this for 15 years,\u2019 or somebody who\u2019s done it for 25 years coaching. But I think the more you communicate, the more you talk, you realize we\u2019re trying to accomplish the same thing and that there\u2019s a nice balance. It\u2019s a tool, not the tool belt.\u201dEarlier this year, Headley asked David Grabiner, the director of quantitative analysis for the Yankees, to bring him something that might be useful.\u201cIt can be frustrating when you get information passed down to you without any communication,\u201d Headley said. \u201cMore than anything, I\u2019m trying to get that relationship going so that when he brings me something there\u2019s that trust that this is something that might really help me, it\u2019s not just some obscure number.\u201dCarlos Beltran, the Yankees\u2019 best hitter this season, said that while he studied video, he considered himself an intuitive hitter, relying on his 19 years of big league experience to guide him. But Miller, the reliever, said he believed that would change with the next generation who will come up understanding metrics such as Z-scores or wOBA and use them to influence how they swing the bat or throw the ball.That generation may soon be on its way.A raft talent in the Yankees\u2019 minor league system has inched its way closer to the majors. And no matter how the next iteration of Yankees look, they are certain to be shaped by Fishman\u2019s increasingly visible hands.An article on Monday about Michael Fishman, an assistant general manager for the Yankees who oversees their analytics staff, misstated the academic discipline of Ben Baumer, an assistant professor at Smith College who previously worked in analytics for the Mets. He is an assistant professor of statistical and data sciences, not data and sciences.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Understand About the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThis is an updated version of an article that first ran on March 27, 2016. One consistent theme from Donald J. Trump in his campaign for the presidency is this: The United States is losing at trade, and the trade deficit is the evidence.\u201cWe\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cSo we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s smart to me.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article was first published in March and was updated to reflect Donald Trump\u2019s most recent comments on the trade deficit.Advertisement"}

He was a rising movie star with just enough low-key charisma to lead members of his Queens, New York, hometown squad around Hollywood on an always funny, sometimes tragic quest for parties, women and fame.\u2028It\u2019s a gold star entry on the 40-year-old Brooklyn resident\u2019s lengthy roster of acting credits in projects that range from indies like John Waters\u2019 \u201cCecil B. Demented\u201d to blockbusters like \u201cA.I. Artificial Intelligence,\u201d \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d and the action thriller \u201cMarauders\u201d co-starring Bruce Willis.\u00a0But his career diversification hasn\u2019t just been in film. In fact, he\u2019s shown a certain relentlessness when it comes to expanding the diversity of his professional success with work behind the camera, in music studios, executive boardrooms and all over the web. He says: \u201cIt is all born of the same spirit of creation and storytelling and communicating ideas.\u201d He has founded a film production company, Reckless; performed in two bands \u2014 Kid Friendly and The Honey Brothers \u2014 and continues to break new music talent with his indie recording label and music incubator Wreckroom.His broad range of creative passions may not include much sleep or downtime, but over the years, Grenier\u2019s resume has become an impressive case study in leveraging a successful entertainment career with a passion for social responsibility. He\u2019s invested his fame wisely in bringing attention to his efforts to help raise awareness of issues surrounding climate change and preservation of the environment. He has produced and co-hosted the green-focused lifestyle series \u201cAlter-Eco\u201d and co-founded Shft.com, a web destination for content encouraging sustainability through art, design and gastronomy. \u201cYou look at the magnitude of the problems facing us,\u201d says Grenier. \u00a0\u201cI think we have to think big and act boldly. We can\u2019t afford to be small.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before Dell and Grenier partnered with the rideshare company Uber to launch \u201cNYC Tech Takeback\u201d to make it easier for New Yorkers to responsibly recycle their used technology through the Dell Reconnect program, a partnership with Goodwill Industries. They also collaborated to create \u201cCry Out: The Lonely Whale Experience,\u201d a virtual reality film in which viewers get to simulate swimming alongside a whale in a three-minute excursion that involves encounters with other marine life, noise pollution and plastic ocean debris.\u00a0Adrian Grenier has said that when it comes social and environmental advocacy, he has an entrepreneurial spirit. He is open to working with new tools and resources to improve life for people and animals, and also the environment. One of those tools is technology, which helps in the creation of innovative systems for getting the word out on important causes and offering ways for people to turn that awareness into action. \u00a0He says through his work with Dell, he has found a partner with similar values that supports his progressive, creative approach to technology as well. \u00a0\u201cDell has really been introducing me to great ways they\u2019re helping artists, communicators and people who are trying to make the world a better place,\u201d he says. \u201cI started creating my own businesses and my own non-profits and these led to the work that I\u2019ve been doing and continue to do with Dell.

A 60-year veteran of the chemical industry, he was the inventor of the yellow Hi-Liter, introduced by Carter&aposs\n                                        Ink Co. in 1963. He holds over 25 patents. Born in Syracuse, NY and raised in Ohio, he earned a B.S. from John Carroll University, M.S. from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, and Ph.D. in organic chemistry\n                                        from the University of Pittsburgh. Beginning his career in wartime research for General Cable Corp., he worked on substitute materials for natural rubber and subsequently developed wire insulation from newly invented\n                                        synthetic plastics and elastomers. Following the war, he became a Fellow of the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh where he conducted research for the Quartermaster Corps, the Office of Rubber Reserve and Armstrong\n                                        Cork Co. His optical cement, designed to overcome the deficiencies of heat-sensitive Canada balsam, was adopted by the military. From the Mellon Institute, Honn joined M.W. Kellogg Co. where he pioneered the development\n                                        of fluoroelastomers for use at high temperatures in missile and aerospace applications. When the Kellogg division was acquired by the 3M Company, he moved into the role of chemical industry executive, a path he\n                                        followed with various global chemical companies for the next thirty years. His experience includes serving as vice president of technology for Carter&aposs Ink, vice president of commercial development for the\n                                        chemical division of Olin Mathieson, vice president of new products for the Mennen Co., and a number of positions with BASF Corporation, ending as director of corporate planning, development and marketing and a\n                                        member of the executive committee. After retiring from BASF, he served as an outside director of Henkel Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Henkel KGaA, until 1992. Never content to be anything other than active, in 1988\n                                        Honn accepted the Alfred Driscoll Chair and Professor of PharmaceuticalChemical Studies in the Business School at Fairleigh Dickinson University. For 15 years, he taught courses on managing research and technology,\n                                        strategic management, and international business to MBA candidates employed by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. While there he wrote three textbooks. Honn joined the American Chemical Society in 1944\n                                        and remained an active member for his entire career. Another long-term commitment was to the Commercial Development Association, for which he served as president in 1974-75. He was awarded the Golden C for his invention\n                                        of the Hi-Liter and pioneering work in fluoroelastomers. He was founding chairman of the CDA Educational Foundation. Beyond his professional accomplishments, Honn shared a lifelong love of opera and classical music\n                                        with his beloved wife of 66 years, Alyce. Their first date was attending \"La Boheme\" at the old Met. He served as trustee and trustee emeritus of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra for thirty years, and\n                                        was a steadfast and enthusiastic supporter. Following his motto to \"keep busy!\", he was president of the Residents Association at Crane&aposs Mill after moving there in 2010. At the time of his death,\n                                        he was Chair of the Finance Committee of the Organization of Residents Associations of New Jersey, which includes all 25 continuing care retirement communities in the state. At the age of 92, he co-authored a 30-\n                                        page report on the impact of Hurricane Sandy on Continuing Care Retirement Communities. In the last several years, he facilitated different lecture series for the Crane&aposs Mill residents based on the Great Courses,\n                                        including one on the technology of ancient Greece and Rome. His family knew well his prodigious memory, which was amply documented in the 254-page memoir he wrote at age 87. Among his many recollections are those\n                                        detailing his commute to high school on trolleys heated by coal fired stoves, a 1937 trip on a Great Lakes iron ore carrier, and the research specialties of his professors at Brooklyn Poly, eminent scientists who\n                                        had fled Nazi Germany. Ever intellectually driven, he leaves behind a stack of bedside reading that includes books on the Federal Reserve, materials science, and Harry Truman, as well as carefully catalogued copies\n                                        of \"Chemical and Engineering News.\" Throughout his long and productive life, he remained devoted to his family. He is survived by his son and daughter in law, David Honn and Leigh Davis Honn of Acton,\n                                        MA, his son, Gregory Honn, of Greenwich, CT, and his daughter and son-in-law, Cynthia and Robert Hillas, of Princeton, NJ, as well as by his loving grandchildren, Robert Jr. and his wife Camden, Alison and her husband\n                                        Jonathan, Mary and Timothy.

{"Headline": "In 9/11 Document, View of a Saudi Effort to Thwart U.S. Action on Al Qaeda", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The long-classified document detailing possible connections between the government of Saudi Arabia and the Sept. 11 terrorist plot released on Friday is a wide-ranging catalog of meetings and suspicious coincidences.It details contacts between Saudi officials and some of the Sept. 11 hijackers, checks from Saudi royals to operatives in contact with the hijackers and the discovery of a telephone number in a Qaeda militant\u2019s phone book that was traced to a corporation managing an Aspen, Colo., home of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, then the Saudi ambassador to Washington.The document, 28 pages of a congressional inquiry into the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, is also an unflattering portrayal of the kingdom\u2019s efforts to thwart American attempts to combat Al Qaeda in the years before the attacks.But it is also a frustrating time capsule, completed in late 2002 and kept secret for nearly 14 years out of concern that it might fray diplomatic relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Subsequent investigations into the terror attacks pursued the leads described in the document and found that many had no basis in fact. But the mythology surrounding the document grew with each year it remained classified.The Obama administration sent a declassified version of the document, with some redactions, to the congressional leadership on Friday. Its release on the website of the House Intelligence Committee later in the day marked the end of a years-long fight by lawmakers and families of the Sept. 11 victims to make public any evidence that Saudi Arabia may have played a role in the attacks.It is by no means a Rosetta Stone that deciphers the lingering mysteries behind the attacks. But it is also a far more substantial document than many American and Saudi officials \u2014 from the White House press secretary to some members of Congress to the Saudi foreign minister \u2014 tried to indicate in a flurry of news conferences and emailed news releases on Friday afternoon.And it was made public at a particularly troubled moment in America\u2019s decades-long relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Senate unanimously passed a bill in May that would make it easier for families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the Saudi government for any role in the attacks. The bill is now being considered in the House.The White House has threatened to veto the legislation, but the Obama administration has had its own recent period of tension with Saudi leaders over the Iran nuclear deal and the grinding war in Syria.Much of the push over more than a decade to get the document declassified was led by former Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who was one of the co-chairmen of the congressional inquiry. In a statement on Friday, Senator Graham compared the release to the \u201cremoval of the cork at the end of the bottle\u201d that should lead to even more information to be declassified.The panel that Senator Graham helped lead did not try to reach definitive conclusions about what the 28 pages called the \u201cSaudi issue\u201d in its final report in 2002. \u201cIt was not the task of this Joint Inquiry to conduct the kind of extensive investigation that would be required to determine the true significance of any such alleged connections to the Saudi Government,\u201d the document states.The most extensive investigation into the attacks was conducted by the September 11 Commission, which pursued many of the leads presented in the 28 pages. The commission\u2019s final report, released in 2004, said that the panel had found no evidence that the \u201cSaudi government as an institution, or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda.Congress released the so-called \"28 pages\" on Friday that discuss the possible involvement of Saudi Arabia in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The pages have been withheld since the conclusion in 2002 of a congressional inquiry into the attacks..Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, quoted that assessment word for word on Friday, adding that the various leads that investigators pursued about top Saudi officials having a role in the plot \u201cdidn\u2019t really turn up anything.\u201dAdel al Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, echoed that sentiment hours later at a news conference at the Saudi Embassy, saying that all the allegations in the document \u201chave been dealt with in the subsequent investigations and they have found that they were without merit.\u201d\u201cThe surprise in the 28 pages is that there is no surprise,\u201d he said.But some former September 11 Commission staff members pointed out that the wording in the group\u2019s final report did not rule out the possibility that lower ranking Saudi officials had assisted the hijackers and said that the commission operated under extreme time pressure and could not run down every lead.In particular, some investigators remain puzzled by the exact role played by Fahad al-Thumairy, a Saudi consular official based in the Los Angeles area at the time of the attacks. They believe that if there had been any Saudi government role in the plot, it probably would have involved him.Mr. Thumairy was the imam of a mosque visited by two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, and some American government officials have long suspected that Mr. Thumairy assisted the two men \u2014 Nawaq Alhamzi and Khalid al-Midhar \u2014 after they arrived in Los Angeles in early 2000.An F.B.I. document from 2012, cited last year by an independent review panel, concluded that Mr. Thumairy \u201cimmediately assigned an individual to take care of\u201d of Mr. Alhamzi and Mr. Midhar \u201cduring their time in the Los Angeles area,\u201d but the F.B.I. has been unable to piece together other details of the movement of the two men during their early days in the United States.Two investigators for the Sept. 11 commission interviewed Mr. Thumairy for several hours in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in February 2004, but he denied having any ties to the hijackers \u2014 even after being presented with phone records that seemed to link him to the two men.The 28 pages discuss the role that Mr. Thumairy is said to have played, as well as a number of possible connections between Qaeda operatives and Saudi officials. One section of the report details how a phone number in a telephone book found with Abu Zubaydah, who was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 by the C.I.A., was traced to a corporation in Aspen, Colo., that manages the affairs of the Colorado residence of Prince Bandar.The Saudi government on Friday issued a lengthy rebuttal to the 28 pages, saying it was \u201cone of the more peculiar ironies\u201d that a nation that has done so much to combat terrorism finds itself \u201cthe object of ceaseless suspicion.\u201d American officials broadly agree that Saudi Arabia, since the Sept. 11 attacks, has been aggressive in its efforts to stamp out terror networks inside the kingdom and to clamp down on the financing private individuals in the country historically have given to militant groups.But the document released on Friday is unsparing in its criticism of Saudi efforts to undermine American attempts to dismantle Al Qaeda in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks. Moreover, it portrays the F.B.I as generally in the dark about the maneuverings of Saudi officials inside the United States during that period.It closes with a snippet of testimony from October 2002, when a senator asked Robert Mueller III, the F.B.I director, during a closed-door session, whether the work of the congressional inquiry had unearthed information of which he had been unaware.\u201cYes,\u201d he said.Matthew Rosenberg and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Government Supports Your Junk Food Habit", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "A weekly column on the science and culture of eating. At a time when almost three-quarters of the country is overweight or obese, it comes as no surprise that junk foods are the largest source of calories in the American diet. Topping the list are grain-based desserts like cookies, doughnuts and granola bars. (Yes, granola bars are dessert.)What do these foods have in common? They are largely the products of seven crops and farm foods \u2014 corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, milk and meat \u2014 that are heavily subsidized by the federal government, ensuring that junk foods are cheap and plentiful, experts say.Between 1995 and 2010, the government doled out $170 billion in agricultural subsidies to finance the production of these foods, the latter two in part through subsidies on feed grains. While many of these foods are not inherently unhealthy, only a small percentage of them are eaten as is. Most are used as feed for livestock, turned into biofuels or converted to cheap products and additives like corn sweeteners, industrial oils, processed meats and refined carbohydrates.Health advocates have long pointed out this seeming contradiction. While the federal government recommends that people fill half their plates with fruits and vegetables to help prevent obesity, only a small fraction of its subsidies actually support the production of fresh produce. The vast majority of agricultural subsidies go instead to commodity crops that are processed into many of the foods that are linked to the obesity crisis.Now federal health researchers have examined the relationship between metabolic disease and the consumption of federally subsidized foods. After adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic factors and other variables, the researchers found that those who had the highest consumption of federally subsidized foods had a 37 percent greater risk of being obese. They were also significantly more likely to have belly fat, abnormal cholesterol, and high levels of blood sugar and CRP, a marker of inflammation.While the study does not prove cause and effect, its authors say that this strong association is consistent with other research showing that diets that are higher in subsidized foods tend to be poorer quality and more harmful to health.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis tells us that the factors that influence the prices of our foods are an additional factor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ed Gregg, chief of the epidemiology and statistics branch in the C.D.C.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Division of Diabetes Translation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hoping that this information reaches policy makers and the people who influence how subsidies work.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Franck, a research assistant at the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research of the Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, said many factors influence what people choose to eat. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to argue that subsidies are a direct cause of obesity, they clearly play a role.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that what happens at the top of the food chain has an impact on what happens at the bottom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgricultural policies are just not aligned with public health goals.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn part because of public pressure, the last farm bill, which was passed in 2014, allowed farmers who grow commodity crops to use 15 percent of their acreage to grow fruits, vegetables and other specialty crops. It provided support to organic farmers, including $100 million for research to improve organic production. And it funded a \u00e2\u0080\u009chealthy incentives\u00e2\u0080\u009d program that encourages food stamp recipients to consume more fruits and vegetables by increasing the value of food stamps that are used to buy fresh produce at retail stores or farmers\u2019 markets.Ms. Franck said that early results suggest that the program is increasing the amount of fresh produce people consume. But others are not so sanguine. Raj Patel, a research professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the funding for fruits and vegetables in the most recent farm bill was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrumbs\u00e2\u0080\u009d compared to the billions in subsidies for commodity crops.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would transition us away from the unhealthy consequences of the current industrial food policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something very broken about the subsidy system.\u201dEat Well is a new weekly column on the science and culture of eating.

{"Headline": "Brooklyn Hospital\u2019s Sale, Backed by de Blasio and Cuomo, Is Drawing Federal Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byBefore Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo began their bitter public feud, the two men found themselves on the same side of tense negotiations over the future of Long Island College Hospital in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.In the end, the leaders, both Democrats, would get what they were after: The state sold the hospital, and Mr. de Blasio could claim victory for having preserved union-backed health care at the site.But the outcome now appears to be under federal scrutiny, the latest subject of a sprawling investigation into fund-raising and potential pay-to-play politics in New York. Federal subpoenas have been received by the health care workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U., which has supported Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, and by the hospital\u2019s former owner, the State University of New York.A developer, Fortis Property Group, which had been favored by SUNY, bought the hospital, with the sale completed in 2015. Prosecutors are seeking information related to the sale and, in particular, communications between SUNY and top City Hall officials or those associated with the mayor\u2019s nonprofit group, Campaign for One New York, about the hospital\u2019s fate, according to the subpoena, dated July 14 and described by an official who had seen it.The subpoena names Mr. de Blasio; Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor; four top mayoral aides; and Ross Offinger, who had been finance director of the mayor\u2019s 2013 campaign, according to the official, who requested anonymity citing the continuing federal investigation.On Thursday, the union also received a federal subpoena related to its own involvement in the hospital deal, according to an official there who declined to describe its contents.The inquiry into Long Island College Hospital, known as LICH, opened a new front in an investigation of Mr. de Blasio that has already focused on fund-raising for the Campaign for One New York and by the mayor\u2019s aides for Democrats in tight State Senate races in 2014. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration, too, is the subject of federal scrutiny related to state spending on projects in Buffalo, referred to as the Buffalo Billion.The governor\u2019s office said it had not received a subpoena related to the deal. \u201cThis administration had no say or role in the sale of LICH but supported resolving this issue and the court fight,\u201d said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, adding that SUNY had been \u201closing hundreds of millions of dollars operating the hospital.\u201dCity Hall said it had not gotten one either. \u201cWe will of course share whatever appropriate information is requested of us during any review of this matter,\u201d said Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary.A spokesman for the Campaign for One New York declined to comment on whether it had received a subpoena.The precise focus of the federal subpoenas related to the hospital and Mr. de Blasio\u2019s involvement was unclear, but prosecutors\u2019 attention to 1199 S.E.I.U. could shed light on the overlapping interests at play in the hospital\u2019s closing and eventual sale to the developer.Mr. de Blasio vowed to preserve the hospital and, in late July of that year, filed a lawsuit seeking to keep it open. He was joined by community groups eager to preserve the medical center, which served both the brownstones of northwest Brooklyn and the public housing blocks of Red Hook. (A judge ultimately removed Mr. de Blasio from the case, citing a lack of standing to bring the suit as public advocate.)By early 2014, however, both Albany and City Hall appeared to be pushing for Fortis, which had been a partner with NYU Langone Medical Center in operating an emergency room at the site. By that point, the parties involved were considering settling their case in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.Mr. de Blasio announced a settlement on Feb. 21. It included a new request for proposals for the site, with health care requirements in addition to development. Fortis joined with NYU Langone, but found itself ranked third in the bidding after the Brooklyn Health Partners and the Peebles Corporation.On March 7, 1199 S.E.I.U. contributed $250,000 to the group, according to its disclosure forms.Mr. Cuomo, for his part, received campaign donations of $5,000 from the president of Fortis, Joel Kestenbaum, in late November 2013, and $12,500 from Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s uncle, Moshe Kestenbaum, in January 2014.

A $39 million mansion in the Los Angeles hills. A $17.5 million tear-down in Beverly Hills. Each was bought anonymously, the source of its financing hidden.On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged that these lavish properties were among the more than $1 billion in United States assets bought with money stolen from Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund by people close to that country\u2019s embattled prime minister, Najib Razak.The story line of sudden riches and lavish spending by people close to Malaysia\u2019s prime minister has been told many times over the last year, amid rising discontent with his government and corruption investigations at home and abroad. But federal prosecutors offered the most scathingly detailed version yet as they filed a complaint to seize the assets in federal court in California.According to the complaint, the stepson, close friends and associates of the prime minister diverted more than $3 billion from Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2014 called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Some came from an international oil deal and some from bond deals managed by Goldman Sachs.Then, the complaint said, they transferred more than $1 billion of the embezzled funds into the United States using shell companies and the client bank accounts at the white-shoe law firm Shearman & Sterling. They rose up the social ladder, spending on celebrity-studded parties, purchasing high-end real estate, financing movies like \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and buying paintings by the likes of Picasso and Monet.\u201cThe money was raised by the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund and it was supposed to be used for investments that would return profits that would be used to support the Malaysian people,\u201d Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general who heads the department\u2019s criminal division, said in an interview. \u201cWhat happened instead was corrupt officials within 1MDB and others siphoned off a very large percentage of the money that was raised to the tune of $3 billion and used it in ways that provided absolutely no benefit to people in Malaysia other than themselves.\u201dThe forfeiture complaint, issued by a unit known as the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, represents the largest such case brought by the Justice Department. It comes at a time of heightened concern about secrecy, shell companies and illicit money flow around the world.The Justice Department named three of those people in its filings. One, Riza Aziz, is the stepson of Mr. Najib and a Hollywood film producer. Another, a financier named Jho Low, is a longtime friend of Mr. Aziz and his family. The third is Mohamed Badawy al-Husseiny, a former official at a government fund in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, that participated in deals with Malaysia\u2019s fund. Prosecutors also cited Khadem al-Qubaisi, who was an official at a related fund in the United Arab Emirates, as well as another individual who was an associate of Mr. Low.The people named in the complaint have not been charged with crimes. The defendants in an asset forfeiture case are the properties that the government wants to seize. But an asset complaint does not preclude criminal charges.Mr. Aziz\u2019s movie company, Red Granite Pictures, said in a statement that it was confident that \u201cwhen the facts come out, it will be clear that Riza Aziz and Red Granite did nothing wrong.\u201dMr. Low, Mr. Husseiny and Mr. Qubaisi did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, representatives for Mr. Aziz and Mr. Low have acknowledged that their clients own United States properties but have said that they did nothing improper.The complaint does not name Mr. Najib, but it does cite \u201cMalaysian Official 1,\u201d described as a high-ranking government official who oversaw the fund and is a close relative of Mr. Aziz.Tengku Sariffuddin, Mr. Najib\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement issued early Thursday that Malaysia would cooperate with \u201cany lawful investigation.\u201d If any wrongdoing is proved, he said, \u201cthe law will be enforced without exception.\u201d He said the investment fund had been the subject of several investigations in Malaysia and that authorities found no crime was committed.The immediate effect of the Justice Department\u2019s action is effectively to freeze the assets. The forfeiture process is lengthy. First, a court must make sure that no other interested party has a valid claim to the properties. Once true ownership is determined, the court must decide whether the money used to buy those assets was, in fact, earned illicitly. Only then can the government permanently seize the assets.In the nearer term, the government\u2019s action may increase the political pressure on Mr. Najib, who has held on to power by halting investigations into the investment fund and by removing officials in his governing party who criticized him.The 1MDB fund was created in 2009 as a \u201cstrategic development company\u201d to invest the Malaysian public\u2019s money, primarily its oil wealth, in projects to benefit the country. Mr. Low helped set up an earlier version of the fund.The Times reported last year that Mr. Low was secretly involved in major transactions with a small oil company called PetroSaudi International and Malaysia\u2019s public fund, which was led by Mr. Najib in his position as prime minister. Mr. Low then helped the prime minister\u2019s stepson buy property in the United States using shell companies and finance his movie company.The Times investigation documented property transfers between Mr. Low and Mr. Aziz, including one on Hillcrest Road in Beverly Hills that was done behind the veil of a shell company, with no property transfer filed in public records, as well as the role that Mr. Low played in helping to finance Mr. Aziz\u2019 movie business.That transaction was one of several using shell companies that were detailed in the Justice Department complaint.The complaint minutely chronicled an odyssey of embezzlement, global money flow and lavish spending in the United States.Prosecutors described several crucial transactions involving 1MDB, including the one with PetroSaudi. In that transaction, the complaint said, 1MDB officials and their associates stole about $1 billion that was supposed to be used for oil exploration. In addition, more than $2.5 billion was stolen through bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 that were managed by Goldman Sachs, the complaint said.Then, according to prosecutors, Mr. Low and the others involved in the embezzlement wired hundreds of millions of dollars into the escrow account of the Shearman & Sterling law firm. Banks generally do not do due diligence on the clients of law firms, leaving that step to the law firms themselves.PetroSaudi, Goldman and Shearman were not accused of wrongdoing. Those firms did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. 1MDB, the sovereign fund, was also not accused of wrongdoing and said in a statement that it was cooperating with investigators.According to the complaint, from October 2009 to June 2010, more than $85 million of the stolen money was spent on gambling in Las Vegas, jet rentals, yachts and payments to other individuals.It said that the $150 million used for luxury properties in New York and California came from the PetroSaudi deal, as did $44.8 million to buy a hotel in Beverly Hills and $35.4 million for a jet.Money from the Goldman Sachs bond deals, prosecutors said, was used to purchase $130 million worth of artwork at auction, as well as an interest in the music rights of EMI. It also helped finance the production of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d they said.According to the complaint, money from the bond offerings was put into a shell company in the British Virgin Islands and then transferred in part to Red Granite Pictures. Mr. Aziz and Mr. Husseiny previously told The Times the financing for the movie had come from personal funds of Mr. Husseiny, the complaint notes, even though the money came from 1MDB.In New York, the funds for the purchase of the Time Warner penthouse originated with 1MDB and were siphoned off from the PetroSaudi deal, the complaint said. The money was transferred through accounts in numerous countries but eventually landed in an account that Shearman & Sterling held for \u201cclient 37103 (TJL/RT MISCELLANEOUS INVESTMENT MATTERS).\u201d\u201cThis case is a perfect example of how shell companies can be used by criminals and kleptocrats and other people to steal money, hide money, launder money and make it very difficult for law enforcement to find out who controls that money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem globally but it\u2019s also a problem in the United States.\u201dReporting was contributed by Richard C.

{"Headline": "How Renewable Energy Is Blowing Climate Change Efforts Off Course", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneGermany, Europe\u2019s champion for renewable energy, seems to be having second thoughts about its ambitious push to ramp up its use of renewable fuels for power generation.Renewables have hit a snag beyond Germany, too. Renewable sources are producing temporary power gluts from Australia to California, driving out other energy sources that are still necessary to maintain a stable supply of power.The United States, and indeed the world, would do well to reconsider the promise and the limitations of its infatuation with renewable energy.\u201cThe issue is, how do we decarbonize the electricity sector, while keeping the lights on, keeping costs low and avoiding unintended consequences that could make emissions increase?\u201d said Jan Mazurek, who runs the clean power campaign at the environmental advocacy group ClimateWorks.Addressing those challenges will require a more subtle approach than just attaching more renewables to the grid.An analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, narrowly distributed two weeks ago, estimated that nuclear reactors that produce 56 percent of the country\u2019s nuclear power would be unprofitable over the next three years. If those were to go under and be replaced with gas-fired generators, an additional 200 million tons of carbon dioxide would be spewed into the atmosphere every year.The economics of nuclear energy are mostly to blame. It just cannot compete with cheap natural gas. Most reactors in the country are losing between $5 and $15 per megawatt-hour, according to the analysis.Nuclear energy\u2019s fate is not being dictated solely by markets, though. Policy makers focused on pushing renewable sources of energy above all else \u2014 heavily subsidizing solar and wind projects, and setting legal targets for power generation from renewables \u2014 are contributing actively to shut the industry down. Facing intense popular aversion, nuclear energy is being left to wither.Nuclear generators\u2019 troubles highlight the unintended consequences of brute force policies to push more and more renewable energy onto the grid. These policies do more than endanger the nuclear industry. They could set back the entire effort against climate change.As more and more solar capacity is fed onto the grid, it will displace alternatives. An extra watt from the sun costs nothing. But the sun doesn\u2019t shine equally at all times. Around noon, when it is blazing, there will be little need for energy from nuclear reactors, or even from gas or coal. At 7 p.m., when people get home from work and turn on their appliances, the sun will no longer be so hot. Ramping up alternative sources then will be indispensable.The problem is that nuclear reactors, and even gas- and coal-fired generators, can\u2019t switch themselves on and off on a dime. So what happens is that around the middle of the day those generators have to pay the grid to take their power. Unsurprisingly, this erodes nukes\u2019 profitability. It might even nudge them out of the system altogether.How does a renewables strategy play out in the future? Getting more power from renewables at 7 p.m. will mean building excess capacity at noon. Indeed, getting all power from renewables will require building capacity equal to several times the demand during the middle of the day and keeping it turned off much of the time.Daily fluctuations are not the end of it. Wind power and sunlight change with the seasons, too. What\u2019s more, climate change will probably change their power and seasonality in unforeseen ways. Considering how expensive wind and sun farms can be, it might make sense to reconsider a strategy that dashes a zero-carbon energy source that could stay on all the time.But there are limits. \u201cThere is a very real integration cost from renewables,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an economist at Yale who wrote the report. \u201cSo far that cost is small.\u201dDisplacing nuclear energy clearly makes the battle against climate change more difficult. But that is not what is most worrying. What if the world eventually discovers that renewables can\u2019t do the job alone? \u201cI worry about lock-in,\u201d Ms. Mazurek said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, the climate doesn\u2019t have time for a do-over.\u201dEmail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

She was just an infant when Marygrace Sexton started Natalie\u2019s Orchid Island Juice Company in 1990, naming it after her.\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve known,\u201d Ms. Sexton said.For Natalie, expanding while keeping the business debt-free, as her mother has, remains an important goal.\u201cWe are building a company to last,\u201d Ms. Sexton said. \u201cMarygrace instilled this in me from a young age.\u201dLooming over her is the statistic that only 30 percent of family-owned businesses make it through the second generation. That data is from 1987, but experts say it still holds true today. It is known as the second-generation curse.With \u201cmany of the families that stumble into the second generation and then fail,\u201d said John A. Davis, a Harvard Business School professor, \u201cyou\u2019ll see a pattern where the second generation wasn\u2019t developed well and the first generation stayed on too long and didn\u2019t let the next generation take the reins or experiment.\u201dMore than three million family-owned businesses in the United States face the issue of how to beat the odds. The three critical goals for such companies are to bring on board and train the next generation, plan for succession and let go when the time is right.For the Sextons, identifying who would lead the next generation was easy. The company was named after Ms. Sexton, who always knew she wanted to follow her mother, though there were some sore points when Natalie was younger, Marygrace Sexton remembered.\u201cOne day, Natalie was crying and said, \u2018I have no mother; I just have a C.E.O.,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Sexton said.Other children, however, have had to prove themselves to their parents before even being hired at the family firm, let alone taking the helm. Suzanne Groth, whose family owns Groth Vineyards & Winery in Napa Valley, did not initially want to be involved in the business. Everyone assumed her brother, who has an M.B.A., would take over. But he wasn\u2019t interested.Ms. Groth, after burning out on postcollege hospitality jobs, decided she wanted to be back in the wine business after all. When she asked her father, she didn\u2019t get the answer she expected.\u201cHe said, \u2018You didn\u2019t think you were going to get a job here, did you?\u2019\u201d Ms. Groth remembered. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t have any experience.\u2019\u201dHer father, Dennis Groth, remembered the conversation going more gently, but the end result was the same. Ms. Groth took a job with a local distributor to learn the sales side of the business.After working at the distributor for five years, she joined the vineyard as the regional sales manager. Today, she is the vice president for sales and marketing at the 121-acre winery, which has 30 employees, and she is on track to become what the business calls its managing member.Frank Venegas Jr. has both a daughter, Linzie, and a son, Jesse, working at the Ideal Group, a Detroit manufacturing and construction services company he started in 1979 with $12,000 he earned selling a Cadillac Coupe DeVille that he won in a raffle. Today, the Ideal Group employs 850 and has four divisions.Ms. Venegas is the vice president for marketing, finance and human resources, while her brother runs one of the divisions. But which one will lead the company is still not known.\u201cGod knows what will happen,\u201d Mr. Venegas said. \u201cBut they separate roles really well.\u201dIn the meantime, he has begun transferring stock to his children and putting an official succession plan into place to clarify roles and titles. He is now the chairman and his brother Loren is president, acting as a bridge to the next generation.\u201cI always hated all of those titles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t mean anything. But they really do in a transition phase because if you don\u2019t have a place to write in what everyone is supposed to do, it gets real shady.\u201d\u201cWith a founder generation struggling to let go, we often see them hand over the title, but they don\u2019t really give over the control or the leadership,\u201d said Jonathan Flack, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers and leader of its family business services in the United States.Entrepreneurs who have built companies that touch multiple generations share what they have learned along the way.So many lines are blurred in family business that lack of communication kills many firms making the generational transition.\u201cYou have to be able to talk about the business issues and confront issues when they exist,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cYou need to have leadership and parenting to be able to keep this thing going.\u201dTo avoid family conflicts, the Groth family created the title of managing member to identify the person responsible for making final decisions for the business. Dennis Groth now holds that title, and Suzanne Groth is learning how to make her proposals to him for changes.\u201cMy father has always planned everything on a spreadsheet,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if I want my father to bite down on something, I get him to look at the numbers.\u201dWhen she wants the support of her mother, Judy, she changes her approach. \u201cWith my mother, it\u2019s best if it\u2019s her idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI plant the seed and hope it grows.\u201dMs. Groth is trying to persuade them to adopt screw cap bottles instead of using corks. But her mother associates them with low-cost fortified wines. \u201cShe remembers when Thunderbird would be left on the street by the bums,\u201d Ms. Groth said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the wine she\u2019s making. So I have to ultimately respect the people who are running the business.\u201d\u201cMy sister is the reason why everything gets done,\u201d Espy Thomas said.Neither sister planned to be a part of the business \u2014 they had enough of lugging potatoes and smelling like pie when they were children. But both came back nearly 15 years ago. Now, Espy can\u2019t imagine not being a part of the business and shaping it for the future.So far, they think they will escape the second-generation curse. They persuaded their parents to build out a cafe rather than just serving baked goods. Now, they are considering expanding beyond sweet potato recipes because of customer demand.But the sisters are trying to help their parents, Cassandra and Jeffery, step back from the business.\u201cEven though it\u2019s challenging working with my parents every day, I like it,\u201d Espy Thomas said. \u201cI feel like our parents have tried to create a legacy for us.

{"Headline": "U.S. and Russia Agree on Steps to Combat ISIS in Syria", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The United States and Russia announced a tentative deal on Friday to coordinate airstrikes against the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria.Secretary of State John Kerry, after talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, said an internationally brokered cease-fire in Syria had been undermined by two problems: bombings by the Syrian government and attacks by the Nusra Front.\u201cWe agreed to steps that, if implemented in good faith, can address two serious problems that I just described about the cessation\u201d of hostilities, Mr. Kerry said.\u201cIt is possible to help restore the cessation of hostilities, significantly reduce violence and help create the space for a genuine political transition,\u201d he said.But Mr. Kerry refused to list the terms of the agreement.\u201cThe concrete steps that we have agreed on are not going to be laid out in public in some long list,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we want them to work and because they need more work in order to work. I want to emphasize, though, that they are not based on trust,\u201d but on specific steps that needed to be taken by both sides.Critics said the lack of details raised suspicions that Mr. Kerry had conceded too much.Mr. Kerry left his meeting with Mr. Lavrov to pitch his proposed deal to the Obama administration\u2019s top national security officials through a secure communications link at the nearby United States Embassy. After discussing the deal with the officials, Mr. Kerry returned to the bargaining table and asked most of the aides from both countries to leave so he could speak more directly with Mr. Lavrov.The agreement has also raised alarms because it might lead the United States to support or even participate in strikes against groups fighting Mr. Assad. One of the great complications of the Syrian civil war is figuring out which groups should be considered rebels focused on ousting the Assad government \u2014 a goal the United States supports \u2014 and which groups are aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, both of which Washington has designated as terrorist organizations and has vowed to defeat.The Nusra Front has been one of the most effective anti-Assad forces, and American-backed rebel groups often coordinate their activities with its units. In Russia\u2019s view, that means that Washington is effectively supporting the Nusra Front and that the American-backed groups are legitimate targets. So a joint campaign against the group not only would appear to concede Russia\u2019s point, but could also bring American firepower to bear against the strongest anti-Assad military force and a sometime partner of Washington\u2019s allies.Mr. Kerry made clear that defeating the Nusra Front was a major American priority.Mr. Lavrov said that supporting terrorist organizations would always lead to disaster.\u201cThere were cases in history when some countries were trying to play with extremist and terrorist groups, hoping to use them to achieve their own geopolitical goals to topple undesirable regimes,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said. He referred to American support for the mujahedeen in Afghanistan, which he said led to the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.The other complication is that the Syrians and the Russians have routinely undermined previous cease-fires and other measures to spare civilian lives. In just the past week, the Syrian Army has announced cease-fires, only to conduct a military campaign around the rebel-held section of Aleppo, leaving about 300,000 people besieged.Government forces are also advancing on the Damascus suburb of Daraya, one of the first areas to revolt against the government. In recent days, a refugee camp near the border with Jordan was bombed, and civilians were killed. It is not known who carried out the operation.When asked whether Russia had violated previous cease-fire agreements, Mr. Lavrov said, \u201cA lot could be said on who is to blame.\u201dThe United States has carried out occasional strikes against what have been described as senior Qaeda figures in Syria. But it has refrained from systematic attacks against the Nusra Front, whose ranks are heavily Syrian, including many who left less extreme rebel groups because Nusra was better armed and financed.The United States proposal states that American and Russian officials would share information on the locations of rebel groups to ensure that strikes aimed at Nusra did not hit American-backed groups.

{"Headline": "Four Seasons, Lunch Spot for Manhattan\u2019s Prime Movers, Moves On", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byIn New York, a restaurant that lasts 10 years is old. Most fail to make it to their first birthday. When the Seagram Building turns the lights out on the Four Seasons restaurant next week, it will end a run that began in 1959. Eisenhower was president, the Edsel was still new and television viewers tuned in, for the first time, to \u201cBonanza\u201d and \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d It was a very long time ago.Its closing will mark the end of an era. The Four Seasons, probably the most important New York restaurant of the 20th century, Americanized fine dining and set in motion many of the trends that still dominate restaurant culture in the United States.In its time, the Four Seasons was the most modern, the most daring, the most New York restaurant the city had ever seen. Defined visually by the confident modernism of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Seagram Building, it expressed, through its menu, d\u00e9cor and clientele, a vision of Manhattan as the nerve center of the postwar era: a nexus of talent, money and ambition.When the city faltered in the 1970s, the Four Seasons remade itself. Hoping to appeal to a new generation of up-and-comers, it scaled back its extravagant menus and created a stage for the city\u2019s prime movers in publishing, advertising, fashion and finance. In the overhauled Bar Room, a cavernous, often empty space where patrons stopped in for a drink or took a table when the Pool Room was full, the power lunch was born. Every weekday at noon, in a ritual as formalized as a quadrille, Page Six names descended on what was now being called the Grill Room, took a seat at their customary table and dined \u2014 abstemiously.For food was not the attraction. \u201cPowerful people eat in order to be seen with other powerful people,\u201d Michael Korda, the former editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, and a Four Seasons regular, wrote in The New York Times in 1977. The choicest dish was not on the menu: the validation that came with being seated and served with an important client, surrounded by elite company.\u201cIn the past, the best restaurants were patronized by high society,\u201d said Paul Freedman, the author of \u201cTen Restaurants That Changed America,\u201d to be published in September by Liveright. \u201cThey were not places to do deals, but at the Four Seasons it was all about transacting business and being seen.\u201dThe cast of characters changed. Wall Street crashes, bankruptcies and the occasional indictment took a toll. But the milieu did not change much. There are regulars who have been regulars for 30 or 40 years, players in a social drama that has run longer than \u201cThe Fantasticks.\u201dIt is an impressive record for an afterthought. When the Seagram Building was under construction, the ground floor and lower level were 24,000-square-foot blanks to be filled in. There were plans to turn the rooms into exhibition spaces, or lease them to a bank or an auto dealership.Once Mr. Brody convinced Samuel Bronfman, the chairman of Seagram, that a restaurant would reinforce the company\u2019s image and add value to the building, Mr. Baum was turned loose. Philip Johnson, chairman of the architecture department at the Museum of Modern Art and Mies\u2019s assistant on the Seagram Building, was assigned to handle the architecture, with William Pahlmann responsible for the interior design.What sort of restaurant would it be? Mr. Baum was clear on one point: It would not be French, \u201cbecause we are not Frenchmen, we are Americans,\u201d as he later put it.This was radical. French cuisine epitomized fine dining in the United States, especially in Manhattan, where restaurants like Le Pavillon, Le Cafe Chambord and Voisin set an uncompromisingly Gallic tone.Mr. Baum could be cryptic when talking about his restaurant ideas. \u201cModern New York with Continental touches\u201d was one formulation, but the germ of the idea, and the name, remain somewhat obscure. He was a great admirer of the Vier Jahreszeiten (\u201cFour Seasons\u201d), the hotel in Munich. He was also taken by \u201cshibui,\u201d the Japanese concept of restrained elegance, which his friend Elizabeth Gordon, the editor of House Beautiful magazine, was then explaining to American readers. A haiku about the seasons set him to thinking about a way to embody shibui, and seasonality, in a restaurant that reflected its time and place.\u201cHe offered a very simple explanation: New York as crossroads of the world, the place where everything is happening, the capital city of modernity,\u201d Mimi Sheraton, a former restaurant critic for The Times, said in a recent interview.The restaurant\u2019s name was chosen from a long list of dubious candidates: the Four Seasons of the Zodiac, the Time Table, Season-o-Rama, among others.\u201cEvery day, from one to five in the banquet room of the Hotel Lexington, we would go through 35 dishes, starting with appetizers,\u201d Ms. Sheraton said. Albert St\u00f6ckli, Restaurant Associate\u2019s chameleon-like Swiss chef, who had an uncanny knack for making Mr. Baum\u2019s ideas edible, fed the team, working from a mandate that emphasized fresh ingredients supplied by small producers around the United States, seasonal changes and a contemporary, international slant on flavor combinations.The idea of seasonal change was carried through almost fanatically. Four times each year, new trees and floral displays would be trucked in; the waiters would get new uniforms; the menus would get a makeover; the ribbons in the typewriters would be changed; and the banquettes would be reupholstered.In the end, Mr. Baum created the most expensive restaurant in the city\u2019s history. The Four Seasons cost $4.5 million to open, nearly $40 million in today\u2019s dollars. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which opened the same year, cost $3 million.Craig Claiborne, then the food news editor of The Times, reviewed the Four Seasons two months after its July 29 opening. \u201cBoth in d\u00e9cor and in menu, it is spectacular, modern and audacious,\u201d he wrote, en route to calling it \u201cperhaps the most exciting restaurant to open in New York within the last two decades.\u201dHe expressed admiration for the lobster mousse and the lavish use of fresh herbs and mushrooms, rarely seen in American restaurants. He admired the appointments: paintings by Jackson Pollock and Joan Mir\u00f3; a giant Picasso stage curtain; tableware designed by L. Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable; flowers and ficus trees matched to the season. Anchored in the verities of French haute cuisine, however, he found the menu difficult to comprehend and, in some way, not right.Food historians now see it as the starting point for a series of trends that came to define American dining: the cult of freshness and organically grown ingredients, which Alice Waters embraced at Chez Panisse; the inventive interpretation of regional American dishes, which became known as New American cooking; the international blending of styles and ingredients, later described as fusion.\u201cIn 1959, they were naming the places where the ingredients came from,\u201d said Jeremiah Tower, the chef at Chez Panisse in the early 1970s. \u201cThey would write: \u2018Handpicked tomatoes from Long Island, carved tableside.\u2019 They were the first to pick up on farm-to-table.\u201dThe Four Seasons was not just an expensive proposition. The restaurant had never made money, and by the late 1960s, it was running on fumes, subsisting on the patronage of curious tourists. \u201cQuite clearly, there are not enough people, even in New York, to regularly underwrite first grouse from Scotland, fiddlefern from Maine, haricot from Paris, and nubbin carrots from Oregon,\u201d Michael Whiteman, the editor of Nation\u2019s Restaurant News, and later Mr. Baum\u2019s partner at Windows on the World, wrote in a letter to New York magazineRestaurant Associates, no longer interested in the fine-dining business, eased Mr. Baum out in 1970. Mr. Brody, who had committed the cardinal sin of divorcing the boss\u2019s daughter, was out too. \u201cIn every sense, the Four Seasons was losing its soul, its personality and its allure,\u201d John Mariani wrote in \u201cThe Four Seasons: A History of America\u2019s Premier Restaurant\u201d (1994).In 1973, Tom Margittai, a vice president of Restaurant Associates\u2019 fine-dining division, and Paul Kovi, director of the Four Seasons, put down $15,000 in cash to buy the restaurant and set about transforming it into a club for young executives, the kind of people they called \u201cthe doers.\u201dPart of the plan was to turn the Bar Room into a grill, a less formal alternative to the Pool Room with simple, quickly prepared dishes like skewered shrimp with chipolata sausages, chicken paillard, gravlax with dill mustard sauce.The new owners made shrewd hiring decisions. They brought in Seppi Renggli, another versatile Swiss chef, to re-energize the kitchen. Alex von Bidder, 26, a young Swiss hotelier, was hired to build up the banquet business, and Julian Niccolini, a Tuscan with solid hotel experience in Europe, was handed the sensitive task of managing the Grill Room. He proved to be a rare combination, both diplomat and court jester.The makeover worked. Nora Ephron found the location convenient and began turning up for lunch. The grandees of publishing followed her lead: Richard E. Snyder and Michael Korda of Simon & Schuster, Phyllis Grann of Putnam, Alexander Liberman of Cond\u00e9 Nast, Jason Epstein of Random House. John Fairchild, the publisher of Women\u2019s Wear Daily, became a regular, as did the literary agents Morton L. Janklow and Lynn Nesbit. Financiers like Peter G. Peterson, the chairman of Lehman Brothers, staked their claims, along with the fashion designer Bill Blass and the advertising executive Lois Wyse.Credit for the term \u201cpower lunch\u201d usually goes to Lee Eisenberg, who, in a 1979 Esquire article titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Powerful Lunch,\u201d decoded the Grill Room and, as a service to the reader, offered an annotated seating plan matching diner to table.But conceptual ground had already been broken, from an insider\u2019s view, two years earlier by Mr. Korda, in an article for The Times headlined \u201cLe Plat du Jour Is Power.\u201d Mr. Korda understood the fine points and perverse politics of powerful eating, which valued conspicuous nonconsumption. \u201cThe most powerful person is the one who can order the meal with the lowest number of calories,\u201d he wrote. Catering to this philosophy, the restaurant would introduce an irreducibly plain dish: a baked potato served with a bottle of olive oil on the side.The power parade continued through the decades, and the Four Seasons became, for the first time, a profitable restaurant. Whenever attrition threatened to thin the ranks, new recruits turned up. Henry Kissinger, after leaving Washington, added his clout to the daily seating chart.When book publishers began cutting costs in the 1990s, a phalanx of financiers and real estate developers rose to take the seats once reserved by editors. An army of Cond\u00e9 Nast editors descended, turning the Grill Room into a company canteen. Art Cooper, the editor of GQ, occupied a corner booth and spent about $200,000 a year at the restaurant. He ate his last meal at the Four Seasons, suffering a fatal stroke at the age of 65 while eating lunch in 2003.Over time, the lively dance of the Four Seasons became a frieze, the daily power-lunch ritual an arthritic display.In 2000, the German-born real estate developer Aby J. Rosen bought the Seagram Building with his partner in RFR Holding, Michael Fuchs. It did not take a crystal ball to predict the future. Mr. Rosen, a fan of contemporary art and experimental theater, looked at the restaurant\u2019s time-honored rituals and its older clientele with a cold eye.In 2013, he told the New York Landmarks Conservancy that he intended to move the Picasso curtain, \u201cLe Tricorne,\u201d to carry out repairs on the wall behind it. The conservancy, the owner of the artwork since 2005, when the French entertainment giant Vivendi donated it after having acquired Seagram five years earlier, said the curtain, measuring 19 by 20 feet, was so fragile that it would crumble \u201clike potato chips\u201d if moved.Picasso had created the curtain, which depicts a bullfighting arena, for a 1919 Ballets Russes production and sold it in 1957 to the Bronfman family for about $50,000. When the Seagram Building, including the interior of the Four Seasons, was granted landmark status in 1989, the curtain was excluded from the designation because it was not part of the building\u2019s structure.The Picasso contretemps had sent an unmistakable message. The Four Seasons\u2019s lease was set to expire in 2016. Mr. Rosen made it clear that he was going to let it. \u201cI love the guys, but their time has passed, and sometimes something great has to go,\u201d he told The Times last year.He hired the young partners in the Major Food Group, responsible for the buzzy restaurants Carbone, Dirty French and Santina, to come up with a replacement for the Four Seasons. Like Mr. Baum, they will have to start from scratch. After 57 years, it is 1959 again.Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Sunday 10 with an article about the history of the Four Seasons restaurant misstated the year Philip Johnson, the restaurant\u2019s main architect, celebrated his 95th birthday. It was 2001, not 2005.Advertisement"}

When he was kidnapped, he was the dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.After he was snatched near his Beirut home, where he lived with his wife, Mr. Sutherland was confined in a series of rooms, often blindfolded and chained to a wall, by gun-toting men who operated under Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.The Western hostages were abused regularly, hit with fists, sticks and rifle butts, said Terry Anderson, the longest-held American, who was a Middle East reporter for The Associated Press. Mr. Anderson said he and Mr. Sutherland had spent a great deal of time together, lying side by side on cots and engaged in conversation.\u201cHe had a particularly difficult time, especially in the first two years,\u201d Mr. Anderson said on Sunday. \u201cHe had always been in academia. He was a gentle man, and he just couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.\u201dTo break the boredom, Mr. Sutherland gave Mr. Anderson lessons in French and agriculture. In return, Mr. Anderson taught him how to play chess, using pieces made of tinfoil, and bridge. Mr. Sutherland later said his talks with Mr. Anderson had been critical to his coping with the captivity.Thomas McNee Sutherland was born on May 3, 1931, in Falkirk, Scotland, to William and Helen Sutherland, and grew up on a dairy farm. He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1953 with a degree in agriculture and then traveled to the United States, where he earned a Ph.D. degree in animal science from Iowa State University in 1958.He joined the faculty at Colorado State University and later became a naturalized American. He took a leave of absence to go to Beirut in 1983.When Mr. Sutherland arrived to a crowd of well-wishers at San Francisco International Airport, he had on his arm his 4-year-old granddaughter, a girl he was getting to know for the first time.In Fort Collins, the home of Colorado State, the trees were decorated with yellow ribbons.Mr. Sutherland became a professor emeritus at Colorado State, and in his 70s, he took up acting.In addition to his wife of 60 years, he is survived by three daughters, Kit Sutherland, Joan Sears and Ann Sutherland; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.In 2001, the Sutherland family won a lawsuit against Iran over its role in financing Hezbollah. Individual members of the family received sizable payouts from frozen Iranian assets, including more than $23 million for Mr. Sutherland, much of which he gave to charity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio Administration Says It\u2019s Ahead of Schedule on Affordable Housing", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byWhen Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014, he made affordable housing the centerpiece of his administration, vowing to build or preserve 200,000 units over a decade in a city where the cost of shelter was rocketing past the grasp of many residents.Now, despite skepticism from many housing experts and a feud with the governor that has derailed one of the major programs used to subsidize development, the de Blasio administration announced on Monday that it was ahead of schedule in meeting its goals, having financed the creation or preservation of nearly 53,000 affordable apartments so far.Just in the fiscal year ending June 30, more affordable housing units \u2014 23,284 \u2014 had been built or preserved than at any time since 1989.\u201cThis engine is in full gear, financing enough affordable homes for 130,000 people in just two and a half years,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement on Monday.\u201cBy any measure, the de Blasio administration has blown this out of the water,\u201d said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development. \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of schedule and slightly under budget.\u201dAffordable for whom, of course, remains a question. Some housing activists have complained that the administration has not done enough to create homes for the poorest New Yorkers, focusing instead on moderate-income residents.But according to the city\u2019s housing commissioner, Vicki Been, one-quarter of the affordable units created during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration are reserved for tenants making less than $31,100 for an individual and $40,800 for a family of three; of those, half are for tenants who earn less than $19,050 for an individual or $24,500 for a family of three.Nearly a quarter of affordable apartments preserved with city financing last year were in two Manhattan projects, both devoted to middle-class tenants: Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, on the East Side between 14th and 23rd Streets, and the Riverton Houses, in East Harlem.Both complexes were built by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for veterans returning from World War II, and both had been sold to investors who sought to rapidly replace existing residents with new tenants at sharply higher rents, only to have their plans upended by the 2008 financial crisis.The new owners of the complexes got tax breaks and other subsidies from the de Blasio administration to keep apartments affordable. At Stuyvesant Town, 4,500 units are reserved for middle-income families. A family of three earning up to $128,210 a year, for instance, would pay a rent of $3,205 per month.At Riverton, in exchange for subsidies worth about $100 million, 975 apartments will be kept affordable for working- and middle-class families for 30 years.Those projects are far larger than the typical complex in the city\u2019s affordable housing programs.When it comes to building new units, the mayor\u2019s task has been made more difficult by his tense relationship with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, who has his own ambitious agenda for building housing. At times, the state has threatened to reduce authorization for tax-free financing. This year, when the governor denounced a compromise that would have extended an important city housing program known as 421-a, which gave developers tax breaks for including affordable units within their developments, the Legislature let the program lapse.Eventually, Domino will include 2,800 apartments, 700 of which will be affordable.\u201cWe are pleased to see that the administration has increased the pace of production of housing for low- and extremely-low-income New Yorkers,\u201d said Barika Williams, deputy director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cBut the need and demand for that kind of housing has only increased. And it won\u2019t be met by the administration\u2019s housing plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Parliament Passes Law Enabling Ouster of Legislators", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli Parliament passed contentious legislation early Wednesday that enables the suspension or ouster of members accused of racial incitement or of supporting armed struggle against Israel. Critics said it was intended to target Arab legislators and harmed democratic principles like freedom of expression.The legislation, which was approved by a vote of 62 to 47, with several members absent, after a stormy debate, requires the support of 90 out of the Parliament\u2019s 120 lawmakers to oust someone. Setting such a process in motion requires the votes of 70 lawmakers, including 10 from the opposition, which makes the process difficult to carry out. Lawmakers voted out of Parliament would be able to appeal to the Supreme Court.But the law has added to the sense that Israel\u2019s conservative government is pushing populist and questionable measures that some opposition politicians have called discriminatory and even indicative of \u201cbudding fascism.\u201dSupporters of that law argued that it would prevent foreign interference in Israeli affairs. Opponents say it unfairly singles out left-wing groups critical of Israel\u2019s policies toward Palestinians, as most right-wing groups mostly rely on private donations from abroad.The law that passed was a watered-down version of the original draft, which would have required representatives of foreign-funded groups to wear special tags when visiting the Knesset. Still, the State Department spokesman John Kirby spoke of the \u201cchilling effect\u201d the new law could have, while the European Union said the legislation \u201crisks undermining\u201d values it shares with Israel, such as its \u201cvibrant democracy, freedom of speech and its diverse civil society.\u201dThe legislation allowing for the removal of members of Parliament appears to have grown out of a broad Israeli aversion to one particular lawmaker: Hanin Zoabi, one of the feistiest and most provocative Arab politicians in Israel. She joined the Knesset in 2009.Arabs make up about a fifth of Israel\u2019s population of more than eight million. Though they are citizens of the Jewish state, many of them, and their leaders, identify as Palestinian, a source of significant friction.But several Israeli political groups complained that the law allowing for the ouster of Parliament members went too far.The Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank, said it \u201cturns the Parliament, a political body, into investigator, judge and jury, on the basis of a vague legal provision.\u201d The Association for Civil Rights in Israel said the law \u201charms the very building blocks of democracy \u2014 the right to freedom of expression, the right to vote and to be elected, and the right to representation.\u201dAyman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cwants politics for Jews only,\u201d and pledged to respond to the new law by working to increase the power of Arab parties in the next elections.But Prof. Abraham Diskin, a political scientist of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, rejected the notion that the two new laws represented any kind of anti-democratic trend. He said the foreign-funding law was \u201ccorrect, justified and even essential\u201d for the sake of transparency, but criticized the expulsion law as \u201cunnecessary, counterproductive and stupid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Goldilocks Strategy for Prudent Investors", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byRetiringARE you saving for retirement but worried about how to handle a sudden, unexpected expense? Or already retired and wondering how best to protect yourself against a stock market loss?Many people with those fears set aside a so-called rainy-day fund, keeping large sums in their bank accounts or money market funds. This is a costly mistake, rivaled only by the excess fees too many investors pay to high-cost money managers.When I ask people why they do it, they say things like \u201cin case I wreck my car\u201d or \u201cin case my house burns down\u201d or \u201cin case I have a medical emergency.\u201d But problems of this sort require large cash outlays only if you are not insured. And the remedy for this is to make sure you are adequately insured, rather than create a big rainy-day fund that earns vastly inferior rates of return compared with stocks and intermediate-term bonds.You will need a lot of cash, of course, when you retire or if you join the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Under those circumstances, however, you will need that money over a protracted period of time. There is no reason that the resources to finance this spending stream should take the form of low-interest bank deposits or money market funds, which inevitably will fail to keep up with a rising cost of living, even if inflation remains modest.Instead, to minimize the real risks we all face in meeting our unknown, long-term financial obligations, you need a different strategy, one that produces reliable, spendable cash flow and superior returns, minimizing the likelihood that the inflation-adjusted value of your portfolio will decline over time.The best way to achieve those goals is to avoid \u201cperfectly safe\u201d cashlike assets, relying on your savings account or money market funds only for a 30- to 60-day cushion to cover your day-to-day obligations, plus enough extra at times to satisfy those occasional outsize expenses like a child\u2019s college tuition bill that is due in the next few months.After that, your primary goal is to build wealth. Not surprisingly, equities do best. That\u2019s why most of your money for your retirement should be invested in stocks.But you may not have realized that intermediate-term bonds, over the long run, are superior not just to cash but to long-term bonds as well. So when thinking about where to invest your fixed-income assets, remember Goldilocks: The best place to be is not too long and not too short.The return you expect to earn and the risk associated with bonds rise as maturity lengthens. But the rates at which they rise are neither uniform nor equal. At first, as you move out of cash into short-term bonds your expected return rises rapidly, but risk \u2014 if we define it as the chance that you will lose to inflation \u2014 actually diminishes.That\u2019s why the shortest-maturity investments like money market mutual funds and Treasury bills are among the worst investments you can make.As you then extend your maturity from short-term bonds to intermediate, the increase in return slows down and risk begins increasing, but the trade-off between the two seems commensurate. Extend your maturity beyond intermediate, however, and the additional expected return that you gain seems wholly inadequate compared with the amount of extra risk incurred.With long bonds you are at the mercy of the inflation gods: If inflation is low enough, you can win big; if it\u2019s high enough, you get buried.The moral of the story: Don\u2019t put your money in long bonds (too risky) and don\u2019t put your money in money market funds or bank accounts. The latter give up way too much return for the (supposed) perfect safety of zero fluctuation in the value of your investments.Instead, the place to be is what is essentially a large \u201csweet spot\u201d between short and intermediate. That\u2019s where the reward-risk trade-off is at its greatest.But what about those of you who have been investing in long-term bonds, which have done very well since the early 1980s? All I can say is: Fabulous market timing! As Morningstar reports, for the 34 years ending 2015, long Treasuries offered a compounded return of 10.1 percent per year, a pace that was much better than intermediate Treasuries\u2019 7.5 percent and not all that unfavorable compared with stocks\u2019 11.5 percent.But it\u2019s worth remembering that at the end of 1981 long Treasuries were yielding more than 13 percent and were about to begin a decades-long decline that produced hefty capital gains. With long-term Treasuries now yielding just 2.3 percent (and yields on non-Treasuries not much higher), you are all but certain to have inferior returns on long bonds unless we enter an extended period of deflation. With the unemployment rate at a low 4.7 percent and underlying inflation running around 2 percent, I would not bet on that.Indeed, long-term bonds can be a horror show. Over the long period that stretched from 1940 to 1981, long-bond returns averaged 2.2 percent while inflation advanced at a 4.7 percent annual rate. The value of such assets dropped nearly 63 percent in real terms, even if you never spent a dime. After taxes, you would have lost 70 to 75 percent of your money.Fortunately, not many investors keep a large share of their funds in long bonds. Many more fall prey to the irrationally strong preference for perfect stability: Bank accounts and money market funds capture almost 30 percent of individual investors\u2019 liquid financial assets.That\u2019s a sucker\u2019s game, with no chance to earn the higher coupons that are routinely paid by bonds with modestly longer maturities. For the 90 years ended 2015, investors gave up 1.7 percent a year, compounded, if they stuck to Treasury bills instead of being willing to invest in intermediate Treasuries.Obsessing over downside risk costs investors a great deal of money, reducing their standard of living in retirement. And speaking of not obsessing over acceptable risks, it\u2019s even better to avoid Treasury securities in favor of low-cost mutual funds that invest in either corporate or municipal bonds. The extra yield these bonds pay (after tax) swamps the tiny costs they incur on those rare occasions when bond issuers default.The point of accumulating assets is not so that you can spend them down quickly in retirement, for once you spend them, you are broke. The point is to mainly rely on the income they produce.And, of course, income does not mean simply nominal income, but real (inflation-adjusted) income. And in this regard, equities do best, while within the universe of fixed-income investments, intermediate maturities offer you the best odds of beating inflation during the course of your lifetime.David A. Levine is a former chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., now a unit of AllianceBernstein, who also founded and ran the firm\u2019s fixed-income department.Advertisement"}

Researchers believed that if they could better understand how the animals did it, they might apply the insights to humans, developing new drugs or medical treatments, for example, or ways for astronauts to survive long spaceflights in a hibernationlike state.Confirming work by other researchers, Dr. Godsk Jorgensen and his colleagues found that bears\u2019 heart rate slowed sharply during hibernation, from about 75 beats a minute to as few as 10, with pauses that sometimes lasted 19 seconds or more.\u201cI once had a patient with a pause of 13 seconds,\u201d Dr. Godsk Jorgensen said. \u201cWhen you have that, you go around and you faint and hit your head.\u201dDr. Ole Frobert, a cardiologist at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden who led the research team on the ultrasound study, said work on hibernation in bears was attracting more interest at a time when some scientists have grown disillusioned with studies using mice as subjects.\u201cMedical research in a way is in a crisis,\u201d Dr. Frobert said, \u201cbecause we do a lot of research and publish a lot of papers, but there are very few breakthroughs.\u201dMice can be more easily kept in a laboratory than bears, of course, but they are far from perfect as a model for humans and often fail to respond to drugs or other treatments as humans do. Bears, although more difficult to study, Dr. Frobert said, allow scientists to look at several physiological systems at once, and provide a natural model of evolutionary solutions to questions that continue to befuddle scientists.Hibernating bears, grown fat from summer feasting, do not eat, drink, urinate or defecate while they are hibernating. But they lose no muscle mass from inactivity. Platelets in the bears\u2019 blood become less sticky, acting as a natural blood thinner, the researchers found, perhaps to counteract blood clots that could form during long periods of immobility. The bears\u2019 metabolism drops to 25 percent of its normal state and their kidneys stop functioning, yet they do not have kidney failure.The research team collected blood and tissue samples for the studies from free-ranging brown bears in Sweden in February and again in June. The bears, all teenagers, were tranquilized, and although some of the animals later changed dens, they seemed otherwise unaffected by the research, Dr. Frobert said.\u201cObese bears are healthier; in fact, they are more reproductively fit,\u201d said Heiko T. Jansen, a professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University who presented at the meetings. \u201cThey have all the advantages, which is so counterintuitive to human biology.\u201dIn research financed in part by the pharmaceutical company Amgen, Dr. Jansen and his colleagues found that bears\u2019 handling of insulin appears to vary with the seasons, with resistance increasing during hibernation and sensitivity increasing in summer.Fat cells of hibernating bears treated with a blood serum from \u201csummer\u201d bears become more insulin sensitive, the researchers found.\u201cThere\u2019s clearly something important in serum that\u2019s important for multiple things,\u201d Dr. Jansen said.He and other researchers said they hoped such studies would eventually lead to drugs to treat diabetes or cure obesity.But practical applications are still uncertain. And it may take some time for researchers to figure out how bears do naturally what people cannot.\u201cWe have to learn and relearn and relearn that nature has solved these problems,\u201d Dr. Jansen said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s our job as primates to figure this out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His leanings in the recent referendum to leave the European Union would seem obvious.Grants from the European Union have funded many of the projects he works on, including the former bank branch he was painting last week in this city in southern Wales. European Union funds also helped him hire apprentices, including his own son. And Wales gets back far more money from the European Union than it pays in.Even some in Newport who knew what they stood to lose were conflicted over the vote.\u201cWe get more back than we put in,\u201d said Mr. Adams, 52, leaning against his van in spattered white work pants. \u201cWhat the money has done is made the infrastructure of Wales much better, everywhere\u2019s much more accessible because of the road infrastructure, things like that. That\u2019s where all the E.U. money\u2019s gone.\u201dEven so, he said he could not bring himself to support staying in the union and chose not to vote, because the issue of immigration held him back. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re an island,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can take only so much population.\u201dEven so, 56 percent of voters in Newport voted to leave. One of the Leave movement\u2019s core arguments was that Britain could keep money it now pays to Europe and use it for its own purposes.Britain as a whole paid about $9.5 billion more annually into the European Union than it got back over the last half-decade, according to the British treasury. After it leaves, it most likely will still have to pay money into the union to keep its trading privileges. And the aid coming back will cease.Many in the British Parliament insist on keeping some kind of access to the so-called single market, the European system of rules and laws that seek to make trading among member states more seamless. But some vying to be the next prime minister have suggested Britain could operate outside the single market, though that could throw up myriad barriers to trade.Either way, Britain is unlikely to get more favorable terms than it already has. Part of the problem is that Norway and Switzerland are part of the Schengen Area, a passport-free travel zone. This kind of unfettered movement is exactly what many Leave voters detest.European leaders, hardly in a charitable mood, seem unlikely to do favors.\u201cThere will be no single market \u00e0 la carte,\u201d Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said this week, while Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said that access to the single market was contingent on basic principles including the free movement of people.Many areas in Britain favored with European aid are mired in poverty and voted in frustration.During a visit, it did not take long to determine the Leave campaign\u2019s appeal for a number of residents.\u201cI\u2019m definitely not a racist,\u201d said Thomas Reynolds, an 88-year-old retired construction worker. But he said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the outcome. \u201cMuslims don\u2019t like Christians. I don\u2019t want Muslims next to me, I prefer Christian. But they probably would think the same, so we\u2019re on the same page.\u201dTom Fereday, 28, an unemployed office administrator and a supporter of the far right U.K. Independence Party, said he was uncomfortable with the growing Muslim population in the city\u2019s Pillgwenlly neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m happy to go through hard times if it means we get our national sovereignty back,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo keep letting in thousands of third-world Muslim migrants is just complete insanity.\u201dThe disquieting racism the referendum has inflamed was tangible when a small group of young white men were heard briefly hooting monkey sounds as they walked past a black man on a downtown street.But this was hardly a reflection of the whole city.\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that we voted out,\u201d said Hilary Small, a 67-year-old retired medical secretary. Many voters, she said, simply were uninformed about the money the European Union sends to the region.\u201cA lot of the Welsh people didn\u2019t realize that,\u201d she said.Dean Jeffery Beddis, 51, the heavily tattooed owner of Kriminal Records, a shop in a downtown arcade, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think people knew the consequences of their vote, to be honest.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of things, ignorance, lack of education, fear and just not knowing,\u201d he said, denouncing the \u201cfear mongering\u201d of The Sun, a right-wing tabloid, before turning his fire to Boris Johnson and then Donald J. Trump. A rug with President John F. Kennedy\u2019s image hung behind him.Russell Thomas, Mr. Adams\u2019s partner in the painting business, did vote to stay in the union.\u201cA lot of the subsidies now we think will be stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a devastating blow I think, but there we are.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the consequences of a British vote to leave the European Union misstated the dollar equivalent of 150 million pounds, roughly the amount Britain was sending to the European Union each week.

{"Headline": "Nigel Farage, Who Spurred \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Resigns as Head of U.K. Independence Party", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 He spent nearly 20 years pushing for Britain to leave the European Union, and having succeeded in his aim, he is now taking his leave.Nigel Farage, the politician who probably did more than any other to force the referendum on British membership in the European Union, resigned on Monday as leader of the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve done my bit.\u201dMr. Farage, 52, has quit the post before \u2014 twice. But on Monday he sounded as if he meant it this time, telling reporters that \u201cmy political ambition has been achieved\u201d and that \u201cI want my life back.\u201dBut since the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote he has also been encouraged to quit by Arron Banks, the self-made insurance millionaire who has been a main funder of the party, known as UKIP, and of the unofficial Leave.EU campaign, and who sees the possibility of a more broadly based political party that can appeal to disaffected Labour voters.But his push for a referendum, first as a member of the European Parliament and then as the leader of UKIP, arguing that Britain could manage immigration and regain full sovereignty only from outside the European Union, struck a deep chord with many Britons. It fed into the euroskeptic wing of the Conservative Party and made many Conservative legislators fear that UKIP would deny them an election victory in 2015.Even within UKIP, Mr. Farage was not universally loved. Internal critics complained of an inability to delegate, and his rivalry with the more cerebral Douglas Carswell, UKIP\u2019s only member of Britain\u2019s Parliament, developed into guerrilla warfare. On Monday, Mr. Carswell greeted Mr. Farage\u2019s resignation announcement by posting on Twitter a smiling emoji wearing sunglasses.Mr. Farage specialized in a blunt political discourse that appealed both to right-wing conservatives and to those who felt left behind in an increasingly polarized country.As they mocked him, he responded: \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny? When I came here 17 years ago and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me. Well, I have to say, you\u2019re not laughing now, are you? The reason you\u2019re so upset, you\u2019re so angry, has been perfectly clear, from all the angry exchanges this morning.\u201cYou as a political project are in denial. You\u2019re in denial that your currency is failing. Just look at the Mediterranean! As a policy to impose poverty on Greece and the Mediterranean you\u2019ve done very well,\u201d he said, then went on in that vein, both angry and smug.But his claim to be an anti-establishment figure was never convincing. Educated at Dulwich College, a famous and expensive private day school for boys in south London, he skipped college to become a commodities trader.In a 2010 memoir, \u201cFighting Bull\u201d (updated in paperback as \u201cFlying Free\u201d), he described his years of making money during the day and drinking hard at night, and his various adventures with women, marriage and divorce. He survived testicular cancer in his 20s and, later, a serious accident when a light aircraft he was in crashed.Mr. Farage became involved in the campaign to extract Britain from the European Union in the early 1990s, but the UKIP he joined soon found itself competing with another, better-financed group, the Referendum Party.In Britain\u2019s 1997 general election, UKIP won just 0.3 percent of the vote. But the prospects of Mr. Farage and his party were immeasurably helped when the European Union forced Britain to adopt more proportional voting in elections for the European Parliament.In 1999, Mr. Farage won one of three UKIP seats in the European Parliament, where he has stayed ever since, and where he has used the generous expense allowances for legislators to promote his party and himself.Despite his innate English nationalism, Mr. Farage always seemed at home in Brussels, where he would frequent the bars of Place du Luxembourg, or in Strasbourg, France, the home of the European Parliament, where UKIP held regular, alcohol-fueled dinners in what was known as the \u201cgadfly club.\u201dMr. Farage employed his German-born second wife, Kirsten Mehr, as his assistant, and has acknowledged expense and allowance claims of some 2 million pounds, in the neighborhood of $3 million, since his election to the Parliament.None of which prevented him from pummeling the institutions or its representatives, most notably the former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, whose appointment he greeted with the sort of polemic seldom heard in the rarefied debates of the European Parliament.By then Mr. Farage, who was elected UKIP leader in 2006, had already resigned once \u2014 after the European Parliament elections in 2009, in which UKIP won 13 seats with 16.5 percent of the vote.The plan was to run for the British Parliament in 2010, but Mr. Farage lost, and on the day of the election nearly lost his life in the aircraft accident.He tried again in the 2015 British election but failed again, even as UKIP nationally won almost four million votes. In the immediate disappointment of that failure he quit the party leadership, only to reverse his decision, claiming, to some ridicule, that this was by popular demand.During the recent referendum campaign, he was kept out of the official Leave campaign amid fears that his focus on immigration might deter middle-of-the-road voters. But migration became a dominant issue for all the senior figures who argued for British withdrawal from the European Union, a vindication of sorts for Mr. Farage.\u201cLove him or loathe him \u2014 and many people do \u2014 it is simply a fact that we would not have had the referendum vote, nor have won it, without him,\u201d said Gawain Towler, a longtime ally and spokesman for UKIP.No one else had a similar reach among voters in poorer, postindustrial areas that had traditionally voted for the opposition Labour Party, Mr. Towler added.Under Mr. Farage, UKIP transformed itself from a right-wing rump into an insurgent populist force, switching its focus from support among groups such as ex-military personnel in the affluent south to the left-behind towns of the east coast and the north of England.UKIP\u2019s support, he has said, is now to be found in areas with \u201cordinary people who get up at 6 in the morning, commute to work, pay their mortgages and do their best to bring their kids up.\u201dLast month, millions of those people listened more to Mr. Farage than to the mainstream political leaders, precipitating a referendum result that, just a few years ago, seemed inconceivable.And today, with Mr. Cameron announcing his resignation, the Conservatives competing to see who is the most loyal to Brexit and the Labour Party in chaos \u2014 with little to say about immigration \u2014 UKIP or a party built on its foundations has an open door for more support.\u201cDuring the referendum campaign, I said I want my country back,\u201d Mr. Farage said on Monday. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying today is I want my life back, and it begins right now.\u201dNot quite. Mr. Farage said he intended to keep his Parliament seat in Strasbourg until Britain finally left the European Union, just to ensure that there was no backsliding \u2014 and undoubtedly to keep annoying the other legislators by his very presence.Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Then one by one, they came to Brooklyn to die.The closing of the cemetery left a wound on the eastern edge of the Navy Yard.Now, it is beginning to heal.An exhaustive 1999 study of the abandoned cemetery included a list of all known burials, from Alexander Adams to Charles Zoller (Pages 115 to 174), as well as a detailed history.Mr. Woltz wanted to prepare me for the scene that greeted us when we walked through the gateway on Williamsburg Street West: not a traditional park in any sense, but a field of tall grasses sprinkled with blazing star, brown-eyed Susan, purple coneflower, butterflyweed, Queen Anne\u2019s lace and fleabane.Cherry trees in a sacred grove will one day reach 80 feet. Right now, they are shoulder high. Some have not even survived their first season. Mr. Woltz likened the acclimation to tough love, necessary for a meadow that will be to a large extent self-sustaining.The path through the landscape is a gently meandering boardwalk, made of black locust planks, varying in width from 10 to 16 feet and elevated 30 inches above the meadow.\u201cWe were told not to disturb the ground plane of the soil,\u201d Mr. Woltz said. \u201cIt holds the stories and bodies of people, some of whose names we do not know.\u201dIn 1997, ground-penetrating radar detected what may have been a full human skeleton. \u201cSome burials may still remain intact in the Naval Hospital Cemetery, but their identity would be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine,\u201d a study compiled in 1999 by TAMS Consultants and Joan H. Geismar said.Mr. Steiner praised the Naval Cemetery Landscape. \u201cThe way the walkway is elevated is very respectful,\u201d he said, \u201cand reflects that the land is sacrosanct.\u201dThe park opened May 20.Birds, bees and butterflies did not wait for a formal invitation to discover the place.\u201cThere\u2019s a family of hawks \u2014 a mom and a dad and, I believe, three babies \u2014 and a turkey vulture,\u201d 12-year-old Josiah Shakir said as he confidently took over the tour from Mr. Woltz. Out of school for the summer and keeping his father company, Josiah has become something of a self-appointed docent.He led us to beehives hidden in a shaded area near the sacred grove, noting with wrinkle-nosed distaste that an opossum had been dining on berries and relieving itself around the hives. After reflecting for a moment, Josiah added, \u201cThough, when you think about it, the manure is good for fertilizing the soil.\u201dMr. Woltz could not have been happier than to see this landscape embraced by a boy and his furred and winged entourage.\u201cWe thought that attracting all the life you possibly could to the site was the most appropriate memorial to the lives of the people who were interred here,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s so .\u2008.\u2008. real. But fans of the genre make a strong case for their own peculiar obsession, to the point of making me want to have what they\u2019re having. Whatever it is.So that\u2019s my first takeaway \u2014 losing yourself in true-crime stories is like the ritualistic folk magic practiced by shamans, witches and superstitious grandmothers. And it\u2019s considerably more sanitary than spitting through your fingers to keep the demons down in hell where they belong.The case that captured Renner\u2019s imagination was a poser, all right. Maura Murray, a nursing student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (once considered \u201cthe most violent campus in the country\u201d), drove her car into a snowbank in the winter of 2004. But when the police arrived on the scene only minutes after the crash, Maura had vanished. Drawing on published accounts, social media and his own nose for news, Renner gradually divulges odd bits of information about Maura and members of her family. (Not to give anything away, but this wasn\u2019t the first time she had wrecked a car.)Renner, the author of \u201cThe Serial Killer\u2019s Apprentice,\u201d is just plain fun to read. Noting that Maura lived in Melville Hall, he can\u2019t resist mentioning that this freshman dormitory took its name from \u201cthe guy who wrote the ultimate book on pointless obsession.\u201d He\u2019s also shamelessly entertaining on how he happened to do a brief but humiliating stint in jail for assaulting a police officer. And while his chronicle of the ups and downs of his own messy life brings no insights to the still-unsolved mystery of Maura Murray\u2019s disappearance, it does give us a clue to how inquisitive armchair detectives can turn into excitable children when they get carried away playing with their toys.Di Maio\u2019s first important case after he joined the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Maryland in 1969 involved the unexplainable seizures of the children of the Army sergeant Harry Woods and his wife, Martha. One of the children, 7-month-old Paul, died. (Over a 23-year period, seven of the babies in Martha Woods\u2019s care died, and five were touch-and-go.) The psychological disorder of Munchausen syndrome by proxy wasn\u2019t defined until the late 1970s, Di Maio says, and \u201cserial killer\u201d didn\u2019t become a common term until the 1980s. But this seminal case helped start the dialogue.To satisfy \u201cCSI\u201d fans hungry for technical details about the decomposition of the human body, Di Maio obliges with some vividly depicted exhumations. He also offers a grim scientific explanation for why so-called satanic ritual cult murders are a lot of hooey, existing \u201conly in the movies, on the internet and in paranoid dreams.\u201d In a flourish of a finish, he even advances the theory that van Gogh\u2019s famous suicide may have been a homicide.Working from exhaustively researched archival material, she delivers the requisite case histories about infamous lady poisoners. There was Eliza Fenning, a pretty young cook who went to the gallows for serving her master and his family a heaping plate of arsenic-laced \u00addumplings. (The overworked servant probably just wanted to give them indigestion.) In another scandalous case, Madeleine Smith, who came from a wealthy family in Glasgow, was said to have dispatched her secret lover with a helping of arsenic when she received a more attractive marriage proposal. Anne Barry was a sadder case. The devoted charwoman for a shopkeeper who made a habit of sexually assaulting his young female customers, Anne delivered the poison that killed the newborn daughter of a 17-year-old girl who had been raped by Anne\u2019s employer. She was hanged for her complicity; happily, so was he.Although Stratmann\u2019s academic narrative style is on the dry side, there\u2019s fire in her sociological thesis that poison murder was a \u201csecret\u201d crime, the chosen method of voiceless women, children and servants \u2014 those who had no legal power within the Victorian patriarchal system. The political and social establishment considered poisoners \u201cthe worst kind of criminals\u201d because they directly \u201cthreatened the established order of society.\u201d It seemed that no cheating husband, abusive master or inconvenient infant was safe from a desperate woman. But once women\u2019s marital rights were expanded (in, for example, the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of 1870) and labor reforms extended to children, who worked long hours in mines, factories and sweatshops, the image of \u201cthe archetypical female poisoner who operated in an impoverished domestic setting\u201d gave way to a new image of \u201cthe educated middle-class male\u201d \u2014 a \u201cgentleman\u201d who, it should be noted, was more likely to murder for profit than from the pain and passion that motivated women.\u201cThe people had elected one of their own as their secular saint,\u201d Murphy writes, \u201cas a martyr for their age and their condition.\u201d But the popular press that spoke for the upper classes was having none of it. \u201cThere are among us,\u201d one newspaper editorial ran, \u201clarge numbers of men and women who have an unmistakable craving for this sort of ghastly stimulus.\u201dAlthough Murphy, the author of \u201cShooting Victoria,\u201d is mainly interested in the advances of forensic science, his lively narrative, with its unambiguous tone of outrage, is also a takedown of the social system. \u201cHe was the young master,\u201d Murphy notes. \u201cShe was his servant, and she had served him as innumerable young female servants had served innumerable young masters in the past.\u201d Sure enough, the hierarchy prevailed. Edmund was acquitted of murder, and his debased victim found no justice. (It was left to Jane\u2019s friends to affirm her \u201chuman value\u201d on her tombstone.)There were enticing things to see and do in and around London in the summer of 1895 \u2014 cricket matches in St. John\u2019s Wood, a melodrama at the Theater Royal, excursions to the seaside town of Southend \u2014 and 13-year-old Robert Coombes and his 12-year-old brother, Nathaniel, wanted to see and do it all. And they would, with the assistance of a grown-up, their honest if slow-witted babysitter, John Fox. But first, Robert had to kill the boys\u2019 mother.Through a combination of cunning (Robert\u2019s) and innocence (Fox\u2019s), the decomposing body of Emily Coombes went undetected in her bedroom for several days. (Both boys and the nasally challenged Fox spent their nights in a downstairs room.) During the day, Robert sent Fox about the city to finance their excursions by selling various household items. Eventually, Emily\u2019s body was discovered by concerned relatives who insisted on being let inside the house. (It was his own aunt who called Robert \u201ca bad, wicked boy.\u201d) Because there was no court for young defendants, the brothers were tried as adults. Nathaniel struck a plea deal, but Robert was convicted and sent to the Broadmoor asylum, where he remained for the next 17 years. And there, you might think, the story would end.But Summerscale has barely started, intent as she is on bringing some insight into Robert\u2019s behavior and eviscerating the criminal justice system for pouncing on him as if he were some depraved fiend. Over the course of her irresistible book, she takes on popular attitudes toward children and their place in society. \u201cThe child is, naturally, by his organization, nearer to the animal, to the savage, to the criminal, than the adult,\u201d Havelock Ellis wrote in 1890, reflecting a popular belief of the day. To subdue their savage minds, the jury called for a ban on penny dreadfuls, the \u201cinflammable and shocking literature\u201d that inflamed Robert\u2019s over\u00addeveloped imagination. Summerscale proves a wonderful champion of these exciting adventure tales, which allowed young boys to dream of better things than a life of poverty.With Robert serving as scapegoat, the defenders of England\u2019s crumbling system of morality went so far as to demand a recall of the Education Act of 1870. There were four and a half million children in school in 1892, which sober minds knew would lead only to \u201cambition, restlessness, defiance, a spirit of insurgency.\u201d The boys\u2019 own father, who had been away at sea during the tragedy, damned Robert for his very intelligence. \u201cThe boy was afflicted with a preponderance of brain matter,\u201d the father offered at the trial. \u201cHe had too much brain tissue for the size of the skull.\u201dThe notion that too much imagination is dangerous hardly died out with the end of the Victorian age. But the lovely irony of Robert\u2019s story is that, when he was finally released from prison, he became a hero like the protagonists of his beloved penny dreadfuls and went on to live the adventurous life he had dreamed of.Marilyn Stasio writes the Crime column for the Book Review.Advertisement"}

Funded by the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, the consortium will investigate whether genetic and biological factors, not just lifestyle factors, influence the racial disparities.\u201cThis effort is about making sure that all Americans \u2014 no matter their background \u2014 reap the same benefits from the promising advances of precision medicine,\u201d Dr. Douglas R. Lowy, the acting director of the N.C.I., said in a statement. \u201cThe exciting new approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment ring hollow unless we can effectively narrow the gap of cancer disparities, and this new research initiative will help us do that.\u201dThe consortium will gather data and biospecimens from 18 previous studies, pooling them for the largest sample to date, Dr. Funmi Olopade, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who is part of the consortium, said in an interview.There have been similar consortiums for women of European and Asian descent, but this is the first of its kind for women of African descent, Dr. Olopade said.It will be key to understanding why black women are more likely to die of the disease. Though the role of genetics has largely been a mystery, scientists have offered a wide variety of environmental factors that could contribute to mortality rates, including obesity and access to care.\u201cFor a very long time, that\u2019s how people have explained it,\u201d Dr. Olopade said. \u201cBut some of the work we have done has suggested it\u2019s much more complex than that. There might be some genetic risk factors that are actually contributing to the fact that black women tend to get more aggressive breast cancers.\u201dScientists cannot assume that risk factors apply equally to black, Asian and white women who do not have the same genetic background, she said. Over the past decade, black women have been just as likely to get mammograms as women of other races, but they\u2019re still dying at a higher rate, she said.\u201cIf you can identify who\u2019s likely to get it, you may be able to develop a targeted way to identify them and get them the care that they need,\u201d Dr. Olopade said.Advertisement"}

In this case, the purchaser is Gores Holdings, a publicly traded arm of the Gores Group known as a blank-check company, having raised $375 million in an initial public offering last year to finance acquisitions.Hostess\u2019s former parent sold its cake business, which had outlived wars and low-carb diet fads, to Apollo and Metropoulos, both of which are seasoned corporate turnaround players, in the spring of 2013 for about $410 million. (The company also sold its Wonder Bread business to Flowers Foods for $360 million.)Apollo and Metropoulos focused on reviving a nearly dead brand. They restarted operations that had been dormant during Hostess\u2019s bankruptcy and made the company\u2019s shopping operations more efficient. Under the two owners, Hostess collected about $650 million in sales during the 12 months that ended May 31.Including Tuesday\u2019s deal, Apollo and Metropoulos together stand to collect a return of about $1 billion on an initial equity investment of about $185 million. (During the three years that they owned Hostess, the two companies collected several hundred million dollars in dividends from the snack maker.)Hostess\u2019s owners explored putting the baker up for an initial public offering in recent months, but the approach from Gores provided a more certain payout.Under the terms of the deal, Gores Holdings will pay out not only most of the $375 million that it raised in its I.P.O. last year, but also an additional $350 million that it raised from other investors. That includes $50 million of the additional capital that will essentially come from Metropoulos\u2019s rolling over some of its existing holdings in Hostess.\u201cHostess presents a unique opportunity to invest in an iconic brand with strong fundamentals that is poised for continued growth,\u201d Alec Gores, the chairman and chief executive of the Gores Group, said in a statement.Being acquired by a blank-check company will give Hostess a listing on the Nasdaq stock market, where Gores Holdings trades. That would give Hostess the ability to raise capital from the stock markets to pay for acquisitions or pay down some of its debt.Other elements of the Hostess business will not change, including the company\u2019s existing leadership. Both C. Dean Metropoulos, the bakery\u2019s executive chairman, and William Toler, its chief executive, are expected to keep their roles under Gores\u2019s lead ownership.Both Apollo and Metropoulos are expected to remain investors in the business, owning about 42 percent of the combined company, which will assume the Hostess Brands name.\u201cThis new phase in Hostess\u2019s evolution and partnership with the Gores Group and our broader investor partners will continue to propel Hostess into a growing and innovative company with significant reach and potential long into the future,\u201d Mr. Metropoulos said in a statement.Advising Gores Holdings were Deutsche Bank, Moelis & Company, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Hostess received financial advice from Rothschild, Credit Suisse and Perella Weinberg Partners.Apollo took legal counsel from the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, while Metropoulos received financial advice from UBS and legal counsel from the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Named My Mixed-Race Daughter for a Slave-Trading Town", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR nearly 20 years, my great-great-great-grandfather\u2019s portrait has watched over me from my red dining room wall. With his high collar, ruffled cravat and black waistcoat, Samuel Fales, 1775-1848, is the very image of the upstanding 19th-century New England gentleman. An eminent merchant and alderman of Boston, he was the founder of the family\u2019s shipping business. I\u2019ve known his face and taken comfort in his smile since I was a child attending Sunday lunch at my grandmother\u2019s in the 1960s.Samuel Fales seemed utterly unperturbed by the changes the 20th century had wrought, among them his great-great-grandson\u2019s unorthodox choice of bride: my mother, a black Haitian-American actress, and my brother and me, his mixed-race descendants. His portrait has stood as an emblem of our family\u2019s pride in its history. \u201cYou have relatives on both sides of your family who fought in the American Revolution,\u201d my mother would frequently remind me.To honor my forebears, my husband and I named our only child Bristol, after the town in Rhode Island where some of the Faleses first settled in the 17th century. A year ago, I learned through new historical research that Bristol had in fact served as a main hub of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. This gave me great pause. Had I done my daughter a dreadful disservice? Upon reflection, I decided that naming a multicultural African-American after a slave port was in fact redemptive, the ultimate act of reclamation.It never occurred to me that my family might have participated in the port\u2019s inhumane commerce.Knowing of my interest in Bristol, a friend sent me an invitation this past spring to a lecture at Yale by Sean M. Kelley, a historian of the slave trade. Unable to attend, I emailed the professor, asking if a podcast might be available and proudly informing him of my family\u2019s connection to the town. He wrote back, generously sharing his lecture notes. At the email\u2019s end, he stated: \u201cYou may be disappointed (or gratified?) to see that I don\u2019t mention any members of the Fales family. I did do a quick check of my notes and found reference to a Fales who was involved in a slave trading prosecution from 1815.\u201dI read on with dawning horror as he described the case of Fales v. Mayberry, a lawsuit waged in 1815 against the captain of a slave ship for recovery of the proceeds from the sale of 150 slaves in the West Indies, and subsequent sale of the ship itself in Saint Bartholomew. The judge in the case, Joseph Story, chastised the plaintiff, Fales, for the horrific nature of the slave trade and its illegality under federal law.The Fales in question was none other than my great-great-great-grandfather, Samuel. He had first established his wealth through trading slaves.That email dealt a death blow to the pride I had always felt in hailing from a family of industrious and, I thought, uniformly upstanding Anglo-Saxons. It was devastating to realize that our \u201cfortune\u201d had begun with America\u2019s original sin.Ashamed of my own na\u00efvet\u00e9 and ignorance, I turned to \u201cThe Fales Family of Bristol, Rhode Island,\u201d a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d history of the family written by my grandfather in 1919, to see how such essential truths had eluded me for so long. Everyone in the family had a copy of the book; the problem was, like the Bible, few of us had ever bothered to read it cover to cover. In its pages, I found euphemistic references to the \u201cWest India trade,\u201d and ships captured by pirates off the \u201ccoast of Africa.\u201dGiven Rhode Island\u2019s extensive role in the slave trade, it dawned on me that Samuel probably wasn\u2019t the family\u2019s only participant. I journeyed back through the pages and the generations. Timothy Fales, a Harvard-educated teacher for whom my father was named, left his post as Bristol\u2019s schoolmaster to enter in the \u201cWest Indies trade.\u201d Read: slave ships. As a result of his ventures, by 1720 he was able to purchase vast tracts of land.Yet another ancestor had decamped to Cuba for 20 years in the early 19th century. Given that the United States\u2019s biggest slave trading family, the DeWolfs of Bristol, held plantations on the island, it is safe to deduce he wasn\u2019t running a cigar factory.My grandfather referenced our forefathers\u2019 shipping ventures, but beyond rum, never discussed the nature of their cargo. As many a prestigious American university does, he had imposed an embargo of silence over that particular detail of our family\u2019s past, to create a noble portrait.The sense of betrayal no doubt felt by some students at Yale who have to live in a residential house named after an arch proponent of slavery, Vice President John C. Calhoun, or by those at Georgetown who walk the grounds financed by the sale of hundreds of slaves, swept over me. In this case though, the crime-stained name was my own. And unlike an administrator at Yale, Georgetown or Harvard trying to make amends for the misdeeds of predecessors to whom they had no connection, I personally owed my debt-free Ivy League education not only to my parents\u2019 hard work, but also to the blood money acquired by my ancestors.I live the paradox that though my brown skin has excluded me from so called white privilege, all my life I have benefited from the plunder of privileged whites. From the time I read Thackeray\u2019s novel \u201cVanity Fair\u201d as a teenager, I have been fascinated by the character of Rhoda Swartz, the \u201cwoolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitts,\u201d a mixed race heiress to a lucrative plantation, and real-life figures like her. Now I know why: Their stories are mine, and like them, I occupy the uneasy limbo between exploiter and exploited. I, an African-American woman, am every bit as much a \u201cdebtor\u201d to my \u201crace\u201d as any descendant of John C. Calhoun\u2019s or indeed as Georgetown University itself.Now as I contemplate my ancestor\u2019s portrait, I cannot forget the thousands of lives ruined for my family\u2019s gain. How does one begin to repay such a debt? My pride in my family\u2019s accomplishments has given way to a somber resignation to the fact that I can never make full amends for their crimes. No good deeds, or acts of generosity past or present, will ever restore what my ancestors stole from thousands of families unknown to us and now dispersed across the Caribbean and the United States: two centuries of freedom and dignity.In the meantime, I can neither shun my great-great-great-grandfather nor stand in judgment of him. Some of his contemporaries, like Justice Joseph Story, who presided over the slave ship lawsuit, recognized the evil of slavery. Had I been a white man in the 19th century, would I have been a forward looking humanitarian, like the justice? Was Samuel any more reprehensible than my black Haitian ancestors, who, in an often overlooked facet of colonial and plantation history, belonged to a caste of blacks who owned slaves themselves?The \u201ctriangular trade\u201d bound America, South America, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean in a blood knot whose legacy we live to this day but have never thoroughly explored. Our family\u2019s redemption and my own must begin with a full and honest reckoning of our role in this world-altering traffic.Several days after my exchange with Professor Kelley, I shared what I\u2019d learned with Bristol, now 13, over Friday dinner, with Samuel Fales\u2019s portrait peering down at us. Bristol gazed at the portrait as I spoke, and absorbed the revelation with her trademark equanimity, but from the note of sorrow in her eyes, I could tell she was mulling over the ugly facts. A few weeks later, I asked her how she was feeling about what I had told her. \u201cI\u2019m not proud and I\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d she answered evenly.She had accepted our slave trading forebears as yet another facet of the complex legacy she carries, but she did chide me for naming her after a slave port. I reminded her that her father and I had no idea at the time. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have found out?\u201d she challenged. With that simple question, my child demolished all of my excuses and reminded me that the truth of our family history, like our country\u2019s, had always been hidden in plain sight. It\u2019s our duty to seek it out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Recesses, Leaving More Stalemates Than Accomplishments", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress limped out of town Thursday for a seven-week recess, leaving behind a trail of partisan fights, a failed bill to help fight the Zika virus, a stalemate on gun safety and a few mundane accomplishments that members hoped to sell as awesome to voters in an unsparing mood.Although Congress began the year with some legislative accomplishments, including an important energy measure, Democrats have been eager in recent months to rob Republicans of even modest victories as they head into the election. Republicans, in turn, have been unable to resist attempts to legislate social policy through spending and other unrelated bills, furthering the impasse. The result has largely been inertia.\u201cI am glad we have been able to make some bipartisan accomplishments,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \u201cBut I am disappointed by the dysfunction.\u201dSome of that gridlock has reflected the broader toxic atmosphere in a nation anxious about terrorism and dismayed over the state of race relations and a rising number of police shootings.Fights over gun legislation, over federal aid to help Flint, Mich., and especially over Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy have set the tone for months.Thursday began with Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, trading insults on the Senate floor for roughly 45 minutes over who was most to blame for the gridlock that has defined Congress since divided government began in 2011.\u201cDespite Senate Democrats\u2019 efforts to put partisan politics before pressing issues like national security and Zika,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cthe Republican-led Senate is working hard to advance solutions for the American people.\u201dDemocrats, eager to retake control of the Senate, painted Republicans as unable to govern.\u201cThere are two main reasons why this Republican Congress has been a flop,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the minority leader.\u201cFirst, Republicans made a calculated decision to appease the most radical factions of their party,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd who do they have? They have Donald Trump. And second, there has been a serious erosion of trust since Republicans assumed the majority.\u201dAt midday, Democrats played host to Mrs. Clinton while Republicans retreated to a separate room to enjoy Alaskan salmon and halibut served by Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, as gossip about Mr. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick swirled.By day\u2019s end, a plan to aid the fight against the mosquito-borne Zika virus, a measure to prevent terrorists from getting guns, scores of judicial confirmations, a sweeping bipartisan criminal justice reform package and basic appropriations bills were left scattered about like errant wrappers from the Senate candy drawer.Most notably, Republicans and Democrats failed to come together to approve money to combat Zika, despite widespread agreement that the virus, which can cause serious birth defects, was a public health emergency.The measure failed after House Republicans refused to accept a bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate, and instead inserted clauses that reignited old disputes over government financing for Planned Parenthood.Senate Democrats twice rejected the Republican measure, including in a repeat vote on Thursday that Mr. McConnell scheduled in an effort to show that Democrats and not Republicans were the ones obstructing.One thing was clear: No new funding was approved.\u201cIt\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, whose state was expected to be among the hardest hit by Zika.\u201cThere was a time in America where there were a number of issues that were beyond politics, like everyone could agree that on something like this we wouldn\u2019t use it for political advantage,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s very few things left that fit that category.\u201dBut even these cases were marked by bitterness rather than collegial celebration. The White House did not issue a veto threat, but denounced the opioid measure for not including the necessary financing to implement its provisions \u2014 a view echoed by Democrats in Congress.\u201cNobody ought to be taking any victory laps,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.Even as members took to hallways and the Senate floor to denounce one another, there were poignant and just plain odd moments throughout the week. Miss America contestants strolled through the Capitol wearing their sashes, only to get caught in a brief lockdown after reports of a shooting nearby.The fraught state of race relations was a frequent topic in both chambers, and on Thursday, Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, took to the floor for the second day in a row to describe his experiences, as an African-American, of being pulled over by the police.Byron Dorgan, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota, said his onetime colleagues simply reflected the broader disagreements among their constituents.\u201cThe structure of governing isn\u2019t working,\u201d Mr. Dorgan said.\u201cThey are all a product of what comes out of their town meetings,\u201d he added. \u201cIt pulls them to the right or pulls them to the left, and it imposes a huge penalty if they decide they want to be somebody that wants to meet in the middle someplace.\u201dIn the House, where Republicans do not have to overcome filibusters, more legislation has been approved, but it has also been far more partisan.On Thursday afternoon, as most lawmakers raced for the airport, some went to the floor to continue to snipe. Mr. McConnell said more could be accomplished if Democrats would show flexibility.\u201cWith continued hard work, and cooperation from our friends across the aisle,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can continue to add to that record of achievement for people across the country.

These contracts have flourished in communities where there was a large supply of cheap, foreclosed homes and a paucity of mortgages for properties worth substantially less than $100,000.\u201cLand installment contracts are popular with investors because defaulting borrowers can be swiftly evicted, and traditional mortgage foreclosure protections do not apply,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis allows investors to reap substantial profits.\u201dSome state regulators and federal lawmakers are pushing for stronger action to clamp down on predatory seller-financed home sales.One of the larger national firms to emerge in the contract for deed market is Harbour Portfolio Advisors. The Dallas company has bought nearly 7,000 homes \u2014 most of them from the government-backed mortgage company Fannie Mae \u2014 and has been reselling them \u201cas is,\u201d often in need of major repairs, through contracts that critics contend lack basic consumer protections. The Times article in February focused on Harbour Portfolio.The National Consumer Law Center looked at 94 homes that Harbour Portfolio had purchased in the Atlanta area and found that the properties were overwhelmingly located in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.In one case, Charles Wright, 46, of Lithonia, Ga., spent more than $12,000 on repairs and improvements for a Harbour Portfolio home in 2012. The company then moved to evict Mr. Wright this year after he missed several monthly payments last year.Over three years, Mr. Wright paid more than $17,000 toward the balance of the 30-year contract, according to his lawyer and one of the authors of the report. Mr. Wright said he felt misled by Harbour Portfolio, which had bought the home for $11,745 from Fannie Mae.\u201cThey were wrong for telling me that I was buying a house and then getting me to put all this money in,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cAnd now they are kicking me out.\u201dIn an emailed response, a representative for Harbour Portfolio said: \u201cWe have worked hard to resolve any issues with him in the past and we will continue to look for a solution.\u201dThe representative added, \u201cHarbour welcomes the opportunity to work with government authorities to create a specific framework for this industry.\u201dThe law center report also noted that from the 1930s to the 1960s, contract for deed sales were typically used by home sellers in black communities where mortgages were largely unavailable.But then as now, a contract for deed created a \u201cmirage of homeownership,\u201d the report said. It said that the housing lawyers who were interviewed described \u201cmarketing schemes that appeared to target African-American and Spanish-speaking consumers.\u201dThe report urges the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take the lead in pushing for \u201ccomprehensive regulation\u201d or pursuing enforcement actions against sellers who use predatory contracts. The federal consumer protection bureau has jurisdiction over seller-financed transactions.It also recommends that all land contracts be recorded, that they use the same standard contract and that sellers be required to pay for an independent appraisal and inspection of the home before a sale.New Mexico officials are also investigating reports that contract for deed home sales are targeting immigrant and Spanish-speaking populations, according to Hector Balderas, the state\u2019s attorney general.\u201cIn my review of the issue there is no effective government oversight in measuring the scope of the problem,\u201d Mr. Balderas said. \u201cNobody is monitoring the scope and size of these real estate contracts.\u201dBut the contracts and other forms of seller-financing deals have strong supporters, too.Several nonprofit organizations are using contract for deed sales to help those who have poor credit find a path to homeownership. Historically, such contracts have been used by people to sell their homes to friends and relatives.Several legislators introduced a bill in the House of Representatives in May that would relax some of the rules for companies that enter into fewer than 24 seller-financed transactions in a year. The measure would amend a provision in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that requires companies engaging in contract for deed sales to register as mortgage originators.\u201cWe know a lot of folks who are unbanked or unbankable \u2014 you can\u2019t fit a square peg in a round hole \u2014 and that is where seller financing comes in,\u201d said Charles Tassell, a member of the Seller Finance Coalition, a two-year-old group that has lobbied for the bill.\u201cIf seller financing isn\u2019t a good deal for both sides,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not going to succeed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Williams Faces Uphill Battle in Fight With Energy Transfer", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWhen a publicly traded company is acquired, the buyer and the target will enter into an agreement to accomplish this takeover. It is called a merger agreement because this is the structure used to acquire the company. A merger, for those who are wondering, is a legal way to combine two companies into one and eliminate all of the shareholders of the target company.The merger agreement specifies the transaction structure, but it also sets forth a road map. A merger of two public companies can almost never be completed right away. Shareholders and regulators must approve it. Financing may need to be obtained, and other consents may be warranted. Because of this, there is typically a lag of at least two to three months between the signing and announcement the merger agreement and the completion of the deal. The lag can be longer if there is a more searching antitrust inquiry.The \u201croad map\u201d dictates how the two companies will get from signing to closing. It specifies how the deal will be done and what the parties need to do to complete the transaction.This is where the conditions in a merger agreement come in. The parties are required to use some level of effort to complete the transaction. Neither party is required to close unless the specified conditions in the merger agreement are fulfilled. In other words, there are conditions to closing and each party must use \u201cefforts\u201d to fulfill them. For example, where shareholder approval is required, the merger agreement will specify that the parties have to hold a shareholder meeting and file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And there is the catchall of requiring that the parties use \u201cefforts\u201d to obtain this approval.This is the issue in the Williams case. The agreement with Energy Transfer was very favorable to Williams. It required Energy Transfer to specifically perform the agreement and complete the transaction. There was no right, as was more common in the days leading up to the financial crisis, for Energy Transfer to simply terminate the deal and pay a so-called reverse-termination fee.But if there is one lesson we learned from failed deals involving companies like Huntsman, Penn National Gaming, Clear Channel and BCE, if a deal looks like it should break, it will, no matter the legal issues.Energy Transfer\u2019s chance to escape this transaction arose out of an obscure condition in merger agreements where the consideration paid includes stock. In those situations, the stock payment is typically tax-free. The shareholders of the target company receive stock in the acquirer and do not need to pay taxes at the time of the merger because it is deemed to be a reorganization. Instead, taxes are deferred until they sell the stock they receive.To ensure the deal is indeed tax-free, there is a condition that the lawyers on both sides will give an opinion that the transaction is a tax-free reorganization. In this case, the condition required Energy Transfer\u2019s lawyers, Latham & Watkins, to give the opinion that the transaction \u201c\u2018should\u2019 be treated by the tax authorities as a tax-free exchange under Section 721(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d In the taxonomy of legal opinions, by the way, \u201cshould\u201d instead of \u201cwill\u201d is a lower standard that gives the law firm wiggle room to stick to its opinion.This is where things went awry and Williams sued. The trial court found that Latham & Watkins legitimately decided that it could no longer give this opinion. The reasons are buried in the minutiae of tax law and an unbelievably complex transaction. But the basic idea is that to be a tax-free deal in this circumstance, there had to be a certain ratio of cash to stock. This ratio is traditionally set at the time a deal is signed under I.R.S. rulings. After additional scrutiny of its client\u2019s deal at Energy Transfer\u2019s request, Latham found problems.It is suspicious of course that Latham would suddenly find this out months after the deal was signed, potentially saving its client billions of dollars. And indeed, Judge Glasscock said as much, though he justified his findings on the idea that just because things look suspicious does not mean that there is wrongdoing.The judge based his opinion on two findings. First, he read into the condition in the merger agreement a need for good faith on the part of Latham. He concluded that Latham fulfilled this requirement.Second, Latham was not a party to the merger agreement. It is really Energy Transfer\u2019s behavior that is in question here. Judge Glasscock still had to find that Energy Transfer had not breached its obligation to use \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d to close the transaction. He found that it did not, reasoning that once Latham said it could not give the opinion, Energy Transfer was off the hook.The beauty of this reasoning is that it spares the judge the headache of determining who is right on the tax point, probably an impossibility for a judge.With the tax opinion condition unfulfilled, the so-called drop-dead date occurred. This is the date that every merger agreement has, ensuring that the deal does not go on forever. But a party cannot be in breach of their agreement to invoke this right. Because the judge found that Energy Transfer was acting appropriately, it was able to terminate the deal on June 28, 2016, the agreement\u2019s drop-dead date.Williams has announced that it is appealing the Delaware court\u2019s ruling to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. It is likely to also reserve the right to argue before the higher court that Energy Transfer is still obligated to close the transaction instead of paying damages.In Delaware, the conventional wisdom is that appeals normally lose. The Delaware Supreme Court defers to the Chancery Court, particularly in a case like this in which the sides are arguing over facts.Williams\u2019 only real chance is to argue some legal error. From the briefs in the case, its most likely route is to argue that Energy Transfer could not just sit there once Latham gave its report. Instead, Energy Transfer was obligated to look for an alternative way to close the deal. And here, there is some odd inferential behavior, like the fact that Energy Transfer did not extensively consult with its transactional counsel, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, on the tax issues.Williams has nothing to lose by appealing. Even so, it all comes down to whether the Delaware Supreme Court wants to intervene and, if so, whether it agrees that reasonable efforts as a standard required more in this situation. These are valid questions, but it is going to be an uphill battle for Williams to show that this fine legal point matters given the fact-finding of the lower court judge and the penchant of the state\u2019s Supreme Court to defer to the lower court on these issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sports Court Upholds Ban on Russian Track and Field Athletes", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byAn appeals court on Thursday upheld the ban on Russia\u2019s track and field team from the Rio Olympics, empowering sports organizations to discipline other Russian teams after revelations of a government-run doping scheme.With just over two weeks until the opening ceremony in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had deferred the decision of whether to take aggressive measures to individual sports federations like the I.A.A.F. After detailed proof of state-sponsored cheating was produced this week in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency, Olympic officials said they would \u201cexplore legal options,\u201d but they also indicated that they would await the arbitration court\u2019s decision before taking action.Thursday\u2019s ruling, affirming the track and field organization\u2019s authority over a nation\u2019s Olympic participation, enables the I.O.C. to pass responsibility for the Russian doping crisis to the 28 individual sports federations that participate in the Summer Games. Olympic officials are set to convene on the matter Sunday.Among the options ahead: Olympic officials could call on the other individual sports federations \u2014 such as those in gymnastics and weight lifting \u2014 to follow the I.A.A.F.\u2019s lead and engage in a case-by-case review of Russian athletes registered to compete in Rio. Or a blanket ban of the Russian Federation could be adopted.In response to Thursday\u2019s decision, Sebastian Coe, head of the track and field organization, said that while he was \u201cthankful\u201d the ban had been upheld, he was not celebrating.\u201cI didn\u2019t come into this sport to stop athletes from competing,\u201d he said in a statement.The appeals court said that because of the urgent nature of the case, it was issuing only its verdict, which was unanimous. Its full decision, including the grounds for the verdict, will be issued as soon as possible, the court said.\u201cIn my view, certainly, this decision absolutely violates the rights of clean athletes, honest athletes, and sets a collective responsibility precedent,\u201d Vitaly Mutko, Russia\u2019s sports minister, said at a news conference in Moscow.In instituting its ban, the I.A.A.F. invited Russian athletes living outside the country who had been regularly tested for drugs to petition to compete individually; officials said they had offered that option in part to protect against court challenges.The I.A.A.F. said that the exempted athletes would not compete in Rio under the Russian flag but rather as unaffiliated athletes. Russia won 18 medals in track and field, including eight golds, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Whether the country\u2019s medal aspirations in other sports in Rio are squashed, too, could soon be determined by other sports federations.Those federations, however, have little expertise in adjudicating doping cases, and in the political world of sports, some have strong ties to Russia.A step-by-step look at how Russian agents used an elaborate scheme to swap out tainted urine samples for clean ones taken months earlier.Sports officials and antidoping authorities alike have agitated for strong action from the I.O.C. in recent days, pointing out that the Olympic organization had in its power a drastic option that would seem to be beyond legal challenge: banning the whole Russian delegation from the Games.\u201cIt\u2019s really important for the I.O.C. to defend its integrity and make a strong statement now by suspending the Russian National Olympic Committee,\u201d said Max Cobb, president of the United States Biathlon Association. Mr. Cobb added that he thought the evidence presented this week condemned not only the Russian sports ministry but also the Olympic committee.For the I.O.C. to wait until the arbitration decision was announced on Thursday, Mr. Cobb said, was \u201cunnecessary stalling.\u201dMore than a dozen national antidoping organizations \u2014 including those in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway \u2014 echoed that sentiment Wednesday, sending a letter to the I.O.C. that argued for denying all Russian athletes entry in the Olympics, according to the correspondence, which was obtained by The New York Times.\u201cThis is a responsibility that cannot and should not be delegated by the I.O.C.,\u201d the letter said. Anything less than a full ban, the officials wrote, \u201cis not a reasonable and proportionate measure to protect the value of the Olympic promise given the circumstances caused by the state-run doping program that corrupted the Olympic Games.\u201d The allegations of cheating have extended to the last two Olympic Games, in London in 2012 and in Sochi, Russia, in 2014.Such conduct extended across disciplines, inquiries commissioned by WADA found. According to Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer who led the most recent inquiry and wrote this week\u2019s report, Russia\u2019s antidoping lab covered up drug violations affecting \u201cvirtually all sports\u201d since at least 2011.Mr. McLaren is a longtime global sports arbitrator who decided several precedent-setting cases that probably figured into the deliberations that led to Thursday\u2019s decision, made by three arbitrators, from Britain, Italy and the United States.The arbitration court, which has its headquarters in a chateau in Lausanne, Switzerland, has for decades had supreme authority in international sports disputes; its decisions can be overruled by the Swiss Federal Tribunal on the basis of a procedural error only.The president of the court\u2019s parent organization, the International Council of Arbitration for Sport, which appoints arbitrators to the court, is John D. Coates of Australia, an I.O.C. executive board member who participated in the committee\u2019s urgent meeting on Tuesday to discuss possible courses of action the I.O.C. might take against Russia.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In New Jersey Student Loan Program, Even Death May Not Bring a Reprieve", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byAnd then there were the college loans.When Ms. DeOliveira-Longinetti called about his federal loans, an administrator offered condolences and assured her the balance would be written off.But she got a far different response from a New Jersey state agency that had also lent her son money.\u201cPlease accept our condolences on your loss,\u201d a letter from that agency, the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, said. \u201cAfter careful consideration of the information you provided, the authority has determined that your request does not meet the threshold for loan forgiveness. Monthly bill statements will continue to be sent to you.\u201dMs. DeOliveira-Longinetti, who co-signed on the loans, was shocked and confused. But her experience with the authority, which runs by far the largest state-based student loan program in the country, is hardly an isolated one, an investigation by ProPublica, in collaboration with The New York Times, found.New Jersey\u2019s loans, which currently total $1.9 billion, are unlike those of any other government lending program for students in the country. They come with extraordinarily stringent rules that can easily lead to financial ruin. Repayments cannot be adjusted based on income, and borrowers who are unemployed or facing other financial hardships are given few breaks.The loans also carry higher interest rates than similar federal programs. Most significant, New Jersey\u2019s loans come with a cudgel that even the most predatory for-profit players cannot wield: the power of the state. New Jersey can garnish wages, rescind state income tax refunds, revoke professional licenses, even take away lottery winnings \u2014 all without having to get court approval.\u201cIt\u2019s state-sanctioned loan-sharking,\u201d Daniel Frischberg, a bankruptcy lawyer, said. \u201cThe New Jersey program is set up so that you fail.\u201dThe authority, which boasts in brochures that its \u201csingular focus has always been to benefit the students we serve,\u201d has become even more aggressive in recent years. Interviews with dozens of borrowers, who were among the tens of thousands who have turned to the program, show how the loans have unraveled lives.The program\u2019s regulations have destroyed families\u2019 credit and forced them to forfeit their salaries. One college graduate declared bankruptcy at age 26 after struggling to repay his debt. The agency filed four simultaneous lawsuits against a 31-year-old paralegal after she fell behind on her payments.Another borrower, Chris Gonzalez, could not keep up with his loans after he got non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and was laid off by Goldman Sachs. While the federal government allowed him to suspend his payments because of hardship, New Jersey sued him, seeking $266,000 in payments, and seized a state tax refund he was owed.One reason for the aggressive tactics is that the state depends on Wall Street investors to finance student loans through tax-exempt bonds and needs to satisfy those investors by keeping losses to a minimum.In 2010, the agency filed fewer than 100 suits against borrowers and their families. Last year, it filed over 1,600. (Some could result from federal loans handled by New Jersey, though such loans make up just 4 percent of the agency\u2019s portfolio.)The cases are handled by debt collectors, who can tack on another 30 percent in fees on top of the outstanding debt.Marcia Karrow, the authority\u2019s chief of staff, said that \u201cthe vast majority of these borrowers are happy with the program.\u201d She added that New Jersey\u2019s loans had \u201csome of the lowest default rates\u201d in the country. But when asked to produce the annual default rates, the agency sent ProPublica and The Times data only for students with strong credit scores, making it impossible to calculate the overall rate.Besides administering the loan program, the authority provides financial aid counseling, conducting hundreds of financial aid nights at New Jersey high schools, where it offers advice about paying for college, including pitching its own loans.Ms. DeOliveira-Longinetti, who emigrated from Brazil and had long worked as a nanny while raising her son as a single mother, always knew that paying for his college education would be a challenge. Even after marrying her husband when Kevin DeOliveira was in middle school, she knew that their combined income would not be enough to cover the costs. A friend told her about New Jersey\u2019s program. That, along with a combination of scholarships, grants and other loans, allowed Mr. DeOliveira to enroll at the University of Vermont.Since her son was fatally shot, Ms. DeOliveira-Longinetti has made 18 payments to New Jersey. Paying $180 per month, she has about 92 to go.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be poor because of this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut every time I have to pay this thing, I think in my head, this is so unfair.\u201dFor decades, states served as middlemen for federal student loans. Most of the loans were made by banks and were handled and backed by regional and state-based agencies as well as by the federal government. The arrangement was unwieldy, expensive and marked by scandal.In 2010, Congress and the Obama administration decided to effectively eliminate the role of state agencies by having only the federal government lend directly to students.Ms. Karrow said the growth of New Jersey\u2019s program was simply a result of both the increasing number of students and the rising cost of tuition. But in fact, college enrollment and tuition have not grown as rapidly as the program\u2019s size.While other states have similar loan programs, New Jersey\u2019s stands apart, for both its size and its onerous terms.The agency, Ms. Karrow said, treats each instance of a deceased borrower case by case and tries to be compassionate, but, she added, \u201cwe must also meet our fiduciary duty to our bondholders.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing in the federal law or regulations that prohibits them from offering private loan rehabilitation, \u201d Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert, said.The combination of a lack of flexibility, an unwillingness to discharge loans and the state\u2019s power to seize wages has resulted in even \u201cmore intractable problems for our clients than predatory mortgages, deceptive car loans or illegal internet payday lending,\u201d said David McMillin, a lawyer with Legal Services of New Jersey, a nonprofit that provides free legal assistance to low-income state residents. \u201cMany borrowers and co-signers find themselves facing a lifetime of debt problems.\u201dGiven the lack of options, some New Jersey borrowers have resorted to declaring bankruptcy, even though, as is true of all student loans, their debt is rarely canceled. Declaring bankruptcy also makes it virtually impossible to secure a mortgage, lease a car or even use credit cards for years. But for New Jersey borrowers, such an extreme step at least offers a way to gain manageable monthly payment terms.As a co-signer, Tracey Timony struggled to help pay off her daughter\u2019s $140,000 in loans. Though the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority can seize wages or tax returns without court approval, it must secure a judgment to dip into borrowers\u2019 bank accounts or place liens on their property. Instead of garnishing Ms. Timony\u2019s wages, New Jersey sued her after her daughter defaulted.\u201cThe agency is looking to put as much pressure on the borrower and be as aggressive as possible, and the way that you do that is you go after everybody that is liable,\u201d Jennifer Weil, a New Jersey student debt lawyer, said. \u201cIn case the garnishment doesn\u2019t work, a judgment will help put pressure on the parents.\u201dMs. Timony declared bankruptcy and got monthly debt payments that will rise no higher than about $1,000 a month, far less than what the agency had demanded.\u201cI never thought that sending my daughter to college would ruin our lives,\u201d Ms. Timony said.Few have felt the weight of the agency\u2019s powers more than Mr. Gonzalez, the college graduate who was sued after receiving a diagnosis of cancer and losing his job.He had borrowed the maximum he could in federal loans \u2014 a total of about $30,000 for five years \u2014 and paid for most of his tuition with loans from New Jersey.\u201cI felt so comfortable because it was the State of New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s the state, my government, trying to help me out and achieve my American dream. It turns out they were the worst ones.\u201dMr. Gonzalez\u2019s loans had a relatively high interest rate \u2014 on average about 7.5 percent. At the time it seemed like a good investment. He graduated with an engineering degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and landed a job on Wall Street working as a programmer for Goldman Sachs.But a few months after he started, unusual rashes began to appear on his legs and underarms. He learned he had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and started radiation therapy.After three years of cancer treatments, Mr. Gonzalez was also laid off.He needed to take care of his student loans. The federal government and his private lenders all deferred his debt for at least six months.Mr. Gonzalez expected New Jersey to do the same, but the agency refused, requiring him to pay at least $500 a month. With unemployment checks as his only income and burdened by continuing health expenses, it was too much for him.He made no payments while the agency reviewed his case. In June 2014, Mr. Gonzalez moved to Florida to lower his cost of living. His health slowly improved and he started his own company, developing technology for small businesses. In his first year, he made just $26,000, but he started to pay back his federal and private bank loans.On May 8, 2015, after months of hearing nothing, he received an email from New Jersey: His deferral request had been denied and his loan was being sent to a collection agency.\u201cUnfortunately, because of how the loan originated, the authority is not in a position to offer forbearance or relief,\u201d Robert Laird, a program officer at the loan agency, said in the email.Terrified by what a default would mean for his credit rating, Mr. Gonzalez told the agency that he would stop paying for health insurance and use the money \u2014 $200 per month \u2014 to repay the loans.The agency rejected the offer. \u201cIn the event that your doctor declares you total and permanently disabled, please keep me posted,\u201d Mr. Laird told Mr. Gonzalez in an email.One day in April, a stranger rang Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s doorbell.\u201cChris Gonzalez?\u201d he asked. Mr. Gonzalez nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been served with a lawsuit from the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority.\u201dThe suit demanded over $260,000 \u2014 about $188,000 for the original loans, $34,000 in interest, and $44,000 to cover the fees of a collection agency\u2019s lawyer.Even if his business improves, Mr. Gonzalez has no idea how he will afford his ballooning payments.\u201cI don\u2019t have money,\u201d he said. \u201cI am spending it all on my debt.\u201dAnnie Waldman is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Embraces Ideas From Bernie Sanders\u2019s College Tuition Plan", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byMr. Sanders, who has yet to end his candidacy and endorse Mrs. Clinton, praised her education proposal as a \u201cvery bold initiative\u201d in a brief news conference in Washington on Wednesday, calling it a significant step for party unity. \u201cThe final product is the work of both campaigns,\u201d he said \u2014 a clear sign of thawing relations between the two after a bitterly fought nominating contest.Also, borrowing a key aspect of Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan, the new proposal appears to make tougher demands on states than her previous one.Education policy experts generally praised the new proposal, calling the requirements for state financial participation essential to reversing the drastic state cuts in higher education support. But some experts said details of the initiative \u2014 including exactly how it would work and be paid for \u2014 were sketchy, and raised concerns that some states would decline to contribute money.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.They also raised questions about the impact on private colleges and universities with small endowments that compete with state institutions.\u201cTo the extent that it borrows from the Sanders system of federal-state matching, that\u2019s a very significant step forward in our judgment,\u201d said Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, whose membership includes many regional public universities. \u201cThe reason prices have gone up is that states have been withdrawing their support.\u201dF. King Alexander, the chancellor of Louisiana State University, who has advocated a state matching requirement in federal education funding, said the Clinton campaign had been in contact with him about the proposal.\u201cThe most important part of the plan is that the federal government plays a role in getting states to reinvest and keep higher education affordable at public colleges and universities,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cYou can only play in the free college game if your state maintains its commitment.\u201dMrs. Clinton had previously raised questions about that aspect of Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan, saying it gave states the ability to opt out, just as some had done with Medicaid expansion. As recently as this spring, Mrs. Clinton scoffed at the idea that Republican governors like Scott Walker of Wisconsin \u2014 who has slashed state spending on the University of Wisconsin \u2014 would ever go along with Mr. Sanders and support state matching funds to qualify for his proposed federal tuition grants. She was almost surely right \u2014 and on Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Walker said the governor would not go along with her plan, either, seeing it as costly and ineffective.The Clinton campaign was struggling with the question of what would happen if some states refused to participate, said an education expert who was consulted on the plan.In addition to possible opposition from states that would not want to pay or that resent federal intrusion, the plan might face resistance from private colleges and universities that compete with public institutions receiving the federal money, even though it pledges $25 billion over 10 years to help historically black colleges and other private colleges with modest endowments.\u201cOur biggest concern with it is how it limits student choice,\u201d said Sarah A. Flanagan, the vice president of government relations for the 965-member National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. \u201cIt would put a lot of subsidies \u2014 well over $100 billion in new money \u2014 towards major economic incentives for people to go to their in-state public colleges, not even out-of-state public colleges. It certainly limits student choice.\u201dMrs. Clinton had previously said she would raise the money for her education plan, estimated last year to cost $350 billion over 10 years, by limiting deductions for high-income taxpayers. The additional cost of the proposals announced Wednesday would be covered by closing tax loopholes, particularly those used by hedge funds and private equity firms, the campaign said. Mr. Sanders had said his plan to make college tuition free would have cost $70 billion a year, with one-third of that paid for by states.As part of her package of proposals, Mrs. Clinton, who speaks often on the campaign trail of her plans for debt-free college education, is also calling for a three-month moratorium on the repayment of federal student loans. The move, which the campaign said would be carried out through executive action if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, would allow borrowers to refinance loans or restructure high-interest debt.If adopted, her initiative would take shape over several years, the campaign said, initially covering students whose families make $85,000 a year or less. The threshold would increase by $10,000 a year until it reached $125,000 in 2021.The announcement arrives as Mr. Sanders and his allies seek to exert maximum influence over the official Democratic platform, hoping to push Mrs. Clinton to the left on a number of fronts.\u201cThis represents a doubling down by Hillary Clinton on the idea that if you\u2019re a student in America, you should be able to attend your state\u2019s public colleges or universities and graduate with zero debt,\u201d Mr. Green said in a statement. \u201cIt would be smart general election messaging if the popular idea of debt-free college with a tuition-free component gets enshrined in the Democratic platform.\u201dAt his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said: \u201cI want to take this opportunity this afternoon to applaud Secretary Clinton for the very bold initiative she has brought forth for the financing of higher education. This proposal combines some of the strongest ideas which she fought for during the campaign with some of the principles that I fought for.\u201dPatrick Healy and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keep Your Mouth Closed: Aquatic Olympians Face a Toxic Stew in Rio", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Health experts in Brazil have a word of advice for the Olympic marathon swimmers, sailors and windsurfers competing in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s picture-postcard waters next month: Keep your mouth closed.In fact, environmentalists and scientists say Rio\u2019s waters are much more contaminated than previously thought.Recent tests by government and independent scientists revealed a veritable petri dish of pathogens in many of the city\u2019s waters, from rotaviruses that can cause diarrhea and vomiting to drug-resistant \u201csuperbacteria\u201d that can be fatal to people with weakened immune systems.Researchers at the Federal University of Rio also found serious contamination at the upscale beaches of Ipanema and Leblon, where many of the half-million Olympic spectators are expected to frolic between sporting events.\u201cForeign athletes will literally be swimming in human crap, and they risk getting sick from all those microorganisms,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Becker, a local pediatrician who works in poor neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s sad but also worrisome.\u201dGovernment officials and the International Olympic Committee acknowledge that, in many places, the city\u2019s waters are filthy. But they say the areas where athletes will compete \u2014 like the waters off Copacabana Beach, where swimmers will race \u2014 meet World Health Organization safety standards.Even some venues with higher levels of human waste, like Guanabara Bay, present only minimal risk because athletes sailing or windsurfing in them will have limited contact with potential contamination, they add.Still, Olympic officials concede that their efforts have not addressed a fundamental problem: Much of the sewage and trash produced by the region\u2019s 12 million inhabitants continues to flow untreated into Rio\u2019s waters.\u201cOur biggest plague, our biggest environmental problem, is basic sanitation,\u201d said Andrea Correa, the top environmental official in the state of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThe Olympics has woken people up to the problem.\u201d\u201cWe just have to keep our mouths closed when the water sprays up,\u201d said Afrodite Zegers, 24, a member of the Dutch sailing team, which has been practicing in Guanabara Bay.Officials have been grappling with a welter of challenges as they scramble for the opening ceremony on Aug. 5. The Zika virus epidemic has dampened foreign ticket sales, crime is soaring, and the federal government has been paralyzed by the impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff.Last month, the acting governor of Rio de Janeiro, Francisco Dornelles, declared a state of emergency, claiming that a lack of money threatened \u201ca total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management.\u201dStill, Olympic organizers say the sports venues are nearly complete, and the federal government has provided emergency funds to the state. Many athletes expect the Games to proceed without serious complications.The city\u2019s contaminated waterways, however, are another matter.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Nigel Cochrane, a coach for the Spanish women\u2019s sailing team. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned.\u201dFor many, the sewage crisis is emblematic of the corruption and mismanagement that have long hobbled Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest country.Rio officials claim to have spent billions of dollars on sewage treatment systems since the 1990s, but few are functioning.In its 2009 bid for these Games, Brazil pledged to spend $4 billion to clean up 80 percent of the sewage that flows untreated into the bay. In the end, the state government spent just $170 million, citing a budget crisis, officials said.Most of the money in the state\u2019s sanitation budget has been spent on trash-collecting boats and portable berms to stop the sludge and debris that flow into the bay.Critics say they are cosmetic measures.\u201cThey can try to block big items like sofas and dead bodies, but these rivers are pure sludge, so the bacteria and viruses are going to just pass through,\u201d said Stelberto Soares, a municipal engineer who has spent three decades addressing the city\u2019s sanitation crisis.Mr. Soares said he laughed when he heard officials promise to tackle the sewage problem before the Games.An earlier, multibillion-dollar effort financed by international donors yielded a network of 35 sewage treatment facilities, 500 miles of conduits and 85 pumps, he said. When he last checked, only three of the pumps and two of those treatment plants were still working; the rest had been abandoned and mostly vandalized, he said.Asked what had happened, he threw up his hands. \u201cIn Brazil, they say sanitation doesn\u2019t get votes,\u201d he said.Romario Monteiro, 45, a second-generation fisherman who has spent a lifetime plying Guanabara Bay, recalls when the waters were crystalline and the fish were plentiful.Now his net often yields more trash than fish, including television sets, dead dogs and the occasional dolphin killed by ingesting plastic bags.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Mr. Monteiro said.He has sailed past more than a few dead bodies, including the corpse of a man bobbing in the water last month, his legs bound in rope.But Mr. Monteiro is most concerned with the shoreline factories that discharge chemical waste and the oil tankers that flush out their holds, giving the water\u2019s surface a multicolored sheen.As he pulled out from the harbor near his home on Governador Island, he pointed to a half-dozen pipes, exposed at low tide, belching out human waste from the island\u2019s 300,000 residents.\u201cWhen you open up the fish, their innards are black with oil and muck,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we clean them with soap and eat them anyway.\u201dFor many residents, especially those who live in the slums, or favelas, the lack of sanitation causes misery. Hepatitis A is endemic among favela residents, health experts say, and children are frequently sickened by the pathogens that seep from sewage-laden culverts into jury-rigged drinking water pipes.Irenaldo Honorio da Silva, 47, who leads the residents\u2019 committee in Pica-Pau, a favela with 7,000 residents, said local officials had been promising to address the sanitation crisis for decades.\u201cThey come, and then they go,\u201d he said.Heavy rains turn Pica-Pau\u2019s streets into a putrid stew. One edge of the community is bounded by a fetid canal, its banks lined with homes, abandoned cars and food vendors.The odor is overwhelming.\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d Mr. da Silva said. \u201cIn summer, it\u2019s unbearable.\u201dThat includes Flamengo, the bayside cove where the Olympic boating competitions will take place, and the iconic beaches that front some of Rio\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods.Residents still throng the beaches on the weekend, but Prof. Renata Pic\u00e3o, a microbiologist at the Federal University of Rio, has refused to step foot in the water since she began sampling it three years ago.Professor Pic\u00e3o has documented high levels of drug-resistant microbes at five of the city\u2019s best-known beaches. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a government-run lab, found superbacteria in the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, a body of water ringed by high-priced condominiums.She said the pathogens, potentially fatal to those with compromised immunities, probably come from local hospitals that discharge untreated waste. Although superbacteria may not pose a threat to healthy people, the organisms can remain in the body for years and wreak havoc if a person becomes otherwise sick.Professor Pic\u00e3o and other health experts say that unlike residents, who have been repeatedly exposed to sewage-borne pathogens, foreign visitors are more likely to fall ill after contact with contaminated waters.And she is not optimistic about future cleanup efforts.\u201cIf they couldn\u2019t clean things up for the Olympics, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I\u2019m afraid it might never happen,\u201d she said.Anna Jean Kaiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan Resists Strong Medicine for Stimulus", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s economy limped into the second half of the year, some analysts hoped that the central bank would take new, radical steps. It could move its benchmark interest rate further below zero. It could drop cash directly into the arms of Japanese consumers \u2014 so-called helicopter money.Instead, the Bank of Japan chose to keep things at a decidedly lower altitude, at least for now.The central bank said after its policy meeting on Friday that it would only slightly expand deflation-fighting stimulus, with changes that ranked at the cautious end of what analysts and investors had been expecting.But it also said it would carry out a \u201ccomprehensive assessment\u201d of its approach, a tacit admission that it had so far been unable to defeat the debilitating wage and price stagnation afflicting the Japanese economy.That review, which will be delivered at its next meeting, in September, is likely to stir speculation about whether the bank will try more drastic maneuvers to get the economy rolling.The central bank \u201cclearly disappointed the market today,\u201d said Michael Moen, a bond manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.\u201cReading between the lines, the bank appears to be acknowledging the limits of its policy tools, and the focus going forward will need to be on a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus,\u201d he said.There are few weapons in the normal central banking arsenal that the bank has not tried. Its benchmark interest rate is already set below zero, a move intended to try to force companies to invest money rather than hoard it. It is buying government bonds at a rate of 80 trillion yen, or $770 billion, a year to keep banks flush with cash to lend.Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power at the end of 2012 on a promise to rekindle economic growth, his government has often seemed to leave much of the work to the central bank. Japan has the heaviest public debt load in the world, and Mr. Abe\u2019s administration is officially committed to reducing the deficit, so letting the central bank spend instead of the government is less contentious.But as his country\u2019s economy has struggled to grow at a meaningful pace, Mr. Abe has become less restrained. In June he postponed an increase in the national sales tax, and his government is going to put in place spending measures that Mr. Abe said this week would probably be worth \u00a528 trillion. Details are expected to be announced next week.This more aggressive attitude, combined with a recent visit to Tokyo by Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, had convinced some analysts and investors that the Bank of Japan might start to simply print money to pay for the spending.Katsunori Kitakura, a strategist at Sumi Trust, a Japanese asset manager, said he believed the Bank of Japan was essentially buying time with its small move on Friday and would take more decisive action once it assessed the government\u2019s spending plans.\u201cOnly once the government has outlined its fiscal spending measures do we expect the central bank to make a move,\u201d Mr. Kitakura said.The yen briefly jumped almost 3 percent against the dollar after the central bank announced its policy on Friday and was up 1.6 percent late in the Asian trading day. A stronger yen is damaging to many Japanese companies, which would receive less in exchange for their exports. Traders had sold the currency in anticipation that more stimulus spending would weaken it.Yet on Friday, the bank left its policy rate unchanged at minus 0.1 percent and said it would continue buying the same amount of government debt. And the central bank came nowhere close to introducing helicopter money.Instead, it announced that it would increase the scale of a program to buy exchange-traded stock funds to \u00a56 trillion a year from \u00a53.3 trillion, and it doubled the size of a dollar-denominated lending program aimed at Japanese companies operating overseas to $12 billion.The bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said he thought there were still more conventional policy levers left to pull.\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re approaching the limits of negative interest rates or qualitative and quantitate easing,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said, referring in part to the bank\u2019s bond-buying program. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pursuing an aggressive monetary policy for three years, and it\u2019s a natural time for a review.\u201dMr. Kuroda added that the bank could push interest rates further into negative territory, noting that they are even further below zero in some countries in Europe.He said he was against directly financing government spending with newly created money, a practice that has led to out-of-control inflation in some countries. But he suggested he was open to more nuanced cooperation between the government and the central bank.\u201cThe right policy mix can produce synergies between fiscal and monetary policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what we\u2019re doing is totally different from simply monetizing government debt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marie Kondo, Tidying Up and the Ruthless War on Stuff", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "FeaturesThe star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cTidying Up\u201d and author of \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d is training an army of emissaries to declutter the American home.Supported byUpon entering the Japan Society, the 93 Konverts in attendance (and me) were given lanyards that contained our information: our names, where we live and an option of either the proud \u201cTidying Completed!\u201d or the shameful \u201cTidying Not Yet Completed!\u201d In order to be considered tidy, you must have completed the method outlined in Kondo\u2019s book. It includes something called a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon,\u201d which means piling five categories of material possessions \u2014 clothing, books, papers, miscellaneous items and sentimental items, including photos, in that order \u2014 one at a time, surveying how much of each you have, seeing that it\u2019s way too much and then holding each item to see if it sparks joy in your body. The ones that spark joy get to stay. The ones that don\u2019t get a heartfelt and generous goodbye, via actual verbal communication, and are then sent on their way to their next life. This is the crux of the KonMari \u2014 that soon-to-be-trademarked nickname \u2014 and it is detailed in \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic\u201d and her more recent book, \u201cSpark Joy,\u201d which, as far as I can tell, is a more specific \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u201d but with folding diagrams. She is often mistaken for someone who thinks you shouldn\u2019t own anything, but that\u2019s wrong. Rather, she thinks you can own as much or as little as you like, as long as every possession brings you true joy.By the time her book arrived, America had entered a time of peak stuff, when we had accumulated a mountain of disposable goods \u2014 from Costco toilet paper to Isaac Mizrahi swimwear by Target \u2014 but hadn\u2019t (and still haven\u2019t) learned how to dispose of them. We were caught between an older generation that bought a princess phone in 1970 for $25 that was still working and a generation that bought $600 iPhones, knowing they would have to replace them within two years. We had the princess phone and the iPhone, and we couldn\u2019t dispose of either. We were burdened by our stuff; we were drowning in it.[Marie Kondo now has a show on Netflix called \u201cTidying Up.\u201d Read about it here.]People had an unnaturally strong reaction to the arrival of this woman and her promises of life-changing magic. There were people who had been doing home organizing for years by then, and they sniffed at her severe methods. (One professional American organizer sent me a picture of a copy of Kondo\u2019s book, annotated with green sticky notes marking where she approved of the advice and pink ones where she disapproved. The green numbered 16; the pink numbered more than 50). But then there were the women who knew that Kondo was speaking directly to them. They called themselves Konverts, and they say their lives have truly changed as a result of using her decluttering methods: They could see their way out of the stuff by aiming upward.At the Japan Society event, we were split into workshop groups, where we explained to one another what had brought us here and what we had got out of \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u201d Most of the women at the event could not claim \u201ctidying completed!\u201d status; only 27 in the room did, or less than a third. One woman in my group who had finished her tidying, Susan, expressed genuine consternation that a bunch of women who wanted to become KonMari tidying consultants hadn\u2019t even \u201ccompleted tidying!\u201d How were they going to tidy someone else\u2019s home when they couldn\u2019t even get their own in order? How could they possibly know how profoundly life could improve if they hadn\u2019t yet completed their tidying?A woman named Diana, who wore star-and-flower earrings, said that before she tidied, her life was out of control. Her job had been recently eliminated when she found the book. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message for women that you should be surrounded by things that make you happy,\u201d she said, and her and everyone else\u2019s faces engaged in wide-eyed, open-mouthed incredulous agreement, nodding emphatically up and down, skull to spine and chin to chest. \u201cI found the opposite of happiness is not sadness,\u201d Diana told us. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos.\u201d Another woman said she KonMaried a bad boyfriend. Having tidied everything in her home and finding she still distinctly lacked happiness, she held her boyfriend in her hands, realized he no longer sparked joy and got rid of him.During her lecture, Marie demonstrated how the body feels when it finds tidying joy. Her right arm pointed upward, her left leg bent in a display of glee or flying or something aerial and upright, her body arranged I\u2019m-a-little-teacup-style, and a tiny hand gesture accompanied by a noise that sounded like \u201ckyong.\u201d Joy isn\u2019t just happy; joy is efficient and adorable. A lack of joy, on the other hand, she represented with a different pose, planting both feet and slumping her frame downward with a sudden visible depletion of energy. When Kondo enacted the lack of joy, she appeared grayer and instantly older. There isn\u2019t a specific enough name for the absence of joy; it is every emotion that isn\u2019t pure happiness, and maybe it doesn\u2019t deserve a name, so quickly must it be expunged from your life. It does, however, have a sound effect: \u201czmmp.\u201dJoy is the only goal, Kondo said, and the room nodded, yes, yes, in emphatic agreement, heads bobbing and mouths agape in wonder that something so simple needed to be taught to them. \u201cMy dream is to organize the world,\u201d Kondo said as she wrapped up her talk. The crowd cheered, and Kondo raised her arms into the air like Rocky.When she was 19, her friends began offering her money for her tidying services. At the time, she was enrolled at Tokyo Woman\u2019s Christian University, studying sociology, with a concentration on gender. She happened upon a book called \u201cWomen With Attention Deficit Disorder,\u201d by Sari Solden, and in it there was a discussion over women who are too distracted to clean their homes. Kondo was disturbed that there was little consideration that a man might pick up the slack in this regard, that a woman with A.D.D. was somehow broken because she couldn\u2019t tidy. But, she conceded, buried in this outrageous notion was a core truth: that women have a closer connection to their surroundings than men do. She realized that the work she was doing as a tidying consultant was far more psychological than it was practical. Tidying wasn\u2019t just a function of your physical space; it was a function of your soul. After college she found work at a staffing agency but continued to take tidying jobs in the early mornings and late evenings, initially charging $100 per five-hour block. Eventually she quit her job, and soon, even working at tidying full time, the wait list for her services reached six months.When she enters a new home, Kondo says, she sits down in the middle of the floor to greet the space. She says that to fold a shirt the way everyone folds a shirt (a floppy rectangle) instead of the way she thinks you should (a tight mass of dignified envelope-shaped fabric so tensile that it could stand upright) is to deprive that shirt of the dignity it requires to continue its work, i.e. hanging off your shoulders until bedtime. She would like your socks to rest. She would like your coins to be treated with respect. She thinks your tights are choking when you tie them off in the middle. She would like you to thank your clothes for how hard they work and ensure that they get adequate relaxation between wearings. Before you throw them out \u2014 and hoo boy will you be throwing them out \u2014 she wants you to thank them for their service. She wants you to thank that blue dress you never wore, tell it how grateful you are that it taught you how blue wasn\u2019t really your color and that you can\u2019t really pull off an empire waist. She wants you to override the instinct to keep a certain thing because an HGTV show or a home-design magazine or a Pinterest page said it would brighten up your room or make your life better. She wants you to possess your possessions on your own terms, not theirs. (This very simple notion has proved to be incredibly controversial, but more on that later.)She is tiny \u2014 just 4-foot-8. When I interviewed her, not only did her feet not touch the ground when we were sitting, but her knees didn\u2019t even bend over the side of the couch. When she speaks, she remains pleasant-faced and smiling; she moves her hands around, framing the air in front of her, as if she were the director on \u201cElectric Company\u201d or Tom Cruise in \u201cMinority Report.\u201d The only visible possessions in her hotel room for a two-week trip from Tokyo were her husband\u2019s laptop and a small silver suitcase the size of a typical man\u2019s briefcase. She has long bangs that obscure her eyebrows, and that fact \u2014 along with the fact that her mouth never changes from a faint smile \u2014 contributes to a sense that she is participating in more of a pageant than an interview, which possibly is what it does feel like when big-boned American interviewers whose gargantuan feet do touch the ground come to your hotel room and start jawing at you through an interpreter. Her ankles are skinny but her wrists are muscular. When she shows pictures of herself in places she has tidied, before she starts, she looks like a lost sparrow in a tornado. On the other side, in the \u201cafter\u201d picture, it is hard to believe that such a creature could effect such change.Her success has taken her by surprise. She never thought someone could become so famous for tidying that it would be hard to walk down the street in Tokyo. \u201cI feel I am busy all the time and I work all the time,\u201d she said, and she did not seem so happy about this, though her faint smile never wavered. She sticks with speaking and press appearances and relegates her business to her handlers \u2014 the team of men who pop out of nowhere to surround any woman with a good idea. She feels as if she never has any free time.Kondo does not feel threatened by different philosophies of organization. \u201cI think his method is pretty great too,\u201d she told me later. She leaves room for something that people don\u2019t often give her credit for: that the KonMari method might not be your speed. \u201cI think it\u2019s good to have different types of organizing methods,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause my method might not spark joy with some people, but his method might.\u201d In Japan, there are at least 30 organizing associations, whereas in the United States we have just one major group, the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO). Kondo herself has never heard of NAPO, though she did tell me that she knows that the profession exists in the United States. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to anyone in particular, but what I\u2019ve heard is that thanks to my book and organizing method, now the organizing industry in general kind of bloomed and got a spotlight on it,\u201d she said, though I cannot imagine who told her this. \u201cThey kind of thanked me for how my book or method changed the course of the organizing industry in America.\u201dWhen you receive your Conference lanyard, you can add sticky ribbons to it that say anything from your level of participation in NAPO (chapter president, former board member, golden circle, NAPO Cares, etc.) to where you\u2019re from (a choice of the 41 states represented) to what your state of mind is (Diva, Lazy, High Maintenance, Happy to Be Here, Really?, Caution: Might Burst Into Show Tunes!). Once you are completely categorized, you can enjoy Conference.At Conference, I met women who organize basements. I met women who organize digital clutter. I met women who organize photos. I met women who categorized themselves as \u201csolopreneurs,\u201d which, what\u2019s that now? I met a woman who organizes thoughts, and please don\u2019t move onto the next sentence until you\u2019ve truly absorbed that: I met a woman who charges $100 per hour for the organization of thoughts. I heard the word \u201cdetritus\u201d pronounced three different ways. I met a woman in camouflage (though the invitation begged us to confine ourselves to our native business-casual), who carried a clipboard and called herself Major Mom, and instead of an organizer she calls herself a liberator, like in Falluja.I went to a seminar on closets and pantries that I hoped would be, I don\u2019t know, more spiritual than it was, or at the very least address the problem of the cans of beans I keep buying and not using \u2014 why do I keep buying them? Why am I not using them? Beans are a superfood, after all, and cheap, too. I like beans. But the woman droned on and on and on about shelving units and the pesky corner cabinets, how they misuse valuable space, but luckily there is a drawer or something that could help you fill that space, too, because negative space inside a cabinet is a crime no organizer worth her drawer dividers should find herself guilty of.Conference was different from the KonMari events that I attended. Whereas Kondo does not believe that you need to buy anything in order to organize and that storage systems provide only the illusion of tidiness, the women of Conference traded recon on timesaving apps, label makers, the best kind of Sharpie, the best tool they own (\u201csupersticky notes,\u201d \u201cdrawer dividers\u201d) and the best practices regarding clients who wouldn\u2019t offer their organization goals in a timely manner. I heard about the crises in the industry: that clients who printed out Pinterest pages and said, \u201cI want that,\u201d had unrealistic expectations; that the baby boomers are downsizing for the first time; that there is a rising generation that isn\u2019t interested in inheriting their parents\u2019 old junk.While NAPO members don\u2019t share any standardized method for organizing \u2014 the group offers certification classes, but each woman I spoke with has her own approach \u2014 they are fairly unified in their disdain for this Japanese interloper. They have waged a war through their fuming blog posts and their generally disgusted conversations, saying that she is a product only of good marketing, that she\u2019s not doing anything different from what they\u2019ve been doing since she was in diapers. They don\u2019t like that there\u2019s a prescribed order for tidying; they think you have to yield to what your client wants done and has time for. They don\u2019t like the once-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon, which on average is completed in six months; sometimes organizing is a many years effort or an ongoing one. They don\u2019t like that she hasn\u2019t really addressed what to do with all your kids\u2019 stuff and how to handle them. They don\u2019t like that you have to get rid of all of your papers, which is actually a misnomer: Kondo just says you should limit them because they\u2019re incapable of sparking joy, and you should confine them to three folders: needs immediate attention, must be kept for now, must be kept forever.At the opening-night cocktails/trade show, I stood in front of the booth of a man advertising his cleaning service, which can tidy up crime scenes as well as hoarders\u2019 homes, and I asked some women eating spring rolls what they had against Kondo. The nice ones, struggling for something that wasn\u2019t overtly bitchy to say, said they appreciated that the popularity of her book has brought attention to their industry, which still lobbies to be recognized by the government as an official occupation. (Until that happens, the NAPO women will have to continue calling themselves \u201cinterior designers\u201d or \u201cpersonal assistants\u201d; they would prefer \u201cproductivity consultants.\u201d) But they also feel as if they\u2019ve been doing this for years, that \u201cshe just has one hell of a marketing machine, but she\u2019s doing nothing that\u2019s so different from us,\u201d at least three of them said to me.Yet each organizer I spoke with said that she had the same fundamental plan that Kondo did, that the client should purge (they cry \u201cpurge\u201d for what Kondo gently calls \u201cdiscarding\u201d) what is no longer needed or wanted; somehow the extra step of thanking the object or folding it a little differently enrages them. This rage hides behind the notion that things are different here in America, that our lives are more complicated and our stuff is more burdensome and our decisions are harder to make.\u201cIt\u2019s a book if you\u2019re a 20-something Japanese girl and you live at home and you still have a bunch of your Hello Kitty toys and stuff,\u201d another NAPO member told me, which, while not the only thing a professional organizer told me that was tinged with an aggressive xenophobia and racism, it is the only one that can run in a New York Times article.They even hate Kondo\u2019s verbiage. The word she uses, \u201ctidying,\u201d is annoying and arcane to them. \u201cTidying is what you do before your mother-in-law comes over,\u201d said one woman, while her two friends nodded. In addition, what Kondo offers is limited. Ellen Faye, the president of NAPO, told me the night before: \u201cYou know, I have a client who got me the book, who said, \u2018Here, Ellen, read the book.\u2019 I did page through it. I think her first book is kind of like the grapefruit diet; that there\u2019s nothing wrong with just eating grapefruit. It\u2019s not going to get it all done. I mean grapefruit\u2019s great for losing weight, and what she says is great for bringing order to your life, but it\u2019s not the whole picture. It\u2019s just a narrow slice.\u201dUltimately, the women of NAPO said that Kondo\u2019s methods were too draconian and that the clients they knew couldn\u2019t live in Kondo\u2019s world. They had jobs and children, and they needed baby steps and hand-holding and maintenance plans. They needed someone to do for them what they couldn\u2019t naturally do for themselves.At the lounge, which included space for mindful coloring, I suggested to the organizers present that maybe the most potent difference between Kondo and the NAPO women is that the NAPO women seek to make a client\u2019s life good by organizing their stuff; Kondo, on the other hand, leads with her spiritual mission, to change their lives through magic. With her rigid once-in-a-lifetime tidying marathon directive (no baby steps, no \u201cslow and steady wins the race\u201d), she is a little like the grapefruit diet: simple and extreme and incredibly hard, the way Americans like our renewal plans.A woman who was coloring heard my theory and rolled her eyes. Her name was Heather Ahern, an organizer in Massachusetts for nearly 13 years, and she deals mostly with a clientele who were surviving something hard: divorce, death, loss \u2014 when, for example, their loved ones have no idea how to access any of their online accounts and delete them. \u201cDo you know how many dead people are on LinkedIn?\u201d she asked me. (The correct answer to this is not: I don\u2019t know, all of them?) \u201cFor some of my clients, just making it better is O.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a perfect house. There is no perfect house.\u201d But Kondo would agree with that.\u201cI guess it\u2019s the process,\u201d Ahern said of what bothers her most about Kondo. Ahern\u2019s philosophy is about process as much as about results. \u201cI see that my clients are just too fragile to do that,\u201d she said. We got up to go back to our rooms to briefly abandon our business-\u00adcasual for formal in preparation for the Black and White Ball, where the NAPO women would cut loose as much as their personalities would allow them by doing karaoke to Eminem and dancing to \u201cBaby Got Back.\u201dLast year, when Kondo visited San Francisco, she came to Ning\u2019s studio apartment, and Ning said she felt very ashamed when Kondo opened her closet. Kondo would visit San Francisco again to introduce the consultancy and maybe even before, and Ning told me she wanted to tidy and to show Kondo the progress. I asked if I could come along and maybe help Ning complete her tidying.When Ning was little, she loved to collect things: stamps, stickers, pencils. She was never overwhelmed by her stuff. She thinks of her childhood bedroom as \u201cvery happy.\u201d But as she grew into adulthood, she kept buying clothing: far too much of it.She went to work in finance, but she found the work empty and meaningless. She would come home and find herself overwhelmed by her stuff. So she began searching for \u201cminimalism\u201d on the internet almost constantly, happening on Pinterest pages of beautiful, empty bathrooms and kitchens, and she began to imagine that it was her stuff that was weighing her down. She read philosophy blogs about materialism and the accumulation of objects. \u201cThey just all talked about feeling lighter,\u201d she said, with one leg folded under her and another on the floor as she sat on her bed, which no longer sparks joy and which she would sell in the coming weeks. Ning wanted that lightness.And here, at this moment in the story, Ning began to cry. \u201cI never knew how to get here from there,\u201d she said. Ning looked around her apartment, which is spare. She loves it here now, but that seemed impossible just a couple of years ago.She found Kondo\u2019s book, and she felt better immediately, just having read it. She began tidying, and immediately she lost three pounds. She had been trying to lose weight forever, and then suddenly, without effort, three pounds, just gone.One day, she was texting a friend, saying that she thought she could live her ideal life if only she could work as Kondo\u2019s assistant. It happened that Kondo was in San Francisco and, even better, she was speaking across the street from Ning\u2019s finance job. After the talk, Ning tried to speak with Kondo, but she walked away with only a KonMari business card from one of Kondo\u2019s associates. She didn\u2019t hear anything initially when she wrote to the address.Undeterred, she quit her job and arranged a trip to Japan. There, she finally talked to associates of Kondo\u2019s who told her of their plans to expand into the United States. Could Ning help? Could she! Ning worked free for KonMari Inc. for five months, before landing a salaried position. She donated the suits that she wore to her finance job and hung up all of her yoga clothing in her closet, even though, technically, KonMari does not endorse hanging leisure wear, but that is all she wears now, and all I\u2019ve seen her wear, from the yoga class we did together to the professional events we attended.Ning has thrown away her collections. She has gone to her family\u2019s home in San Diego and thrown away whatever was left there too. She wiped her tears and leaned in and told me, like a secret, that she has kept one collection: the stickers. She asked me if I wanted to see her album. She pulled it out from under her bed, pages and pages of Snoopy stickers and stickers of frogs and cupcakes and bunnies in raincoats playing in puddles and Easter baskets. She smiled down at them and touched a few while I thumbed through the pages. She asked if I wanted to watch her KonMari her pantry, and I said yes, of course I did. I sat next to her shelf full of books with names like \u201cSecrets of Self-Healing\u201d and \u201cMove Your Stuff, Change Your Life\u201d and \u201cHow to Be Idle\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Serenity.\u201d We threw away expired gum and some Chinese healing herbs whose purpose Ning could no longer remember.I went abroad for a year to Israel after high school. While I was there, the boiler in my house in Brooklyn exploded and a soot fire destroyed all our possessions. \u201cEveryone is O.K., but there was a fire,\u201d my father said when I called. What happened after I got off the phone still confounds me: I returned to my dorm room, and when my roommate asked me how things were at home, I told her they were fine, and we went to sleep. In the middle of the night, I woke my roommate up, telling her that my house burned down. She told me it was a dream, and I kept telling her I had just forgotten to tell her. She didn\u2019t believe me for days.I never saw my sticker album again. I never saw anything again. After the place was cleared out, my mother was able to save a few photo albums, because they were closed when the soot invaded the basement and covered and ruined all the surfaces. When I look at the pictures, I don\u2019t ever notice how young or cute my sisters and I were. I look in the background for the items that lie in the incidental path of my mother\u2019s Canon. I try to remember what they smelled like or why we owned them or where we put them. I try to think of what my life would have been like if I\u2019d returned home to what I left behind, the way my friends were able to return to their homes to what they\u2019d left behind and keep returning, after they finished college and after they got married and after they had kids. I try to think of who I\u2019d be if I weren\u2019t in the habit of looking at my home before I left it each day and mentally preparing myself for the possibility that nothing I owned would be there when I got home that night. I try to know what feelings my lost objects, which I forget more and more as the years pass, would evoke if I could hold them in my hands, KonMari style, like a new kitten. Some would bring joy and some would not, but I\u2019m not someone who thinks that joy is the only valid emotion. I try to remember what I no longer can because, in terms of my possessions, it is as if I was born on my 19th birthday.The reason I bring this up is to tell you that you could not have any stuff at all, much less too much stuff, and still be totally messed up about it. The reason I tell you this is so that you know that that tiny butterfly sticker has been the same burden to me as any hoarder\u2019s yield. Nostalgia is a beast, and that is either a good reason to KonMari your life, or a terrible one, depending on how you want to live.I think the NAPO women have Kondo wrong. She is not one of them, intent on competing for their market share. She is not part of a breed of alpha-organizer \u201csolopreneurs\u201d bent on dominating the world, despite her hashtag. She has more in common with her clients. But when it comes to stuff, we are all the same. Once we\u2019ve divided all the drawers and eliminated that which does not bring us joy and categorized ourselves within an inch of our lives, we\u2019ll find that the person lying beneath all the stuff was still just plain old us. We are all a mess, even when we\u2019re done tidying. At least Kondo knows it. \u201cI was always more comfortable talking to objects than people,\u201d she told me. At that moment, I could tell that if she had her way, I would leave the hotel room and she would spray her spray and be left alone, so she could ask the empty room if she could clean it.An article on July 10 about Marie Kondo, an organizing consultant and writer, misstated the given name of the author of the book \u201cWomen With Attention Deficit Disorder.\u201d She is Sari Solden, not Siri.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine. She last wrote about the adventure photographer Jimmy Chin and the safety liaison Jamison Walsh\u2019s climb up the spire at 1 World Trade Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intent on a Reckoning With Georgetown\u2019s Slavery-Stained Past", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byMr. DeGioia oversees one of the nation\u2019s elite universities, managing more than 17,500 degree-seeking students; campuses in Washington and Doha, Qatar; and an endowment of about $1.5 billion. But on this scorching summer day, his mission was to help Georgetown begin the uneasy process of reckoning with its past.\u201cI think all of us need to get it right this time,\u201d Mr. DeGioia said as he stood beside Maxine Crump, whose great-great-grandfather was sold in 1838 along with 271 other enslaved African-Americans.The new initiatives have been greeted with both cheers and consternation. Some applaud efforts to bring a largely untold history to light. Others argue that the focus on the past exacerbates racial tensions on campuses and distracts from more pressing matters.\u201cWhat\u2019s difficult about it is that we want this discussion to be one that ultimately unifies and doesn\u2019t divide,\u201d Dr. Faust said of the conundrum facing many of her peers.At Georgetown, founded by Jesuit priests in 1789, Mr. DeGioia contends that his university will not overcome its past without addressing and making amends for its role in slavery, which he often describes as the nation\u2019s \u201coriginal evil.\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s a very moral man and I think he sees a moral obligation in this,\u201d Maurice Jackson, a historian at the university and a member of the working group on slavery, said of Mr. DeGioia, who is a practicing Catholic. \u201cHe wanted us to get together, to effect change and to use the past to make the present better.\u201dBut some alumni have voiced concern that by focusing on the wrongs of the 19th century, Mr. DeGioia is unnecessarily besmirching the reputation of a venerable institution. His decision to support student protesters and the members of his working group who called for renaming two buildings on campus raised eyebrows among some graduates.Even some members of his executive board, which supports Mr. DeGioia\u2019s efforts to address Georgetown\u2019s history, raised questions at first. The buildings had carried the names of the two Georgetown presidents who organized the slave sale in 1838.\u201cPeople have had questions: Where are we going with this? Are we going to be changing the names of every building?\u201d said Paul Tagliabue, the former commissioner of the National Football League and the vice chairman of the university\u2019s board.Mr. Tagliabue, who described Mr. DeGioia as a leader who prides himself on building consensus, said the college president answered the questions. \u201cEveryone gets it,\u201d he said, referring to fellow board members.Mr. DeGioia, who at age 59 is Georgetown\u2019s longest-serving president, said he knew there were lingering doubts among some alumni. \u201c\u2018Why is there a need to resurface the pain and the agony of this part of our history?\u2019\u201d he said, recalling their concerns. \u201c\u2018Haven\u2019t we moved beyond this?\u2019\u201dBut he said that the nation\u2019s racial divisions, highlighted by the string of killings of black men by the police and persistent racial disparities, suggested that Americans have yet to come to terms with their roots in legalized discrimination and slavery.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can say we\u2019ve sufficiently moved beyond it,\u201d said Mr. DeGioia, who became the university\u2019s first lay president in 2001.Georgetown relied on enslaved labor for decades. The Jesuit priests, who owned the slaves and ran the college, used their plantations in Maryland to help finance operations. And the institution\u2019s portion of the slave sale\u2019s profits \u2014 about $500,000 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 helped pay off Georgetown\u2019s debts.Last month, dozens of those descendants gathered to meet with Mr. DeGioia. Some brought older relatives and photographs of grandparents and great-grandparents. Ms. Crump and her siblings invited him to their family home here, where he fielded questions over cold lemonade and spicy jambalaya.\u201cIt means so much to me to have this door opened to my past,\u201d Ms. Crump said.Most people welcomed him warmly, but there were also flashes of anger, Mr. DeGioia said, and some skepticism. Sandra Green Thomas, who met with Mr. DeGioia in New Orleans, noted that he was short on specifics about how \u2014 or whether \u2014 he would make tangible amends to descendants by offering them scholarships or financing other educational opportunities.\u201cIs this a way to pat us on the head and send us on our way?\u201d she wondered. \u201cOr is this a way to do something really meaningful?\u201dJessica Tilson wanted something more. She asked Mr. DeGioia to issue a declaration of posthumous manumission, granting the slaves their freedom. Then she handed him several jars of soil.She has been haunted in recent weeks by the knowledge that her great-great-great-great-grandparents died without returning to their birthplace in Maryland. So she dug up soil from the old plantation here \u2014 symbols of her enslaved forbears \u2014 and asked him to help her ancestors get back home.Before he boarded his flight back to Washington, Mr. DeGioia shipped the jars to Georgetown.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Timing May Be Right for Investors to Seek Protection", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byStocks have shown no clear trend in more than a year; valuations are high and corporate earnings have been weak.The market at last reached new highs this month. It may well continue to rally, but it will have to do so against a backdrop of weak corporate earnings, a less accommodating Federal Reserve and lingering uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s vote in late June to leave the European Union.The combination of difficult fundamental conditions and a stock market that has had such trouble getting over the hump could make this a good time for owners of equity portfolios to start playing defense. The most obvious way to do that is to sell stocks and hold more cash and other assets, but there are alternative strategies that can keep investors in the game. An important consideration in determining which, if any, defensive approach to use is whether an investor is focused on the short or long run.\u201cTime horizon is key in terms of how much anyone will care about this,\u201d said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar, the investment research firm. \u201cIf you\u2019re investing long term, you don\u2019t get too worked up about it, but for people in or near retirement, it does seem reasonable to protect against the downside.\u201dAssuming you want to buy actively managed mutual funds, her preferred tactic is \u201cbuying a fund that has played good defense in the past,\u201d she said. Managers of funds that fit the bill tend to have an especially keen eye on value and will build a big stockpile of cash if they are unable to find enough stocks at reasonable prices. Examples that Ms. Benz offered included the F.P.A. Crescent and the AMG Yacktman Service funds.Mark Balasa, chief investment officer of the financial advisement firm Balasa Dinverno & Foltz, also considers an investor\u2019s time horizon important when it comes to protecting a stock portfolio against a decline. But in a way his strategy is almost the reverse of what Ms. Benz has in mind.If the aim is more tactical, to guard against an imminent decline, \u201cthat involves some form of timing the market, which is very difficult to do,\u201d Mr. Balasa warned. But he is happy to hold funds with solid defensive characteristics for the long term, no matter the market environment.\u201cPart of our screening process is to look at performance in up and down markets,\u201d Mr. Balasa said.He advised against placing too much emphasis on defense, however. \u201cIf the downside capture is good,\u201d he said, using a term for resilience in falling markets, \u201cthen the upside is capped. As a long-term hold, that\u2019s a challenge.\u201dInstead of looking solely for funds that hold up particularly well in downturns, Mr. Balasa seeks out those whose managers concentrate on high-quality stocks. This group would also largely figure in the first type of fund, although the overlap isn\u2019t perfect. High-quality stock include those of companies with consistent earnings histories or feature strong dividend growth, or both.\u201cWe do that all day long, not just because we think the market is going to be all that volatile, but because long-term exposure makes perfect sense,\u201d Mr. Balasa said.BlackRock\u2019s iShares and Vanguard have exchange-traded funds that tweak benchmark stock indexes to put extra weight on high-quality companies, he noted, and asset management firms such as AQR and Dimensional Fund Advisors have mutual funds with similar approaches.Laurie Kamhi, managing director of LCK Wealth Management, considers funds that have demonstrated an \u201cability to find undervalued stocks for the long haul\u201d \u2014 for instance by focusing on companies that have healthy dividend yields or a history of increasing their payouts \u2014 to be resilient in downturns. Some funds that she mentioned were T. Rowe Price Equity Income, Vanguard Dividend Growth, the Oakmark Fund and the Oakmark Equity and Income Fund.Ms. Benz also liked Vanguard Dividend Growth and American Century Equity, another fund that emphasizes yield and quality.For investors who do want to make a tactical defensive play, Mr. Balasa suggested all-weather funds whose managers have the freedom to own defensive assets and take other steps to guard against declining stock prices, such as Pimco All Asset All Authority, G.M.O. Global Asset Allocation and BlackRock Global Allocation. But Mr. Balasa cautioned that the managers of those funds might not be inclined to take a defensive posture when their shareholders would like them to.Another way to play defense is to shift a portion of a portfolio into exchange-trade funds that specialize in sectors like health care and consumer staples that are coveted for their ability to outperform the market on the way down. A related tactic is to buy an exchange-traded fund that owns low-beta stocks, or those that are less sensitive than average to market movements.But sensible investment ideas often seem less so when more people have them, and that could apply to these types of funds right now. Ross Levin, founding principal of the advisory firm Accredited Investors, said that strong interest in low-beta stocks has elevated their price-earnings ratios to unacceptable levels.\u201cIf you look at multiples of the stocks that those funds tend to own, it\u2019s questionable whether they will be as defensive as people who buy them think,\u201d he said. \u201cThat safe sector is no longer safe as we understand it.\u201dThe same goes for other segments of the market that are ordinarily defensive, Ms. Benz said.\u201cIt looks like the high-quality patch is a little bit picked over, and staples look expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat idea has been out there for a while. Investors gravitating to this strategy may be a little bit late.\u201dAs an opponent of market timing, Mr. Balasa worried about investors being a bit late or early in whatever tactical moves they made. But he acknowledged that a sober decision to become more defensive now could be wise to prevent becoming more defensive in a moment of panic later on.\u201cLong term you\u2019re better off being invested,\u201d he said, but exercising more caution with a stock portfolio \u201ccan help on the behavioral-finance side. To tell someone to hang in there and stay the course wears thin very quickly\u201d in a bear market. Having a more defensive posture all along, he added, \u201carguably doesn\u2019t change clients\u2019 risk profile all that much, but it allows them to stay the course and not harm themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Choosing Mike Pence, Donald Trump Moves Closer to Big Donors Like the Kochs", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byFrom his days as a dissident Republican congressman challenging President George W. Bush to his battles against his own party while governor of Indiana, Mike Pence has often relied on strong support from powerful allies: the conservative philanthropists David H. and Charles G. Koch and the vast political network they oversee.When Republican leaders in the state legislature balked at Mr. Pence\u2019s plan to turn a $2 billion budget surplus into a huge tax cut, the Indiana chapter of Americans for Prosperity, the primary political group backed by the Kochs, staged town hall meetings in the districts of vulnerable lawmakers, convened raucous rallies outside the Capitol and ran hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ads against Republicans. The resulting deal was Mr. Pence\u2019s first major victory as governor.\u201cAmericans for Prosperity made a difference in the Hoosier State,\u201d Mr. Pence told an audience at the group\u2019s national conference in 2014, calling it \u201cthe finest grass-roots organization in the United States of America.\u201dBut now those ties will be tested. In selecting Mr. Pence as his running mate, Donald J. Trump is not only tapping someone who differs with him on policy and in tone. He has also picked a partner with deep ties to some of the party\u2019s most powerful donors, who have spent years \u2014 and hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 trying to steer Republicans away from Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of populism.Mr. Trump has promised to protect Social Security and erect trade walls with China and Mexico, while he inveighed against the donor class that backed his rivals for the Republican nomination. Groups supported by the Kochs and organizations like the Club for Growth have invested heavily in rolling back regulations, reducing taxes and promoting a libertarian-tinged conservatism among Republicans, an agenda Mr. Trump has come to back only piecemeal, and only recently.A spokesman for Freedom Partners, James Davis, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of running mate was unlikely to change that decision.\u201cOur efforts will remain focused on the Senate,\u201d Mr. Davis said.But for Mr. Trump, who has only recently begun to build a modern presidential fund-raising apparatus, the choice of Mr. Pence could yet yield financial dividends. Mr. Pence has his own relationships to donors aligned with the Kochs, along with many other big givers who have until now been reluctant to get behind Mr. Trump or contribute to pro-Trump groups.David M. McIntosh, a longtime friend of Mr. Pence \u2014 and also a former Indiana congressman who is now the president of the Club for Growth \u2014 said his group was not planning to get involved in the presidential race. But he predicted that Mr. Pence\u2019s presence on the ticket would prompt some club donors to give or raise money for Mr. Trump.\u201cThere will be some who say, \u2018I will give to Mike Pence and help the ticket because of him,\u2019\u201d Mr. McIntosh said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see others who will say, \u2018I am still not going to support that financially, but will contribute in other ways.\u2019\u201dIn Indiana, where state law puts no limits on the amount of money individuals can give to candidates for governor, Mr. Pence has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy businessmen like Frederick S. Klipsch, the retired founder of an Indiana-based loudspeaker company, and John Childs, the Florida-based leveraged-buyout investor. Both are involved in Freedom Partners, and Mr. Childs is a major donor to the Club for Growth.In an interview, Mr. Klipsch said he had enormous respect for Mr. Pence, particularly the governor\u2019s education initiatives, such as expanding charter schools in Indiana.\u201cHe has done an outstanding job,\u201d Mr. Klipsch said.Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who Donald J. Trump announced as his running mate on Friday,<strong> </strong>has a relatively low approval rating among governors.\u201cGovernor Pence rose in leadership in the House while taking hard votes,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cHe voted against the bailout, he voted against TARP, he voted against Medicare expansion. Most guys with aspirations to move up didn\u2019t take those principled votes.\u201dMr. Pence has attended the Koch network\u2019s invitation-only seminar series, where conservative rising stars mix with some of the wealthiest donors in the country.Matt Schlapp, a longtime Republican consultant and former Koch Industries official who now leads the American Conservative Union, said Mr. Pence had the credentials to reassure a range of conservative activists and donors. Mr. Schlapp described Mr. Pence\u2019s potential selection as a \u201ctonic\u201d to worries about Mr. Trump\u2019s intellectual commitment to conservative ideas.\u201cHe\u2019s a well-known conservative political leader who has worked in Congress and Indiana,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said.\u201cI think donors will see this as an indication of the type of decisions Donald Trump is going to make about who he is going to surround himself with.\u201dWhether Mr. Pence\u2019s credibility translates into donations to Mr. Trump will not be clear for weeks.Mr. Klipsch, who has given more than $190,000 to Mr. Pence in recent years, said he had not decided whether to support a Trump-Pence ticket.\u201cThat\u2019s a whole other personal question,\u201d Mr. Klipsch said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass on that one.\u201dAn earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Mark Holden, the general counsel of Koch Industries, as the sixth-largest all-time donor to Indiana governor Mike Pence. The donor, Mark R. Holden, is a different individual.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bank Too Big to Jail", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byFair GameHave you ever wondered why the crippling 2008 financial crisis generated almost no criminal prosecutions of large banks and their top executives?HSBC and its American subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, agreed to pay almost $2 billion under the settlement, striking a deferred prosecution arrangement that remains in place. Under such deals, the government agrees to delay or forgo prosecution of a company if it promises to change its behavior.In spite of the settlement\u2019s size, it did not represent a body blow to the bank. Announced in late 2012, the HSBC agreement was almost a footnote to the earlier fallout from the mortgage crisis. Still, the facts outlined by prosecutors were damning enough to raise questions about why the bank had not been subject to harsher treatment, fueling the view that large financial institutions are not only too big to be allowed to fail but also are too significant to be prosecuted criminally.The report on HSBC was not adopted by the full House committee, but neither did it generate a dissent from others on the committee. It was released, the staff said, \u201cto shed light on whether D.O.J. is making prosecutorial decisions based on the size of financial institutions and D.O.J.\u2019s belief that such prosecutions could negatively impact the economy.\u201dThere doesn\u2019t seem to be much doubt about that. Indeed, the report concluded that the Justice Department\u2019s leadership overruled an internal recommendation to prosecute HSBC, citing concerns \u201cthat prosecuting the bank \u2018could result in a global financial disaster.\u2019\u201dThis will surprise few Americans who learned during the financial crisis that banks and their officials are rarely held to account.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said it was \u201ccommitted to aggressively investigating allegations of wrongdoing at financial institutions, and, along with our law enforcement partners, holding individuals and corporations responsible for their conduct.\u201d Since 2014, he said, It has prosecuted numerous individuals for corporate misconduct, including top executives.Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, did not return a phone call seeking comment about the report.Quoting from internal Treasury records, the report said that once the Justice Department decided not to prosecute HSBC, its officials began softening the deal offered to the bank. One change involved releasing the bank\u2019s employees, officers and directors from potential prosecution.The original agreement provided no protection from prosecution for employees who \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d processed financial transactions with countries under American sanctions, the report said.But the final deferred prosecution agreement gave a conditional release from liability for transactions disclosed to investigators during the period covered by the settlement.Citing internal documents that the United States Treasury took three years to produce, the report looks at the Department of Justice\u2019s 2012 settlement with HSBC.Another modification involved penalties to be exacted from executives if HSBC failed to live up to compliance requirements.While initial terms called for voiding the entire year\u2019s bonus compensation at the bank if it did not meet compliance hurdles, the final deferred prosecution agreement said only that a failure could potentially void the bonuses. This revision, the report said, \u201capparently leaves open the possibility for executives to get their bonuses, despite failing to meet compliance standards.\u201dAnother disturbing element turned up by the House committee: The settlement terms were given to HSBC before officials in the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or O.F.A.C., had assessed the full extent of the bank\u2019s sanctions violations.The Justice Department called for HSBC to pay $375 million to settle the sanctions violations. But officials in charge of analyzing those violations were still awaiting additional information from the bank when this figure was submitted. Therefore, they could not be sure the amount was adequate.\u201cNo matter that our sanctions numbers might come in higher than that,\u201d an official at the Treasury office wrote in an email to colleagues. \u201cWe weren\u2019t consulted. We were told.\u201dAs a result, the report said, officials of the Office of Foreign Assets Control \u201cdecided to hastily resolve internal concerns about the extent of HSBC\u2019s sanctions violations and \u2018frame\u2019 O.F.A.C.\u2019s final settlement number to mirror the $375 million \u2018deemed settled\u2019 value proposed\u201d by the Justice Department.\u201cIt would seem that in making the decision with respect to HSBC, Holder gave more attention to the concerns expressed by the F.S.A. than he did with respect to our own agencies,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said in an interview. \u201cAnd think about it: Congress spent three years trying to uncover this information that F.S.A. was getting at the time the events were unfolding.\u201dThat it took the House committee so long to receive the information from the Treasury Department once again raises questions about transparency in government, something the Obama administration has called a top priority.\u201cTreasury improperly impeded the committee\u2019s investigation\u201d for nearly three years before producing certain subpoenaed records, the report said. The department\u2019s production of records \u201cis missing dozens, if not hundreds, of pages,\u201d the report said.Joshua Drobnyk, a Treasury spokesman, disputed this characterization, saying the department had cooperated extensively with Congress. \u201cTreasury made hundreds of pages of documents available to the committee more than two years ago, in April 2014, and committee staff reviewed the materials five separate times,\u201d Mr. Drobnyk said in a statement.But Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee, doesn\u2019t buy it. \u201cIf an incomplete response to the committee after three years and the threat of deposition subpoenas isn\u2019t stonewalling, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAfter these revelations, if the Obama administration refuses to be transparent, produce the documents that it is withholding and address the urgent questions that this report has raised, the American people need to ask why.\u201dThe report should be viewed as \u201cevidence of an abuse of the regulatory system,\u201d Mr. Kane added. \u201cAnd unless proven otherwise, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Britain Could Look to Norway as a Model", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byHOKKSUND, Norway \u2014 Sigurd Braathen worked for a lifetime to build his family\u2019s industrial company into a profitable venture with sales across Europe. Then an environmental diktat from Brussels threatened to outlaw half of his company\u2019s energy-efficient water heaters, even in his home country of Norway.To make his products compliant, Mr. Braathen had to revamp his factory at a cost of 5 million euros.\u201cThe worst part was, Norway had no influence over the matter, because we aren\u2019t a member of the E.U.,\u201d said Mr. Braathen. \u201cBut Norway still must do whatever Brussels decrees.\u201dA similarly conflicted future appears to await Britain.Theresa May, who became Britain\u2019s new prime minister on Wednesday, has said she wants to get the best deal possible to safeguard the country\u2019s industrial base and its services industry. If they falter, the country\u2019s economy risks falling off a cliff.\u201cBritain will probably do a Norway-lite, where it will have to cede some market access in return for the right to place some controls on free movement,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. \u201cBut once the costs become apparent, there will be more of a debate in the U.K. about whether it\u2019s enough, and the politics will get really toxic.\u201dIn some ways, Norway can relate to \u201cBrexit,\u201d as the British exit is known. This verdant Scandinavian country, population five million, voted twice to stay outside the European Union in heated referendums that also turned on issues of sovereignty.Britain has other options, but they are hardly more palatable. It could negotiate trade deals with 27 remaining member nations, as Switzerland did. But that would be a lengthy mess. Or it could follow Canada\u2019s approach, striking deals for trading goods but limiting services, which could hit Britain\u2019s vaunted financial industry.Or the European Union might decline to strike any deal, creating uncertainty in Britain and around the world. In a meeting this week between the United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, Mr. Lew urged that both sides demonstrate \u201cflexibility\u201d in their discussions. \u201cA highly integrated relationship between the E.U. and the U.K. is in the best interests of Europe, the United States and global economic growth, stability and security,\u201d he said.The easiest thing, analysts say, is to just join the European Economic Area like Norway.That arrangement gives Norway sovereignty over two crucial industries that were the focus of Brexit campaigners. The country is free to pursue protectionist policies for its farmers and fishermen, for instance by slapping import tariffs of more than 270 percent on cheese from Europe.But it would not let Britain coddle one of its biggest industries \u2014 finance.As a European Union member, Britain has been able to foil attempts by France and Germany to curb or siphon business by vetoing certain measures, like a proposal to impose a single tax on the region\u2019s financial sector. London also won a victory at the European general court against a European Central Bank rule that would have moved trading of securities priced in euros to countries that use the currency. It would have meant a huge loss of business for the banks that have turned the City, the center of finance in London, into Europe\u2019s financial capital.Outside of the European Union, Britain would be left to do what Norway does: lobby hard behind the scenes and hope that its voice is heard in Brussels.\u201cIt goes without saying that exerting influence in a cooperation such as the E.U., where we are not a member, is challenging,\u201d said Elsbeth Sande Tronstad, Norway\u2019s deputy minister of European Economic Area and European Union affairs.Britain, as Europe\u2019s second-largest economy and a political powerhouse, would probably still have much more sway than tiny Norway. But the risks are there.From his perch in Hokksund, a bucolic industrial town nestled among emerald forests and dark fjords west of Oslo, Mr. Braathen has seen the consequences. Founded by his grandfather in 1932, his company benefited greatly from being able to sell products throughout Europe with little interference.Mr. Braathen reckoned he would have to invest millions in a new plant to meet the standards. If he did not, he would be barred from selling his products even in Norway, because European Union rules apply to his own country even though it is not a member.\u201cBut that was pure luck,\u201d said Mr. Braathen, who still had to refurbish many of his machines to meet other aspects of the directive. \u201cAnd if it hadn\u2019t happened, there was nothing we could have done,\u201d he said.Mr. Braathen swept his eyes over a lane of fir trees lining the entry to the factory. What had happened in his small world now seemed likely to reverberate on a larger scale in Britain \u2014 and with more dire consequences.\u201cI\u2019m sure Britain will have more weight in Brussels than Norway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any way you cut it, they will have a lot less voice on the issues that affect them than they do now.\u201d\u201cThey voted to take their country back,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you can\u2019t take something back without giving something up.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Britain. It is Europe\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany; it is not the largest.Advertisement"}

Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on Wednesday that he had raised $26 million for his campaign in June, a substantial improvement from his paltry May total but one that still leaves him far behind his rival, Hillary Clinton.The donations came from 400,000 supporters, including a $3.8 million contribution made by Mr. Trump to his own campaign. The candidate also raised $25 million for Trump Victory, a joint venture with the Republican National Committee that is being used to help elect Republicans across the country, putting his overall haul for the month at $51 million.Mr. Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire, has so far contributed $55 million to his campaign, and he has said that he will not seek to be reimbursed for those funds.Mr. Trump stepped up his fund-raising efforts last month after raising just $1.3 million in May. Mrs. Clinton raised $40 million for her campaign in June and another $28 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.\u201cWe just started our fund-raising efforts in the last week of May and we are extremely pleased with the broad-based support in the last five weeks for the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the campaign\u2019s finance chairman, said in a statement.The Trump campaign did not reveal how much cash it has on hand, and its announcement did not make clear how some of the funds would be disbursed to various committees.While Mr. Trump has demonstrated an ability to raise money from his legion of supporters, he continues to struggle to keep pace with the previous general election cycle. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, raised $100 million for his campaign and the party in June of that year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trusted Grown-Ups Who Steal Millions From Youth Sports", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Prosecutors in several states say embezzlement investigations involving youth sports have become common.Supported byWHITEHALL TOWNSHIP, Pa. \u2014 With downcast eyes and a microphone clenched in one fist, Brian Farley stood uneasily before nearly 400 children from the Tri-Boro Youth Soccer Club in eastern Pennsylvania.He had stolen their money.Mr. Farley, 55, the longtime treasurer of the all-volunteer, nonprofit club, had pocketed $120,000 from the organization\u2019s bank accounts \u2014 money paid by parents so that their children could play.A county court judge had ordered Mr. Farley to repent publicly to club members as part of his guilty plea, and so there he stood, in front of a throng of children sitting cross-legged on a grassy ball field waiting to play. The club\u2019s leaders were so fearful that an irate parent might charge or assault Mr. Farley that they hired security to maintain order.The youth sports boom in the United States, fortified by at least 30 million participants, has turned what were once homespun local leagues into quasi-professional enterprises with annual budgets that experts who track nonprofits say regularly reach $250,000 \u2014 if not twice that.Yet with the growth and development has come a long list of embezzlement and other corruption cases unfolding in a void of oversight and regulation and capitalizing on community trust.Across the country, people who volunteered as treasurers and other officers for Little Leagues and sports clubs have been prosecuted for pilfering gobs of money from the coffers: $220,000 in Washington, $431,000 in Minnesota, $560,000 in New Jersey, and so on, according to law enforcement authorities, league officials, experts on nonprofit organizations and news reports.The approximately 14,000 youth sports organizations in the United States take in annual revenue of about $9 billion, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics. Oversight of those sums is haphazard and not centralized, as there is no national agency in the country watching over youth sports.Investigators and prosecutors in several states say embezzlement investigations involving youth sports have become common, almost always committed by unpaid board members who are highly regarded in their communities.It is difficult to say whether the problem with embezzlement has worsened or if the growth of the leagues simply means more cases; there is no clearinghouse comprehensively tracking fraud in youth sports.But investigators say the problem gets little public discussion even as, by some measures, there are signs of mounting cases. In the last five years, there have been hundreds of arrests and convictions in 43 states involving 15 sports, based on a study of news accounts and a database compiled by the Center for Fraud Prevention, an organization that aims to mitigate embezzlement in youth sports.And those are only the cases that have become public.Law enforcement officials estimate that they see only about half of the actual fraud in youth sports because organizations often cover up smaller misappropriations to protect their reputations and preserve the ability to raise money in the future.Some leagues have dissolved as a result. Most organizations survive, but they often must defer buying new uniforms; fixing up insufficient or dangerous fields; purchasing equipment; and financing capital projects.Over all, the rate of fraud across the youth sports landscape, which includes thousands of prosperous travel teams, is probably small in scale given the vast scope of youth sports. In general, there is little data of any kind on how extensive embezzlement is among all nonprofit groups, let alone youth sports associations.Yet watchdogs of the nonprofit industry note that youth sports organizations rarely put in place routine checks and balances, such as having multiple people in charge of the money, opening the door to fraud.\u201cPeople treat youth sports groups as social clubs and vest all their trust in one individual because they all know each other, but these organizations need to be treated like businesses with all the same internal and external financial controls,\u201d said James Martin, the Lehigh County district attorney, whose office prosecuted Mr. Farley\u2019s case. \u201cYes, everyone starts out with the best intentions, but then something usually goes wrong and no one is really watching.\u201dA husband and wife were implicated in Michigan after a neighbor, an accountant whose sons played for the baseball league, joined the board and scrutinized the books, leading investigators to a case that uncovered $300,000 in missing money.A woman in Vermont was convicted of stealing from a fund established to honor a dead child who had been a club member.The exposure of embezzlement leaves communities thunderstruck and wounded at the revelation of neighbors stealing from neighbors, friends cheating friends. The children of the accused are often best friends with the children of the accusers.\u201cI couldn\u2019t comprehend having to tell the 700 kids in our entire membership that the money was gone and they couldn\u2019t play soccer anymore because their treasurer was a thief,\u201d Diane Miller, the Tri-Boro Youth Soccer Club\u2019s current treasurer, said last month, recalling Mr. Farley\u2019s arrest in 2013.\u201cI wanted to cry.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of cash involved in these organizations, and whenever there\u2019s cash, there\u2019s people eyeing the cash,\u201d said Tim Delaney, president and chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits.Erik Carrozza, the founder of the Center for Fraud Prevention, said: \u201cSomeone can easily skim 20 percent off the top and it will not be noticed for a while. Twenty percent for five years ends up being a lot of money.\u201dThat money gets spent in a variety of ways.The police have reported that purloined money has gone to dog grooming, tickets to Walt Disney World, illicit drugs, a child\u2019s wedding, fishing trips, financial advice, N.F.L. and Major League Baseball tickets, lingerie, large deliveries of yard mulch, college loans and the interest on personal property being held in pawn shops.Gambling debt has played a role in many cases.Kevin Short, a lawyer who represented a hockey league official in Minnesota convicted of tax evasion after stealing more than $400,000 from a league, said casino debt in fraud cases is so common now that investigators routinely check gambling habits when embezzlement is suspected.\u201cIt\u2019s a standard question,\u201d Mr. Short said. \u201cSince gambling came into Minnesota, we\u2019ve been having problems and embezzlement.\u201dProsecutors and defense lawyers say that many others who have embezzled from youth sports organizations have done so because they were enduring a period of financial distress because of a divorce, a job loss or both.From a work-release facility where he is confined after serving several months in jail, Kevin L. Baker said he stole more than $200,000 from the Kent Little League in Washington State because he was trying to survive financially.\u201cI\u2019m usually a trustworthy, honest person,\u201d Mr. Baker, who was the league\u2019s treasurer for seven years, said in a telephone interview last month. \u201cI got in a bad situation, and when you\u2019re in a bad situation, you make decisions that you wouldn\u2019t normally make.\u201dSince 2007, Mr. Baker, who coached his two sons in the league, had been a responsible volunteer at the league\u2019s many activities.But in 2011, he lost his job, and his wife moved to Idaho with the couple\u2019s sons as part of a divorce. A grandfather who had helped raise Mr. Baker and had been a father figure also died around the same time.To raise his spirits and to try something new \u2014 his grandparents had run a tavern \u2014 Mr. Baker decided to spend $100,000 to buy a bar. The business started strong, then flagged precipitously.Mindy Young, who prosecuted the case, said Mr. Baker had taken money from the Kent Little League in 271 transactions that included cashier\u2019s checks for as much as $20,000. He knew that no one truly scrutinized the treasurer\u2019s books he had been doctoring.But on Dec. 9, 2014, Kent\u2019s Little League president, Greg Whitcomb, went to an Office Depot and tried to use the league\u2019s A.T.M. card to buy $18 worth of envelopes. The purchase was denied.Based on the financial reports he had been receiving from Mr. Baker, Mr. Whitcomb believed the league had $227,000 in bank and investment accounts. For a decade, the league had been soliciting donations and were finally on the verge of buying their own baseball and softball fields.The Kent Little League was actually in debt, owing uniform manufacturers $20,000.\u201cWorse, all the hard work by volunteers raising money for years was lost,\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said.Mr. Baker turned himself into the Kent police.\u201cI felt so guilty; I couldn\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Mr. Baker, who has since been ordered to pay $208,000 in restitution.It often takes suspicious board members or officers to uncover the wrongdoing.In the case involving Pennsylvania\u2019s Tri-Boro Youth Soccer Club, Mr. Farley\u2019s crime was not uncovered until a new club president, Tino Babayan, hired a lawyer to advise the club about various matters, including its finances. The lawyer quickly became suspicious of Mr. Farley\u2019s bookkeeping, especially when the club\u2019s retainer check bounced.Mr. Babayan learned that 80 percent of the club\u2019s money was missing.\u201cFarley was basically paying off his bills and living as if the club\u2019s account were his own,\u201d said Steven Luksa, the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case.Mr. Farley declined to be interviewed last month, but his lawyer, George Heitczman, said that when his client lost his job working on Wall Street, he began making loans to himself from the club\u2019s account.\u201cHe felt he was just borrowing, but that is a slippery slope,\u201d Mr. Heitczman said. \u201cThere were some payments back to the league, but Brian got so far behind.\u201dMeanwhile, the club\u2019s board members, facing a host of unpaid bills, were suddenly desperate to keep Tri-Boro solvent.Mr. Farley offered the club and prosecutors a restitution deal; the organization\u2019s leaders and the club\u2019s parent group balked.Diane Miller, the new treasurer, had pored over the bank records and saw that the club\u2019s A.T.M. card had been used to pay for $500 hairdressing appointments, hotel stays, wine and cigars.\u201cAt that point, I wanted to find him,\u201d Ms. Miller said of Mr. Farley, \u201cand spit in his face.\u201dBut the club, which needed the infusion of cash, took the deal, which amounted to $55,000.Mr. Farley received five years of probation and was ordered to make gradual, systematic repayments to Tri-Boro for the remainder of what he owed the club. Mr. Farley, who has remained in the Allentown, Pa., area, has been paying back the money at about $225 a month and recently told another board member that he intended to pay back the roughly $60,000 he owes the club.Ms. Miller is skeptical. \u201cWe\u2019ll never see it all,\u201d she said.Board members were forced to dip into their own pockets for $200 or $300 each to pay some of the club\u2019s most urgent expenses and keep it afloat.This year, the club is thriving, with a growing membership roll.Coaches and other club members have adapted to new policies mandating invoices and receipts for any reimbursable expenses, regardless of how small the sum. Two board members are also required to extensively review the club\u2019s books monthly.\u201cWe can\u2019t let anything go unexamined,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Like the Tri-Boro Soccer Club, the Kent Little League in Washington had to run on a skeleton budget before it rebounded in part because several local sponsors donated time and money when they heard of Mr. Baker\u2019s theft. A software company that had been working on a new league website chose to finish and install the website for free, allowing valuable registration fees to flow into the league\u2019s bank accounts faster.Still, the Kent Little League misses the more than $200,000 it intended to spend on new fields, cash Mr. Whitcomb knows the league will probably never recoup.As Mr. Whitcomb retrieved the mail at home not long ago with his 15-year-old son, he saw an envelope from Mr. Baker.\u201cI smirked and handed it to my son and said, \u2018Here\u2019s the first restitution payment to your Little League,\u2019\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said.Inside the envelope were two checks for $14 and $11.There is another common thread to many fraud cases in youth sports: the scarcity of people running them, which significantly hampers the necessary oversight.Overscheduled, working parents are hesitant to commit the time to serve on boards. And no one wants to be an organization\u2019s treasurer, which is the most tedious, thankless job.\u201cPeople are always asking, \u2018Can I pay to get out of my time working in the concession stand?\u2019\u201d Mr. Whitcomb said.Many affluent organizations have turned to paying the officers of their boards of directors as an incentive to serve. Others are hiring bookkeepers. Crime or fraud insurance designed specifically to cover youth groups is gaining in popularity.There are groups that have tried to fill the void, like the National Alliance for Youth Sports, a Florida-based nonprofit and youth sports advocate that helps train coaches and administrators. Little League offers guidelines to community leagues and training and information for volunteers.Nonetheless, in recent years youth sports officials have found themselves forced into unforeseen roles: crime investigator, mediator and crisis management specialist.\u201cYou start out wanting to help kids and you end up doing things you never thought you\u2019d have to do,\u201d said Mr. Babayan, no longer the Tri-Boro Soccer Club president.When Mr. Farley concluded his 73-second apology to hundreds of young soccer players, Mr. Babayan, who had exposed Mr. Farley\u2019s embezzlement, was standing a few feet away. As Mr. Farley dropped one arm and uncomfortably raised his gaze to the crowd, Mr. Babayan diplomatically stepped forward to grasp the microphone from Mr. Farley\u2019s clenched fist.The children appeared confused. The parents were miffed. An awkward silence enveloped the grounds.\u201cNo one had ever seen anything like that before,\u201d Mr. Babayan said.Eventually, the players stood and separated into groups. It was time to play.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization that attempts to mitigate embezzlement in youth sports. It is the Center for Fraud Prevention, not the Center for Fraud Protection.Susan C. Beachy and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 4", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 To hear her daughter, to watch a video about her life and to listen to her own words, it was hard to believe that a significant majority of Americans hold a negative view of Hillary Clinton, finding her untrustworthy and dishonest. How could that be true of such a devoted mother, such an exuberant grandmother and such a champion of the underprivileged, with such a big, ready laugh? Do we know her at all? Have we gotten her entirely wrong?The party was making history with a female nominee, and it rightly and fully celebrated that, imagining a woman in the American presidency for the first time, after all this time. \u201cWhen any barrier falls in America,\u201d Clinton said in her speech, \u201cit clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201dBut this particular woman needed to be humanized, softened. In order to touch the sky, she had to reach out as never before. Her story had to be transformed from one of unquenchable ambition to one of boundless heart, and the urgency of the task was underscored by the attention to detail with which she and her campaign team went about it.That video, shown just before Clinton took the stage, was produced by Shonda Rhimes. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman. He concluded by telling Americans that \u201cthis is the woman.\u201dThen Clinton appeared, to music with these lyrics: \u201cThis is my fight song, take-back-my-life song.\u201dShe was taking back her life in order to claim her desired future.\u201cSometimes, the people at this podium are new to the national stage,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019m not one of those people.\u201d Then she gave a quick recitation of her resume.\u201cBut my job titles only tell you what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the \u2018service\u2019 part has always come easier to me than the \u2018public\u2019 part. I get it that some people just don\u2019t know what to make of me.\u201dIt was an extraordinary admission for someone who\u2019s been in the public eye for a quarter century. It was also a necessary one. And it spoke to one of the many oddities of this transcendently odd election. Perhaps the most familiar person ever to run for the White House must use the process to introduce herself \u2014 or, rather, re-re-reintroduce herself \u2014 to voters.In any other year, with any other matchup, that might be politically fatal. I don\u2019t think it will be for Clinton, and her speech, like much of the convention, showed why. The case against Donald Trump is a damning one, and she and other Democrats know how to make it, presenting him as someone who will threaten our national security and throw our most cherished values in the trash, someone of inadequate preparation and an undetectable soul.\u201cA man you can bait with a Tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d Clinton said at one point, to a roar from the crowd.\u201cFor the past year,\u201d she later added, \u201cmany people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn\u2019t possibly mean all the horrible things he says, like when he called women \u2018pigs.\u2019 Or said that an American judge couldn\u2019t be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.\u201d She gave additional examples from the seemingly endless list.Her speech wasn\u2019t a memorable one. It was too much of a laundry list, with too little shape and a delivery that was rushed and mechanical at times. But it was full of terrific lines, and the crowd went wild when she acknowledged the milestone of her nomination, saying: \u201cStanding here as my mother\u2019s daughter, and my daughter\u2019s mother, I\u2019m so happy this day has come. I\u2019m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.\u201dBut the yardstick for her wasn\u2019t really any of those more polished or accessible orators. Nor was it Trump, whose own big convention speech presented the peculiar vision of an even more peculiar candidate not readily comparable to anyone else.The yardstick for Clinton was Clinton herself \u2014 and her tendency to come across as programmed, guarded, remote. If many Americans look askance at her, it\u2019s not just because Republicans have so persistently encouraged them to. It\u2019s because she can seem so far away, on the opposite side of a moat that she dug herself and has little interest in letting people traverse.She got only part of the way there, but that distance was crucial and could well be enough. She shared tales \u2014 carefully selected, of course \u2014 about her grandfather, her father and her mother, who, she recounted, \u201cwas abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.\u201dMothers and daughters and children in general: Clinton and the people who talked about her kept coming back to that, and while the intent was obvious \u2014 to communicate that she wasn\u2019t all stiffness and steel \u2014 the tactic verged on overkill and was a discouraging confirmation of sexist double standards.A man doesn\u2019t have to prove first that he\u2019s been a model father to be allowed to ascend to the pinnacle of his career. But apparently a woman has to show that she hasn\u2019t shortchanged motherhood in order to get the green light.Her conduct as a mother is seen as a window into her character, and she can\u2019t possibly be a warm person unless she\u2019s been a warm parent. That was the context for much of Bill Clinton\u2019s tribute to Hillary and for almost all of Chelsea Clinton\u2019s.Chelsea introduced Hillary as a grandmother who will drop everything on her way to a speech or a debate and use FaceTime \u201cfor a few minutes of blowing kisses and reading \u2018Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo\u2019 with her granddaughter.\u201d She said that Hillary faithfully attended her soccer games and music recitals.\u201cThoughtful,\u201d she called her. \u201cHilarious.\u201dI\u2019ll be fascinated to see what kind of bounce Hillary gets in the polls. I predict that it will be a big one, not because Americans suddenly see her in a wholly new light but because the Democrats\u2019 gathering here was everything that the Republicans\u2019 in Cleveland was not: coherently choreographed, packed full of emotional highlights, packed even fuller with the party\u2019s most respected leaders, and consistent in its messaging about Trump, which was lethal.He looked toward the cameras and addressed Trump directly: \u201cLet me ask you, have you even read the United States constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy.\u201d He held it in its hand.That\u2019s the kind of question and gesture that should doom Trump and likely will. Warm or cold, accessible or aloof, Clinton is smart enough to take advantage of that.Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.On social media over the past two weeks, each party\u2019s convention generated impressive entries in what became a massively multiplayer game of digital \u201cdozens\u201d \u2014 a battle to insult, nickname, meme, gif and hashtag both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. On Twitter, one measure of the success of a convention speech was how quickly a succinct phrase from it appeared and proliferated. Throughout the Democratic National Convention, three-word slogans proved especially suitable for hashtags. Barack Obama reprised \u201cdon\u2019t boo, vote\u201d (for delegates who jeered mention of Mr. Trump), while Senator Tim Kaine landed on \u201cnot one word\u201d (for the number of believable words spoken by Mr. Trump). Mr. Kaine had another winner with \u201csi se puede,\u201d the Spanish twist on Mr. Obama\u2019s original \u201cYes, we can.\u201d @CharlesLandy cheered Mr. Kaine\u2019s hashtag prowess, tweeting that he was \u201cCRUSHING this\u201d by \u201cmaking trending hashtags with every sentence.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden nailed \u201cnot a clue\u201d (for Mr. Trump\u2019s understanding of the middle class), which, together with Mr. Kaine\u2019s #notoneword, made one-two punch attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s ignorance and mendacity. The Clinton campaign, of course, had seeded the hashtags #imwithher, #dealusin and #lovetrumpshate, and when Senator Al Franken and the actresses Lena Dunham and America Ferrera used the campaign slogans, Twitter dutifully echoed them. Last week, the Republican National Convention had a hit with #lockherup, a vigilante cry that sounded in the arena and then played brilliantly on Twitter, even during the Democratic National Convention\u2019s broadcast last night. A subplot emerged, however, when the concerted effort to get the hashtag to \u201ctrend\u201d led to conspiracy musings about how Twitter might have hidden its popularity. A tweeter called @Lion_PartyUSA asked why #lockherup wasn\u2019t trending, concluding, \u201cI hope WikiLeaks builds an alternative.\u201d A WikiLeaks Twitter? Interesting idea. When speakers and candidates work backward from Twitter\u2019s conventions and space constraints to build phrases aimed to trend as hashtags, it\u2019s clear that the medium is profoundly shaping the message. However, as Mrs. Clinton said last night in what might have been her best line, there\u2019s a time to jump off Twitter, especially when the stakes get high. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d she said, breaking free of hashtag character constraints. \u201cDon\u2019t tweet, vote,\u201d she might have added. Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of \u201cMagic and Loss: The Internet as Art.\u201dI asked a few Wellesley alumnae and current students how it has felt to see Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ascension in politics, and what this moment means. Here\u2019s what they had to say. Ms. Salomon lived with Mrs. Clinton for three years in college. \u201cI thought she was incredibly warm, amazingly smart, directed, caring about the people around her and her friends. She\u2019s one of the most loyal people I\u2019ve met,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me very sad that she comes across \u2014 apparently, to many people \u2014 as being cold, reserved, calculating. She\u2019s so warm and caring.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is one of the most exciting moments in my whole life.\u201d Ms. Hill was involved in student government at Wellesley with Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Hill said she had some \u201cadjustment problems\u201d when she entered Wellesley in 1965, as a black woman coming from a segregated upbringing in New Orleans. Mrs. Clinton was one of the first white people she\u2019d met, Ms. Hill said. She said she wanted to drop out of college after the first few days, but her mother and Mrs. Clinton both encouraged her to stay. Her son is now working for the Clinton campaign in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s sobering to know that a person I\u2019ve known 51 years and who\u2019s always been a friend and been supportive of me and my family and someone to look up to is going to become the president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m thrilled for her, but I\u2019m thrilled for the country.\u201d Ms. Ross-Dolen said she decided to run to be a delegate in Ohio\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, despite having no previous political experience. \u201cIt is a thrill to take part in the political process in order to propel Hillary to victory and make history,\u201d Ms. Ross-Dolen wrote over email. Ms. Sjogren, a rising junior, works for the Wellesley Students for Hillary group and said she was \u201cecstatic that Hillary will be president.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand exactly how big of a deal a major party nominating their first woman presidential candidate is. Unlike Hillary and unlike my grandmothers, I didn\u2019t grow up in a world that told me that I couldn\u2019t because I was a girl,\u201d she said. \u201cUnlike every American woman who never got to see last night, I never doubted the possibility of a female president.\u201d \nLauren Tamaki is live-illustrating the speech, with your input.\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 \u201cWe elect presidents in Iowa,\u201d said Ora McQueen. A 72-year-old Hillary Clinton delegate, Ms. McQueen noted that President Obama had carried Iowa twice. Mrs. Clinton barely eked out a win over Bernie Sanders there in January. \u201cThere\u2019s good buzz in Iowa for our girl,\u201d said Tara McNulty, a Clinton delegate, before the day\u2019s convention proceedings began. Still, she said, \u201csome people think she\u2019s too reserved.\u201d \u201cA lot of people feel like she\u2019s a robot,\u201d said Corey Jones, a 19-year-old Sanders delegate. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s human.\u201d One solution, he said, was to show more emotion: \u201cI think if she cried onstage, that would help a lot.\u201d Ms. McNulty thinks Mrs. Clinton needs to spend more face-to-face time with Iowa voters to counter the perception that she\u2019s unapproachable and to win the state in November. Ms. McQueen, too, wants Mrs. Clinton to spend more time in Iowa. In particular, she said, \u201cI want to see Hillary continue addressing the women.\u201d Working in the male-dominated field of corrections, Ms. McQueen has seen many men she trained advance to executive positions, so equal pay for women is a key issue for her. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength on wage equality helped Ms. McQueen make the decision to support her. Aside from appealing to voters with sound proposals, Mrs. Clinton also has to manage sometimes-conflicting expectations that her male opponents \u2014 first Mr. Sanders, now Donald Trump \u2014 haven\u2019t had to reckon with. As Mr. Jones put it, \u201cbeing a woman in politics, she has to be tough, she has to be emotionless.\u201d \u201cShe has to put on that barrier,\u201d he explained, but \u201cif she doesn\u2019t break that barrier, then we won\u2019t really know who she is.\u201d PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The historian Annette Gordon-Reed said recently that she thinks it was easier for a black man to win the presidency than it will be for a white woman. It was Ms. Gordon-Reed\u2019s research that erased any doubt that Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children of his slave Sally Hemings. Her magisterial book, \u201cThe Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2009 and made her the first African-American woman to win that prize. Of course, that was also the year Barack Obama became the first black president of the United States. Ms. Gordon-Reed believes it was easier for Mr. Obama to become the first black president than it will be for Hillary Clinton to become the first female one. She said that she didn\u2019t think when the book was published in 2008 \u201cthere was any doubt about who most black people were going to vote for. But the gender thing is different. You can never get women to vote as a monolith \u2014 this is a deep cultural thing. \u201cBlack men got the vote before women, which caused great dissension. Feminists supported abolition, but didn\u2019t get the vote.\u201d For female candidates, she said: \u201cIf you\u2019re too motherly that\u2019s a problem, if you\u2019re too young or sexual or pretty that\u2019s a problem. Getting there, persuading people to love you, to trust you \u2014 how does a woman do that across a wide swath of the nation?\u201d Political analysts once thought a black presidential candidate would face a comparable, complicated challenge: For example, some thought that the first black president had to be a Republican, like Colin Powell. But along came Barack Obama, whose win blew away those notions \u2014 and suggested that Americans were more ready to embrace a minority president than a female one. Now Mrs. Clinton is pitted against Donald Trump, a candidate who has a record of insulting women. Her candidacy, Ms. Gordon-Reed says, \u201cis a test of the character of the American people. She should not underestimate the power of the forces aligned with Trump. She should continue to run an inclusive campaign, tell people what she\u2019s for and focus on the positive things rather than trying to out-negative him.\u201d Convincing people to vote out of optimism, rather than fear, she said, was what John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were about, as was Bill Clinton in the 1990s. \u201cJefferson said you should not try to change people\u2019s beliefs about things, because it will harden them in their stance. You\u2019re better off sticking to your story, and maybe, in the fullness of time, people will be persuaded.\u201d The Trump campaign has famously been understaffed. Still, might there possibly be a senior \u2026 handler whose sole duty each night is to snatch the Republican nominee\u2019s cellphone at the sign of his Twitter fingers twitching? Someone to intervene before he goes digitally nuclear? Because he\u2019s been known to do that. Day 1, after the Bernie Sanders delegate mutiny was subdued, Trump tweeted a few fistfuls of salt to rub in the wounds. (\u201cSad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution \u2026 totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d) Mid-evening, he went all mean girl on Elizabeth Warren: \u201cPocahontas \u2026 spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated.\u201d Then silence, of an ominous sort. Could he possibly have been as mesmerized by Michelle Obama as the crowd inside the Wells Fargo Center? Almost an hour elapsed. Even when Mrs. Obama took dead aim, \u201cThe issues a president faces are not black and white, and cannot be boiled down into 140 characters\u201d \u2014 still nothing. I envisioned him sequestered in Trump Tower, handcuffed to the arms of his faux Louis XIV ormolu throne. (\u201cFor your own safety, Mr. Trump,\u201d the handler whispered.) The cuffs finally came off, but only for a final swipe at Bernie Sanders. He was done for the night. After a massage and cold-cream application, the handler gave him his silk sleeping gloves. It turned out Mr. Trump was actually in North Carolina, where the following day he told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention audience: \u201cWe will create a private White House hotline to field complaints about the Veterans Administration. This could keep me very busy at night, folks. This could take the place of Twitter.\u201d Though not, nota bene, \u201cso fast your head will spin.\u201d The key word was \u201ccould.\u201d That afternoon, Bernie Sanders, microphone in hand, said, \u201cI move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States.\u201d As the evening proceedings got underway, Mr. Trump struck a Twitter tone more petulant than savage. Unaware that Bill Clinton would be telling an ultimately not-so-shaggy-dog story about a \u201cgirl\u201d he once saw in a library, he pre-emptively reviewed it: \u201cNo matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated.\u201d Anything else? \u201cI hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!\u201d A minority opinion. For the rest of the day his hands were full with the fallout from his invitation to Vladimir Putin to join his cabinet. Which perhaps accounts for his failure to offer any specific critiques of President Obama\u2019s Night 3 valedictory/paean to Hillary Clinton. No matter, other Republicans stepped in. On MSNBC, Nicolle Wallace, a senior adviser to John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, said: \u201cPresident Obama made the case against Trumpism. He made the definitive case.\u201d Her fellow commentator Steve Schmidt, who was a senior adviser both for Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign and for George W. Bush in 2004, concurred. \u201cA master class in American character,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cHis attacks on Donald Trump from a character basis were shattering.\u201d Many people are Googling for information related to voting. Through the first three days of the Democratic convention, Google searches that include the word \u201cvote\u201d are twice as high as they were during the comparable days of the Republican convention. If you look at all conventions since 2004, the current Democratic convention is generating the second-highest interest in voting, after the 2004 Republican convention. The recent Republican convention generated the second-lowest interest in voting, just beating out the 2012 Republican convention. There is also evidence that the majority of searches for voting during a party\u2019s convention come from supporters. During the recent Republican convention, searches for voting were higher in states that voted Republican in the previous presidential election. Thus far, during the Democratic convention, searches for voting are higher in states that voted Democratic. Of course, for this to truly be good news for Democrats, a large number of the people now motivated to vote will have to successfully pull it off. In the United States, that isn\u2019t so simple. There\u2019s a lot of talk today about how hard it will be for Hillary Clinton to match the rhetorical appeal of President Obama\u2019s speech last night \u2014 the soaring cadences, the patriotic uplift, the defense of American ideals against Donald Trump\u2019s strongman appeal, the deliberate appropriation of \u201cmorning in America\u201d themes from a Republican Party that\u2019s gone way down into the dark.But if Clinton\u2019s eloquence is likely to fall short of the Obama standard, she also has reasons to try something different with her speech anyway, something few speakers at this convention have attempted, and go a little bit into the dark herself.No single theory explains this persistent discontent. There are sociological factors at work: America is an older society than it was in Reagan\u2019s day, a more individualistic and more atomized one, more ideologically polarized and less religious, with more diversity but less solidarity and social trust. There are economic trends: The Obama era, like the Bush era before it, hasn\u2019t generated sustained wage growth even when the unemployment rate is low, creating a feeling of stagnation even in periods of rising gross domestic product.True, electing Trump to deal with these problems seems far more likely hasten any unraveling than to reverse it. But President Obama and his party, in the course of defending his legacy this week, have struggled to acknowledge the legitimacy of American anxiety, the depth of disappointment and discontent.The first three days of this convention have been about stability, continuity, progress, uplift \u2014 all intended to contrast with the reckless and reactionary candidacy of Donald Trump.But to fully deal with her rival\u2019s appeal, Clinton still needs to become, to some degree at least, a candidate for darker times.This year\u2019s Democratic National Convention, however, has not tracked the hero\u2019s journey of the party\u2019s nominee, Hillary Clinton. Perhaps the hero\u2019s journey doesn\u2019t work all that well with female experience. Indeed, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s narrative this week has been that of a nurturer, one who has methodically dedicated herself to recognizing and facilitating the heroism of others \u2014 the handicapped, the kids, the unions, the Mothers of the Movement. Instead, the hero whose journey is being thematized at the engrossing spectacle in Philadelphia is that of the male voter. The voter in conflict. The one who hears the call of Hillary Clinton but refuses it. The one who experiences some supernatural interference in the form of the arch-imago Donald J. Trump. And the one who finally braves, say, another party\u2019s convention or the scorn of his supporters to emerge a changed man, ready to spread the word. It is the story of Bernie Sanders. Man, did Mr. Sanders refuse that Clinton call. Refuse, refuse, refuse \u2014 some heroes do that. But having done battle with his conscience, Mr. Sanders now shows up chivalrically at the convention, day after day, where he sits by his gently encouraging wife, sometimes seeming to brood but also recognizing that this is destiny. And it is the story of Barack Obama. Last night, President Obama was a gracious victor. He is farther along in his hero\u2019s journey than Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Sanders, having won the brass ring himself. In fact, having fought and trounced the Clintons years ago, gallantry now requires that he overcome any last resentments, embrace Mrs. Clinton and become her knight. Then there\u2019s Bill Clinton, who, in speech and demeanor, has looked this week more like a man whose steepest bill has come due than a contented Gandalf. His strangely roundabout formulation about his wife\u2019s sacrifices \u2014 \u201cI really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret\u201d \u2014 was ambivalence itself. But even if it sounded a touch phony and begrudging, he seemed to get it: He has been dodging creditors for a long time and now he is ready to face them. Does jumping into a supporting role as first gentleman \u2014 an inevitably feminized role \u2014 mean that he will have to forfeit his ambitions, his authority, his very virility and life force? Virginia Heffernan, a former television critic and internet columnist at The Times, is the author of \u201cMagic and Loss: The Internet as Art.\u201dVladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea. He threatens the freedom of the Baltic States, which the West struggled to obtain for decades. He rigged elections. He kept Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria while he used chemical weapons against his own people. Putin took over Russia\u2019s fledgling independent media and has been suspected in the murder of journalists. He stole billions for himself and his pals while ordinary Russians struggle to put food on their tables. And what is the assessment of the man who wants to build a wall to keep out impoverished Mexicans but offers open arms to the Russians? Was Trump also being sarcastic last week when he said he would not necessarily come to the aid of countries threatened by Russia, making a mockery of the North Atlantic alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for some 70 years? Trump added, \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe, so you know.\u201d (That, by the way, is an old Kremlin propaganda line that was intended to create a false moral equivalency between the Soviet Union and the United States.) \u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Scarborough said with admirable understatement. \u201cYou obviously condemn Vladimir Putin killing journalists and political opponents, right?\u201d \u201cOh, sure, absolutely,\u201d Trump said. Well, that\u2019s a relief \u2014 unless, of course, he was being \u201csarcastic.\u201d If Trump becomes president, will we constantly have to parse his words to figure out if he\u2019s being sarcastic? I can\u2019t imagine Putin will make the effort. Elizabeth Williamson is a member of the editorial board of The Times.\nCharles Blow was on the convention floor, asking delegates for their opinion.\nThey were mentioned line by line in speeches: unions, especially those for teachers and public employees; environmental groups; workers for reproductive rights, L.G.B.T. rights, civil rights and gun-control laws; campaign-finance reformers; and so forth. Not many of these causes had universal support among elected Democrats, and keeping this coalition of interests intact was the work of the party. When Democratic leaders did their job right, as in the 1990s, this coalition held together. An ideological movement needs a steady diet of enemies and ever bigger promises, whereas interest groups are satisfied with incremental progress and a seat at the table. But the interest-group party had drawbacks, too. It was difficult to present a coherent vision to the many voters who weren\u2019t committed to one particular cause. It neglected dozens of issues, like Wall Street regulation, that had no advocacy groups to counter the interests of campaign donors. Deep structural conflicts, like trade, were often ignored. Racial justice issues were spoken of quietly, as the party struggled to retain its hold on working-class white voters. The phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d would have terrified the Democrats of 1996. The first two days of the Democratic convention felt different, reflecting a long transition that began in the mid-2000s to a more seamless party vision. It started with Howard Dean\u2019s term as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and an effort to build a stronger sense of the party itself, and with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s work, before she was a senator, to call attention to such everyday economic issues as bankruptcy laws. Hillary Clinton\u2019s political lifetime is wholly within the interest-group party, but she has adapted slowly to the more robustly ideological world of this decade, more open to ideas once considered too far left and leery of compromise. But, as the convention is showing, what that means still isn\u2019t quite clear. But other convention speakers, notably Michelle Obama and Senator Cory Booker, showed a different kind of ideology, one that incorporates racial justice, inclusion, tolerance and a commitment to economic justice in a way that doesn\u2019t just check off interest-group boxes. Mr. Booker, for example, laid out a broad agenda of economic and individual justice and yet embedded it in the abstractions of the Declaration of Independence. It\u2019s a new voice for the Democratic Party, not the familiar checklist, not quite Mr. Sanders\u2019s bigger and more confrontational dreams, but also not quite the same as Barack Obama\u2019s frustrated dreams of unity and compromise. The question for the week will be whether Hillary Clinton can master this new voice. Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.She was on her state\u2019s shoreline for Governor\u2019s Bay Day, when there\u2019s free parking at the beaches and free public transportation to them. \u201cThere was a girl there, maybe 8 years old, from Massachusetts,\u201d Raimondo recalled. \u201cHer mom said, \u2018I heard the governor is at this event.\u2019 And the little girl said: \u2018Where is he? I want to see him.\u2019 \u201d Even after all this time, even after so much progress, \u201cWhen you close your eyes and you think \u2018leader,\u2019 you probably picture a man,\u201d Raimondo, 45, observed. The little girl from Massachusetts still did. Little girls from everywhere still do. Raimondo, a Democrat who took office early last year, is Rhode Island\u2019s first female governor. And although Democrats pride themselves on diversity, only two other Democratic governors in America are women. One, Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire, is running for the Senate and will soon exit the governor\u2019s office, to be replaced in all likelihood by a man. The other, Kate Brown, of Oregon, is in a seemingly tight race against a Republican challenger \u2014 male \u2014 and could also be out of office next year. Women have come far, but not all that far, and Raimondo said that she is constantly reflecting on this as she watches Hillary Clinton\u2019s progress, rooting for her to win the presidency. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to really break through is if people become more accustomed to seeing female leaders,\u201d she told me during an interview here late Wednesday afternoon. In particular, she said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough women in public executive roles \u2014 people don\u2019t even really know what they want to see in a female leader.\u201d She was Rhode Island\u2019s treasurer before she was its governor, and had an all-business, no-nonsense image. Then, at the start of her gubernatorial campaign, she released a television commercial that showed her riding bikes with her husband and two children. \u201cThe press could not get their heads around it,\u201d she said, adding that reporters asked her, \u201cAre you trying to convince voters that you\u2019re not this tough executive but that you\u2019re this warm and fuzzy person?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be both?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be a loving mother and also a competent finance person? It\u2019s binary with women.\u201d To listen to her was to think about Clinton and the stretches of Clinton\u2019s political career when she felt compelled to project toughness, the other chapters when she had to show warmth and her endless struggle to get the ratio just right. Most male politicians don\u2019t go through that. \u201cI just admire her perseverance and her personal resilience,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t to say she\u2019s perfect. She\u2019s made plenty of mistakes.\u201d In addition to the three Democratic women who are governors right now, there are three Republicans: Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Susana Martinez of New Mexico. Out of 50 current governors, six women. And out of 44 American presidents, none. If Clinton changes that, Raimondo said, it will help to change the way girls like that 8-year-old from Massachusetts see their futures and their world. \u201cLittle girls \u2014 8 years old, 9 years old, 10 \u2014 come up to me and say, literally, \u2018You make me think that I can do that,\u2019 \u201d Raimondo said. \u201cI know it sounds like something you read in a book, but it\u2019s happened to me 500 times. It\u2019s a much bigger impact than I ever realized.\u201d That\u2019s not reason alone to elect someone. Raimondo wasn\u2019t suggesting as much. But it\u2019s something to consider well beyond the 2016 presidential race: what our lineup of leaders \u2014 corporate as well as political \u2014 says to the next generation, and how the paucity of women on top puts the ones who\u2019ve made it there under a special microscope. Time and again as president, Barack Obama has chosen to use cautious language, at times frustrating both his allies and critics. His descriptions of corporate America\u2019s misbehavior during the financial crisis sounded like cocktail-party chatter compared with Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s jeremiads. Obama\u2019s sporadic refusal to utter \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cradical Islam\u201d has become a Republican meme.All of which highlights the bluntness and harshness of his attacks on Donald Trump on Wednesday night.\u201cAnyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or,\u201d Obama said, pausing slightly, \u201chomegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.\u201d Look at that list: A president notorious for his cool demeanor compared the opposing party\u2019s presidential nominee to America\u2019s two great 20th-century enemies and its bloodthirsty 21st-century enemy.Mr. Obama has now been on the national scene for 12 years and a day, dating to his 2004 speech at this same convention. Can you think of any personal insult that he has levied in that time that remotely approaches this one? I cannot. And I don\u2019t think Obama did it casually.Every living person who has held the office of the presidency \u2013 three Democrats and two Republicans, spanning 32 years in the White House \u2013 views Trump as unfit to hold it. Were he to win, the country could enter a period of instability few of us have known.The third night of the Democratic convention was the night that the party tried to raise the level of alarm about the Trump danger.Will the bracing honesty about Trump work? My instinct is that it will make a difference. Yet after all of 2016\u2019s surprises, I\u2019m deeply humble about anyone\u2019s ability to forecast matters pertaining to Trump.I do know this: If October rolls around and Trump appears to have a serious chance of winning, many people will wonder if they had done enough to halt his rise. On Wednesday, Obama and the Democrats decided to err on the side of aggressiveness. On principle, it was the right decision.And it raises a question many Americans should begin to ask themselves: Am I doing enough?On the final night on the Democratic National Convention, a full slate of speakers, including state leaders, some Republicans and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, preceded Hillary Clinton\u2019s appearance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Keeps Distance in G.O.P. Platform Fight on Gay Rights", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Same-sex marriage and transgender rights are emerging as points of serious strain between social conservatives and moderates who are trying to shape the Republican platform, reviving a festering cultural dispute as thousands of party activists and delegates prepare for their convention.The uncomfortable dynamic Mr. Trump has created for himself is perhaps best illustrated by his own calendar.But he has also promised not to interfere with the platform, which serves as the party\u2019s official declaration of principles.Even as Mr. Trump keeps his distance from the debate, other Republicans who share his more accepting view of gay and transgender issues are working aggressively to tone down some of the platform\u2019s language.Paul E. Singer, a billionaire Republican who has financed gay rights battles across the country, is now funding an effort to write into the platform language more inclusive of gays, lesbians and transgender people.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to say we\u2019re tolerant because we are tolerant of other views,\u201d said James Bopp Jr., a member of the platform committee from Indiana who has long supported efforts to make the platform more strongly in favor of traditional marriage. Such language promoting tolerance, he added, would be \u201credundant and superfluous.\u201dAdvisers for the American Unity Fund, who say they know they are fighting a steep uphill battle, argue that the Republican Party can no longer afford to alienate people on gay rights issues.Though he will almost certainly not mention it when he accepts the nomination next week, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions and words on gay rights have been more supportive than those of any Republican presidential nominee, even if they fall short of the full social and legal acceptance that his expected opponent, Hillary Clinton, has promoted.He has boasted of his friendships with many gay people, saying \u201cI have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay.\u201dBut as he tries to convince social conservatives that he is not acting as a moderate, Mr. Trump has been largely hands-off with the platform.\u201cHis guys have not shown up and said, \u2018Change this, change that,\u2019\u201d David Barton, a platform committee member from Texas, said.The Republican platform committee has long been dominated by some of the party\u2019s most stalwart activists. And some of them have hardly been shy about their views.Mr. Bopp of Indiana recently wrote to delegates to say that the Republican Party has always opposed threats to traditional marriage \u201cbeginning with our opposition to the \u2018twin relics of barbarism\u2019 of slavery and polygamy in our 1856 platform.\u201dAs dominant as those conservative voices have been, delegates who want to see a more inclusive platform are gaining seats on the committee.Many of them believe the Republican Party needs to have a serious debate this year about whittling down a platform that has grown long and become riddled with special-interest additions.Boyd Matheson, a first-time platform committee member from Utah, noted that at 33,000 words, the 2012 platform was \u201csix or seven times longer than the Constitution.\u201d Recent platforms have become, he said, \u201cthese laundry lists and litmus tests of \u2018thou shalts\u2019 and \u2018thou shalt nots.\u2019\u201dThe party\u2019s first platform in 1856 was fewer than 1,000 words.It is not the discussion Mr. Trump is eager to have, either. Asked in a recent interview about the platform, he declined to comment, saying only that he was \u201clooking at it.\u201dBut as a reminder of how unorthodox a Republican Mr. Trump is \u2014 and of how contrary many of his views on issues like trade, foreign policy, eminent domain and gay rights are to the party\u2019s doctrine \u2014 there is no more vivid example than the platform.\u201cThe bigger problem for Trump and the Republican National Committee,\u201d said Lanhee J. Chen, who led Mitt Romney\u2019s platform efforts in 2012, \u201cis the fact that there are these major disagreements between where Trump is on some of these issues and where the activist base of the party is.\u201dDifferences between a candidate\u2019s views and what is written in the platform are nothing new, of course.

{"Headline": "How the Rich Are Hurting the Museums They Fund", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionFor museum executives, the dirty secret of expansions has been that they are often motivated by the need to have some exciting new thing to rally board members and interest potential patrons. These institutions depend heavily on rich people to fund them. Those rich people like to pay for flashy new buildings; no one wants to donate to boring old museum upkeep.New institutions like the Broad, financed by the billionaire Eli and his wife, Edythe Broad, and other \u201cego-seums\u201d illustrate that the people with the money are increasingly interested in founding their own institutions. Consequently, traditional museums have to be ever more aggressive with new projects just to win their imaginations, and their dollars.So, have museums been growing? Yes. But on a sustainable basis? No.Institutions that already had to beg for funding were drawn into building more expensive facilities, but had no better way to fill the funding gap when a crisis hit.Large, cosmopolitan institutions have resources to compete for attention in a way that the bulk of smaller institutions, more dependent on local communities and cultures, simply can\u2019t.So there\u2019s a case for a significant increase in public art funding that\u2019s more than just a sentimental call for a cause favored by the well-to-do. In fact, it\u2019s based on correcting for the biases of the rich.That makes it all the more important to see that, whatever its glories, the great American museum boom mirrors all the irrational extremes of the age of inequality.An opinion article last Sunday about art museum expansion misstated the status of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art after its expansion. It is now the largest modern and contemporary art museum in the country, not the largest art museum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trouble With Hillary Clinton\u2019s Free Tuition Plan", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byThe Cost of CollegeIt\u2019s easy to devise a straightforward way to meet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s goals: Students at public colleges and universities simply forward their tuition bills to the federal Department of Education, which pays them. Congress could write such a law on a single piece of paper and still have time for golf in the afternoon.That policy would also be a financial disaster. Any public university president with an ounce of sense would simply raise annual tuition by $5,000 or $10,000 or more, secure in the knowledge that Uncle Sam would foot the bill. It would be an unlimited bonanza for colleges and a huge drain on the Treasury, for a program already estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars per year.Mrs. Clinton could, of course, decide that her program will provide free tuition only at current prices, plus some future inflationary adjustment. But that still leaves another major problem: Tuition isn\u2019t the same everywhere. It varies greatly, largely based on how much states spend on making college affordable.Take North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Both are among the 10 most populous states, are relatively balanced politically between Republicans and Democrats and have similar levels of G.D.P. per capita. Both have world-class research institutions, regional universities and community colleges.Pennsylvania, by contrast, spent only $3,758 per student, less than half of what North Carolina did. Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania students pay almost double the college tuition of their peers in the Tar Heel state: $13,395 a year.The same would be true elsewhere. Average public college tuition varies by more than 3 to 1 among the states, from less than $5,000 in Wyoming to over $15,000 in New Hampshire. The range of public investment is even larger, from $2,591 per student in New Hampshire to $14,412 in Alaska.The alternative is to distribute federal money to states on a formula basis, giving each the same subsidy per student. Many existing federal education programs work this way, often with adjustments for local poverty rates and personal income. But that would make it extraordinarily hard for states like Pennsylvania to make public college free. It would require states that have historically been least willing to raise taxes and spend money on affordable higher education to suddenly do the most.Presumably, some would choose not to. States will be able to opt out of the Clinton plan, just as a significant number have chosen not to accept large federal subsidies to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.The problem boils down to the consequences of building higher education policy around a single price: $0. If that\u2019s a given, Clinton will have to choose between an extremely expensive and grossly unfair policy that actually fulfills her highly publicized promise, or a more affordable and reasonable policy that leaves hundreds of thousands of students with more than $0 to pay.Asked for details about the plan, Clinton campaign officials suggested a kind of compromise: In the beginning, high-tuition states like Pennsylvania would get larger amounts of money. Then, over time, the \u201cgoal\u201d would be for such states to invest more, so that grant amounts from the federal government would begin to converge with states that are already keeping tuition low or free.But this would still reward states that have historically done the least to make college affordable. And it can be very difficult to reduce public subsidies once they are put in place.By taking on the mantle of free college, Mrs. Clinton may have won the loyalty of reluctant Sanders supporters and increased her odds of being elected president. But in doing so, she has created significant new problems to overcome if she wins.An earlier version of this article misstated the federal program that some states have opted not to expand as part of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s Medicaid, not Medicare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Olympics Issue", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "July 31, 2016By Michael PowellOne man blocked his path: Usain Bolt, from Sherwood Content, Jamaica \u2014 the charismatic star who dominated sprinting after Gatlin was banished from the sport in 2006. Bolt won gold medals in both the 100 and 200 meters at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. \u201cI had a target all season long, and it was Bolt in Beijing,\u201d Gatlin told me recently. \u201cI knew I needed to run 9.7 to beat him.\u201d He seemed ready to do so: He was conquering 2015 so far, having run 100 meters in 9.74 seconds in Qatar in May, followed by a 9.75 in Rome in June and another in Lausanne in July. His times were less than two-tenths of a second off Bolt\u2019s world record.The gun sounded. Gatlin\u2019s head-down drive was instantaneous. Forty yards out, his acceleration mechanically perfect, he was a step ahead. But the beauty of Bolt is to be found not in his starts but in his top-end speed and his ferocious competitiveness. With racehorselike strides, he pulled even. World-class sprints are blink-of-eye affairs, yet the best runners talk as if these races occur in slow motion; they notice everything. Gatlin saw Bolt at the edge of his vision. With 20 meters to go, he started to come undone. His chest flew out; his stride grew long and wild. \u201cI ran like I was out there on the streets,\u201d Gatlin recounted to me with disgust. \u201cInstead of concentrating on my technique and my race, I got sucked into all the hype.\u201dBoth men lunged for the line. Gatlin crossed at 9.8 seconds. As he had predicted, that was not enough. Bolt got there four inches ahead of him, in 9.79 seconds.In the BBC television booth, in seats set aside for track insiders and former champions, ecstatic cheering broke out for Bolt, a man the British press had celebrated as a savior and \u201csuperhero.\u201d Sebastian Coe, twice an Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters and now the president of track\u2019s ruling body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, had opined to BBC One that track \u201cneeds Usain to come through in Beijing.\u201dWhen a television reporter caught up with Gatlin after the race, he said, \u201cI\u2019m happy\u201d \u2014 his voice caught \u2014 \u201chappy to be an American.\u201d He tried again, speaking of those who loved him. \u201cIt keeps me emotional inside. I\u2019m just happy to be here, man.\u201d Gatlin tried to say more but could not.The pressure to seek chemical advantages in a sport where the margins of victory are so small cannot be overstated. Gatlin finished first at the United States Olympic trials earlier this month. Michael Rodgers finished two-tenths of a second behind him, in fourth place, and did not qualify for the Olympics in that event.Sprinters\u2019 prospects can hinge on balky hamstrings and pulled calf muscles. They take piles of vitamins and supplements, visit doctors in hopes of finding and keeping an edge. An industry has popped up to certify which supplements are clean of banned substances. A no-less-vigorous underground industry of pharmacists and endocrinologists boasts to athletes and coaches of being able to increase muscle mass and endurance and speed the healing of injuries while evading ever more sophisticated tests. Anonymous surveys suggest that significantly more athletes dope, often in microdoses, than are caught. \u201cWe can\u2019t be na\u00efve: There\u2019s a win-at-any-cost in every sport,\u201d says Travis T. Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Too many coaches, he adds, ask runners to sign public pledges not to use drugs and then, in private, press them to do just that.Ross Tucker, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of the Free State in South Africa whose website, The Science of Sport, is much respected in the world of running, points out that \u201cvery few people in history have sprinted under 9.9 seconds without testing positive for a drug at some point.\u201d Bolt, 29, is in that group, but Gatlin is not. Now he is about to become the oldest sprinter in United States Olympic history while also representing the nation\u2019s best shot at beating Bolt and winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters. Gatlin is one of a tiny handful of men in their mid-30s who have run 100 meters in under 10 seconds, and his times have improved in five of the past seven years. \u201cHe\u2019s running faster than when he won the 2004 gold medal,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cThat makes him an extreme outlier in a sport known for doping.\u201dHe is tested often and randomly by the United States Anti-Doping Agency; screeners have checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times this year. They look for evidence of steroids, stimulants, blood doping and human growth hormone. The more Gatlin wins, the more he is tested. He consistently passes these tests. Yet he cannot outpace suspicion \u2014 either that he might still be doping or that he continues to derive benefits from past steroid use, a phenomenon scientists have seen in experiments on mice. Studies suggest that the muscle mass acquired through steroid use could remain for many months, perhaps years, after that use ends.Running was like breathing. He raced along oak-shaded streets, while his friends rode bicycles beside him. In high school, he was a coach\u2019s dream, running hurdles on a team that won a state championship. His mother laid down the rules for the college recruiters who took turns visiting their home: He had to remain within a day\u2019s drive from Pensacola. He went to the University of Tennessee, where, as a freshman in 2001, he won N.C.A.A. titles in the 100 and 200 meters. \u201cIn high school, you get to leave school early and see girls in short shorts,\u201d he says. \u201cIn college, everything was an intense blur.\u201dAt the end of his freshman year, Gatlin tested positive for a minute trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by USA Track & Field. Amphetamines are ingredients in Adderall, which Gatlin had a prescription for and had taken while preparing for midterms in two summer courses. That accorded with N.C.A.A. rules and was consistent with the guidance offered to professional athletes. Gatlin figured the drug would exit his body by the time he raced three days later.This would become a foundation stone in the narrative of Gatlin as unrepentant cheat. Except that there was nothing to repent for: An American Arbitration Association panel concluded that Gatlin took a permitted medication in the appropriate dosage, and that it did not aid his performance. \u201cHe neither cheated nor intended to cheat,\u201d the panel stated. \u201cHe is certainly not a doper.\u201d His transgression consisted of not having told officials in advance that he had taken Adderall. The international body that governs professional track cut what was initially a two-year suspension to a single year. Because Gatlin remained in school, competing as an amateur, the suspension had no practical effect on him.Gatlin left college after his sophomore year, having won six N.C.A.A. titles, in order to turn pro. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s take a plane, bring it on,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cI want to make a name for myself.\u201d His first professional race pitted him against his idol, Maurice Greene. Gatlin was vibrating with nerves, but he finished ahead of Greene.Just before he turned pro, Gatlin and his parents, Willie and Jeanette, drove from Pensacola to New York for a funeral. (They could not afford the airfare.) On the drive, Gatlin\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Trevor Graham, who wanted to be his coach. \u201cI told him I\u2019d never heard of him \u2014 Trevor was kind of taken aback,\u201d Gatlin recalls. He got a crash course in finances. Graham had a formidable reputation and coached a stable of athletes affiliated with Nike, a colossus in the track world and a company Graham served as a frontman. According to Jeanette Gatlin\u2019s testimony in a later hearing, Graham told her son that Nike wanted to cut a deal with him years earlier but feared bad publicity if it persuaded him to skip college.Graham promised to treat Gatlin like a son, though his parents never stopped feeling uneasy about the rumors of doping that swirled around the world of pro track. (In 2004, Willie saw something online saying that his son had failed a drug test. He would learn it was an April Fool\u2019s gag \u2014 but not before Jeanette found him packing his pistol. He told her: \u201cI\u2019m driving to North Carolina to kill Trevor. He promised this would not happen.\u201d)Graham guided Gatlin to his greatest moment as a sprinter when he won gold, silver and bronze medals in Athens in 2004. But Gatlin\u2019s triumph was soon dimmed by his association with his coach. In the months leading up to the Games, Graham\u2019s name became linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, or Balco \u2014 then the target of a widely publicized doping investigation that involved numerous pro athletes \u2014 suggesting he had helped an earlier generation of his athletes acquire steroids. Then, at the Olympics, Graham told reporters that he had anonymously mailed a syringe containing a steroid to the United States Anti-Doping Agency in an effort to implicate Balco.Executives from Nike and USA Track & Field were worried; they viewed Gatlin as the new and marketable face of American track. They told Gatlin he had to be beyond reproach, meeting with him, his parents and his agent, Renaldo Nehemiah, who would later refer to this as a \u201ccoming-to-Jesus talk.\u201d Yet Gatlin elected to remain with Graham. Pro runners are loners, one bad injury removed from obscurity. The eighth-ranked sprinter in the world makes a fraction of the riches that go to the top ranked; sponsors want winners, and Graham had helped Gatlin win.The financial blow was immediate. Nike dropped him, as did other sponsors. His income, expected to reach $2.5 million that year, disappeared. He sold his house in North Carolina and ended up in a small bug-infested apartment in Atlanta. He had to ask his mother if he had enough money to buy jeans. \u201cI was collecting unemployment checks and eating ramen noodles,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cYou go to the supermarket and you\u2019re marked. It feels like everyone is staring at you.\u201dHe never contested the doping result, but his admission was hedged. Gatlin speculated publicly that a masseur, disgruntled at the lack of a bonus, had spread steroid cream on him after a race. A three-person panel with the American Arbitration Association heard the case, and the majority decision concluded that Gatlin\u2019s testimony related to the cream \u201cwas not credible, was not substantiated.\u201d (One panel member dissented, saying Gatlin\u2019s account was credible.) The panel laid out a different scenario: Suffering from a hamstring tear in the spring of 2006, Gatlin was sent by his coach to see a doctor, who in turn let an assistant coach give an injection to Gatlin\u2019s thigh to speed healing. \u201cIt was a vitamin,\u201d Gatlin had told the arbitration panel. \u201cIt was supposed to help heal my torn hamstring and the microfiber tears and reduce swelling.\u201d The panel was skeptical. It pointed out that the coach could as easily have injected Gatlin with steroids, leading in turn to the positive test. World antidoping regulators take the view that athletes are responsible for what goes into their bodies and cannot blame their support staff.A federal investigator, Jeffrey Novitzky, contacted Gatlin and asked if he would work undercover to help build a steroid trafficking case. (Novitzky also led the Balco investigation.) If Gatlin lied or tipped off anyone, Novitzky told him, he would be prosecuted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask to think about it,\u201d Novitzky, who now works for the U.F.C., told me this spring. \u201cHe said he had nothing to hide.\u201d Gatlin recorded 11 conversations with Graham. When I asked Gatlin about that time, he shook his head in disbelief. \u201cIt was like living in a soap opera, or a spy novel.\u201d Though Gatlin\u2019s recordings did not uncover new evidence of wrongdoing by Graham, the coach would later be convicted of a felony for lying to federal investigators.That Gatlin earned his suspension is beyond doubt. Still, a question nagged at me, and I put it to Novitzky: Did Gatlin dope intentionally or was he far too credulous? Novitzky paused. \u201cAthletes who test positive don\u2019t materialize out of thin air,\u201d he told me. \u201cJustin surrounded himself with questionable people and needed better judgment. He did not do due diligence.\u201dI asked again: Did Gatlin know? He hesitated again. Gatlin had helped him, of course, but he has also worked with a wide range of informants. \u201cI had many years of training in how to read untruthfulness,\u201d Novitzky said. \u201cUnless Justin was an Academy Award-winning actor, I didn\u2019t see evidence of purposeful, knowing use.\u201dIn 2010, in an early comeback meet in Finland, he ran the 100 meters in 10.28 seconds. That\u2019s blindingly fast for a normal person and a slog through mud for a top-end sprinter. \u201cLet\u2019s be real,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cMy opponents were the best Finns in Helsinki. And I had to claw for every meter.\u201d Two years later, Gatlin was back in the Olympics, where he won a bronze medal at the London Games, finishing a couple of strides behind Bolt. At 30, Gatlin had no real plan for coming up with those missing strides.One night while scrolling through Facebook he came across the coach Dennis Mitchell, who was known to be obsessed with proper technique, and sent him a message. \u201cIt took Dennis a month to reply,\u201d Gatlin says. \u201cHe\u2019s not computer savvy.\u201d Mitchell, a top 100-meter sprinter who was caught doping in 1998 (at the time, he attributed the positive test to five beers and lots of sex with his fianc\u00e9e), possessed swagger, knowledge and a hunger for redemption as great as Gatlin\u2019s. \u201cDennis was like, \u2018We\u2019re training for gold, period,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to hear.\u201dMitchell dismantled and reconstructed Gatlin\u2019s form, from start to stride. Nothing about the process was polite: No, that\u2019s not right, do it again. Do it again. \u201cIt was like \u2018Rocky,\u2019 \u201d Gatlin says. \u201cI wanted to kill him some days.\u201d In the evenings, Gatlin watched hours of video \u2014 of himself and of sprinters past, going back to Jesse Owens. To view Gatlin\u2019s races from his early 20s is to see a runner relying far less on technique than on intense competitiveness and raw talent.Gatlin changed that. He began exploding out of the blocks. His drive phase, in which a runner reaches maximum speed, became tight, with an emphasis on quick strides. A sprinter reaches peak speed at about 70 meters; any appearance of increasing speed after that is an optical illusion. By 2014, having overhauled his mechanics and diet \u2014 he weighed 174 pounds, down from 205 pounds at the beginning of his comeback, his muscles now long rivers instead of thick knots \u2014 he began to win every time out. And after every race, Gatlin heard the same doubting questions from reporters: How are your times possible? Are you doping? Did you apologize for your doping? Each question was more or less reasonable; collectively, heard day after day, they were difficult to answer with equanimity.Gatlin was not interested in equanimity. Stubborn anger and hurt fueled him. \u201cDennis trained me like a sensei trained his warrior,\u201d he says. \u201c \u2018Remember your ethos! Don\u2019t give them nothing!\u2019 \u201d Anger made Gatlin \u2014 who laughs easily with fellow runners and shows grace with teenagers seeking autographs and selfies \u2014 unlikable as a public figure. Last year, he barked at reporters who asked about doping. \u201cWhy would I answer that? I answered it 10 years ago.\u201dThis April, I traveled through the pine forests of Central Florida \u2014 Gatlin lives in Clermont, outside Orlando \u2014 and found him seated underneath the stands at a track meet in Gainesville, waiting out a downpour. He spoke of taking months off after that Beijing race against Bolt, the longest break he\u2019d ever allowed himself. \u201cPeople who love me, they said: \u2018Why are you doing this to yourself?\u2019 \u201d Gatlin recalled. \u201cEven a warrior puts that sword and shield down.\u201dEarly in his comeback, Gatlin saw his role as, in his words, the \u201cthe Batman of track, a vigilante.\u201d While Bolt smiled and pantomimed shooting an arrow, Gatlin scowled. But he came to find the mask becoming the face. \u201cI was too angry; it was deteriorating my character,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t like who I had become.\u201dOne afternoon a teenager at a local gym invited Gatlin to attend his church. The teenager did not let on that his father was the pastor. Gatlin took a seat in the pews. The pastor, Everett Gates, had left a handsome salary at a big church in Atlanta to found his own, much smaller congregation. He knew who Gatlin was, and so what? In the weeks to come, Gatlin talked with Gates. \u201cJustin told me, \u2018I\u2019m focused on running, but I want to be at peace,\u2019 \u201d Gates recalls.Top runners from different Florida camps found their way to this little church. It became that rare place where they could shed their competitive armor. \u201cTrust is not part of their sport,\u201d Gates says. One Sunday, Gates recalls, he asked who wanted to find God, and Gatlin raised his hand. Gatlin walked over and held the pastor in an embrace, and cried uncontrollably. \u201cPastor, I am broken,\u201d Gatlin said. \u201cCompletely broken.\u201dGatlin got off to a slow start this season. He had a serious ankle sprain; he was 34; perhaps age finally had put in a grappling hook. But a few weeks ago, at the Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., he ran a 9.83 in the semifinals. Ninety minutes later, he ran a 9.80 in the finals, the fastest time in the world this year.I visited Gatlin the next day in a house where his family was staying during the trials. The sunlight through the pines was dappled, and his son, Jace, played with puzzles on the floor as Gatlin talked with affection of a young runner, Trayvon Bromell, who also made the American team as a 100-meter sprinter. \u201cTrayvon, he is like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me.\u201dGatlin knows that his generation is dropping away. Bolt told me this Olympics would be his last. Gatlin spoke of the grind of training, taking Epsom salt baths and ice baths and trying to fall asleep at 2 a.m. after a race, his mind still afire. \u201cI know how old I am every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cEach year, it becomes harder to draw on something to keep that edge.\u201d The longer he runs, and the better his times, the more questions circle around him. Several European athletes have denounced him. In early March, the American middle-distance runner Alysia Monta\u00f1o told reporters at an Olympics press event that Gatlin should be barred from the Games. \u201cYou are 100 percent held accountable for what you put in your body,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, someone gave me a massage.\u2019 \u201dDoes he hear that disbelief? He smiled faintly. He has said many times that he is not doping. He noted that his 6-year-old son sat on his lap for the post-race news conference at the United States trials, and he spoke of the joy that brought him. Maybe that would be enough. Or maybe not. I asked if he had thought about retirement. He shook his head. \u201cBeing suspended, losing all those years, it\u2019s like I constantly have to prove a point,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop yet. I can\u2019t.\u201dMichael Powell writes the Sports of The Times column.By Michael Sokolove. Photographs by Erik Madigan HeckLedecky, 19, is also happy, seemingly just about all the time. When you start listing the factors that make her so freakishly good at what she does, being freakishly happy has to rank very high. She rarely has anxieties about her swimming or anything else, and when she does, she says: \u201cI can get rid of them. I\u2019m pretty good at doing that. If I\u2019m worried about something, I\u2019m able to make myself just think about something else.\u201dThe sport she has come to dominate makes almost impossible demands of the body and spirit. It imposes a ratio of hard training to exhilaration that is depressingly out of whack. Top swimmers train as often as nine times a week, 50-plus weeks a year, with their heads submerged in water for two or more hours at each of those sessions. What they hear is the rhythm of their own strokes, their teammates\u2019 kicking, their coach\u2019s muffled voice. One of the sport\u2019s cruelties is that all this extreme training produces, on the whole, lackluster competitive performances. Swimmers try to peak just once or twice a year, and they prepare for these occasions in scientific and ritualistic ways. They swim fewer yards in the weeks leading up to a big competition, in order to be rested and fresh. They also, on the eve of major races, shave: women their legs and arms, men their legs, arms, chests, backs and sometimes their heads. The idea is to feel sleek and fast in the water.Ledecky wants practices and all but the biggest meets to feel harder, not easier. \u201cI haven\u2019t shaved my legs since Russia,\u201d she told me late last year in one of our first conversations, referring to a competition many months earlier. She laughed, which she does often. She has a big, engaging smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s probably too much information, right?\u201dHis daughter, though, was quietly setting goals, sharing them only with her coach \u2014 first, make the Olympic trials, then qualify for the Summer Games. In one of her first meets with world-class competition, she swam a 400-meter freestyle against Allison Schmitt, a top American swimmer who is seven years older. \u201cI gave her a bit of a race,\u201d is how Ledecky recalls it. \u201cAfter that, I knew I could compete against those people. I wasn\u2019t afraid to race them.\u201dIn 2012 in London, Ledecky, a little-known 15-year-old, won the gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle, defeating Rebecca Adlington, a British swimmer and world-record holder so heavily favored that Prince William, Kate Middleton and other members of the British royal family were in attendance at the Olympic aquatic center, anticipating a coronation. As the crowd chanted Adlington\u2019s name, Ledecky channeled its energy and imagined the shouts were \u201cLedecky, Ledecky, Ledecky.\u201d In the four years since, she has been on a world-record spree, setting them at all times of the year and over a stunning range of distances. First she established her supremacy in the distance freestyles, then she took command of shorter events. She is now the world\u2019s top female swimmer in the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles. She is among the best Americans in the 100 free. No swimmer has conquered this combination of distances in nearly half a century, and to many in the sport, her achievement is hard to fathom \u2014 it would be like the Jamaican star sprinter Usain Bolt taking up and winning mile races.In mid-January, I attended a three-day meet at the University of Texas in Austin. A large contingent of top American and international swimmers were there. Most of them talked about using the weekend to measure the state of their training; no one, or almost no one, was expecting to produce particularly fast results.On the day before the racing began, Ledecky, who took a gap year after high school to train for the Olympics before she enrolls at Stanford this September, was led into a small media room by a staff member of USA Swimming. Not uncommon for a swimmer, she can seem a little awkward on land, and she approached the lectern with a gangly, slightly slope-shouldered gait. When the questioning began, she seemed to try to fall in line with the other swimmers\u2019 modest goals. She said, for example, that she was just hoping to \u201cimplement\u201d some of what she had been working on in practices. A poised public speaker, she referred to the coming competition more than once as \u201cone of these kinds of meets\u201d \u2014 meaning not too big a deal. But when someone asked what times she anticipated, she smiled, and it was a thinner smile, almost a smirk. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a good weekend,\u201d she said. It was Ledecky\u2019s demure way of saying: Keep your eye on me.On the meet\u2019s last day, she broke her own world record in the 800 freestyle, her 11th world mark since London. At the United States Swim Trials in Omaha, Neb., earlier this summer, she won three events. She could end up with four or possibly even five gold medals in Rio, depending on how many relays she participates in. The first eight nights of NBC\u2019s Olympic coverage will focus on swimming, with about 90 minutes of live coverage from the pool every evening, and Ledecky will play a starring role. She will get the kind of exposure that recent American Olympians have eagerly converted into riches, but Ledecky has distinguished herself in another way too: She has not become a professional athlete. This has little to do with pursuing some notion of Olympic purity, which never existed anyway; instead, it is a savvy decision that serves her swimming and may very well give her a competitive advantage. While some others are out chasing endorsement dollars, she is focused only on gold.In Austin, I sat down with Bob Bowman, Michael Phelps\u2019s coach, whom I first met while writing about Phelps when he was roughly the same age that Ledecky is now. \u201cShe has an intensity to her swimming that I have never seen in a distance athlete,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s completely fearless\u201d \u2014 by which he meant she goes out fast without the fear of fading at the end.Swimming is a highly technical sport, and there are different approaches to each stroke, but Ledecky\u2019s freestyle is a near replica of Phelps\u2019s. In what she recalls as a \u201ceureka moment,\u201d it was taught to her in 2011, when she was 14, by her coach Yuri Suguiyama, who has since moved on to become the associate head coach of the men\u2019s swim team at the University of California, Berkeley. He showed her a video of Phelps setting a world record in a 200 free at a world championship meet, and they set out to copy his form.Unlike Phelps, whose physique is built for swimming \u2014 a long torso, big hands that serve as paddles and relatively short legs (which create less drag in the water) \u2014 Ledecky is unremarkably proportioned. She describes her stroke as \u201cloping,\u201d but there is nothing leisurely-looking about it. She has what swim coaches call a \u201chigh elbow catch\u201d and a quick connection to the water. Her arms are never up in the air very long. Like Phelps, she has a \u201cgallop\u201d in her stroke: She glides on one side just an instant longer, like a sailboat keeling.Her future coach at Stanford, Greg Meehan, uses the term \u201caquatic strength\u201d in talking about her prowess, adding that it\u2019s hard to quantify and not related to how much weight a person can lift in a gym. \u201cShe grabs a lot of water and holds onto it through every stroke,\u201d is how he explains it. \u201cAnd she is able to do that again and again, without letting up.\u201dUntil the year of the London Games, Ledecky breathed to both sides, every third stroke, but that creates too much side-to-side body sway for efficient racing. She now breathes to her right side, with her left arm in the water \u2014 and so smoothly that the goggle on her left eye never comes fully out of the water. You wonder how she even gets air.\u201cHer form is as close to perfect as exists,\u201d says Russell Mark, a former college swimmer with a degree in aerospace engineering who is a high-performance consultant for USA Swimming. Mark compiles metrics for America\u2019s top swimmers. His numbers indicate that Ledecky has been steadily increasing her tempo \u2014 turning her strokes over faster \u2014 while also improving the quality of her stroke, meaning each one takes her farther. This combination is enormously difficult to accomplish. When younger swimmers increase their tempo, they often \u201cspin\u201d \u2014 they don\u2019t get anywhere \u2014 but even the best swimmers can fall into a version of the same trap. In her 800-meter races, in which her world record is 8:06.68, Ledecky is now completing a full cycle \u2014 or strokes with each arm \u2014 approximately every 1.4 seconds. After her push off the wall, she covers 50 meters with 20 cycles.\u201cPeople trying to go fast are like animals,\u201d said Bowman, who happens to own thoroughbreds and sees in them some of the same biomechanical habits of the swimmers he trains. \u201cYou watch a horse. The first thing they do is increase their stride length. And the second thing is the rate. She followed the natural progression. She picked up the rate of her stroke to keep the thing moving forward, which is how she got from 8:14 to 8:06 in the 800. Sooner or later she\u2019ll have to go back to length. It\u2019s a balance. You can\u2019t just do one or the other.\u201dLedecky\u2019s competitiveness is apparent at practices and in meets, even if it is expressed quietly. About 15 minutes before their events, swimmers gather in a \u201cready room\u201d that usually consists of a few rows of chairs and a TV showing the races. Ledecky invariably sits in a kind of trance with her parka zipped up and her hood pulled over her head. The intensity she radiates causes even friends to keep their distance. \u201cAt practice, she\u2019s a nice girl,\u201d Anna Belousova, a 19-year-old Russian breaststroker who trains with Ledecky, told me. \u201cAt meets, I\u2019m afraid to go near her.\u201dOne afternoon this spring, I was sitting with Ledecky by the pool at Georgetown Prep, an all-boys school where her team, the Nation\u2019s Capital Swim Club, practices. A couple of freshmen came over and asked for an autograph, and she signed. I suggested to her that she seemed to enjoy beating her opponents, not just by a bit, but really crushing them. \u201cSure I do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can be nice when you race. But it\u2019s not personal. I\u2019m mostly focused on my own time, and you\u2019ve got to be mean to the clock, right?\u201dIn the starting blocks before a race, Ledecky does not stroke her biceps or pound her fists against her own body, as some male swimmers do. (In Omaha, a swimmer billing himself as the Dark Knight went to the blocks in a Batman mask.) She just stretches her neck a bit and shakes her arms out, then dives in the pool and wins.In Bethesda, Ledecky trains with about 30 swimmers, spread out over eight lanes, coached by Bruce Gemmell and two assistant coaches. But she has only three real training partners, all of them male, because they are the only ones with the ability to keep up with her. They swim either in the same lane or in an adjoining lane to Ledecky. Her training mates told me that when they are supposed to be going at a slower pace \u2014 practices consist of repeated sets of distances swum at variable rates of speed and effort \u2014 she tends to swim fast, pulling the whole group along with her. The ability to coast is something she either does not want or does not have. Ledecky told me that sometimes she has bad days at practice, when she is just not feeling energetic, and shrugs them off. If she has two in a row, it frustrates her. Her aerobic fitness is a combination of her genetics \u2014 her \u201cbig engine,\u201d as Meehan, the Stanford coach says \u2014 and the fact that she works so hard.It\u2019s not unusual for men and women swimmers to train together, but being in the pool with Ledecky is something that many men can\u2019t handle. In April, Conor Dwyer, a 6-foot-5, 27-year-old American swimmer who won a gold medal in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay in London, gave a revealing interview posted online by USA Swimming. In it, he talked about male swimmers being \u201cbroken\u201d by Ledecky when they practiced together at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.\u201cShe is no easy task to beat in practice, even as a male,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get broken by her, so I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d He added: \u201cI saw her break a lot of guys in practice. ... What I mean is if we\u2019re doing a 3K threshold\u201d \u2014 30 all-out 100 frees \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019ll just start beating you every single hundred, and slowly but surely you get broken like you do in a long race, like a mile. Your morale goes down pretty quickly when you get broken by a female in practice. I saw a couple of guys have to get yanked out of workout because they got beat by her.\u201dWhen I asked Ledecky about this, she claimed not to have noticed. \u201cI was probably just concentrating on doing my own work,\u201d she said.Ledecky\u2019s training partners include Andrew Gemmell, the coach\u2019s son, who is 25 and finished ninth in the 1,500 at the 2012 London Games, and Matthew Hirschberger, 17, who competed at this summer\u2019s Olympic trials and is one of the nation\u2019s top young middle-distance swimmers. (Neither qualified for the games in Rio.) \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, it can be annoying when she beats you,\u201d Hirschberger told me. Even if the person getting the best of him is a reigning world-record holder in three events? \u201cYou\u2019re just not used to getting beat by a girl,\u201d he said.When Gemmell swam for the college team at Georgia, he trained with both male and female Olympians. \u201cLook, I understand, he\u2019s a little younger,\u201d he said, when I told him what Hirschberger had shared. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little more of a perspective. There have been a couple of times where I\u2019ve come really close to asking my dad: Can I pop out of practice to watch? Because what\u2019s going on next to me is just ridiculous. It\u2019s unreal.\u201dLedecky\u2019s ability to crush men in practice does not necessarily mean she would defeat them in competition. There\u2019s a difference between imposing her will, and perhaps superior conditioning, over the course of a two-hour practice and doing it in a shorter race in which men\u2019s generally greater strength provides an advantage. Her best chance would probably be in the 1,500 freestyle, which women race at the FINA World Championships but not at the Olympics. (The men don\u2019t swim the 800 in the Olympics, so there are the same number of events for male and female swimmers.) Ledecky\u2019s best time in the event would put her among the dozen or so top American men and is 25 seconds faster than their qualifying time at the United States Olympic trials \u2014 but it is much too slow to earn a medal at the Games. On the other hand, because no other woman offers a real challenge to her, she is never pushed in that event. I asked Andrew Gemmell, who specializes in the 1,500 free, a hypothetical question: What if, in some dystopian swim universe, Ledecky was told that there would be no women\u2019s events and that she would have to try to make the American team by competing with the men in the 1,500?His father, who trains her, had told me that he did not think she could qualify, a feat that under current rules would require her to finish first or second at the trials. Andrew, who trains side by side with her, had a different answer. \u201cIt would be really difficult, but I would never bet against her,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows yet what she\u2019s capable of.\u201dLedecky is, in a sense, the last amateur of the Olympic Games. She is not the only Olympian who has opted against turning pro \u2014 in many sports, there is no appreciable money to be made \u2014 but she is the only one at her exalted level. In order to accept a swimming scholarship at Stanford, she chose to pass up millions of dollars in potential endorsement contracts.For many years, Olympians had to remain amateurs, at least ostensibly. The \u201camateur ideal\u201d may have been outdated from the start, and it hurt many athletes, going all the way back to Jim Thorpe, who was stripped of his medals from the 1912 Games when it was later discovered that he had accepted money to play semipro baseball. (The medals were restored posthumously.) But professionalism has its own costs. At the Olympic trials in Omaha, it was hard to miss the pure joy with which Ledecky seemed to be swimming, especially compared with rivals who spoke of the immense pressure they were feeling. It helped, of course, that she was so far ahead of her competition and did not really have to worry about qualifying. But one reason for this might be that she has achieved an ideal that is so difficult for others to reach \u2014 truly racing for herself. \u201cThe more money that gets put into something, the more it gets messed up,\u201d Bowman, Phelps\u2019s coach, told me. \u201cNobody is demanding her time. She never misses a day. That\u2019s how you maintain that level.\u201dThere are just a handful of swimmers who have made life-changing money from the sport, but for those who do, most notably Phelps, it can be a lot. \u201cShe would have had the earnings potential that no one but Michael has had, if she wanted it,\u201d Bowman said. I asked Matt Powell, a sports-industry analyst with the NPD Group, a market-research firm, about Ledecky\u2019s commercial value. \u201cShe has a terrific personality \u2014 great kid, great smile, she\u2019s excelling at a really high level,\u201d he said. \u201cThe endorsement side could be worth millions to her, as much as $10 to $15 million per year.\u201dAt different times, I heard Ledecky\u2019s coach, Bruce Gemmell, say that she was going to be a performer \u201cin NBC\u2019s billion-dollar reality show,\u201d referring to the network\u2019s telecasts from Rio. It was said with an edge. Her parents and coach well understand, of course, why she matters to NBC and the vast commercial enterprise of the Games. The network\u2019s cameras gravitate to American winners, and she is the surest bet. Phelps, now 31, is back in the water after a brief retirement and then a suspension after a second arrest on D.U.I. charges, but he will be entered in fewer events than he raced in his prime \u2014 and he won\u2019t be a solid favorite in any of them. The American swim team, both the men and the women, looks weaker than it has in past Olympiads, based on the times in Omaha; swimmers like Ryan Lochte and Missy Franklin, who starred in past Summer Games, will most likely have to improve their times to compete for gold. Ledecky won three events in Omaha \u2014 the 200 freestyle, in which she is likely to be challenged by the Italian star Federica Pellegrini for gold, and the 400 and 800 frees, in which she looks untouchable. She could also win medals in the 4-by-200 freestyle relay and, if coaches place her in it, the 4-by-100 relay.Her parents zealously protect her time and have rejected requests from the late-night shows \u2014 and even NBC Sports and USA Swimming \u2014 when they felt it would interfere with her preparation. They attend almost all her meets and will be in Rio, but they avoid attention. Her father often sits in corners of arenas where the TV cameras won\u2019t find him. \u201cYou can sit there stoically while she\u2019s swimming or jump up and down,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like an idiot one way or the other.\u201d The family discussed whether she should turn pro, but it was never seriously considered, they say, nor did they really endeavor to attach a number to how much money she might be passing up.To turn pro at a young age means separating from peers who have gone off to college and instead joining a training group of other professional swimmers, all of them most likely older. There is a risk that an already difficult sport will become a lonely one too. Ledecky is aware, as well, that several female swimmers who turned professional out of high school have experienced steep declines in their performance. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really tempt me,\u201d Ledecky says. \u201cNobody ever told me, \u2018You\u2019ll get this certain amount of money if you go pro.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what it would be, but it\u2019s not something that bothers me.\u201dThe decision that Ledecky made was one she could make. The youngest of two children, she has grown up in a fair degree of comfort. Her father is a lawyer, and her mother, Mary Gen, a former college swimmer, worked as a hospital administrator, and they now spend much of their time shuttling their daughter to and from practices. Her older brother graduated from Harvard in May. An uncle, Jonathan Ledecky, is a venture capitalist and co-majority owner of the New York Islanders. Ledecky is an excellent student, and whenever she puts swimming behind her, she should have a Stanford degree to add to what will, in all likelihood, be a display case full of Olympic gold medals.But there is also the possibility that we are just at the beginning of her reign. Four years ago, Ledecky was the youngest swimmer, male or female, on the American team in London. She will be the youngest again in Rio. And four years from now, at the Summer Games in Tokyo, she will be just 23 and probably still in her prime.She has said that after this summer, she will probably put more work into the shorter races, including the 100, which she did not qualify for at the trials in Omaha. She could start competing in the 400 individual medley, which combines all four competitive strokes (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle); she ranks among the top Americans in the event even though it has been an afterthought for her. But to continue setting new world records in the distance events, she may need something that\u2019s out of her control \u2014 real competitors.No other woman has ever come within seven seconds of her top time in the 800 freestyle; in the 1,500, the gap is a ridiculous 13 seconds. At the Olympic trials, Leah Smith, an emerging middle-distance swimmer, came within two seconds of her in the 400. She said she was excited because, in her races against Ledecky, \u201cI had never been able to see her feet before.\u201dRowdy Gaines, the longtime commentator on NBC\u2019s swim telecasts and himself an Olympic gold medalist, told me that Ledecky is already the most dominant swimmer he has seen in his four decades in the sport, even more so than Phelps. \u201cMichael had rivals, swimmers who could stay at least somewhat close to him,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Katie\u2019s best events, she has none. To be fair, they are longer races. But she\u2019s swimming them by herself.\u201dMichael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine.Photographs by Erik Madigan Heck. As told to Jaime Lowe.Allyson Felix (bottom), 30, Track and FieldMedals: Gold, 200 meters, 4x100-meter relay, 4x400-meter relay (2012), 4x400-meter relay (2008); silver, 200 meters (2008), 200 meters (2004)I compete in a sport that is decided by one one-hundredth of a second. It\u2019s difficult to be in a sport that measures you that way. Joanna was very transparent about what it took to get the gold medal. She was always going above what the standard was; I saw that, no matter what, I always have to push harder. When I run, I don\u2019t notice anything: It\u2019s just me and the track and nothing else. I\u2019m there to do a job. I know that anything less than winning a gold medal is failure.Medals: Gold, 100-meter hurdles (2004)Allyson is very different than anyone I\u2019ve ever met on the track. She was born with a gift that is unlike any I have ever seen \u2014 it\u2019s effortless. She\u2019s a gazelle when she runs: She just opens up these long legs and goes. I get bored when I just run. When I was younger, I thought hurdling was completely crazy. You fall all the time! I clipped three hurdles in a race in Athens, but I was able to keep going. It\u2019s just like in life: Make the right choice, don\u2019t mess this up.Simone Biles (right), 19, GymnasticsThese are her first Olympic Games.Dominique said, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone make the decision for you,\u201d when I was choosing between college and the Olympics. She emphasized that the decision was mine. The hardest part for me is knowing how mentally prepared I have to be. I overthink things sometimes. I want to go out there and have fun.The hardest on the floor is the double layout, full out. At first, I felt like I was stuck in the air and gravity was like, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m about to slam you right now.\u201d Now, I don\u2019t think about what I\u2019m doing \u2014 I have full control over everything, even in the air. We feel like we\u2019re flying, but flying with total control.Dominique Moceanu, 34, GymnasticsMedals: Gold, team competition (1996)Simone is a one-of-a-kind gymnast. She\u2019s a little powerhouse, she has fun and she loves the sport \u2014 she gets to be herself out there. She could come away as the first U.S. woman gymnast who wins more than two gold medals; she could win four or five, which is unheard-of. I couldn\u2019t go to my opening ceremonies because our coaches wouldn\u2019t let us. They were worried about us standing for over four hours, but we were in the best shape in our lives! I understand that they want you to be rested, but it should be a choice for the athletes. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ever going to go to another Olympics.David Boudia, 27, DivingMedals: Gold, 10-meter platform (2012); bronze,synchronized 10-meter platform (2012)I wanted to be Apolo and dominate the sport. In both of our sports, one wrong move could be the end of the competition, or even the end of a career. When I started really diving, I was so fearful \u2014 I was basically jumping off a three-story building. I was afraid of the height, but when I dug deeper, I realized it was a fear of not being in control of everything. I had to let go and just let my training do the work. When you look at short-track speed skating, you\u2019re gliding around the track with these effortless movements, and that\u2019s what diving is, too.Apolo Ohno, 34, Short-track Speed SkatingMedals: Gold, 1,500 meters (2002), 500 meters (2006); silver, 1,000 meters (2002), 1,500 meters (2010); bronze, 1,000 meters, 5,000-meter relay (2006), 1,000 meters, 5,000-meter relay (2010)Imagine training eight or 12 years for a moment \u2014 40 seconds \u2014 that defines who you are as an athlete and as a person for years to come. To this day, I think I have never skated a perfect lap. It\u2019ll look perfect, but deep down, I always want to be more, I want to be better, better, better. Olympians are these superhero figures trapped in these normal-looking bodies, but once the curtain opens and it\u2019s time to shine, you feel like, This is why I am here on earth, I have this talent and have captured that lightning in a bottle.Kerri Walsh Jennings, 37, Beach VolleyballMedals: Gold (2004, 2008, 2012)I always had the standard male role models \u2014 I\u2019d watch Michael Jordan and think, That\u2019s a rad athlete \u2014 but when Mia came to the forefront on the national soccer team, I was so stoked to find a woman! She had the it factor, and she was everything I aspired to be. I admired her presence. She was so comfortable leading the ship: She rose to every occasion. It wasn\u2019t just fearlessness; it was a knowing belief in herself. I wanted that to translate into my game.Mia Hamm, 44, SoccerMedals: Gold (1996, 2004); silver (2000)It\u2019s completely transformed from where soccer was in \u201996 to where we are now. Now people know who the national team is. I had dreams about medaling, but the actual ceremony topped all of that. I just remember standing up there \u2014 you only get to hear your national anthem if you win, and we wanted to hear our anthem! Standing there with a medal around your neck, screaming at the top of your lungs and being able to look into a stadium full of cheering fans \u2014 it\u2019s amazing.Kayla Harrison, 26, JudoMedals: Gold, 78-kilogram division (2012)Jimmy\u2019s been my hero since I was 6 years old. I didn\u2019t have a lot of American athletes to look up to, and he was the most decorated judo athlete at the time. I met him when I was 9, and he signed a poster and my uniform and I thought, Someday I want to be as good as him.When I was 16, my first coach was arrested for sexually abusing me. I ended up in Jimmy\u2019s office, crying. I remember him looking at me and saying that what happened was wrong and that I needed to heal. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it, but he and his father saved my life.Jimmy Pedro, 45, JudoMedals: Bronze, 73-kilogram division (1996), 73-kilogram division (2004)When Kayla first came to us, she was completely broken down, completely torn apart. She didn\u2019t want to do judo, but it was the only thing she knew. Her parents basically said: Please rebuild this girl. We got her psychological assistance; judo was secondary. We got her around people who are positive, people with similar goals. We got her enrolled in high school, we gave her a job. She trained with Ronda Rousey, and it became her normal.As a coach, you always want your athletes to surpass what you did. That was my father\u2019s mentality too, when I went to the Olympics \u2014 I fulfilled his dream. When I was a young kid, my father was a huge fan of the Olympics. I watched every Olympic Games on the TV. Carl Lewis and Nadia Comaneci and Bruce Jenner \u2014 I was trying to be like them.Erik Madigan Heck is a photographer based in New York.

In December 2014, shortly after Boston submitted its bid, the International Olympics Committee announced its \u201cAgenda 2020,\u201d a suite of reforms aimed at making the Games more affordable and sustainable and thus more accessible to smaller cities. It was an acknowledgment of criticism, following excesses like Beijing\u2019s starchitecture-studded 2008 spectacle, that the Olympics had become a showy indulgence for a handful of deep-coffered world cities and a boondoggle for everyone else.Boston, which was proposing a temporary stadium and a walkable footprint for the Games, seemed an ideal showpiece for this new direction. Dempsey had read in news reports that the I.O.C., which had not staged a summer Games in America since Atlanta in 1996, was eager to return to the United States. And the East Coast was one of the most lucrative time zones in the world for live broadcasts.Dempsey also understood what Boston\u2019s Olympics boosters thought the city would get out of the deal. In the vision they laid out to the city, the Games \u2014 or, more specifically, the billions in private funding promised by Boston\u2019s Olympic organizing committee \u2014 could provide the city with a cash infusion, and the infrastructure investments could help Boston make headway on its most intractable problems: worsening economic inequality, a lack of affordable housing and a crumbling public-transit system with an estimated $7 billion repair bill. Rather than leaving behind an architectural legacy of crumbling eyesores, as the Olympics infamously had elsewhere, the Boston Games would contribute to the permanent redevelopment of the city: the down-at-the-heels industrial district slated to host the temporary stadium would be reborn as a whole new mixed-income neighborhood called Midtown, and the Olympic Village would be transformed into housing for college students and senior citizens, among other things. It was a chance for one of America\u2019s most innovative and creative cities to reinvent itself and perhaps reinvent the Olympics in the process.But the more Dempsey thought about it, the less sense it all made. \u201cYou will be pulling time and attention away from education and housing and putting it into questions like \u2018Where does the velodrome go? Who\u2019s paying for it?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was very clear to me that if 2024 won, for a number of years leading up to 2024, the single biggest issue was going to be 2024.\u201d Dempsey found an ally in his friend Liam Kerr, the state director for Democrats for Education Reform. The two vowed to derail Boston\u2019s bid as quickly as possible. With little more than a Twitter account, a website and a PowerPoint presentation they threw together in a couple of weeks, they started an organization whose name spoke for itself: No Boston Olympics.The Olympics are often sold as a kind of gold medal for the world\u2019s brightest cities. They are seen as an opportunity to shine on the world stage and a financial prize to be reaped: hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket revenue, plus billions in long-term economic development, all wrapped in a gleaming two-week-long pageant of international good will. But they are also an incredibly risky investment. Cities are forced to sign agreements promising extraordinary fiscal and regulatory power to Olympic organizers and to pick up the tab if the production goes overbudget, which it often does.Few cities have taken these lessons quite as much to heart as Boston, whose residents, led by Dempsey and Kerr\u2019s unexpected rebellion, shocked city leaders and the United States Olympic Committee last year by rejecting the proposal to host the 2024 Games, after a protracted and very public fight that the chief executive of the U.S.O.C., Scott Blackmun, would later call \u201cthe most unsettling and challenging time in my professional life.\u201d The defeat was all the more stunning because the Boston bid epitomized, for Olympics supporters inside and outside the city, a blueprint for a smarter, more impact-conscious Games. Instead, it became a referendum on the Olympics\u2019 ability to wreak political and fiscal havoc.Among them was Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. Zimbalist had stumbled into writing about the economics of baseball at the suggestion of his young son, and he began scrutinizing the deals that cities cut with baseball teams to build new stadiums. In 2003, Zimbalist was asked by the chairman of the Shubert Organization, Broadway\u2019s largest theater owner and operator, to take a look at the impact of New York\u2019s bid for the 2012 Olympics, which piqued his interest in the Games. In his book \u201cCircus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup,\u201d published amid the debate over Boston\u2019s proposal, Zimbalist dismantled the prevailing arguments that the Olympics led to long-term financial growth.The Olympics promised economic benefits to all, but in fact, Zimbalist wrote, the beneficiaries are usually few: construction companies, trade unions, architectural firms, investment banks and insurance companies. In other words, the winners just happen to be the same sorts of entities that often support Olympic bids in their cities. You might assume the hospitality industry would benefit, but studies showed it usually didn\u2019t. The direct tourism benefits of the Games were often more than offset with losses caused by congestion, elevated prices and security concerns.Zimbalist dissected the various costs of the Games and found that claims of budget surpluses were often built on hidden government subsidies. He argued that hosting the Olympics often increased inequality, because public housing was frequently demolished to make way for new venues. He found no evidence to suggest that hosting the Olympics helped cities attract new foreign investment.In fact, in the not-so-distant past, before the myth of the Olympics\u2019 economic benefits had taken hold, the Games were seen by many cities as a bad bet. When the I.O.C. went looking for a host city for the 1984 Games, it found virtually no takers; the memories of Munich 1972 (the Palestinian terrorist attack) and Montreal 1976 (a financial disaster that would leave the city in debt for 30 years) were too fresh. Los Angeles finally broke the losing streak in 1984, hosting a turmoil-free Games and turning a nominal profit, but this was partly because the city had more pre-existing sports infrastructure than others did and partly because, as the only city willing to host the Games, it was able to cut a better deal with the I.O.C., which waived its customary demand that the host city pay for any cost overruns and revenue shortfalls. Los Angeles was the exception, not the rule.Los Angeles might have been the exception, rather than the rule, but it nevertheless bolstered the dream of a profitable Olympics. For a couple of decades, the world\u2019s great cities competed vigorously for the honor of hosting the games. In recent years, however, reluctance has once again crept in. Four of the six cities initially bidding for the 2022 Olympics in 2013 and 2014 eventually pulled out of the running.The Boston Games, boosters argued, would be smaller, more sustainable and more transparent in their planning than past Olympics. But from the beginning, the process seemed suspiciously tight-lipped. Under pressure from the U.S.O.C. to keep details of the bid secret, Boston 2024 failed to reach out to community partners until it was too late, and its own disclosures were outflanked by details uncovered through public-records requests by sleuthing newspaper columnists and citizen journalists. In November 2014, it was revealed that Boston 2024\u2019s plans included taking over Franklin Park in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood, the crown jewel in the city\u2019s Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Emerald Necklace, an idea about which the boosters had not yet consulted the public-private partnership that helped manage the park. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got really scared,\u201d John Ruch, then the editor of The Jamaica Plain Gazette, says. \u201cI started to panic.\u201d He published a scathing editorial railing against Boston 2024 as a \u201csecretive, private committee of tycoons and special interests,\u201d then called for residents to organize to oppose it. Within 12 hours, they did.Ruch expected resistance to the Olympics would come from baby boomers weaned on the transportation fights of the 1960s and \u201970s. Instead, the movement Ruch inspired \u2014 an eventual ad hoc, grass-roots ally to Dempsey\u2019s and Kerr\u2019s No Boston Olympics, called No Boston 2024 \u2014 was organized by younger activists who had been involved with the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter and the A.C.L.U. Within three days they held a public meeting in a church, an event notable enough that Boston 2024 sent a delegation including Doug Rubin, the state\u2019s most-celebrated political strategist, who had recently helped put Elizabeth Warren in the Senate.In truth, Bostonians were lukewarm about the Olympics from the beginning. Support for the Games peaked in January 2015, just after Boston was named the U.S.O.C.\u2019s bid city, with polls showing 51 to 55 percent of those surveyed in the greater Boston area in favor. By contrast, 67 percent of New Yorkers initially supported hosting the 2012 Games. When Chicago was competing for the 2016 Games, support reached 75 percent but plunged below 50 percent when the city admitted it, like Boston, would have to sign a taxpayer guarantee.Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, insisted that polls would show that the majority of people were excited about the Games. But the polls instead showed lukewarm support. Steve Koczela, president of the MassInc Polling Group, who conducted surveys throughout the campaign, says that \u201cwhat happened was, the more people learned about it, the more they thought they would be on the hook to pay for it.\u201d By March, approval numbers bottomed out at just 36 percent. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re competing against cities and countries where 75 or 80 or 90 percent want the Olympics,\u201d Koczela told me, \u201cthat\u2019s not good enough.\u201dBy spring, the bungled bid rollout, the sagging poll numbers and a series of contentious public meetings had Boston 2024 playing defense. In May, Boston 2024\u2019s leader, John Fish, one of the city\u2019s most powerful businessmen, stepped down from day-to-day leadership of the bid. \u201cDemocracy can be very messy,\u201d he says today. \u201cAnd I think it got a little more messy than I thought it would.\u201d Boston 2024 prepared a last-ditch attempt to salvage Boston\u2019s bid, starting a belated effort to incorporate community feedback into the plan for the Games. But state officials had grown wary of what the state\u2019s secretary of transportation called, in an email to the governor\u2019s chief of staff, \u201cprojected costs ... based solely on \u2018back of the envelope\u2019 calculations\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous\u201d claims about where the money would come from. An independent report financed by the state would later conclude that Boston 2024 underestimated costs by as much as $970 million, while overstating likely revenue by more than $300 million.On a Monday in July 2015, Walsh strode to the lectern at a hastily convened news conference to say the city was pulling its support for the bid. But by then, the plan was essentially dead already. The U.S.O.C. turned its attention to Los Angeles, which remains a contender. (The host city will be announced next year.) Boston 2024 reportedly ended its campaign facing more than $4 million in debt.Today, Fish says he takes full responsibility for the loss. He concedes that his group should have taken the time, immediately after Boston was announced as the U.S.O.C.\u2019s bid city, to educate residents, gather feedback and incorporate public sentiment into the bid. \u201cIf we did it all over again, I think we\u2019d win,\u201d he said, \u201cand if someone asked me to do it all over again, I would absolutely do it all over again.\u201d But opponents insist the deal wouldn\u2019t have gotten any better. \u201cIt was not a plan that got screwed up,\u201d Ruch told me. \u201cIt was a scam that got exposed.\u201dFor the I.O.C., the Boston bid laid bare a paradox. The organization\u2019s Agenda 2020 might have argued for leaner, less-extravagant Games that wouldn\u2019t force smaller cities to take on untenable financial risk. But as the state-financed report suggests, the only truly foolproof way of mitigating the cost and risk of the Games would be to create permanent sites for the Winter and Summer Olympics to which the Games would return every four years. The next best thing would be returning the Games to a megacity that has already invested in the infrastructure needed to support them. What Boston demonstrated was that the twin dreams of making Olympics hosting more egalitarian and more affordable may ultimately not be reconcilable.Dempsey and his No Boston Olympics colleague Kelley Gossett flew to Hamburg, Germany, last October, to advise a group opposing an effort to bring the 2024 Games there. In November, Hamburg residents voted to withdraw the city\u2019s bid. \u201cI like to think that the I.O.C. has a lot to learn from what happened in Boston,\u201d Dempsey told me, \u201ceven if they are too proud to admit it.\u201dCarly Carioli is a Boston-based contributing editor at Politico Magazine.by The New York Times MagazineMEXICO CITY, 1968DICK FOSBURY OUTSMARTS THE HIGH JUMPBy Tom WhymanAs with any child, for me a large part of the joy of reading and thinking about sports was imagining that I myself might someday enjoy real sporting success. But I knew, having the sort of body that I did \u2014 overweight, flailing, racked by nervous tics \u2014 that I would never be able to enjoy this sort of success on the usual terms. Instead, I dreamed of finding some trick or innovation that would place me not just on everybody else\u2019s level, but above it: a new way of keeping goal in soccer, a new way of bowling a cricket ball.Really, I dreamed of being like Dick Fosbury.When he was growing up, in the 1950s and \u201960s, Dick Fosbury was a pretty mediocre athlete as well. He was a high jumper, but only after he failed to make it onto his school\u2019s football and basketball teams. And even when he started practicing the high jump seriously, in college, he still wasn\u2019t especially good at it. Using the standard techniques of the time, Fosbury was only able to clear a height of 5 feet 4 inches \u2014 well below anything like an Olympic standard.This all changed when Fosbury found his innovation. For whatever reason, Fosbury started leaping over the bar by pushing himself up back first, a bizarre technique that necessitated landing on his neck, looking every bit like a corpse being pushed out of a window. Coaches were skeptical, particularly about the technique\u2019s safety, but it worked: Fosbury instantly improved his personal best by six inches, and the \u201cFosbury Flop\u201d was born. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Fosbury definitively proved the superiority of his unorthodox method when, as an unheralded outsider, he used it to flop not only to the high-jump gold medal but to an Olympic record.The Fosbury Flop has since become the standard high-jump technique. But it retains, I think, an essential strangeness. Watching the high jumpers flop over the bar back first, I am fascinated by the fact that it would ever occur to someone to do that in the first place; it seems to run contrary to all the logic of the human body. And yet it is, objectively, the best way of jumping over a high bar that we know of. Fosbury discovered that, and what\u2019s more, he convinced the world of its correctness.The Olympics ostensibly celebrate human excellence. But all too often, what this means is extreme displays of mere human competence: We witness men and women who have spent their whole lives training to be the best in a particular discipline as it is traditionally practiced and as they have been coached. They are supposed to do some single thing that they have been told to do, exceptionally well, within the limits of the rules, so there is little room in their performances for creativity, innovation or cunning. But an athlete like Fosbury can give Olympic performance a twist \u2014 and the spontaneity of real art.SEOUL, 1988CARL LEWIS IS OUTRUNBy Carvell WallaceA funny thing happens when a hero stumbles: The qualities that made him great in the first place are instantly recast as the character defects that brought on his downfall. With that 1988 loss, Lewis was suddenly deemed too garish, too full of himself. The beauty and confidence we embraced four years earlier turned into categorical proof that Lewis lacked rigor, that a quiet, hardworking man from the cold north could simply outmuscle the spoiled American.If only it were that simple. Two days after the race, Johnson was informed that he had failed a doping test. The next day, the I.O.C. stripped him of his medal and declared Lewis the true victor. It would later emerge that Lewis himself had tested positive for banned substances during trials. Four of the top five finishers in the 100 that year would fail doping tests at some point in their careers, giving that championship a nickname that has stuck: \u201cthe Dirtiest Race in History.\u201dI was 13 that summer, watching on TV. I had just moved to Los Angeles to live with my mother, who had a lot in common with Lewis: She, too, was intense and exquisite, flamboyant and competitive. She, too, had that particular brand of beauty that can make you feel intimidated by someone at the same time you are irrefutably drawn to them. In my early years, when she and I were a nation\u2019s distance away from each other, she was only a dream to me, a promise of family and home; if I could just be with her again, everything would be wonderful. But in the summer of \u201988, our real life in Los Angeles was hot and severe. Eviction and homelessness threatened. I had discovered skateboarding and cursing in secret and drinking gin from a plastic bottle. I had discovered the freedom of leaving our small apartment to ride the bus through endless city blocks, watching the world from behind a graffiti-scrawled window.I had visited my mother in Los Angeles for the first time the summer of 1984. She lived in a studio apartment just four miles from the Olympic stadium where Carl Lewis was dominating men\u2019s track and field. His power seemed to inhabit the city: It was in the way the announcers talked about him, the way the cameras followed his every move, as if his most mundane gestures held the secret to otherworldly strength. It was in the prideful way my mother said his name, smiling and laughing, clapping her hands as though \u201cCarl Lewis\u201d were the most important words in a favorite hymn. That summer was the golden one, with my mother by my side and Carl Lewis forever on the victory podium.But by 1988, that was already a long time ago, a thin and indiscernible vapor of reverie. Growing up is a series of dreams evaporating; the reality is always more wearisome and less dignified than you had hoped. Carl Lewis lost in 1988. He went on to lose in other ways too: a bungled run for office, a notoriously botched attempt at the national anthem at a 1993 N.B.A. game. Each defeat felt personal. I wanted Lewis to be as great forever as he was in the summer of \u201984. I wanted whatever hope I had \u2014 for him, for my mother, for myself \u2014 to continue in a straight line until the end of time. But after he lost, nothing was the same. Nothing ever is.Carvell Wallace is a writer living in Oakland, Calif.LILLEHAMMER, 1994.TONYA HARDING AND NANCY KERRIGAN FACE OFF ON ICEBy Taffy Brodesser-AknerThe story most of us know is that in 1994, Kerrigan, an Olympic favorite for figure-skating gold, was kneecapped after a practice by a man she didn\u2019t recognize. A thing people often don\u2019t know is that it was never quite proved that Harding was responsible. It was her ex-husband and bodyguard who hatched the plot. Harding herself claims that she didn\u2019t know about it until after the attack, and she was never convicted of anything other than conspiracy to hinder prosecution, for not immediately telling authorities what she knew.At first, Harding represented all that I disliked about the Olympics. In 1991, when she became the first American to complete a triple axel in competition, she couldn\u2019t hold in her joy: She made a whooping face and tightened her fists into little balls of achievement right there on the ice, and I teared up even though I didn\u2019t want to. Thankfully, she also contained the essential ingredients for \u201990s-era tabloid scandal. She looked mean, with her narrow eyes and turned-up nose (a literal one, not a metaphorical one) and, despite being from Oregon, her fluffy Long Island bangs.And in her supposed greed and malevolence, she manifested the evil that lurks in the hearts of every second-placer, every understudy \u2014 an evil that the perpetual first-placers don\u2019t even realize they share (but do, or will the moment their luck turns). More than anything, she wanted to win. I have long been drawn to extreme cases of American exceptionalism, which, by my definition, involves people being willing to carry out actual crimes to achieve their American happiness, like a good job or a house in the suburbs or a gold medal at the Olympics.It got even better: Kerrigan still competed, but achieved silver to Oksana Baiul\u2019s gold. Harding had a shoelace malfunction and came in eighth. Kerrigan could be heard on a live microphone being unkind about Baiul\u2019s victorious weeping. Later, she claimed death threats prevented her from attending the closing ceremony, though some speculated that she left early to appear at a parade at Disney World, because Disney was one of her sponsors. The humanity! This I could watch.Having a scandal this tawdry brought a democracy to the Olympics that hadn\u2019t previously been there. America is made up of all kinds; the Olympics, less so. And if you are someone with a taste for the ugly or a taste for scandal, the Olympics so often leave you with something akin to self-loathing. That year, people like me, with dark hearts and what my mother calls \u201clow taste\u201d \u2014 we exist in droves, I\u2019m afraid \u2014 briefly understood why the rest of you enjoy this so very much.Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a contributing writer for the magazine.MEXICO CITY, 1968JOHN CARLOS AND TOMMIE SMITH RAISE THEIR FISTSBy Jacqueline WoodsonI knew that all these people \u2014 and a man named Malcolm X and a woman named Shirley Chisholm \u2014 had some connection to what I was beginning to understand as \u201cour people\u201d and \u201cour power.\u201d I knew that I was supposed to be proud to be black and that this pride was supposed to be a part of something larger and greater. I knew that my cornrows, as painful as they\u2019d been to style, were as much a part of that pride as the dashikis and Afros.Even as I took all of this in, the furry haze of being 5 kept me from making sense of it. And in the midst of this haze, two African-American men, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, having just won the gold and bronze medals in the men\u2019s 200-meter dash at the 1968 Olympics, climbed onto the medaling stands in Mexico City, lowered their heads and raised their black-gloved fists \u2014 to which the world just about lost its mind.Those fists traveled from Mexico City to the corners of every black home in America. So much of the world seemed angry at the audacity of our two new heroes, but the people I loved cheered, slapped each other five, cut articles from the newspaper, crowded around black-and-white screens to watch the moment televised and retelevised. A word I did not know yet \u2014 \u201csolidarity\u201d \u2014 flowed through their conversations.Years later, I would join the Flashettes, a girls\u2019 track team. We would compete against the Atoms; both teams sent Brooklyn girls to the Olympic trials and a few to the Games themselves. I would understand what it meant to \u201ctrial\u201d and to \u201cmedal.\u201d I would run the 200-meter dash in college. I would come to understand that the gesture Smith and Carlos made meant \u201cBlack Power,\u201d yes, but also something greater. It was a homage to the rights of all human beings, paid through the eyes and fists of two African-American champions. But at 5 years old, what I knew was that two of the fastest men in the world had stood and spoken to the people I loved, the boys with their Afro picks, the relatives in dashikis, the grown-ups beaming in the blue light of black-and-white television. And they spoke to me, a child who would one day be the fastest girl on the block but for that moment had simply this: a hand I could curl into a fist and lift high in the air.Jacqueline Woodson is the author of \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming.\u201d Her most recent novel, \u201cAnother Brooklyn,\u201d will be published Aug. 9.ATLANTA, 1996U.S. WOMEN\u2019S BASKETBALL FINDS ITS HEROESBy Jessica LutherWe were there to watch the U.S. women\u2019s team in Olympic competition. This was an epochal moment for women\u2019s basketball: For the first time, the Olympic team was composed of the best postcollegiate basketball players, selected more than a year before the Games. The roster was stacked with players now considered legends: Sheryl Swoopes, Dawn Staley, Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, Jennifer Azzi. They played 52 games, around the world, in preparation for the Atlanta Olympics, and won all 52 of them. This was the team whose popularity helped lead to the American Basketball League and the W.N.B.A. \u2014 which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.The day we attended, Team U.S.A. was still in the early rounds, so we saw them play Zaire, Australia or South Korea; I can\u2019t remember which, but it hardly matters. In the summer of 1996 I was tall, big-bodied, still trying to figure out how to move through a world that didn\u2019t accommodate six-foot-tall teenage girls very well. I had found just one place that did: a basketball court. I played center and forward on my eighth- and ninth-grade teams. I could block and rebound, sometimes without my feet leaving the floor. If I was on the post, I could use my size to make space and get the ball in the hoop. My body, finally, was made for something. People cheered me for it.And in that awkward body that I didn\u2019t yet know how to wear, I watched some of the best female athletes \u2014 women whose bodies looked like mine \u2014 play ball on the Olympic stage. I wasn\u2019t ever good enough to play basketball for much more than fun. But when I look at that photo, I remember how I imagined that the people around me in that stadium, watching those women play, might look over at me and think, \u201cShe\u2019s probably a basketball player too.\u201dJessica Luther is a freelance journalist.

Witt had a knack for dramatic footwork and serious height on her jumps. She wore puffed sleeves and dark lipstick and thick eyeliner. \u201cShe certainly is a beautiful, beautiful lady\u201d \u2014 this was the sort of thing American sportscasters couldn\u2019t resist saying. Liz Manley, meanwhile, had strawberry-blonde hair that she stubbornly styled in a short mom cut; she tended to wear baby blue and hot pink. The American sportscasters\u2019 notes on her were sure to mention that she once had a nervous breakdown and \u201cput on a tremendous amount of weight.\u201d This meant that she tipped the scales at more than 120 pounds when, as a teenager, she was sent off to Lake Placid by herself to train.Canadians muttered to one another about this. Complaining about the anti-Canadian bias in American coverage is an Olympic tradition for us. In the end, though, Manley defied the sportscasters. In the long program, aided by a middling Witt performance and a disastrous one from poor Debi Thomas of the American team, Manley gave the performance of her life. Her jumps took her higher than she\u2019d been accustomed to; every landing was precise, flawless. She won the silver medal and nearly knocked Witt out of the gold. It was a true upset \u2014 a huge triumph for a person who hadn\u2019t been expected to win a thing. Canadians celebrated as though she topped the podium.Americans think this sort of thing is adorable. \u201cSilver \u2014 a.k.a. \u2018Canadian gold,\u2019\u2009\u201d texted one American acquaintance when I tried to explain this to him. This is the joke about us that Americans alone seem to be amused by: that we are, in some essential way, a bit bovine \u2014 soft-eyed and complacent, even in defeat.It seems impossible to explain this to Americans, but not really being expected to win is, typically, the Canadian national position. We are O.K. with this. The jury is still out on whether Justin Trudeau will do anything to alter this situation, though I personally doubt it. The soul of our country prizes solid competence, which is what makes Canada a very nice place to live much of the time. Excellence is an afterthought, a lovely dividend that is not entirely expected. This may mean that we get very few gold medals, but we will always have the particular sort of pride that comes with saying we did our best, nobody lost their head and everything was accomplished with a minimum of self-aggrandizement, megalomania or unrealistic expectations. This is a deeply underrated variety of satisfaction. More countries should try it.Michelle Dean is a writer whose first book, \u201cSharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,\u201d will be published next year.BEIJING, 2008LOLO JONES MEETS THE NINTH HURDLEBy Greg HowardBut on the ninth, her front heel caught the hurdle. She stumbled through it, but the lost momentum left her flailing while the women around her sailed smoothly past. Jones crossed the finish line seventh and then collapsed, her legs buckling beneath the heartbreak.I watched Jones from my dorm room, where I was preparing for my final season as a collegiate soccer player. The game was, for me, a language all its own \u2014 a system of manipulations of the ball with my feet, thighs, chest and head; a way of moving in tandem with 10 other men, navigating through opposing defenses with a glossary of loud whoops, barks and terse shouts. For as long as I could remember, I had expressed myself through soccer, and at 20, I had no sense of self without it.I knew that eighth-hurdle feeling, too, of breaking free. Thirty-four months before watching Jones, during my final high-school soccer game, I outpaced the other team\u2019s defense and surged toward the goal, and for a brief few seconds, everything around me was still, silent. Then the goalkeeper dove for the ball and missed, but took my left knee with him. I didn\u2019t run again for six months.I still harbored what felt to me like modest aspirations: to play professionally, somewhere. So I limped my way onto a college team and busied myself with constructing a redemption story. I fought forward until, eventually, I started negotiating down: If I couldn\u2019t go pro, I would be a college-team starter; if I couldn\u2019t start, I would score; if I couldn\u2019t score, I would at least play. By the end, I bargained down until all I wanted was to return, for one last moment, to that eerie calm, the feeling of striding clear of the surrounding chaos. But I never broke free again, either.I was lucky. I was never close enough to victory to reckon with whether I was actually good enough, and I had an excuse: Whenever someone asked about soccer, I could just point to the scars running along my knee and shrug. But for a brief moment in 2008, yards away from Olympic gold, Lolo Jones was close enough to reckon with the questions that haunt every athlete. Was she good enough? Did she trip, or did she choke?In 2012, she finished fourth in the 100-meter hurdles. Two years after that, she competed in the Sochi Winter Olympics, this time as a bobsledder. Her team finished 11th. It wasn\u2019t until Sochi that I realized Jones had been negotiating down, too: If she couldn\u2019t win an Olympic gold in hurdles, she would win an Olympic medal, period. This year, she tried to prepare for another shot at the hurdles but had to pull out of the Olympic trials in June with a hip injury. Jones says she\u2019ll be back in 2020. She\u2019s bargaining now, as I was. But her moment is past, and I doubt she\u2019ll ever break free again.Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.MELBOURNE, 1956HUNGARY FACES THE U.S.S.R. IN ONE BLOODY WATER-POLO MATCHBy Daniel Duane\u201cYou know, I played against Zador when I was at Cal,\u201d my father liked to say, thinking back to his time at U.C. Berkeley. \u201cHe was an unbelievably dirty player. I always wanted to thank the Russian who punched that bastard.\u201dI first heard the story in 1984, when I was a skinny kid trying to join the popular crowd at Berkeley High School. That crowd revolved around water polo, the most magnificent game that almost nobody cares about. (It rivals football for extreme conditioning, sanctioned violence and technical beauty, but it makes a lousy spectator sport; too much happens underwater.) The team needed a new goalie, and I had long arms, so the popular boys conscripted me. I spent the summer treading water with folding chairs on my head and learning that the phrase \u201cmy father played water polo at Cal\u201d carried a weight in California aquatics culture not unlike the one \u201cmy father played quarterback at Clemson\u201d would carry in the South. My father\u2019s Zador story worked like an anecdote about a collegiate encounter with Peyton Manning.Recently, however, my father decided I should know more. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that Zador business,\u201d he said. \u201cI never actually made varsity, so that must have been a J.V. match. And I remember I had a date that night with a beautiful synchronized swimmer who came to the game, and I was swimming the ball down pool when Zador started pressuring me. I tried to pass the ball to my goalie, but my goalie wasn\u2019t looking, so the ball went into the net.\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201cyou never made varsity?\u201d\u201cOh, Pop.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me Zador ruffled your feathers so bad you scored an own goal in front of your swimmer girl? That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been badmouthing him all these years?\u201dMy father chuckled with embarrassment. \u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was so humiliated that I got completely drunk and, well, there was no second date with that synchronized swimmer.\u201dMy brother-in-law, Mario, offered me a silver lining: \u201cSounds like you ought to thank Zador for your existence.\u201dBut a 2006 documentary called \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fury,\u201d about that famous game, nudged me toward a different interpretation. Zador was Hungary\u2019s enforcer and top-scoring player, arguably the most skilled and physically intimidating player of the era. My father\u2019s encounter with him is best understood by picturing an American J.V. soccer player trying to dribble past Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi and finding himself kicked in the groin, dropped face-first in the mud and somehow guilty of a personal foul that gives Messi a penalty kick to win the game \u2014 a humiliating taste of world-class play and a precious memory nonetheless.Daniel Duane last wrote for the magazine about the rock-climber Alex Honnold.ROME, 1960ABEBE BIKILA RUNS A BAREFOOT MARATHONBy Nitsuh AbebeIt\u2019s hard, these days, for me to picture the Olympics as anything other than a massive and very expensive science experiment, in which a handful of overcompetitive first-world states with spare resources to invest in medal production filter their talented young athletes into research-driven training programs and qualifying competitions, optimizing as many facets as possible of their training, diet, gear, psychology, supplements and elaborate methods of cheating. This isn\u2019t a test of human potential or athletic drive; it\u2019s a test of corporate-organizational prowess, a way for entire nations to play with their citizenry the way kids play with favorite action figures. And this is before we reach the Winter Olympics, where even that challenge falls away and all that\u2019s left is a handful of nations awarding themselves medals for being good at bizarrely specialized feats that most humans on the planet wouldn\u2019t ever have reason to even contemplate trying, let alone building the elaborate tools and tracks and apparatuses involved.Once these uncharitable killjoy thoughts have entered your mind, there are moments when the individual stories of pluck and devotion and odds-overcoming that go into athletes\u2019 Olympic biographies begin to seem almost sad, like imagining one gear in a cuckoo clock having dramatic emotions about its struggle to turn the next one. You start to wonder: Why leave anything to chance? Why not get it over with and choreograph the whole thing as art? Bring on the screenwriters; let them give us an Abebe Bikila for every week of coverage.Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.LOS ANGELES, 1984LIONEL RICHIE OVERSEES the CLOSING CEREMONyBy Wesley MorrisWhat a live entertainer too. There\u2019s nothing pyrotechnic about Richie\u2019s voice, but he was a star in an era when a singer was expected to be able to sing. So it was like a dream watching him belt while strutting around the floor of a darkened L.A. Coliseum, seemingly lit by only his immaculate white pants and the sparkle of sequins on his amazingly tailored jacket. The production got busier as the dancers pooled around him. Soon Richie was just a snarling voice in wide shots of pageantry.It was the first time I saw anybody take that kind of dancing seriously. Here was this city presenting a version of its streets to the world, saying, \u201cThis is who we think we could be.\u201d Any kid who has ever fought with an adult about what good culture is seeks this kind of vindication. Breakdancing isn\u2019t dancing? Well, here, Mr. Adult, is your friend, the former Commodore, Lionel Richie, begging to differ. The production crew could barely keep up with the guys doing head spins and windmills, the ladies doing two-steps. And through it all, Richie looked and sounded time-of-his-life happy to have whipped up this kind of new American chaos. It was a fantasy of a Los Angeles whose multiculti exuberance he made you believe really would play on, play on, play on.Wesley Morris is the critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.By Sam AndersonWhat gives the Olympics its special, precise energy is the tension among all of these orders of time: Everything hinges on a crucial millisecond during the two weeks that we waited for four years (and several millenniums) to see. The Olympics are a global pageant of time swirls, a tiny window that opens, at regular intervals, onto eternity.The face staring out of that window is always the same: Bob Costas. He has presided over the Olympics for so long, nearly 30 years, that he may as well have broadcast the first ceremony from ancient Greece. Although Costas is not particularly athletic-seeming, he has outlasted all the athletes. In his mid-60s, he remains the same boyish, affable elf that he was in the beginning. He is blessed with the American ability to seem perpetually fresh out of the box.In 2014, when a wretched eye infection temporarily knocked Costas out of hosting the Winter Olympics, it felt like seeing George Washington catch a cold and start sneezing on Mount Rushmore. We didn\u2019t know he could do that, didn\u2019t know he had the flesh and glands and fluids. His replacements \u2014 Matt Lauer, Meredith Vieira \u2014 did fine; they are pros. But they didn\u2019t carry the same existential gravitas, the sense of having been flung out of the Big Bang and directly into the host\u2019s chair.In recent months, Costas has spoken of his eventual retirement, of NBC\u2019s succession plan, but it all seems entirely hypothetical, like when astrophysicists talk about the inevitable implosion of the sun: It will happen in a time beyond time, past the reach of mere eons and weeks and milliseconds and years.Sam Anderson is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nuclear Subsidies Are Key Part of New York\u2019s Clean-Energy Plan", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe blueprint for New York State\u2019s lofty clean-energy goals relies on the technologies of the future: The state, officials have promised, will draw half of its electricity from renewable and clean energy sources like wind and solar power by 2030.But as the plan takes shape at the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, talk of still-young technologies has been overshadowed by something of a throwback: the state\u2019s aging nuclear power plants.The subsidy is likely to grow into the multibillion-dollar range over the 12-year period proposed by the state, a sum that has caused watchdogs to question whether the state is about to approve a major industry bailout with minimal public scrutiny \u2014 even though it is the public\u2019s utility bills that will grow.Though the commission outlined the plan in January, saying that the subsidy could cost anywhere from $59 million to $658 million by 2023, not until 10 days before the deadline for public comments did it disclose that the actual amount would be closer to $1 billion over the first two years. (The commission pushed the deadline back another week, to Friday, after a minor outcry, while maintaining that it had offered plenty of time and information.)From the state\u2019s perspective, the subsidies are not simply handouts, but a way of putting a dollar value on the benefits of a reliable carbon-free power source. Propping them up for now, supporters say, will give the state time to foster a stable mix of renewable energy sources.The plants accounted for about a third of the power New York generated last year, as well as more than half of its emissions-free energy.\u201cNuclear has a role,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference, framing it as a matter of using the tools available. \u201cUnless we\u2019re willing to go back to candles, which would be uncomfortable and inconvenient, we need energy generation.\u201dExelon Corporation would stand to benefit the most from the plan; It owns two of the three upstate plants, and is in talks to buy the third, the FitzPatrick nuclear power plant in Oswego. Exelon has spent at least $426,000 on lobbying over the past two years, according to state records.\u201cWith very little process, and very little time for the public to even know this is happening, what they\u2019re proposing here is a multibillion-dollar uncompetitive subsidy to one company,\u201d said Jessica Azulay, a spokeswoman for the Alliance for a Green Economy, an environmentalist group.The alliance has calculated the total cost over 12 years as more than $7.6 billion.James Denn, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, dismissed that estimate, saying that if wholesale energy prices rise, as they are forecast to do, customers will ultimately pay less in subsidies.If the nuclear plants closed, he added, energy prices would increase, forcing customers to pay more than three times what they would pay for subsidies. He also said the subsidies would return about $5 billion in benefits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Doig Says He Didn\u2019t Paint This. Now He Has to Prove It.", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported bySo when Mr. Doig, whose eerie, magical landscapes have made him one of the world\u2019s most popular artists, was sent a photograph of a canvas he said he didn\u2019t recognize, he disavowed it.\u201cI said, \u2018Nice painting,\u2019\u201d he recalled in an interview. \u201c\u2018Not by me.\u2019\u201dThe owner, however, disagreed and sued him, setting up one of the stranger art authentication cases in recent history.The owner, a former corrections officer who said he knew Mr. Doig while working in a Canadian detention facility, said the famous painter indeed created the work as a youthful inmate there. His suit contends that Mr. Doig is either confused or lying and that his denials blew up a plan to sell the work for millions of dollars.But Mr. Doig, 57, has compelling evidence he was never near the facility, the Thunder Bay Correctional Center, about 15 hours north of Toronto.\u201cThis case is a scam, and I\u2019m being forced to jump through hoops to prove my whereabouts over 40 years ago,\u201d he said.To Mr. Doig\u2019s surprise, though \u2014 and the astonishment of others in the art world \u2014 a federal judge in Chicago has set the case for trial next month at United States District Court for Northern Illinois.Art law experts say they can\u2019t recall anything like it, certainly not for a major artist like Mr. Doig.\u201cTo have to disprove that you created a work seems somehow wrong and not fair,\u201d said Amy M. Adler, a professor at New York University Law School.The stakes are high as well. A Doig painting has sold for more than $25 million. Other works have routinely sold at auction for as much as $10 million. The plaintiffs, who include the correction officer and the art dealer who agreed to help him sell the work, are suing the painter for at least $5 million in damages and seek a court declaration that it is authentic.They have focused on what they say is a hole in Mr. Doig\u2019s teenage years in Canada when, they assert, he cannot fully account for where he was or what he was doing.\u201cEvery artist has destroyed work,\u201d said William F. Zieske, the lawyer for the painting\u2019s owner and the art dealer. \u201cWe can\u2019t really get into his mind and say why he looked at this painting and said, \u2018I am not going to own that.\u2019 I don\u2019t think anyone can.\u201dDisputes about authenticity, a vexatious topic in the art world, tend to center on the works of dead artists. Legal claims, when they arise, are usually made against experts who have doubted the art\u2019s veracity, and not against the artist.But Mr. Doig is not the first artist to deny having created a work and still be challenged.Neither man, however, was sued for rejecting the work.In her defense, Ms. Noland invoked a 1990 law called the Visual Artists Rights Act. It gives artists powers to, among other things, prevent their names from being used on works that have been mutilated or distorted.The retired corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, 62, said he bought the painting for $100 from a man named Pete Doige (spelled with an e), whom he met in 1975 in Thunder Bay, Ontario.The young man he knew was taking art classes at a local college, Lakehead University, and said he was, like Mr. Doig, from Scotland. After the man was incarcerated on an LSD charge at a prison farm where Mr. Fletcher worked, Mr. Fletcher saw the young artist create the painting, an untitled acrylic canvas of a rocky desert scene.The painting is signed \u201cPete Doige 76.\u201d\u201cI am 100 percent convinced that this is the man and that this is the painting I own,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said in an interview. He became the young man\u2019s parole officer and also helped him find a job through the Seafarers International Union. He said he bought the painting because he feared Mr. Doige might go back to selling drugs.About five years ago, a friend noticed the painting on Mr. Fletcher\u2019s wall and told him it was by a famous artist. When Mr. Fletcher pulled up a video and watched Mr. Doig speaking at a college, he said, he recognized his facial expressions and mannerisms, and now feels let down by someone he believes he helped, and wants to be proved right.Mr. Fletcher, who lives in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, consigned it to a gallery in Chicago on the recommendation of his brother, who lives there. The gallery, run by Peter Bartlow, contacted an auctioneer, hoping no doubt for a payday similar to those achieved by several recent Doig sales.Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Bartlow said the painting contains many similarities to Mr. Doig\u2019s undisputed works, such as a horizontal striped landscape, a body of water, logs protruding from a lake, even white lichen on the trees.A Sotheby\u2019s specialist, to whom they sent an image of the picture, said it was \u201crare to see such a complete and highly resolved early painting by Doig\u201d and said it had Mr. Doig\u2019s \u201ctrademark eeriness of the empty landscape,\u201d though she later said she never inspected it firsthand and did not authenticate it, according to court papers.\u201cThere are so many of defendant Doig\u2019s commonly used techniques and elements in the disputed work that it could be the most typical of all of his works,\u201d Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Bartlow say in court papers.Mr. Doig, however, said they are taking advantage of the similarity in two people\u2019s names so as to profit from a far-fetched tale.Yes, he grew up in Canada before attending art school in England. But in 1976 he was only 16 or 17, and lived in Toronto. He has never been to Thunder Bay, he said, and was never incarcerated. He denies there are similarities to his own works.\u201cI did not begin to paint on canvas until late 1979. (Before that, I had done some pencil and ink drawings on paper),\u201d he said in court papers.Never to this day, he said in an interview, has he used acrylic paint on canvas. \u201cIf I had painted that painting when I was 16, I would admit it.\u201dMr. Doig and his lawyers say they have identified the real artist, a man named Peter Edward Doige. He died in 2012, but his sister said he had attended Lakehead University, served time in Thunder Bay and painted.\u201cI believe that Mr. Fletcher is mistaken and that he actually met my brother, Peter, who I believe did this painting,\u201d the sister, Marilyn Doige Bovard, said in a court declaration. She said the work\u2019s desert scene appeared to show the area in Arizona where her mother moved after a divorce and where her brother spent some time. She recognized, she said, the saguaro cactus in the painting.The prison\u2019s former art teacher recognized a photograph of Ms. Bovard\u2019s brother as a man who had been in his class and said he had watched him paint the painting, according to the teacher\u2019s affidavit.Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Bartlow have no record of Mr. Doig being imprisoned in Thunder Bay, but they said that\u2019s because he was a minor and his records were probably expunged, or paperwork was just lost. (In June, The New York Times asked the Ontario authorities to search their records in an effort to come up with conclusive evidence. They were able to easily search only records going back as far as 1985; a deeper search would take more than six weeks.)Mr. Doig plans to present his own set of records, school documents, correspondence, photos and testimony to demonstrate, he said, that he never attended Lakehead University and that during the months in 1975 and 1976, when he is said to have created the painting, he actually was in Toronto or working on oil rigs in western Canada or traveling outside the country.He asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that he should not be tried in Illinois. But Judge Gary Feinerman of United States District Court decided in April this was a dispute that could be resolved only at trial.\u201cThe presence of the Lakehead and the Seafarers records for Doige, but not for Doig, certainly favors Doig,\u201d Judge Feinerman said in his decision. \u201cThere is no doubt about that. But it\u2019s not strong enough evidence, given all of the evidence in the record,\u201d the judge said, to eliminate any chance that Doig \u201cwas not the person at Thunder Bay who was the author of the painting.\u201dNow, Mr. Bartlow said he thinks the artist refuses to acknowledge the painting because it shows he has been using similar formulaic compositions for four decades.\u201cThere is no question that Peter Doig painted the painting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the outline of our painting in his other works.\u201dBoth sides plan to call experts to debate this point. The drawn-out process is a stressful distraction for an artist at the peak of his talents, said Gordon VeneKlasen, Mr. Doig\u2019s dealer at Michael Werner Gallery in New York.\u201cThis has become about much more than Peter\u2019s painting,\u201d Mr. VeneKlasen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about authorship. It\u2019s about being forced to put your name on another artist\u2019s work.\u201dIn a statement, he went further: \u201cIn our case, the artist and dealer have the resources to carry on this fight, but I wonder about all the artists who might not. Do they simply acquiesce and let inauthentic works into the market if they are the product of a similar attempt at bullying and rampant greed?\u201dTo win, art lawyers say, Mr. Fletcher and his advisers will have to persuade the judge that the painting is real.But even if the court favors Mr. Fletcher, it could be a hollow victory. Since the artist himself and the dealer who represents him say it\u2019s not a Doig, the art market is unlikely to assign much value to it, art experts said.A decision against Mr. Doig, and any costly award for damages, would nevertheless probably send a shock wave through the art world.\u201cIt would,\u201d said Nicholas M.

{"Headline": "A Prized Stettheimer Painting, Sold Under the Radar by a University", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBut what was not revealed at the time, and has only recently come to light, is that before the agreement was completed \u2014 and with the debate over the future of Fisk itself swirling around her \u2014 Hazel O\u2019Leary, then the university\u2019s president, on behalf of the school quietly sold off two other paintings owned by Fisk.One painting was Florine Stettheimer\u2019s exuberantly detailed \u201cAsbury Park South.\u201d Its sale represented the first time a major work by Stettheimer, the beloved New York modernist artist and salon hostess, had come on the market in 20 years.According to Mr. Albano, Fisk decided to sell work by Stettheimer and the painter and illustrator Rockwell Kent, which had been donated to the university with \u201cno strings attached.\u201dAnother dealer ultimately bought the Stettheimer painting, offering it for sale at the Armory Show in New York in 2012. When Michael Rosenfeld, a gallery owner, saw \u201cAsbury Park South,\u201d halfway out of a crate, \u201cI literally got on my knees, and said to the person in the booth, \u2018I have to have this painting,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was virtually impossible to own a major painting\u201d by Stettheimer, he added. Mr. Rosenfeld scooped it up for an undisclosed amount.Fisk\u2019s under-the-radar sale of the Stettheimer highlights the minefield institutions must navigate when they use proceeds from art, whether to pay expenses or, in recent years, to try to finance costly expansions. At the same time, the sale reveals what can happen when an artist \u2014 even one as critically revered as Stettheimer \u2014 fails to secure her legacy.Though the task force does not have legal authority over universities, its members, who represent several museum associations, can censure those who sell art to pay operating expenses, putting pressure on them not to treat art as an A.T.M. That practice \u201calienates donors and undermines the purpose of having a museum on campus,\u201d Ms. King said.Various museum associations say that deaccessioning art, if not in violation of the original gift, is justified if the proceeds are used to buy more art. It is the cherry-picking of a painting here and a painting there to bolster an endowment or support operating expenses that is frowned upon.Universities, however, have argued in several settings that they must consider such sales when the fiscal alternatives \u2014 cutting programs or staff \u2014 are untenable.\u201cWe\u2019re managing everything at Fisk today in such a manner that we hope we are never confronted with having to make that kind of decision again,\u201d said Frank Sims, the university\u2019s interim president.When Ms. King\u2019s own institution made plans to expand its Frank Gehry-designed space, \u201ca couple of our advisory board members said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just sell your Georgia O\u2019Keeffe?\u2019\u201d Called \u201cOriental Poppies,\u201d it was the Weisman Museum\u2019s most valuable work. \u201cWe convinced them there was another way,\u201d Ms. King said, and the new wing was financed without selling art.Born into a wealthy German Jewish family, Florine Stettheimer had no need to sell her art during her lifetime, and the way her paintings were distributed after her death in 1944, at 72 \u2014 with most going to institutions \u2014 has meant that few of her important works have been offered for sale since.Painted in 1920, \u201cAsbury Park South\u201d is set at a restricted beach in New Jersey. Most of the figures are African-American, but Stettheimer included herself and white friends like Marcel Duchamp and the writer and critic Carl Van Vechten in the crowded and lively scene. A central figure in the Harlem Renaissance, with close ties to Fisk, Van Vechten suggested to Stettheimer\u2019s sister Ettie that the painting be donated to the university, just as he encouraged O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s larger gift from her husband\u2019s collection of modernist art. Both gifts were made in 1949.But 61 years later, Fisk was in crisis. Ms. O\u2019Leary approached Mr. Albano, whose gallery represents many African-American artists, about brokering the sale of one of Rockwell Kent\u2019s Greenland paintings and \u201cAsbury Park South.\u201d \u201cI wish I had just bought it,\u201d Mr. Albano said of the Stettheimer. (Ms. O\u2019Leary, who retired from Fisk in 2013, said she was not well enough to speak and suggested The Times call her back but she did not return the subsequent calls.)The exact amount Fisk made is unclear, since none of the former or current administrators contacted would discuss the sale. But a former curator at Crystal Bridges, which passed on buying the Stettheimer from Gerald Peters, the dealer who acquired it through Mr. Albano, recalled that it was offered to the museum for a low six-figure amount.Stettheimer\u2019s auction record is $375,000, set in January at Skinner in Boston for a floral still life, but not a major work like \u201cAsbury Park South.\u201d If an important Stettheimer came to auction, said Elizabeth Beaman, head of the American art department at Christie\u2019s, \u201cI think we would see an unbelievable response.\u201dMs. King said the sale of museum collections to fund operating expenses, which began with art museums, has extended to other institutions, like those with valuable paleontology collections. And though European museums, which are mostly government controlled, have not faced this problem thus far, she said she feared that \u201cas the financial crisis continues in Europe, it may become more of an issue.\u201dThe problem, according to Ms. King, is most acute at small private universities, where museum directors often are not strong enough to stand up for their collections.But what happens when an entire school faces closing, when there isn\u2019t enough money to pay basic expenses, let alone maintain a gallery or museum? That was Fisk\u2019s predicament as it fought to sell an interest in the Stieglitz Collection, with Ms. O\u2019Leary telling the court that her university would \u201cbleed to death\u201d if it did not sell art. Brandeis University also cited severe financial hardship when it announced in 2009 that it would sell off the holdings of its Rose Art Museum. A legal challenge ended with Brandeis\u2019s keeping the collection intact.Mr. Sims, Fisk\u2019s interim president, said this month that it was \u201cnot currently considering the sale of any art, and if we ever do consider something like that, it would be a decision made by the board of trustees.\u201dIn the end, some suggest, perhaps the responsibility for protecting a legacy after death should fall on the artist. Stettheimer made no plans for her work\u2019s fate. In fact, she wanted her paintings destroyed when she died, having once commented that \u201cletting people have your paintings is like letting them wear your clothes.\u201dInstead, her sister Ettie donated most of her work to institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Columbia University, with Columbia receiving the largest trove on the understanding that a museum would be built on campus. That never happened, and for a time, the university\u2019s deans could borrow major Stettheimer paintings to hang in their offices \u2014 something unimaginable with an O\u2019Keeffe.But Stettheimer\u2019s reputation has grown in recent years. In 2014 the Lenbachhaus in Munich mounted the first solo exhibition of her work outside the United States. Next spring, the Jewish Museum in New York will present \u201cFlorine Stettheimer: Painting Poetry.\u201d The Portland Museum\u2019s gift shop even has a Stettheimer refrigerator magnet for sale.Stettheimer is having a moment \u2014 including at Fisk.Its centerpiece?

For emerging markets, the move into the dollar could presage a tide of investment flowing out, imperiling economies from Brazil to Indonesia. For Europe, a weaker euro underscores fundamental doubts about whether leaders can finally muster a formula for economic vibrancy after years of disappointment and recrimination.When economies function in healthy fashion, money flows across investments in pursuit of rewards that are supposed to be correlated to risks. But when a shock hits and fear takes hold, investors tend to trust only storehouses with one key trait \u2014 the certainty of survival.The charge into the dollar says less about investors\u2019 faith in the United States and more about the alarming situations confronting other major economies.The 19 countries that share the euro appear vulnerable to political discord and widening separatism as they contend with an influx of refugees, aging populations and tepid economic growth. Years of confusion may be unfolding \u2014 the sort of turmoil that could make a money manager crave safety.The United States is not without risks. Its public debt exceeds $19 trillion. Fractious politics have in recent years brought the country to the verge of self-inflicted default. It has economic inequality rivaling the Gilded Age of the late 19th century and tens of millions of working people who have essentially lost faith in the American economic bargain as living standards have declined.And yet, the United States can print its own money while finding seemingly limitless demand for its debt. The dollar remains the foundation of global finance, the one piece of a cosmically complex puzzle in which continued faith is required or the totality ceases to make sense.\u201cRightly or wrongly, there are existential questions about the future of the euro,\u201d said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSay what you will about the dollar, no one questions that it will be around 10 or 20 years from now.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.The worst-off countries, like Greece, Spain and Portugal, have sought to unleash government spending, running deficits to stimulate their economies. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s most powerful member, has vetoed that move, demanding that they instead cut spending, including on pensions and social services.\u201cThe people running Europe have gotten so disconnected from what the majority wants, and has always wanted for decades,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.Will Britain\u2019s withdrawal alter the politics and spur Germany to moderate its obsession with austerity? Will Berlin assent to less dogmatic economic policies aimed at bolstering growth and spreading the spoils?Every new development heightening doubts about the cohesion of the European project risks provoking investors to demand greater compensation for loans to debt-choked borrowers like Italy, Portugal and Greece. The more those countries have to pay to keep credit flowing, the greater the worries about the health of their banking systems. The greater the reduction in banks\u2019 willingness to lend, the tighter the chokehold on European economic growth. And the absence of growth is both cause and effect of the populist inclinations coursing through the region.And so the cycle potentially turns, with only one predictable outcome: a flight to safety.\u201cContinuing uncertainty is going to make the dollar go up more,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at Harvard.\u201cIf the uncertainty continues, it\u2019s going to hit the periphery of Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to hit emerging markets.\u201dWorld markets are now so interconnected that when money shifts with unexpected severity, it can yield unanticipated effects. Such was the case in 2013, as the Fed signaled its intention to slow the pace of its extraordinary interventions.Currencies dropped in Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey. Stock markets fell. Businesses suffered, laying off workers.A repeat today would unfold at an especially difficult time. The slowdown of China\u2019s economy has diminished the appetite for goods produced worldwide. Weaker growth in Europe puts more pressure on emerging markets.The Fed is supposed to serve American interests, yet as the taper tantrum brought home, its impacts are felt everywhere. Now, the Fed is weighing when to lift rates after years of maintaining them near zero.\u201cThere\u2019s a potential for huge volatility and huge shocks,\u201d said Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University. \u201cThe part of this that no one can say out loud is that the Fed is the global central bank.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then he follows up with his outlook for toxic algae.On a map, Mr. Korbel points out areas with high concentrations of algae \u2014 natural gatherings of microscopic plankton that, while often innocuous, can degrade water quality and even be dangerous.\u201cBrown or red tide is much catchier than harmful algal bloom,\u201d Mr. Korbel joked about the right wording to use in his broadcast. It\u2019s a relatively new topic for him, something that was never part of his decades-long career. Nor was it part, he said, of his meteorology training at New York University. \u201cThat was down the hall, in oceanography,\u201d he said.Mr. Korbel may not be an outlier for long. If a growing number of scientists have their way \u2014 and can get federal funding they say is desperately need to protect the public \u2014 algae forecasts could become as common as weather reports, and as essential.Sophisticated sensors can be deployed to measure when toxins are reaching harmful levels, allowing officials to redirect fishing, beachgoers or water treatment efforts.So money for algal bloom science comes from more general federal science funds, and those pots are shrinking. Congressionally approved funding for a broad range of related science is around $9 million this year, down 45 percent from five years ago, according to several scientists involved in the research. That means less money for deploying sensors or even to pay for boats and crews to monitor the shorelines.\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox,\u201d said Christopher Gobler, a professor of marine sciences at Stony Brook University who provides the data for Mr. Korbel\u2019s weekly report and believes the field should be more mainstream. \u201cWe need it more than ever, and we\u2019ve brought ourselves to the precipice of making great forecasts, but we can\u2019t make it happen.\u201dDr. Gobler and his team do their sampling the old-fashioned way \u2014 by fanning out on Mondays around Long Island and scooping up water samples. His project is financed largely by foundations.In the case of Dr. Lessard, though, the grant money for the sensor was not enough to cover the cost of training to use it, and of deploying it off San Juan Island, Wash.Scientists say at least 20 sensors are needed around the country at a cost of about $7 million, including training and deployment. The only sensors now in use for any extended period, they say, are in the Gulf of Mexico, though the funding for those is scheduled to run out in 2018.Vera Trainer, a NOAA scientist in Seattle who studies algal blooms, had to ask for volunteers to go on a research expedition to study algal concentrations in the Pacific Ocean because she did not have the money to send her own staff.\u201cI feel like a beggar,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just robots that we need,\u201d Dr. Trainer added. \u201cWe need the research that helps us understand the hot spots, when the cells are most toxic, in what years they\u2019re going to be most intense, the effects of climate change.\u201cWithout the basic knowledge, we have no forecast.\u201dPresident Obama\u2019s 2016 fiscal-year budget called for $13 million for research related to harmful algal blooms.\u201cUnfortunately, there has been an increase in the number, frequency and type of algal blooms,\u201d 19 House Democrats wrote in a letter late last year to ranking members of the House Appropriations Committee, in a failed effort to have the funding level met. The increase in blooms, the letter stated, \u201cis having a crippling effect on local and regional economies.\u201dMr. Spain said the early warning systems could help fishermen avoid millions of dollars in losses like those they suffered last year when toxic blooms devastated the West Coast crab season.\u201cWe can\u2019t live in a world where we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and we don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more advanced notice, the better we know what to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The largest donations were for $10,000 and included two hotel companies, the Westin New York at Times Square and the InterContinental New York Times Square.In the past, the group had received contributions as large as $350,000 from unions, developers and others with business before the city.Another group allied with the mayor, United for Affordable NYC, created to support his push for more affordable housing, raised a total of $390,000, including $150,000 from the Campaign for One New York, $125,000 from Local 2 of the United Federation of Teachers, and $30,000 from District Council 37, a union that represents many city workers. A large portion of the money was spent on producing and buying airtime for television commercials, the group said in a statement.

Mr. de Blasio and his associates raised money for it from unions, developers, corporations and others in the usual cast of characters who nurture their close connections to politicians in power.Mr. de Blasio escaped legal jeopardy because the nonprofit did much of its work in 2014, too long ago to have any immediately discernible connection to the mayor\u2019s re-election effort.

On the steps of 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, she said that she would lead a battle against \u201cburning injustice\u201d and help create opportunities for all, not just a \u201cprivileged few.\u201dShe wasted no time in dispensing with the services of George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer and the architect of public spending curbs, and appointing new faces to domestic ministries: Amber Rudd at the Home Office, and Justine Greening at the Department of Education.However, Mr. Osborne\u2019s replacement, Mr. Hammond, who must find the money for any new social spending programs, \u201chas a reputation as a fiscal hawk, which potentially conflicts with May\u2019s pledge to ease up on the pace of austerity,\u201d said Kallum Pickering, the chief economist for the United Kingdom at Berenberg, an investment bank.Mr. Hammond on Thursday highlighted the importance of resolving Britain\u2019s new relationships with the European Union, telling the BBC that \u201cif there is one thing that is damaging our economy today \u2014 right now \u2014 it is uncertainty for businesses.\u201dMr. Hammond made a special plea on behalf of London\u2019s financial services sector, a prominent part of the country\u2019s economy and a huge generator of tax revenues that finance social spending.\u201cWe have to make sure that in our negotiations with the E.U. we have very clearly in our minds the need to ensure access to the European Union single market for our financial services,\u201d he added.The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, urged Britain to quickly begin the process to leave the European Union, saying, \u201cWe cannot let this ambiguous and murky situation last, in the interest of the British themselves, I would even say.\u201dBut that may not be the priority of David Davis, a veteran lawmaker and former Europe minister, who will head up a new ministry responsible for Brexit, or of Liam Fox, who will be in charge of negotiating international trade deals.\u201cOnce the European nations realize that we are not going to budge on control of our borders, they will want to talk, in their own interest,\u201d he said.Yet European leaders have made clear that they do not intend to give way to Britain\u2019s demand that it get unimpeded trading rights with the Continent without adhering to the bloc\u2019s immigration rules, which require member countries to let European Union citizens live and work where they wish. That open-borders policy, as much as any other factor, drove British sentiment against the bloc.As a result, the uncertainty could drag on for some time if Ms. May\u2019s negotiators are not willing to reach a compromise on immigration, potentially hurting the economy and giving other nations time to poach British business, not least from among banks and investment firms that are now considering moving some operations away from London.Mr. Tilford argues that the main pro-Brexit campaigners are ill equipped to negotiate, saying that they lack understanding of how the European Union works, what trade-offs are required and, therefore, of what deals are possible.He pointed to some of Mr. Davis\u2019s Twitter posts that called for \u201ca UK-German deal\u201d allowing access to Britain for German cars and other goods in exchange for a deal on British exports, and claimed that \u201csimilar deals would be reached with other key EU nations.\u201dIn fact, the European Union reaches trade agreements as a bloc, rather than on a country-by-country basis, so Germany would not even negotiate directly with Britain.But Mr. Tilford said that there might be \u201cmethod in the madness\u201d of Ms. May\u2019s central pro-Brexit cabinet appointments.\u201cThey are going to be confronted by the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be possible for them to continue to claim that you can have your cake and eat it. They are going to be negotiating with other countries, and they will no longer be able to rely on bluster and obfuscation.\u201dMr. Tilford said that if ideological supporters of Brexit failed or were discredited, that would force a reality check on their supporters, leading to a more flexible negotiating stance.Even under this scenario there is a hitch, however: the economy. \u201cIn the short to medium term, things can get a lot worse,\u201d Mr. Tilford said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the reporting credit with this article misspelled the contributor\u2019s given name.

{"Headline": "The American Who Accidentally Became a Chinese Movie Star", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "FeatureThe journey of Jonathan Kos-Read, better known as Cao Cao, is a good guide for anyone seeking to make it in China\u2019s budding, chaotic film industry.Supported byThis was troubling. Kos-Read, who is known in China only as Cao Cao, is by far the leading foreign actor working in the country today, having appeared in about 100 movies and television programs since his career began in 1999. He is famous throughout the mainland, and his career has been on a steady upward trajectory. Last December he appeared in the action film \u201cMojin \u2014 The Lost Legend,\u201d currently the fifth-highest-grossing movie in Chinese history. Who, Kos-Read wondered, would the producers have cast instead of him?\u201cIp Man 3\u201d went on to gross $115 million at the box office in China, with more than half of that coming on the opening weekend. China\u2019s booming movie market grew by nearly 50 percent last year and is expected to surpass North America\u2019s as the largest in the world by next year. These days, Hollywood studios hardly greenlight a blockbuster without first asking, \u201cHow will this play in China?\u201d The rewards are too vast. \u201cFurious 7,\u201d for example, earned $390 million in China \u2014 more than it made in the United States \u2014 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever in the country.And just as Hollywood has begun to crack the market, Chinese cinema has come into its own. In recent years, Chinese studios have started shifting away from the agitprop that defined their cinematic output for generations and are instead focusing on genres that draw viewers to theaters in any country: action, adventure, comedy. In February, a sci-fi comedy called \u201cThe Mermaid\u201d became the highest-grossing movie ever in China within 12 days of its release, earning more than $430 million. Increasingly, Chinese cinemagoers are opting to buy tickets for movies made specifically for them \u2014 like those in the \u201cIp Man\u201d series \u2014 not those that pander to them or lecture them. It is in this sort of film that Kos-Read has finally had the chance to act, rather than portray a stand-in for Western imperiousness. If the Hollywood studios really want to understand how to succeed in China, Kos-Read\u2019s journey makes for a kind of accidental guide.Kos-Read was tired. He had flown in a few days before from the Bay Area, where his wife and two young daughters live; the actor now splits time between the United States and China, which he has called home for almost two decades. Kos-Read has wavy brown hair, a thick beard streaked with gray and the kind of broad face that looks good on camera. He curses a lot and often wears a look of deep contemplation that borders on exasperation. As we boarded the plane for our 10:30 p.m. flight, he sported a huge calf-length black parka, which he wears on set \u2014 Chinese sets are notoriously frigid in the wintertime \u2014 and carried a heavy backpack filled mostly with equipment for photography, a personal hobby. The airplane was only half full. Kos-Read lumbered through the center aisle until he reached the last row, where he heaved his backpack onto a seat and plopped down into another as if he were claiming a spot on a long-distance bus.Jonathan Kos-Read trying on costumes for \u201cGoodbye! Pili.\u201dDuring the two-hour flight, Kos-Read drank a few cans of Yanjing Beer and discussed his role in last year\u2019s \u201cMojin.\u201d In the film, he plays a lawyer to a cult leader. After the first act, he turns into a zombie. It was by far the biggest project of his career, with by far the biggest stars, and it increased his already-formidable exposure in China by degrees of magnitude. On our plane, a flight attendant recognized him from the film. (In California, by contrast, he is basically anonymous outside of Chinatowns.) Kos-Read was happy for the opportunity to appear in such a large movie but was disappointed with his performance, which he believes was adequate but not excellent. \u201cIn a lot of TV shows, you just have to spit out the lines, really. But in a big movie, you\u2019ve really got to be good,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn my first big movie, I stepped up into the big leagues and hit a single.\u201dStill, acting in one of the biggest Chinese blockbusters of all time is a long way from where Kos-Read began. Raised in Torrance, Calif., he attended an arts high school, where he got interested in acting. He went on to study film and molecular biology at New York University. There, he took a Mandarin course and became determined to master the language. He moved to Beijing in 1997 and drifted, living for a period in a student dorm and forcing himself to speak nothing but Mandarin for a three-month stretch. \u201cLike everybody else, I arrived and bummed around for two years, not knowing what I was going to do, trying to do a bunch of things, failing,\u201d he says. \u201cTeaching English.\u201dNot long after he arrived, he began dating a Chinese woman named Li Zhiyin, a finance major in college who later became his wife. On one of their early dates, he picked up an English-language listings magazine and saw an ad seeking a foreign actor for a Chinese movie. Kos-Read had never lost his love for performing, and he thought it could be fun to act in China. He auditioned and got the part, which was supposed to pay the equivalent of about $400 for three months of work. In the movie, called \u201cMei Shi Zhao Shi\u201d (\u201cLooking for Trouble\u201d), Kos-Read plays an American documentary filmmaker following around a group of disillusioned bohemians. He says it took the producers two years to pay him. But two weeks after the movie wrapped, he landed three months of work on a Chinese soap opera.There were only a handful of foreign actors working in China at the time, and Kos-Read quickly realized he offered filmmakers there a rare combination of traits. He spoke good Mandarin, was a decent actor and had a look that many Chinese consider typically \u201cAmerican\u201d: six feet tall, square jaw, blue eyes. He was able to make a living in the industry, but his early roles weren\u2019t great. At that stage of his career, most filmmakers still had limited exposure to foreigners and foreign cultures, and his early parts tended to reflect Chinese stereotypes of Westerners. He rarely played bad guys, because there are very few American villains in Chinese movies (those roles tend to go to the woeful cohort of Japanese actors working in China). Instead, Kos-Read was often typecast as a \u201cdumb guy,\u201d he says. Most frequently, he was an arrogant foreign businessman who falls for a local beauty, only to be spurned as she inevitably makes the virtuous choice to stay with her Chinese suitor. Sometimes he played the foreign friend whose presence onscreen is intended to make the main character seem more worldly; Kos-Read dubbed another stock character \u201cthe fool,\u201d an arrogant Westerner whose disdain for China is, by the end of the movie, transformed into admiration.When he was studying Mandarin at N.Y.U., Kos-Read adopted a Chinese moniker, as many language students do. He took his, Cao Cao, from a historical general who is also a central character in one of the country\u2019s most revered classical novels, \u201cRomance of the Three Kingdoms.\u201d Like a Chinese King Arthur or Davy Crockett, the original Cao Cao exists in fact and fiction and in between. Kos-Read chose the name because it was easy to remember and because he liked that Cao Cao was a wise, self-reliant man. Years later, the decision would prove wise indeed. To his Chinese audience, it showed that the American, despite his loutish onscreen personae, took an interest in their history and culture.\u201cCao Cao Lai Le\u201d ran for about three years before the struggling \u201cSunday\u201d dropped it (\u201cSunday\u201d soon went off the air as well), but it led to better roles in film and TV and a long line of travel-show hosting gigs, which took him to virtually every region of China \u2014 from the deserts of the west to the grasslands of the north to the hilly metropolis of Chongqing.China\u2019s film industry has long been focused on propaganda-laden historical epics, hence the need for a full-size Forbidden City replica. Even as China became a global superpower in the late 20th century, big-budget Chinese movies were, by and large, treacly, patriotic fare. And though tastes were shifting, the studios used their connections with the government to ensure their own films succeeded. In 2010, for example, the behemoth state-owned studio and distributor China Film Group pulled \u201cAvatar\u201d from 1,628 screens and replaced it with its own film, a Confucius biopic starring Chow Yun Fat.Because the Chinese government allows only 34 foreign movies to enter the market per year, and the officials\u2019 criteria for selection are mysterious, many American studios have sought to lessen the uncertainty by co-producing films with Chinese firms, thereby sidestepping the import rules (which apply only when a movie\u2019s producers want a share of the box-office receipts, which is to say they apply, effectively, to all major Hollywood films). And yet few co-productions have achieved anything resembling commercial or critical success. Not only have studios struggled to find ways to appeal to both audiences, they\u2019ve also struggled to work well together on set. This is at least in part because of the collision of two vastly different moviemaking cultures. Whereas Hollywood film sets have rather rigid, union-determined rules, Chinese sets are decidedly unsystematic, ad hoc, fly-by-the-seat-of-their-pants operations. (I once reported on a film whose special-effects guy was also in charge of payroll.) On this set, there were dozens of people, mostly young men, standing around in the cold who didn\u2019t seem to have any job at all. It\u2019s exactly these sorts of differences that have made Chinese-American co-productions so difficult, and those problems follow them to the box office.Often censors don\u2019t even have to get involved, as studios have begun self-censoring their films to avoid the hassle. \u201cRed Dawn\u201d is perhaps the most infamous case. The 1984 original is about a guerrilla uprising against a Soviet invasion of America; in the 2012 remake, screenwriters updated the movie by casting China as the aggressor. MGM executives realized their error too late, and unwilling to risk offending the censors, they reportedly spent around $1 million in postproduction recasting North Korea as the invader.Despite the breadth of roles he has played in China, Kos-Read is passed over for most co-productions. Hollywood producers want to bring in their own talent, he says. And once, Chinese producers told him that because of the ubiquity with which he appears in Chinese cinema and television, he would make their production seem too local. He has acted in only two East-West movies: a deep-sea epic funded by a Chinese billionaire with a predominantly foreign cast, and a bigfoot movie shot in Shennongjia, a mountainous region in Hubei Province, where there have been hundreds of purported bigfoot sightings. Each film was plagued with on-set dysfunction, and neither has been released.Kos-Read says that the reason most co-productions fail is as much about the chaos on the Chinese side as it is the arrogance on the Hollywood side. \u201cThey come here and say, \u2018We\u2019re from Hollywood, we know better and whatever it is that you think is the right way to do it, it\u2019s by definition not,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cYou come in with an attitude like that, you will have a lot of problems. You will misunderstand the kind of stories they want to see.\u201dAnd as Chinese filmmakers have figured out what sorts of stories Chinese audiences really want to see, the nature of Kos-Read\u2019s work has changed for the better. Although his part in \u201cKnight\u2019s Glove\u201d wasn\u2019t groundbreaking, he is now often cast in increasingly complex parts.After the morning\u2019s shoot, we drove across the lot to film another scene. In the back of the van, Kos-Read scrolled through photos on his phone of some of the roles he has played over the last two years, each with a distinct facial-hair style. They included: an American engineer who worked on the first locomotive in China; Gen. Douglas MacArthur; an \u201c[expletive] lawyer\u201d; a World War II radio announcer; a hip-hop dancer; a wisdom-dispensing alcoholic barfly; a Mafia boss; an antiquities expert; a sleazy Russian lounge lizard; a cowboy; a bisexual fashion designer; and a French detective.Kos-Read believes the growing variety of roles for foreign actors like him is a result of more Chinese exposure to outsiders. \u201cThere are more foreign actors now,\u201d he says. \u201cChinese know some foreigners. So they write more interesting characters. I\u2019m lucky because I usually get to do the better stuff.\u201dAs I dressed in the truck, Kos-Read approached with a Chinese crew member and said, \u201cThey asked me to make sure you knew that they weren\u2019t actually going to pay you or anything.\u201d I laughed. As absurd as it may seem to be yanked from the sidelines in an instant and thrown in front of the camera, this kind of thing happens with surprising regularity for foreigners in China, and moments like these become the kind of China Stories that keep people like Kos-Read around for so long.We filmed four or five takes of a short scene in the car. I pretended to drive, yanking the steering wheel back and forth with the kind of comical exaggeration you might see in \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d Two cameras glided on a track and crane outside the car while Kos-Read, sitting in the back, and a young Russian actor, who sat beside me, exchanged a few lines of dialogue. The Russian had until recently been a student in Jinhua, a nearby city, but was now trying his hand at an acting career. Maybe it would have worked out for him had he started a decade and a half ago, like Kos-Read, but his performance didn\u2019t bode well. He struggled with the lines; his English was wooden, the delivery stilted.Kos-Read, on the other hand, naturally eased into character as soon as they started rolling. He said his lines in a British accent, smoothly and barely above a whisper, looking out the window as the camera swept by.Mitch Moxley is a writer based in New York.

She patronized the House of Worth, preferred French couturier to American socialites and favored designs that accented her voluptuous figure. She pushed back by employing fashion and public image as weapons, helping the family compete with the Astors and others who had shunned Jay Gould.Anna Gould was married to two French aristocrats.

{"Headline": "Doctors Are Improperly Billing Some on Medicare, U.S. Says", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Doctors are improperly billing poor people on Medicare for deductibles, co-payments and other costs from which they are supposed to be exempt, the Obama administration says.Federal officials have warned doctors that they may be subject to penalties if they persist in these practices. They could, for example, be fined or excluded from Medicare.The people who are being billed improperly are \u201cqualified Medicare beneficiaries\u201d who are also enrolled in Medicaid. They are 65 and older or disabled and have low incomes, generally less than $1,010 a month for an individual or $1,355 for a married couple.Federal law says that such beneficiaries do not have \u201cany legal liability to make payment\u201d to a doctor or a hospital beyond the amounts paid by Medicare and Medicaid. The Obama administration recently told doctors that they \u201cmust accept the Medicare payment and Medicaid payment (if any) as payment in full for services rendered to a qualified Medicare beneficiary.\u201dDespite this requirement, a study by the Department of Health and Human Services found that improper billing still appears to be \u201crelatively commonplace\u201d because \u201csome Medicare providers unlawfully bill enrollees\u201d after receiving payments from Medicare and Medicaid. Many low-income beneficiaries are unaware of the billing restrictions or are concerned about losing access to their doctors, so they \u201csimply pay the cost-sharing amounts,\u201d the administration said. In other cases, it said, \u201cunpaid bills are referred to collection agencies.\u201dIn some cases, it said, beneficiaries \u201ccurtail their use of needed services due to concerns about their ability to pay.\u201dTanya D. Kaltenbach, 45, of Evans, Ga., outside Augusta, is on Medicare because she is disabled. She said that one of her doctors, a specialist in rehabilitation and pain medicine, \u201chas been adamant\u201d that she pay about $25 for each visit \u2014 a total of hundreds of dollars over the last few years.She showed the doctor\u2019s staff a Medicare publication stating that qualified Medicare beneficiaries are not subject to such charges, but the dispute continues. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll be thrown out of the doctor\u2019s practice for making a fuss about co-payments,\u201d said Ms. Kaltenbach, who added that her income was less than $900 a month. \u201cThe office manager suggested that I was taking food out of the doctor\u2019s mouth if I don\u2019t pay the co-payment.\u201dThe Obama administration has expressed its concerns in a report last summer, in a notice to health care providers in February, in a letter to insurance companies in April and again in the Federal Register two weeks ago.Medicare, the insurance program for older Americans and disabled people, is run by the federal government. Medicaid, for low-income people of all ages, is financed jointly by the federal government and the states. Eligibility, benefits and provider payment rates vary from state to state.About seven million low-income people receive financial help through the program for qualified Medicare beneficiaries. Under this program, state Medicaid agencies help pay Medicare premiums, deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance. But states do not have to pay doctors the full amount of such costs, and in some cases they pay nothing, leaving doctors with hundreds or thousands of dollars in unreimbursed expenses.\u201cBecause of this gap in payment, many doctors and other health care providers try to bill the beneficiaries or refuse to provide services to them,\u201d said Denny W. Chan, a lawyer at Justice in Aging, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization.Many states have adopted policies that limit how much they will pay. For example, a doctor performs a service for a Medicare patient and bills Medicare for $100. Medicare pays 80 percent, or $80, and the doctor could ordinarily collect the other $20 from the patient. But if the patient is also on Medicaid, and if Medicaid\u2019s payment rate for the service is only $70, then the state does not have to make any additional payment, and the claim is considered to be paid in full. The doctor is forbidden to bill the patient for the balance.Medicaid is supposed to operate like a supplementary insurance policy, filling gaps in Medicare for people who could not easily afford to pay their share of the bills. But under a 1997 federal law, states have the option of making payments based on Medicaid rates rather than on Medicare rates, which saves them money. Medicaid payment rates for physician services are often well below Medicare\u2019s \u2014 a reason that some doctors cite for refusing to participate in Medicaid or for limiting the number of Medicaid patients they will see.The Obama administration has warned doctors that if they participate in Medicare, they \u201cmust abide by the balance-billing prohibitions,\u201d regardless of whether they also accept Medicaid patients. \u201cMedicare providers who violate these billing prohibitions are violating their Medicare provider agreement and may be subject to sanctions,\u201d the administration said in a bulletin for doctors.For their part, doctors say they do not always know that a patient is a qualified Medicare beneficiary and is therefore exempt from Medicare\u2019s cost-sharing requirements. The government is increasing efforts to educate doctors and patients after finding widespread confusion. Federal officials have also reminded private Medicare Advantage plans that they too are bound by the billing restrictions in federal law.While doctors cannot bill qualified Medicare beneficiaries, they can try to collect the unpaid share of a bill from the state Medicaid program. But if the doctors do not participate in Medicaid, they may have difficulty obtaining payments.Sukrit Dass, of Lansing, Mich., said he and his wife, Monica, both 73, had received bills from an eye doctor and from physical therapists even though they were supposed to be excused from such cost-sharing as qualified Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Dass took the bills to a counselor at Michigan\u2019s Medicare/Medicaid Assistance Program, who got the charges waived after pointing out the prohibition in federal law.The counselor, Linda Kusnier, said she had a similar experience with a local pharmacy that insisted on collecting 20 percent of the cost of diabetes supplies from one of her clients, a low-income beneficiary entitled to both Medicare and Medicaid. Ms. Kusnier said she had told the drugstore, \u201cThat\u2019s not right, it\u2019s against the law.\u201d And the charges were eventually reversed.David A. Runkle, 51, of Fort Lauderdale, who has AIDS and is an advocate for people with the disease, said, \u201cBalance billing is rampant here in Florida.\u201d Mr. Runkle is a qualified Medicare beneficiary, but said he had received dozens of bills from doctors and hospitals. \u201cI send them back a copy of the law,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they keep sending me more bills because they do not understand the law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Photography was still in its early years when the 20-year-old Alsatian-born Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Auguste Bartholdi traveled to Egypt with a box camera. He returned with calotypes and, more important, a fascination with the monumental architecture of antiquity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 undoubtedly planting the seeds for the gigantism of his own designs for the Statue of Liberty. Although he soon sidelined photography in favor of painting and sculpture, it\u2019s a medium whose visionary possibilities he recognized in the the early stages of its development. This was the era of public works: In France, Napoleon III used monuments in his reign through 1870 to create a sense of national unity and glory. Bartholdi built his first statue at age 22 (G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ral Rapp, inaugurated in his hometown, Colmar); later, his Lion de Belfort caused a stir for its proportions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 11 meters high and 22 meters wide, or 36 feet by 72 feet. But his Statue of Liberty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Liberty Enlightening the World \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is Bartholdi\u2019s magnum opus. The project was conceived as a gesture to seal Franco-American friendship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 French support during the American Revolution had solidified relations. Moreover, it was seen as a symbolic celebration of a hundred years of United States democracy. And photography played a crucial role in making Lady Liberty a reality. Bartholdi hired photographers to document its creation, and those images raised money and awareness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe entire promotional phase and diffusion of images of the Statue of Liberty is through photography \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because Bartholdi had a lot of trouble financing the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sam Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9, the director of the Rencontres d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arles photography festival, where many of these images are on display. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was constantly looking for funds, and he got them by what could be considered the first merchandising campaigns.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf anything, Bartholdi was his own master of hype, said Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9, noting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe image of the Statue of Liberty circulated well before the statue itself was inaugurated.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore the centennial of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independence in 1876, Bartholdi took a trip across the United States. Along the way, he acquired a panorama of New York Harbor, which he amended with gouache, directly painting the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 now known as Liberty Island \u00e2\u0080\u0094 off Manhattan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip.The statue was built in Paris, in an atelier in the 17th Arrondissement to ensure its solidity and durability. Its full 46 meters, or 150 feet, loomed above the local Haussmannian buildings. For each section, a wooden skeleton was covered with plaster and copper sheets were hand-hammered on it to contour the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outermost layer. The architect and restorer Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Viollet-le-Duc advised on internal functionality; when he died, Gustave Eiffel and his team took over. Though Bartholdi no longer practiced photography, he clearly grasped the medium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance: He hired professionals to record the progress of his gargantuan, utopian project. The purpose of the images was utilitarian, but the photographers, among them Pierre Petit and Charles Marville, shaped the aesthetics of 19th-century photography.The show is chronological to illustrate the deliberate process, with Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos from Egypt as the starting point. Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 and his co-curator, Luce Lebart, curator at the French Society of Photography, selected 100 archival images for their aesthetic and informational value. The Statue of Liberty took Bartholdi 15 years to complete, from 1870 to 1885, a decade longer than anticipated. During the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 centennial of independence, only the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand holding the torch was ready. This part was independently lent to the first American World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fair in Philadelphia in 1876, where visitors paid to climb the 10-meter-high hand, and stand before the flame.Entrepreneurial savvy was crucial. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven during the building process, paid public atelier visits were possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmall souvenirs were marketed, including photos.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was unveiled at the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris. Visitors paid to climb inside and look out through the crown over the city \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then mark this moment of wonder by buying keepsakes.Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cunning use of photography was unprecedented, because when he started construction in the 1870s, the medium was only 30 years old. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a new art form, not terribly easy to handle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was not the first attempt at using photography for documentation, it was the first that was as complete and systematic for a work of that import.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After endless delays with the statue, further fiscal problems plagued construction of the massive pedestal on which it would stand, which the Americans were tasked with building. The statue and pedestal were so overdue, the press published drawings of the Statue of Liberty as an old lady, a taunt about how she would look by the time the whole project was completed. Dismantled into 350 pieces, the statue was transported to New York from the port of Le Havre. When it finally reached the other side of the Atlantic, it was rebuilt over four months and inaugurated on Oct. 28, 1886, with a parade on Broadway. Its awe-inspiring scale was to match the modernity of its egalitarian ideals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet, no women, blacks or Jews were invited to the statue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication.Surprisingly, the Statue of Liberty wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t initially intended for New York. It was meant for the opening of the Suez Canal, as a beacon for boats. Bartholdi had presented a model to the canal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, and to the Khedive of Egypt, Isma\u00e2\u0080\u0099il Pasha, in 1869, but the idea was rejected. In Bartholdi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first version, the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head was covered, to reference the attire of Middle Eastern peasant women. Mr. Stourdz\u00c3\u00a9 mused, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think that 130 years ago, the Statue of Liberty could have been at the opening of the Suez Canal, showcasing a veiled version of Liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Liberty\u00e2\u0080\u009d is on view at the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e D\u00c3\u00a9partemental Arles Antique in Arles, France, through Sept. 11."}
{"Headline": "Taking Down Politicians for Decades, and Rising in India\u2019s Government", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileMUMBAI, India \u2014 He does not act the part. At 76, Subramanian Swamy has a youthful demeanor, is frequently cheeky but is almost always composed. Yet he is arguably the most vicious infighter in Indian politics, where he has spent a career of more than 40 years taking down ministers and governments. Lately, he has been on a roll.Next he set his sights on the chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry.Then he made a veiled attack on the finance minister for wearing a business suit on a trip to China instead of traditional Indian garb, saying he looked like a waiter.In the process, Mr. Swamy, an economist, has become the subject of intense controversy, an unapologetic Hindu nationalist whose antics are increasingly threatening the stability of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now, the question is whether Mr. Modi will be able to keep him on a tight enough leash to prevent him from cannibalizing his government.Before his latest forays, he was \u201cthe chief wrecker\u201d of the government in 1999, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, causing its fall after 13 months, said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a close adviser to Mr. Vajpayee.\u201cThey\u2019ll face the worst consequences\u201d from tolerating him, Mr. Kulkarni said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great spoiler.\u201dNot only has Mr. Modi tolerated Mr. Swamy, he has actively promoted him, rescuing him from the political wilderness by elevating him to a seat in the upper house of Parliament. The reason, political observers say, is Mr. Swamy\u2019s value as one of India\u2019s most effective fighters against the country\u2019s endemic corruption, something that Mr. Modi has made a centerpiece of his plans to modernize and invigorate India\u2019s economy.\u201cIf Modi is going to live up to his promise to clean up government, he needs Swamy,\u201d said Madhav Das Nalapat, a former editor of The Times of India and a friend of Mr. Swamy\u2019s.In an interview in his New Delhi office, where one wall is covered with pictures of himself with Indian leaders of recent decades, Mr. Swamy declared his latest attacks had the support of \u201csenior colleagues in the party\u201d and were made only after they \u201ctold me, \u2018You are absolutely right.\u2019 \u201dThe son of a government bureaucrat, Mr. Swamy was raised in New Delhi but left in 1962 to pursue a doctorate in economics at Harvard, the beginning of a nearly 50-year affiliation with the university, as an associate professor and summer lecturer.In 1969, after obtaining his degree and teaching at Harvard for several years, he returned to India, hoping to build an academic career there. But as an outspoken advocate of free-market economics, he found himself shut out of the intelligentsia, then rabidly leftist.Unable to find a permanent place in India\u2019s top academic institutions, Mr. Swamy was contemplating a return to the United States when he fell in with a Hindu nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cMy critics began saying I was a chauvinist, nationalist, mad nationalist,\u201d Mr. Swamy said, prompting the Hindu nationalist group to begin wondering, \u201c \u2018Who is this guy who is speaking our language and we don\u2019t even know him?\u2019 \u201dThe group offered Mr. Swamy a seat in the upper house of Parliament in 1974. He took it, beginning his career in politics.Over the years, Mr. Swamy has served five terms in Parliament for two different parties that have since become part of Mr. Modi\u2019s governing party. He settled into a routine of spending winters in India and summers teaching at Harvard.Mr. Swamy, in an interview, was unapologetic about the article and restated his theory of Muslims in India being descended from Hindus. He added that he wished the Harvard faculty had at least given him a chance to make his case before canceling his courses.Few who know him say they believe he is really anti-Muslim, suggesting that his comments are aimed at building a support base among Hindu nationalists. \u201cSwamy is a closet secularist,\u201d Mr. Nalapat said. \u201cOtherwise, how do you explain his family?\u201dMr. Swamy\u2019s wife, Roxna, is a member of the Parsi community, which emigrated centuries ago from Iran. One of his sons-in-law is Muslim.Whatever his role in Hindu nationalism, Mr. Swamy has been a force behind some of India\u2019s landmark corruption cases. He petitioned the Supreme Court in 2010 to prosecute the telecommunications minister at the time over his involvement in awarding cellphone spectrum to companies below market rates. That helped fuel the perception of widespread corruption and led to the defeat of India\u2019s longtime governing Congress Party.He also brought a lawsuit against several Congress Party leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, its president, and Rahul Gandhi, her son and the party vice president, accusing them of illegally acquiring a newspaper for its real estate assets and forcing them to show up in a New Delhi courthouse as the accused and post bail.\u201cEveryone thought that nothing could nail the Gandhi family,\u201d said Sanjaya Baru, a onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. \u201cSwamy showed it\u2019s possible.\u201dIn April, as the question of whether Raghuram G. Rajan would continue as central bank governor was being debated, Mr. Swamy leapt into the mix. In an open letter to the prime minister, he accused the bank governor of an \u201capparently deliberate attempt to wreck the Indian economy\u201d by refusing to lower interest rates, which would have made it cheaper for small and medium-size companies to get loans.Not content to attack Mr. Rajan on interest rates, a genuine policy choice, Mr. Swamy also questioned his loyalty to his country. Citing the bank governor\u2019s possession of a United States green card, allowing him to work and reside there, Mr. Swamy suggested that Mr. Rajan was \u201cmentally not fully Indian.\u201dMr. Rajan has not publicly commented on his decision to step down, but his parents told the newspaper The Indian Express that their son had been hurt by the attack \u2014 and the government\u2019s failure to rise to his defense.Mr. Swamy is convinced that without his attack, Mr. Rajan \u201cwould have gotten an extension,\u201d because he had supporters and it would have been easy to follow the path of least resistance and allow him to stay in the job.Mr. Rajan\u2019s departure seemed to energize Mr. Swamy, who found a new target in Arvind Subramanian, the Finance Ministry\u2019s chief economic adviser. Dredging up testimony before a United States congressional committee from several years earlier, in which he was critical of India\u2019s policy on intellectual property, Mr. Swamy again raised questions about loyalty and tweeted, \u201cSack him.\u201dLater, as the Indian news media reported increasing unease in the Bharatiya Janata Party about his comments, he protested that he had not been referring to Mr. Jaitley, who looked \u201cvery smart in a coat.\u201dFour days later, Mr. Modi, in a rare interview on Indian television, denounced Mr. Swamy\u2019s attacks as inappropriate and publicity stunts, saying, \u201cthe nation won\u2019t benefit from such behavior.\u201d Too late for Mr. Rajan and his supporters, he rose to the central bank governor\u2019s defense, saying, \u201cI believe Raghuram Rajan\u2019s patriotism is no less than any of ours.\u201dIf Mr. Swamy was chastened, he showed no signs of it. On Twitter, he made fun of Mr. Modi\u2019s interviewer and fired off some new attacks on the Gandhi family.Kaushik Swaminathan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

How Mr. McNeil, a science and health reporter for The New York Times, managed to accomplish this so fast I cannot fathom.In a no-nonsense, declarative writing style, Mr. McNeil tells the history of humanity\u2019s relationship with the Zika virus, recounting how an equatorial African microbe surfaced in the Yap Islands in the Pacific in 2007, infecting 73 percent of the population in just five months. Six years later, the virus, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, arose in Tahiti, or French Polynesia, where an estimated 66 percent of the population was infected over roughly nine months. Polynesian athletes unwittingly carried the virus to Recife, Brazil, where they participated in the FIFA Confederations Cup soccer games. El Ni\u00f1o, which radically altered rainfall patterns across the Amazon region in 2015, is credited with causing a surge in mosquitoes across the area, fostering the Zika explosion.Since Mr. McNeil\u2019s book was finished on June 1, numerous new findings have offered further cause for concern about Zika\u2019s arrival in the United States.Mr. McNeil ends with simple words: \u201cStay alert. And empathetic.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad summary of how all of us \u2014 public health experts, politicians, ordinary citizens \u2014 should respond to outbreaks of contagious disease. Being alert is far superior to the alternatives of nonchalance and fearfulness. And empathy is clearly better than common reactions to disease: stigmatization of the afflicted, disdain toward those most at risk for infection and political dithering that leaves populations in peril with few facts and no financing to stop the microbes\u2019 spread.Laurie Garrett is senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of \u201cThe Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance.\u201dZika The Emerging Epidemic By Donald G.

{"Headline": "A Reading List of Tell-Alls, Strategic Plans and Cautionary Tales in Finance", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byDealBookWith the summer upon us and the so-called Brexit vote behind us, perhaps you might have some time to read one of the terrific books published recently that touch on big themes in business, finance and technology. I\u2019ve been plowing through stacks of them to make your life simpler. Here are some of my favorites.This is a tell-all of Mr. Martinez\u2019s experience in venture capital and later at Facebook, filled with insights about Silicon Valley \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe tech whorehouse\u201d \u2014 mixed with score-settling anecdotes that will occasionally make you laugh out loud. Clearly there will be people who hate this book \u2014 which is probably one of the things that makes it such a great read.The dedication page includes this gem: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d Mr. Martinez is particularly incisive when it comes to illustrating how failed ideas that happen to work are often spun into great successes: \u201cWhat was an improbable bonanza at the hands of the flailing half-blind becomes the inevitable coup of the assured visionary,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe world crowns you a genius, and you start acting like one.\u201dThe biggest surprise for me was that the most successful entrepreneurs didn\u2019t quit their day jobs to pursue their ideas; instead, they stayed at work until they had worked all the kinks out of their plans and gotten them off the ground. The other head-scratcher in this book? Procrastination is a great thing. (This was a terrific revelation.)The book is peppered with stories about the likes of Michael Milken, Bruce Wasserstein, Felix Rohatyn and Martin Lipton \u2014 a cast of characters who defined an age that irrevocably shaped corporate America today. But more than any book I\u2019ve read, Mr. Teitelman\u2019s has managed to capture how power shifted from a company\u2019s boardroom to its shareholders, a change that is often seen as positive but clearly comes with its own pitfalls.\u201cSo profound has been that revolution that memories of an earlier corporate identity \u2014 the patriarchal company managed for the stakeholders, the Platonic corporation \u2014 have grown dim, as if it had never existed,\u201d Mr. Teitelman writes.Mr. Gramm has collected a series of deliciously rich letters, many of which were never before published, sent to chief executives by investors by everyone from Warren Buffett to Ross Perot. They are eye-opening, often chilling and include fascinating lessons about business.My personal favorite is this letter from Mr. Loeb to the chief executive of Star Gas Partners: \u201cIt seems that Star Gas can only serve as your personal \u2018honey pot\u2019 from which to extract salary for yourself and family members, fees for your cronies and to insulate you from the numerous lawsuits that you personally face due to your prior alleged fabrications, misstatements and broken promises. I have known you personally for many years and thus what I am about to say may seem harsh, but is said with some authority. It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites. The matter of repairing the mess you have created should be left to professional management and those that have an economic stake in the outcome.\u201dMr. Greenspan is a fascinating subject because for so long he was considered a genius, only to later be blamed for the financial crisis. Mr. Mallaby does an exquisite job going beyond these two versions of the Greenspan narrative and taking the reader inside the complicated mind of a man who may have had one of the largest ever influences over our economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cosmetic Surgery That\u2019s Just a Click Away", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byThe world of cosmetic surgery \u2014 whether it is wrinkle-zapping Botox shots, breast implants or a full-blown face-lift \u2014 is hardly an industry that seems to be a natural candidate for disruption by start-up entrepreneurs.But the industry is no longer limited to celebrities and wealthy socialites. It has become mainstream in recent years, thanks to TV shows like \u201cBotched\u201d and \u201cExtreme Makeover,\u201d as well as infomercial ads promoting the latest age-defying cosmetic products.As a result, more prospective patients are traveling from doctor to doctor to get information through consultations, which can cost up to $500 a visit.Zwivel goes further than \u201cfind a doctor\u201d search platforms or telemedicine sites like HealthTap, in which doctors give patients medical advice through online chats.Just as Match.com allows strangers to scroll through and evaluate potential dates, Zwivel allows patients and doctors to size up each other and ask questions before committing to surgery.The site allows patients to check out doctors\u2019 credentials, send photos or videos of themselves to preferred doctors, and get those doctors to answer questions about cosmetic procedures and prices, all free.There are now about 1,400 doctors and more than 28,000 patients registered on Zwivel, up from 800 doctors and 6,100 patients at the end of its first year in 2015, said Scott Kera, chief operating officer at Zwivel.Only about 36 percent of people who come in for cosmetic consultations end up getting a procedure, Dr. Breslow said. He attributes the low conversion rate to patients having insufficient information about pricing and procedures before the consultation.\u201cPatients who are severely overweight sometimes think liposuction is the answer, and I tell them, \u2018You don\u2019t need liposuction; you need to lose weight,\u2019\u201d Dr. Breslow said. \u201cOr a patient may want $20,000 worth of surgery and thinks the whole thing is going to cost $200,\u201d he said.He created Zwivel with the idea that if patients had a faster and easier way to see doctors\u2019 credentials and get doctors to answer questions about surgical procedures and prices in advance, they would be better informed and more likely to sign up when they went for the in-office consultation.Still, it was a lengthy process to get Zwivel off the ground. In 2012, with $250,000 of their own money, Dr. Breslow and Dr. Abramowitz, who is a dentist, hired two teams of programmers and site designers over two years. None could build the site.Two years later, in 2014, Mr. Kera, who previously founded and sold another technology start-up, came on board and assembled a team that built the site in six months.The company waived the doctors\u2019 subscription fees in 2015 as it built up the site. Since introducing the fee in February, the company has signed on 70 new doctors. Zwivel\u2019s revenue, which has totaled $427,000 since February, is expected to top $1 million this year, $4 million in 2018 and $15 million in 2020, Dr. Breslow said.Dr. Breslow and Dr. Abramowitz raised $3 million in financing from family and friends in 2015 and another $2 million in 2016.Zwivel has been marketing the site through trade conventions and national TV spots on Bravo, Lifetime and E, as well as ads on iHeartRadio. But many patients are finding it through web searches.When Amber Ingerman decided to have breast enlargement surgery in 2015, she contacted 12 doctors and had five formal office consultations. She accumulated fees of about $500 \u2014 and still hadn\u2019t found a surgeon she liked.\u201cI was feeling frustrated,\u201d said Ms. Ingerman, 29, who lives in Fort Worth. \u201cI had wanted the surgery for about 10 years, but I didn\u2019t want just anyone touching me.\u201d Then, in early 2016, she discovered Zwivel while surfing the web for information on doctors.Ms. Ingerman was impressed with the response and credentials of Dr. Rod Rohrich, a prominent plastic surgeon in Dallas who was on Zwivel. She immediately booked a formal consultation with him, and had the surgery a month later.Initially, some doctors questioned the need for a virtual consultation, saying that the face-to-face consultation was their strength and the best way to get a customer to sign on.More than 80 percent of his patients who come through Zwivel for a formal consultation wind up getting a cosmetic procedure, compared with 40 to 50 percent for other patients, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an invaluable tool,\u201d he said.An advantage of Zwivel is that it allows doctors to clear up misconceptions early in the process.\u201cI get patients who say they want Kim Kardashian\u2019s tush or Brad Pitt\u2019s chin,\u201d Dr. Zemmel said. \u201cI can\u2019t cut and paste Kim Kardashian\u2019s butt on you; that\u2019s not realistic.\u201dAs more new patients discover the site, the company sees significant growth potential.Susan Delaney, 49, of Haskell, N.J., had been looking for a doctor periodically for about two years for a tummy-tuck procedure before she came across Zwivel in 2016 through a link on a doctor\u2019s website. Once on the site, she quickly narrowed down her choices, was impressed with Dr. Breslow\u2019s same-day reply, and scheduled her surgery with him.Getting pricing ahead of the formal consultation was particularly helpful. \u201cThe first thing you need to know is if you can afford it so that you\u2019re not wasting your time and the doctor\u2019s time,\u201d she said.Still, not everyone in the industry is convinced that the virtual consultation is particularly useful or accurate.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give pricing because the photos aren\u2019t necessarily indicative of everything. A surgeon is going to want to feel their skin, and assess the skin tone and it\u2019s hard to do that over photos and video,\u201d said Dr. David H. Song, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.Dr. Breslow, however, dismisses this concern. \u201cOf course you need to see the patient,\u201d he said. \u201cZwivel is like Match.com. You still have to go on the date; you just want to know if the date is worth going out on.\u201dMs. Ingerman of Fort Worth was so impressed with her experience with Zwivel that she is already considering another procedure with Dr. Rohrich, this time, rhinoplasty. She has even introduced her mother, Angel, to the site.\u201cAs people find out they can do these consults online to find out prices and doctors\u2019 experience,\u201d she said, \u201cI think Zwivel will completely take over cosmetic surgery and how you shop for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are Mr. Kaine\u2019s positions on some key issues, and how they align with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s views.Mr. Kaine is an outspoken advocate of free trade, but he appears to be shifting that position since Mrs. Clinton selected him on Friday.He has defended the North American Free Trade Agreement and voted in favor of \u201cfast track\u201d authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that President Obama has championed. It now appears that Mr. Kaine, in joining the Democratic ticket, will oppose the deal.Mr. Kaine personally opposes the death penalty, but he oversaw 11 executions during his tenure as governor, and Virginia has had the second-highest number of executions since the 1970s. He said his obligation to uphold the law as governor overrode his moral opposition to capital punishment, which was shaped by his Roman Catholic faith. In the Senate, Mr. Kaine has advocated overhauling the criminal justice system and supported a measure that would give judges more flexibility on sentencing.Last week in Cleveland, New York Times photographers covered the Republican National Convention at \u2014 and outside of \u2014 Quicken Loans Arena.Mr. Kaine supports Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions that would have shielded as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowed them to legally work in the United States. He also backs a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would allow those living in the country illegally to gain legal residency if they pay taxes and a fine.When he was governor of Virginia, Mr. Kaine helped expand the state\u2019s preschool programs that serve at-risk children in families with incomes near or below the poverty line. He also introduced a bill in the Senate to expand nationwide access to prekindergarten programs. Mr. Kaine supported the Every Student Succeeds act, which de-emphasized standardized testing and gave states more flexibility to set education policies.

Mr. Kaine has expressed concern about the rising sea levels along the coast of Virginia, which he fears could impair military operations and endanger businesses. But he also supported opening Virginia\u2019s coast to offshore oil drilling.Mr. Kaine supports \u201ctargeted spending reductions\u201d but wants to close tax loopholes for the wealthy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Again, an Oracle Deal Benefits Ellison", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsLawrence J. Ellison is cashing in again.Oracle, where he is executive chairman, will buy NetSuite, a cloud company in which he controls a 45 percent stake, for $9.3 billion, a whopping 44 percent premium to where the shares were trading before news reports first mentioned a possible deal. The combination makes strategic sense, but Mr. Ellison appears to be benefiting from a side investment at Oracle\u2019s expense.The line between Mr. Ellison and the $162 billion business-software group he founded has always been a bit blurry, sometimes contentiously so. Last year, Oracle paid to lease aircraft, advertise at a tennis tournament and sponsor a sailing team, all via companies owned by Mr. Ellison. In 2013, he settled a lawsuit, forgoing potential payments of more than $500 million from Oracle in relation to the company\u2019s purchase of a data-storage company he controlled.NetSuite was founded by a former employee of Oracle, bankrolled by Mr. Ellison. While Oracle concentrated on selling enterprise software to giant corporations, the upstart focused on serving small and medium-size companies using the cloud. The two companies\u2019 businesses have increasingly overlapped as larger customers have become comfortable using web-based software.As a result, it makes strategic sense to combine the two companies. And the process seems to have been handled correctly, with a committee of independent Oracle directors calling the shots. The premium, while hefty, is not out of line with other cloud deals: last month, Salesforce.com agreed to pay a 56 percent premium for Demandware, for example.Still, the situation is rife with potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Ellison, both in the transaction and in the opportunity arguably missed by Oracle. NetSuite shares have quadrupled since the company\u2019s initial public offering of stock in 2007, while Oracle\u2019s have roughly doubled. Had Oracle under Mr. Ellison either competed more fiercely for cloud business or invested in NetSuite itself, it might not need to pay up for the business now.It is not the first time Oracle has ceded a slice of a potential market to a company founded by a former staff member and financed by Mr. Ellison. Salesforce.com is now worth $55 billion. Oracle shareholders are surely happy to have Mr. Ellison on their side, given his golden touch. They might just sometimes wish he worked even more of his magic for Oracle rather than himself.Advertisement"}

Prosecutors had collected evidence that Mr. Najib had deposited millions of dollars of public money into his personal bank account. Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail was ready to file criminal charges, according to Najib advisers and opposition leaders.Mr. Najib had a reputation as a gentleman who was slow to act and never fired anyone. But when word of the plot reached him last July, he moved quickly. He dismissed both Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, the man who would have taken his job, and the attorney general. And he blocked further inquiries into the allegations against him.\u201cThey took it for granted that he was a sitting duck,\u201d said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament. \u201cHe turned the tables on them.\u201dThroughout Mr. Najib\u2019s 40 years in public office, he has been easy to underestimate.But Mr. Najib, a genteel, British-educated aristocrat who became prime minister in 2009, faces no realistic challenge to his authority and is confidently looking ahead to winning re-election in 2018.The bank transfers are not the first scandal to threaten the career of Mr. Najib, 63, one of America\u2019s most important allies in Southeast Asia. Over the years, he has been accused of having ties to a murder, taking kickbacks from the purchase of military hardware and helping concoct a criminal prosecution against a rival.He has deployed the formidable powers of his office to impede investigations, silence critics, block media outlets and maintain the backing of his largely rural, Muslim base. He has deftly played Malaysia\u2019s brand of money politics, distributing cash to buy party leaders\u2019 loyalty.As prime minister, he oversees Parliament, the cabinet, the police and the intelligence branch. As president of the governing party, he decides who holds key leadership positions and sits atop a vast patronage system that affects the wealth and livelihood of thousands of people.He appointed himself finance minister, giving himself control of the state investment fund at the heart of the scandal.For the United States, Mr. Najib has offered the promise of a moderate Muslim ally and an Asian partner in counterterrorism, whose nation is one of the 12 negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. As a sign of Malaysia\u2019s growing importance, President Obama visited the country and met with Mr. Najib in 2014 and 2015. In between, they golfed together in Hawaii.While that relationship did not deter the Justice Department investigation, his relationship with Saudi Arabia has been more helpful. Mr. Najib\u2019s advisers say most of the money at issue was a gift from the Saudis, partly to help finance his 2013 election campaign, a position the Saudi government has loosely corroborated.Malaysians grumble about Mr. Najib\u2019s wealth, which he claims to have inherited, and the extravagance of his wife, Rosmah Mansor, who is known for epic overseas shopping excursions and her multimillion-dollar collection of Herm\u00e8s Birkin handbags.The allegations of high-level corruption and the lack of any impartial Malaysian investigation highlight the fact that the region\u2019s movement toward democracy has left Malaysia untouched, said Donald Greenlees, an authority on Southeast Asia with Australian National University.\u201cNajib is a throwback to the era of Marcos\u2019s Philippines and Suharto\u2019s Indonesia with ruling families hungry for power and great wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cImelda had her shoes and Rosmah has her Birkin bags. But the bags are vastly more valuable than the shoes.\u201dMr. Najib has acknowledged receiving hundreds of millions of dollars, but says he has done nothing wrong and took nothing for personal gain. He said his government would \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Justice Department investigation.\u201cDon\u2019t think I am a crook,\u201d he told the party faithful in March at a rally in Pahang, his home state. \u201cIf I had wanted to rob, I would have robbed the forest here long ago. I didn\u2019t take a single tree in Pahang. I didn\u2019t take the bauxite mine. I didn\u2019t take anything.\u201dMr. Najib is accused of taking money from a state investment fund called 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. He gave himself extraordinary authority over the fund as both finance minister and, until recently, advisory board chairman. The United States attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said Malaysian officials had laundered more than $3 billion from the fund through American financial institutions.Mr. Najib\u2019s advisers acknowledge that he received $1 billion but assert that most of it was a gift from a member of the Saudi royal family.Mr. Najib and Ms. Rosmah declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article.Mr. Najib was destined to become prime minister, his friends and supporters say. His father was Malaysia\u2019s second prime minister, and his uncle the third.Balding, with a neatly trimmed graying mustache and silver-rim glasses, Mr. Najib behaves like a British gentleman with impeccable manners, they say. He is often dressed formally even for late-night meetings at his home. He is viewed as a numbers guy with an keen eye for detail.\u201cHe\u2019s very cool,\u201d said Fatmi Che Salleh, his longtime friend and former political secretary. \u201cHe takes things one at a time. Everything is planned, what to do, how to do, especially now we see so many attacks on him.\u201dMr. Najib grew up in a household immersed in the politics of an emerging nation and its governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO.He was educated in Britain and studied economics, rejecting the advice of his father, Prime Minister Abdul Razak, to become an accountant.As prime minister, Mr. Abdul was well known for his frugality. He refused his children\u2019s plea to install a swimming pool at the official residence because it would waste government funds, one brother recalled. The lesson on thrift was another piece of fatherly wisdom Mr. Najib ignored.When Mr. Abdul died in 1976, Mr. Najib ran for his father\u2019s parliamentary seat and at 22 became the youngest person ever elected to Malaysia\u2019s Parliament. He married a minor princess, with whom he had three children.In the mid-1980s, Mr. Najib met Ms. Rosmah, who was married with two children. The pair divorced their spouses and married in 1987. They have two children together.Mr. Najib steadily climbed the party ladder, receiving help along the way from UMNO leaders indebted to his father, including Mahathir Mohamed, who succeeded Mr. Najib\u2019s uncle as prime minister.\u201cI owed his father a great deal,\u201d Mr. Mahathir, 91, said in an interview. \u201cIf I could do something for the son, especially as the son looks very promising, I would do it.\u201dHe has spent his entire adult life in elective office, living in a bubble, surrounded by aides and devotees. On a trip to Europe, he did not know how to check in for a flight or find his departure gate, said a friend who traveled with him. He never packed his own suitcase; for a two-day trip, his servants packed him six suits.Mr. Najib was deputy prime minister when the murder of a Mongolian woman and corruption allegations over the $1.2 billion purchase of two Franco-Spanish Scorpene submarines nearly derailed his career.Mr. Najib has denied meeting Ms. Altantuya or having a role in her death. But a decade later, he is still dogged by allegations that he was connected to the killing and received kickbacks from the submarine purchases. The French authorities are investigating whether a French company paid Mr. Najib and Mr. Abdul Razak $130 million to secure the sale. The two deny any wrongdoing.Mr. Najib\u2019s name has also been attached to another murky episode, the criminal case that sidelined his biggest rival, Anwar Ibrahim, a former deputy prime minister who became leader of the opposition.In a case widely seen as politically motivated, Mr. Anwar was imprisoned on sodomy charges in 1998. After his release in 2004, he began rebuilding the fractured opposition, and new sodomy charges were filed in 2008.The accuser was Saiful Bukhari Azlan, an aide in Mr. Anwar\u2019s party. At a trial, Mr. Saiful testified that he had met with Mr. Najib at his home two days before the sexual encounter. Mr. Saiful also met with senior police officials before the encounter.It has never been fully explained how Mr. Najib, then deputy prime minister, happened to meet with a staff member from the opposition party at that time, or why Mr. Saiful met with police officials.Mr. Anwar was acquitted and led the opposition to victory in the popular vote in 2013, though not by enough to overcome district lines favoring Mr. Najib\u2019s coalition.In 2014, an appellate court overturned Mr. Anwar\u2019s acquittal and sentenced him to five years in prison. Opposition parties have yet to coalesce behind another leader.When Mr. Najib became prime minister seven years ago, he inherited a political system awash in cash.\u201cIn Malaysia, politics is about money,\u201d said Oh Ei Sun, a former political secretary to Mr. Najib and an adjunct senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s not a contest about your brilliant ideas.\u201d Indeed, parties vie for votes by funneling money to loyal followers and financing overdue public works projects.He poured more than $300 million into the 2013 parliamentary elections campaign, his advisers say.Malaysia has no limits on how much party leaders can raise or spend, and there is no reporting requirement, said Wan Saiful Wan Jan, the chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs, a Malaysia think tank. The money is tax free, and much of it is distributed to local party leaders, who can easily pocket a share.No law prohibits candidates from depositing donations in their personal bank accounts, even $1 billion.\u201cI don\u2019t think Najib is the only one,\u201d Mr. Wan Saiful said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s the biggest.\u201dThe story of the Saudi gift has evolved with new revelations about deposits into Mr. Najib\u2019s accounts.Mr. Najib\u2019s government said in January that $681 million was a gift from a member of the Saudi royal family. After questions were raised about additional deposits of hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Najib\u2019s advisers said Saudi donors had given him about $1 billion.His office declined to provide documentation demonstrating that either sum was a gift.In April, after Mr. Najib and his aides met privately with Mr. Jubeir in Istanbul, Mr. Jubeir said Mr. Najib had received a gift from an unidentified Saudi source.Mr. Najib has cultivated close ties with Saudi Arabia, but even so, experts say, a gift of $1 billion was unlikely. \u201cNobody believes that the money came from Saudi Arabia,\u201d said James Chin, the director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania.The Justice Department complaint said Mr. Najib\u2019s relatives and associates had taken more than $1 billion from 1MDB, spending it on luxury real estate, gambling, Hollywood moviemaking and high-priced artwork.Ibrahim Suffian, the director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency in Malaysia, said surveys showed that two-thirds of the public were unhappy with Mr. Najib, yet people feel powerless to remove him from office.As popular support has eroded, Mr. Najib\u2019s government has blocked news outlets, prevented opposition leaders from campaigning and prosecuted critics under a colonial-era sedition act that he once promised to repeal.\u201cClearly, in order to save his own political skin, he\u2019s prepared to destroy what little remains of basic civil liberties and human rights in Malaysia,\u201d said Phil Robertson, the deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch.The effort to force Mr. Najib from office \u2014 and the threat of prison \u2014 have given him new resolve to remain in power until the 2018 election and beyond, advisers say. His prospects are good.\u201cHe will be more invincible in 2018,\u201d said Mr. Oh, the former Najib aide, \u201cbecause as it is, he is already unstoppable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fight Over Emails Yields New Details on Role of Outside \u2018Agents\u2019 for de Blasio", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 After the rocky conclusion to his first year in office, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought counsel at the start of 2015 from his most trusted advisers.In 43 separate email chains during the first half of that year, the mayor\u2019s office and a few outside consultants discussed internal opinion surveys and formulated strategy on some of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s most pressing concerns: the New York Police Department, the budget, election reform, media coordination and the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat.One chain concerned charter schools; another dealt with affordable housing in East New York, Brooklyn. Three discussed \u201cthe most effective message to employ in raising funds to advance the mayor\u2019s policy agendas.\u201dThese internal discussions about public matters are now part of a court battle here, as lawyers for a nonprofit aligned with the mayor are fighting to keep those emails confidential, resisting subpoenas for that information by the state\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics.In court documents unsealed on Wednesday, lawyers for the city and the nonprofit echoed that assertion, saying their closeness to the mayor protects them from the subpoenas.The court documents, unsealed in State Supreme Court late on Wednesday, were filed in a dispute over an investigation into the Campaign for One New York by the state\u2019s ethics panel, which has been seeking to determine whether the nonprofit ran afoul of state regulations by failing to register as a lobbyist in 2015.But beyond the narrow question of lobbying, the documents filed in the case offered the deepest look yet at the nature and frequency of emails from outside consultants, several of whom also represent clients with business before the city, even as City Hall and the nonprofit continue to resist full disclosure.They included an affidavit from Emma Wolfe, a top aide to Mr. de Blasio, in which she described emails with those consultants containing analysis of \u201cthe impact of political developments on the mayor\u2019s policy agenda\u201d and discussion of \u201cthe most effective message to advance that agenda.\u201d Ms. Wolfe said the 135 city employees who report to her treated those emails as confidential.The documents also contain the list of 43 email chains along with brief descriptions of who was involved in the correspondence and the topic. There were emails from those previously named as city agents: Bill Hyers, who ran Campaign for One New York and is also a partner in the public relations firm Hilltop Public Solutions; Nicholas Baldick of Hilltop; and Jonathan Rosen of the public affairs consulting firm BerlinRosen.Several others were not previously named among those outside advisers whose communications would be shielded from disclosure, including David Walker, Ben Winston and Anna Greenberg from the polling and consulting firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research; and Nathan Smith, of Red Horse Strategies, who at one point also worked for the nonprofit. (There were no listed communications with the United States ambassador to South Africa, Patrick Gaspard, who was also among those named as city agents by the de Blasio administration.)Eric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s top spokesman, said in a statement that the nonprofit \u201cworked closely with the city\u201d to secure universal prekindergarten and affordable housing. The documents filed in the case, Mr. Phillips said, \u201cshow that no lobbying occurred in 2015,\u201d and he called on the ethics panel \u201cto end this politically motivated fishing expedition.\u201dThe Campaign for One New York, the nonprofit arm of Mayor Bill de Blasio, has refused to comply with a subpoena, filed on April 22, by a state ethics panel that is investigating whether the mayor\u2019s group engaged in unregistered lobbying. The two are fighting over the matter in court in Albany.In her affidavit, Ms. Wolfe described the sorts of public opinion surveys commissioned by the nonprofit and its hired consultants that she said were \u201cintended to assist \u2014 and did assist \u2014 the mayor\u2019s office in formulating the most effective message.\u201d\u201cIf such documents were made public, elected officials might be reluctant \u2014 and might not even choose \u2014 to obtain the information derived from public opinion surveys,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.Arguing before Justice Denise A. Hartman in a courtroom here on Wednesday, a lawyer for the nonprofit, Lawrence A. Mandelker, said that communications between Mr. de Blasio and the nonprofit did not have to be disclosed to the panel because, among other reasons, of a \u201cdeliberative process\u201d privilege that applies to executive branch communications.In essence, the nonprofit, which has taken unlimited donations from developers and others that do business before the city, acts as a kind of kitchen cabinet for Mr. de Blasio, and its advice does not have to be turned over, Mr. Mandelker argued.This was not just the nonprofit\u2019s opinion, he said: It was also contained in Ms. Wolfe\u2019s affidavit. \u201cThat\u2019s the City of New York asserting a privilege,\u201d Mr. Mandelker told the court.Those views were echoed in a separate affidavit from the city\u2019s Law Department by an assistant corporation counsel, Thomas B. Roberts, who said the standard applied to outside advisers involved in government decision making, not just those inside government.Lawyers for the nonprofit, from the firm Kantor, Davidoff, Mandelker, Twomey, Gallanty & Kesten, have resisted responding to portions of an August 2015 subpoena from the state ethics panel that seek all correspondence and meetings between the Campaign for One New York and the mayor. They have refused to comply entirely with a second subpoena, from April 22, that seeks information related to the nonprofit\u2019s expenses, income and correspondence surrounding donations.Mr. de Blasio has also defended the city\u2019s approach in withholding correspondence with consultants from public disclosure.The state ethics panel, in one of its filings, bristled at the assertions, and highlighted one example of an email that had been withheld but was eventually turned over, an exchange between Ms. Wolfe, using her Gmail account, Mr. Hyers and John Del Cecato, a consultant from AKPD Message and Media.The exchange, from March 2015, appeared to reflect a typical nuts-and-bolts strategy conversation, replete with the jargon of polling, political messaging and even conjecture about what the governor might be up to.\u201cCuomo is *planning* to be on the air Tuesday or Wed of next week,\u201d Mr. Del Cecato wrote to Mr. Hyers and to Ms. Wolfe. \u201cSo maybe a final blast before and after budget is done to champion what he did? That\u2019s what I know for now.\u201dMs. Wolfe responded: \u201cBudget done by then \u2026 victory lap /// pounding for leg session.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Mr. Del Cecato wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Drivers Fume as Road and Bridge Work Stops", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported bySeveral miles from Princeton, drivers are playing chicken as they detour across a single-lane bridge. In Summit, the prolonged shutdown of a century-old crossing has forced nearby businesses to lay off workers. And in Hoboken, the delay of the long-awaited rehabilitation of a critical connection to the Lincoln Tunnel threatens to disrupt back-to-school traffic.Across New Jersey, residents accustomed to complaining about all of the road work undertaken during the summer months now have something different to moan about: Hundreds of those improvement projects have ground to a halt, victims of a political stalemate among state lawmakers. In many places, the orange cones and mesh netting are still in place, but the backhoes and road graders sit idle, as do more than 1,000 construction workers across the state.The long days and abundant sunshine of the season make it prime time for fixing the roads and bridges that keep things moving in New Jersey, which, like many states, is saddled with aging infrastructure. But for more than a week, those ideal conditions have been squandered as the state\u2019s political leaders argue about whether and how to raise the state\u2019s gasoline tax.With no agreement and the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund \u2014 which is financed by the tax \u2014 nearly drained, Gov. Chris Christie ordered that all work stop on a long list of projects throughout the state. That left the completion of construction scheduled for this year in jeopardy, said Anthony Attanasio, executive director of the Utility and Transportation Contractors Association of New Jersey.\u201cOne thing everyone agrees on is that government is responsible for providing safe and reliable infrastructure for taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Attanasio said. But, he added, since Mr. Christie\u2019s executive order took effect on July 8, \u201cwe\u2019re in this weird limbo where no work\u2019s getting done.\u201dWith Mr. Christie and other Republican leaders at their party\u2019s national convention in Cleveland this week, a deal to end the stalemate is unlikely in the coming days. The chances of reaching one before the Democrats wrap up their convention in Philadelphia late next week seem nearly as slim.James Kennelly, a spokesman for Hudson County, said officials there had been advised to expect the suspension of work on the Park Avenue Bridge, which connects Hoboken and Weehawken, to extend to the end of July.What is clear is that shutting down and restarting projects will add to their cost, driving up the total price significantly in some cases. Hudson County, Mr. Kennelly said, estimates the stoppage will add as much as $120,000 to the cost of rehabilitating the bridge.In several towns on the northern border of Princeton, the closing of the Route 518 bridge this month \u2014 and the subsequent shutdown of work two days later \u2014 has sent cars onto other traffic-clogged routes over the Millstone River, leading to angry exchanges among drivers. The work was scheduled to be finished this fall. Now the bridge could be closed much longer.Donato Nieman, the administrator in Montgomery Township, said he had seen drivers getting into arguments when they were rerouted to a one-lane bridge to the north. Some drivers have even played chicken on the bridge, facing each other until someone backs down, he said.\u201cYou get the rolling down of windows and the hurling of less-than-charming language,\u201d Mr. Nieman said, noting that officers were sent to park in driveways nearby in an effort to encourage drivers to behave.The police in nearby Franklin Township, in Somerset County, have received complaints about road rage shouting matches at another crossing to the south. Sgt. Philip Rizzo, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the community had seen major traffic backups, especially during the evening commute.Franklin Township asked the New Jersey Department of Transportation to deem a bridge repair project essential, citing the bridge's proximity to a local hospital. The state has halted all non-essential transportation repairs because its transportation trust fund is nearly out of money, causing the bridge to be closed indefinitely.His wife, Victory Chase, was stuck in traffic at an alternate crossing as she returned home on a recent evening after volunteering at a library.\u201cIt took me an hour to do something that takes less than 10 minutes normally,\u201d Ms. Chase said.Stephen Schapiro, a spokesman for the state\u2019s Transportation Department, said officials had developed the detour with local communities before the project began and that the Route 518 bridge would have been closed this week even if a shutdown had not been ordered. Since work on the bridge had already started, it was no longer safe for traffic, Mr. Schapiro said.Down the block from the Route 518 crossing, Barry M. Gerlack, the owner of a travel business, said he was furious with Mr. Christie over the impasse. Not only is his commuting longer, but a pizza deliveryman recently called him frantically asking for detour directions in the hopes of keeping a pie hot.\u201cWe have our own Bridgegate here \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said.At the Morris Avenue bridge in Summit, residents complained of rerouted traffic filling quiet neighborhoods with the sounds of revving engines and honking horns. On Monday afternoon, a group of teenagers walked down the sidewalk as they sought a way around the closed bridge.Jim Jorgensen, 50, a financial analyst who lives in Summit, walked past the idle construction site.\u201cHow long does it take to build a bridge?\u201d he asked.The project in Hoboken had been underway for just two days when Mr. Christie ordered the shutdown, Mr. Kennelly, the Hoboken spokesman, said. Workers had begun chipping away at the old concrete on the bridge, one of two that connect Hoboken and Weehawken just south of the Lincoln Tunnel.\u201cOur main concern was that we found ourselves in a tricky position because it is very difficult to get in and out of Hoboken,\u201d Mr. Kennelly said. \u201cWe wanted to try to manage things so that we didn\u2019t increase any period of time of aggravation.\u201dCounty officials asked the contractors to cover up the work its crew had done and reopen the lane of traffic that had been closed off, Mr. Kennelly said. Before the suspension of the work, the plan had been to have crews work for 12 hours a day six days a week through mid-September.Under that schedule, the project could have been completed without much nighttime labor and before school buses start rolling again in the fall, Mr. Kennelly said. But now that plan will have to be reworked with the understanding that it will extend well past the end of summer.Construction industry officials, Mr. Attanasio said, still hope that elected officials can work out a solution before the end of the month. If not, he said, the stalemate could grow into a more dire condition.\u201cIf you get into August, you\u2019d be going from hundreds of projects to thousands of projects\u201d shut down, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to affect every single person in New Jersey and anyone who travels through our state and anyone who ships goods and services to and from our state.\u201dNate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Japan Cuts Festival, Films by Sion Sono That Don\u2019t Fit His Bad-Boy Label", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookThese are some of the movies that Sion Sono, the most recognizable, if not the most universally celebrated, director in Japan, is best known for in the United States. Perhaps you can spot a trend. Labels like provocateur, bad boy, maverick and cult favorite follow Mr. Sono around like Pok\u00e9mon Go players chasing a Weedle.The film traces the very uneventful days of an android who\u2019s a kind of interstellar U.P.S. driver, delivering packages containing tokens of memory \u2014 a fishing lure, a cigarette butt, a crumpled paper cup \u2014 to lonely humans. It recalls Tarkovsky, Antonioni or the Japanese avant-gardist Hiroshi Teshigahara, rather than more customary Sono comparisons like John Waters or Lars von Trier, and viewers who like their Sono films fast and furious may find its rhythms too slow and its messages too opaque. But this is not a chilly film \u2014 it\u2019s warm and funny in its own low-key way. Some of that comes from the production design, with a spaceship that, inside and out, looks and functions like a small house in a Japanese village. More comes from the very human performance of Megumi Kagurazaka, Mr. Sono\u2019s wife, as the android delivery woman.It makes sense that both \u201cLove & Peace\u201d and \u201cThe Whispering Star\u201d were projects that Mr. Sono first thought of decades ago. \u201cSimply put, 25 years ago, they weren\u2019t the kind of films that would be accepted by the Japanese film industry,\u201d he said recently, though an interpreter, by Skype from Japan. Financing for both films materialized around the same time, with a benefactor putting up the money for \u201cLove & Peace,\u201d and Mr. Sono forming his own production company to make \u201cThe Whispering Star.\u201dThe Japan Cuts festival, which will present 29 features from Thursday through July 24, also includes \u201cThe Sion Sono,\u201d a documentary about this filmmaker directed by Arata Oshima, son of another controversial Japanese director, Nagisa Oshima. (The full Japanese title is \u201cA Creature Named Sion Sono.\u201d) It was shot while Mr. Sono was directing \u201cThe Whispering Star,\u201d and in it he says: \u201cIf I were 30 making this and \u2018Love & Peace,\u2019 I\u2019d have been called a genius. With girls after me.\u201dIn the documentary, he also discusses the attitude of Japanese critics and moviegoers toward his films, saying that they reserve their approval for work that doesn\u2019t \u201cembarrass\u201d the nation. \u201cOften, when my films do well in Japan, it\u2019s like a reimport \u2014 it\u2019s when they\u2019ve done very well abroad, and then they come back into Japan,\u201d he said in the Skype interview. \u201cIn that sense, I do think an international audience understands my work more.\u201dAiko Masubuchi, a programmer of Japan Cuts, described the appeal of Mr. Sono\u2019s movies in auteurist terms. \u201cNo matter how over the top the movie is, the person is always there,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s talking about something that\u2019s very serious or sad, or something incredibly juvenile, like up-skirt photography, it feels very much like the person is still behind it, no matter what.\u201dWhile acknowledging that the Sono films in the festival were departures from the style American viewers are accustomed to, she said that they share with all his work a profound sense of inquiry and curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious engagement in the big questions we have,\u201d she said. \u201cIn \u2018Whispering Star,\u2019 why do people do these things? Why do people have memories? Why do people send these packages? Why are we even living in this world?\u201dFor the viewer looking forward to another \u201cCold Fish\u201d or \u201cLove Exposure,\u201d she said, keeping an open mind would be worth the trouble.\u201cI would ask them to come to see Sion Sono,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIf you come into these movies wanting to know more about the filmmaker behind them, I think you might discover something new about somebody you thought you knew.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an actress in \u201cThe Whispering Star.\u201d She is Megumi Kagurazaka, not Kagarazaka.The Japan Cuts festival runs from Thursday through July 24 at Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan; japansociety.org.Advertisement"}

Gruen, president of the City Club, said in a statement that the ruling was a \u201cvaluable step in ensuring that this secretive and misguided project will not get off the ground, potentially damaging the environment of the Estuarine Sanctuary in which the island would be located, until the courts have definitively determined whether all applicable laws have been complied with.\u201dPier55 Inc., a nonprofit that is covering most of the cost of the park and would help operate it, described the injunction in a statement as a \u201ctemporary delay.\u201d Pier55 Inc. is financed by Mr. Diller, his wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, and their family foundation.\u201cBy continuing its misguided crusade, the City Club is obstructing the will of the local community and undermining a much-needed effort to create new public parks in New York City,\u201d the statement said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a project born in secrecy and foisted on the city and public without proper procedures,\u201d Mr. Emery said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re challenging that nontransparent process.\u201dThe Hudson River Park Trust, which would run Pier 55, said in statement that it did not believe the suit was based on environmental concerns, but \u201csimply about a small group of people who want to determine, outside the public process, how the Hudson River Park Trust is governed and how Mr. Diller\u2019s money should be spent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In June, his pay was cut after a disappointing year in which the company\u2019s share price tumbled 38 percent and pretax profit slipped 7 percent.Questions around the feasibility of Mr. Bailey\u2019s continuing to hold two executive positions were nevertheless rife, and his move was welcomed by analysts.\u201cBurberry seemed stuck with a less-than-ideal senior management structure,\u201d Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cIt was clear that the \u2018dual role\u2019 experiment was not working, and that both the business and the share price had suffered.\u201dMr. Solca added, \u201cThis is a step forward for Burberry.\u201dThe move does not signal the end of the designer-as-chief-executive trend, however, a model that has served some companies, like Giorgio Armani, well. Last month, the designer Alexander Wang was appointed chief executive of the company that bears his name, taking on a dual role, after the resignation of Rodrigo Bazan. Mr. Bazan had left to join Thom Browne. This followed the news that Marcus Wainwright, previously co-chief executive and designer of Rag & Bone, would become sole chief and designer.Those companies are significantly smaller than Burberry, and privately held. But the industry will still be watching to see if they can pull off what Mr. Bailey seemingly could not.Mr. Bailey will report to John Peace, the Burberry chairman, as will the new chief executive, Mr. Gobbetti. A 20-year veteran of the luxury industry, with stints at Givenchy, Moschino and Bottega Veneta, Mr. Gobbetti will be \u201cresponsible for all commercial, operational and financial elements of the business,\u201d Burberry said in a statement.\u201cMarco brings incredible experience and skills in luxury and retail with him that will be invaluable to us,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in the statement. \u201cI am delighted to welcome Marco, and I am looking forward to working closely with him alongside the rest of our highly talented teams.

A fund to help European news outlets adapt to the web popped up in 2015. And in March, a virtual reality exhibition began at a Belgian museum to showcase a Renaissance painter.All these projects are aimed at supporting European culture and education, helping the region embrace the fast-changing online world. And all are financed by Google.Google has been staging a full-court press in Europe to finance everything from start-up offices to YouTube-sponsored music concerts, trying to remake its image in the region as it battles a mounting list of regulatory woes.Those efforts represent a campaign of \u201csoft lobbying\u201d where instead of, or alongside, paying registered lobbyists to advocate its case in the corridors of power, a company looks to change the minds of the public at large. In Google\u2019s case, experts say, its push to sponsor digital skills training, museum exhibitions and other programs equates to an almost unprecedented effort by a United States tech company to change the perceptions of Europeans, many of whom still see it as an American interloper that does not play by the rules.Google\u2019s soft lobbying efforts are by no means unique, and have filled a funding gap that governments and European rivals are unwilling, or incapable, of matching.But the company has ramped up its campaign in recent years, earmarking about $450 million from 2015 to 2017 \u2014 based on Google\u2019s public filings and industry estimates of its activities \u2014 to revamp its reputation with Europeans and, more important, the region\u2019s policy makers who have the power to issue fines totaling billions of dollars.Google\u2019s vast array of programs \u201care important for our partners, for us and for the countries where we work,\u201d he added.Even before its recent charm offensive, it was one of the largest spenders on direct lobbying in Brussels, home to most of its European regulatory headaches.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cOf course, Google has its own agenda to show to Europe\u2019s political powers that they aren\u2019t bad guys,\u201d said Michael Peters, chief executive of Euronews. \u201cBut this gives organizations like ours the chance to do these types of projects. It wouldn\u2019t have happened without Google.\u201dThe Silicon Valley company is also tapping into a more friendly audience: Europe\u2019s tech community.In Dublin, home to Google\u2019s European headquarters, that has involved a one-year course in software coding for local teachers. Participants in the class, run by Trinity College Dublin, have been invited to the company\u2019s glass-fronted offices on the shores of the Liffey River to learn directly from Google staff members.\u201cI\u2019m so confident now that I can teach my students anything and they can just run with it,\u201d said Helen O\u2019Kelly, 38, a former Microsoft employee who retrained to become an I.T. teacher.Not all of Google\u2019s good will activities have been so well accepted.Museums still regularly question Google\u2019s motives because the tools like high-definition cameras to digitize artwork are all free. Institutions also have raised concerns about who controls the copyright of the masterpieces (Google says all rights remain with the institutions).The tech giant has often picked museums with a digital connection. That includes the restoration of Bletchley Park, a museum on the outskirts of London that housed British codebreakers during World War II and that helped spur the creation of modern-day computers.\u201cThat\u2019s typical of Americans,\u201d she said when asked about a large poster at the entrance to Bletchley Park highlighting Google\u2019s financial support.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Europeans that Google hopes to train on digital skills.

Whenever there is a terrorist attack by Muslim extremists, we look to our enemies like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. But perhaps we should also look to our \u201cfriends,\u201d like Saudi Arabia.For decades, Saudi Arabia has recklessly financed and promoted a harsh and intolerant Wahhabi version of Islam around the world in a way that is, quite predictably, producing terrorists. And there\u2019s no better example of this Saudi recklessness than in the Balkans.Kosovo and Albania have been models of religious moderation and tolerance, and as the Clinton statue attests, Kosovars revere the United States and Britain for averting a possible genocide by Serbs in 1999 (there are also many Kosovar teenagers named Tony Blair!). Yet Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries poured money into the new nation over the last 17 years and nurtured religious extremism in a land where originally there was little.\u201cSaudi Arabia is destroying Islam,\u201d Zuhdi Hajzeri, an imam at a 430-year-old mosque here in the city of Peja, told me sadly. Hajzeri is a moderate in the traditional, tolerant style of Kosovo \u2014 he is the latest in a long line of imams in his family \u2014 and said that as a result he had received more death threats from extremists than he can count.\u201cThe Saudis completely changed Islam here with their money,\u201d said Visar Duriqi, a former imam in Kosovo who became a journalist who writes about extremist influences. Duriqi cites himself as an example: He says he was brainwashed and underwent an extremist phase in which he called for imposing Shariah law and excusing violence. Those views now horrify him.This is not a Kosovo problem, but a global problem. I first encountered pernicious Saudi influence in Pakistan, where the public school system is a disgrace and Saudis filled the gap by financing hard-line madrasas that lure students with free tuition, free meals and full scholarships for overseas study for the best students.Likewise, in traditionally moderate, peaceful countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in West Africa, I\u2019ve seen these foreign-financed madrasas introduce radical interpretations of Islam. In the Balkans, Bosnia is particularly affected by Gulf support for extremists.I don\u2019t want to exaggerate. I saw fewer head scarves on my trip through Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania than I do in New York City, and any jihadist would tear his hair out at seeing women with bare heads and shoulders, not to mention shorts.There are still pillars of pro-American feeling and ecumenism (there is great reverence among Albanian Muslims for Mother Teresa, who was Albanian). Moreover, after a series of arrests of radical imams in Kosovo and Albania, the situation may have stabilized, and jihadists no longer seem to be traveling to Syria from here.But the world needs to have tough conversations with Saudi Arabia about its role. It\u2019s not that it is intentionally spreading havoc, more that it is behaving recklessly; it has made some painstaking progress in curbing extremist financing, but too slowly.It\u2019s particularly dispiriting because much of the extremist funding seems to come from charity: One of the most admirable aspects of Islam is its emphasis on charity, yet in countries like Saudi Arabia this money is directed not to fight malnutrition or child mortality, but to brainwash children and sow conflict in poor and unstable countries.I asked Hajzeri, the imam, whether he was worried by foreign threats to Islam, like the Danish cartoonist who mocked the Prophet Muhammad. \u201cCartoonists can just hurt our feelings,\u201d he snorted. \u201cBut damaging the reputation of Islam? That\u2019s not what the cartoonists are doing. That\u2019s what Saudi Arabia is doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Unfinished Bridge, and Partnership, Between Russia and China", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byNIZHNELENINSKOYE, Russia \u2014 Trumpeted for the past decade as an emblem of Russia\u2019s destiny as an Asian as well as a European power, the huge steel bridge thrusts out from the Chinese side of the Amur River, stretching more than a mile across the turbid waters that divide the world\u2019s most populous nation from its biggest.Then something strange happens: The bridge abruptly stops, hanging in the air high above the river just short of the Russian shore at Nizhneleninskoye, a remote frontier settlement nearly 4,000 miles from Moscow.The unfinished rail bridge across the Amur River, however, offers a more realistic picture of the chasm separating what the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, recently described as the \u201ctruly inexhaustible potential\u201d of Moscow\u2019s \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Beijing and the reality of unfulfilled promises and thwarted hopes.The only sign of construction in Nizhneleninskoye on a recent afternoon was a group of border guards from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, digging with their bare hands and a shovel near a security fence.Russian officials insist that construction work is about to start and that the bridge will be ready to carry rail traffic within two years or so \u2014 a decade after the Russian and Chinese governments agreed to proceed on the project.The gulf between expectation and reality has become a recurring feature of Russia\u2019s relationship with China. After promises by leaders to increase trade between the nations to $100 billion by this year and $200 billion by 2020, for example, two-way trade volume slumped last year by 28 percent, to just $68 billion. It picked up a few percentage points in the first few months of this year.The sheen has also dulled on a 30-year gas deal estimated to be worth $400 billion when it was signed during a visit by Mr. Putin to China in May 2014. A pipeline that Russia needs to build to transport the gas has stalled.At a conference in May in Moscow, Chinese speakers complained that Russia needed to improve its performance. Li Fenglin, a former Chinese ambassador to Moscow, expressed dismay over the slow pace of construction on the so-called Power of Siberia gas pipeline and other projects.\u201cDon\u2019t just drag your feet. You should start working energetically,\u201d Mr. Li said. He added that China and Russia had \u201ca single destiny\u201d but would get their partnership into gear only if they moved away from mammoth state-sponsored ventures and shifted toward market-driven interaction between small and medium-size companies.There is also frustration on the Russian side, particularly among businesspeople whose dreams of tapping Chinese markets and pools of cash have mostly fizzled.\u201cWhat should be noted from the results of our work of the last year is that there has been a catastrophically low level of cooperation between the two countries,\u201d said Viktor F. Vekselberg, a billionaire and the chairman of the Russian chapter of the Russian-Chinese Chamber for Commerce in Machinery and High Technology Products, at the Moscow conference.In the long run, China and Russia have too much of what the other badly needs \u2014 natural resources in Russia and a huge market and capital in China \u2014 not to lift their friendship beyond grand but often hollow declarations by leaders.That is certainly the hope of officials and mining executives here in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, a resource-rich but cash-poor region in Russia that has long looked to the Amur River rail bridge as a way to tap into China\u2019s economic dynamism. If ever completed, it would be the first year-round link between Russia and China along a stretch of frontier more than 2,000 miles long.Valery A. Samkov, the head of the district government in Leninskoye, a border area that includes Nizhneleninskoye, said he hoped the bridge and the business opportunities it would generate would revitalize a community whose population has shrunk to 18,000 from 30,000 since the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991.He said he was optimistic that progress was being made on the Russian side. After years of visits by \u201cmen with ties and nice haircuts,\u201d he noted, he is now receiving tieless visitors from construction companies who ask where they can dump their garbage and find water when work actually starts.Mr. Putin has strengthened and empowered the Russian state and disciplined it to speak with one voice in public. But its various agencies rarely move in lock step or swiftly, particularly when large sums of money are at stake for well-connected insiders.Victor Larin, a leading Russian expert on China at the Far East branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok, said Russia\u2019s fumbling of the bridge showed that parts of the country\u2019s elite remained in the grip of \u201cthe China threat syndrome.\u201d He was referring to a deep-seated wariness in Russia of a neighbor whose population is nearly 10 times bigger, economy more than five times larger and military spending twice as large.All the power that has accrued to Mr. Putin, Mr. Larin added, has left Russia \u201cunder manual control\u201d by the Kremlin, meaning that little gets done on any issue unless the president intervenes directly and forcefully.So while the Kremlin has endorsed the bridge, others lower in the Russian government ranks, Mr. Larin said, have stalled, with finance officials in Moscow complaining about the cost and military officers asking, \u201cWhy build a bridge over which Chinese tanks can come?\u201dThe Kremlin, he said, has a clear vision of where it wants relations with China to go, but \u201cthe lower you go, the worse it gets.\u201d Much of Russia\u2019s elite \u201chas not made the turn psychologically\u201d to viewing China as a reliable partner rather than a potential enemy.Though initially conceived as a private project, the Amur River bridge quickly evolved into a venture funded and carried out by the Russian and Chinese governments. The arrangement, said Valery Gurevich, a former vice governor of the Jewish autonomous region, allowed China to take the lead.\u201cOver there, one party decides everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes things much easier.\u201dEven the seemingly simple issue of where the bridge\u2019s pillars would stand, Mr. Gurevich recalled, stirred a hornet\u2019s nest of arguments between three state landowners in Nizhneleninskoye \u2014 the Federal Security Service, the state forestry fund and municipal authorities.\u201cAt times, you just wanted to hang yourself,\u201d he said.Tougher still was the question of who, on Russia\u2019s side, would get construction contracts potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Chinese decided years ago to entrust the construction of their portion of the bridge to a state-owned engineering company, which quickly got to work and, according to Chinese state television, finished the job two years ago.But in Russia, where state-funded projects invariably go far over budget and yield expansive opportunities for theft, it took until June to choose among different construction companies, each with powerful backers in Moscow. The winner was SK Most Group, a well-connected private Russian company known for its role in building a bridge in Vladivostok that ended up costing the state more than $1 billion.The recent arrival in Nizhneleninskoye of heavy construction equipment has raised hopes that the bridge to China might finally be finished. The regional government, in response to written questions, said the delays were because \u201cthis project is unique with no analog in world practice and required the solving of a long list of questions.\u201d The government said the Russian portion would cost 9 billion rubles (around $140 million) and would be finished by June 2018.Chinese criticism has stung Russian pride. In a recent interview with a local television station, Dmitri Astafyev, the head of Rubicon, a state-controlled company supervising the project, urged China to curb its criticism.\u201cWe\u2019re being criticized because our partners in China have built two kilometers already while we\u2019re not able to build as little as 309 meters,\u201d Mr. Astafyev said.\u201cWhile the Chinese are, of course, talented, they have, for starters, built the easy part,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the key point is the following: They say they\u2019ve built the bridge. Good. But it\u2019s not suitable for traffic.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

PAUL K. SONNGeneral CounselNational Employment Law ProjectNew YorkTo the Editor:Peter D. Salins sees beauty in the earned-income tax credit, a subsidy paid to low-income workers when they file their yearly income tax returns, a program he would like to see expanded.

The effect of an across-the-board raising of the minimum wage would be a tremendous increase in consumer spending at the low end of the work force.In the short term, as business adjusts, there might be some temporary job losses. But in the long run the stimulus effect of all that additional money being spent in low-end businesses would actually spur employment.I have a friend, a single woman, 63, who works as a cashier in a grocery store for $8 an hour. I asked her what she would do with the extra money if her pay were raised to $15 an hour. She said, \u201cSpend it.\u201dThe way to stimulate business, and employment, is to get more money into the hands of people who will spend it.

Salins\u2019 article is nothing but business propaganda. Earned-income tax credits aren\u2019t a better way to raise income. By socializing the cost of low wages, they cut costs to bottom-feeding businesses. They help keep wages low, and they also make it hard for young single workers to save money.We need to examine these supposedly neutral solutions and see who really benefits. Businesses benefit, and we the taxpayers subsidize their workers.JEROME McKENNALong Prairie, Minn.To the Editor:Until Peter D. Salins tries raising two children in New York on $23,572, like a single mother he cites as an example in his article, his cold analysis of the consequences of increasing the minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour will have the moral force of Scrooge urging the poor to hurry to prisons and workhouses or die.Not that his analysis comes as any surprise. We have, after all, reintroduced indenture disguised as college and payday loans. ASKOLD MELNYCZUKBostonTo the Editor:The argument over the minimum wage is really an argument over wage levels.

Today, more and more workers find themselves working for less and less and seeing a cloudy future for their families.If there is an argument at all for a minimum wage and beyond that a middle-class wage that reflects the cost of living in our society, then those numbers must be reasonable on both fronts given the current cost of living.As policies shift, we should certainly provide for those who lose jobs as a result and otherwise fall through the cracks. But to keep people stuck in low-wage jobs is to support a class of working poor. That is not the right road to be on. As \u201cBrexit\u201d showed, something will eventually give that may be far more uncertain and disruptive than a minimum-wage increase. BRUCE NEUMANWater Mill, N.Y.Advertisement"}

Canon representatives in the country could not be reached.International companies that have financial deals with relatives of Mr. Hun Sen risk violating United States anticorruption laws and should consider severing their business ties with the family, the report said.The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which became law in 1977, prohibits American companies and companies listed on a United States stock exchange from providing anything of value to a foreign official to influence a decision or gain an improper business advantage.Mr. Hun Sen, 63, is a former commander of the Khmer Rouge, whose rule of terror in Cambodia lasted from 1975 to 1979. One of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, he came to power in 1985 and refused to step aside in 1993 after he was voted out of office. Critics say he has relied on brutality and intimidation to remain in power. He has said he plans to stay in office for another decade.Patrick Alley, director of Global Witness, called on foreign companies to examine their ties with the prime minister\u2019s family and ensure that they were not contributing to a corrupt government.\u201cIt\u2019s time for international partners and investors to recognize that Cambodia is a dictatorship and is likely to become a dynastic one,\u201d he said in an interview.The report does not specify what business deals American companies may have struck with members of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s family. Many of the foreign companies named by Global Witness sell consumer products in the Cambodian market.One relative cited in the report is Sok Sopheak, the wife of a nephew of Hun Sen, who chairs iOne, Cambodia\u2019s leading Apple retailer. She could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.Hun Mana, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s eldest daughter, appears to be the most active in business of his children, with reported holdings of more than $66 million and an interest in at least 22 companies, the report said. Her interests include media, energy, tourism, aviation, finance and telecommunications, Global Witness said. She also is chairwoman of an advertising business that includes numerous global companies among its clients, the report said. Reached by phone, she declined to comment.Global Witness said that it had contacted all the Hun Sen family members named in the report and that only one, his son-in-law Sok Puthyvuth, had responded. In an email to the organization, he said he had gone into business because his family did not want him involved in government.\u201cI can understand your assumption that I have abused my power to get to where I am today, but I can assure you that I take seriously the challenge of building a responsible and respected private sector group,\u201d he said, according to the report.Mr. Alley said Global Witness would be contacting international companies in the coming days requesting that they evaluate their business dealings with the prime minister\u2019s family.The United States is Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partner, and the two countries have about $3 billion in trade annually. The governments in Washington and Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty to bring additional United States investment to Cambodia.\u201cThe family\u2019s holdings span the majority of Cambodia\u2019s most lucrative business sectors as well as those characterized by high levels of corruption, human rights abuses and environmental damage,\u201d the report said.Neou Vannarin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Advertisement"}

In May, Lester Coney, an executive at a Chicago-based financial services firm, emailed a party finance staff member seeking a contact with \u201cclout within the administration.\u201d Mr. Coney appeared to be referring to Gov. Mark Dayton, the governor of Minnesota.The staff member appeared worried about the request, writing \u201cNo idea what to tell him here,\u201d to the party\u2019s national finance director, Jordan Kaplan, an Obama campaign veteran with deep ties to Midwestern donors.\u201cI told him to call rt,\u201d Mr. Kaplan replied, referring to R.T.

Many revolve around donors\u2019 efforts to qualify for top packages at the convention that begins Monday in Philadelphia. Donors who raise $1.25 million for the party \u2014 or who give $467,000 \u2014 are entitled to priority booking in a top hotel, nightly access to V.I.P. lounges and an \u201cexclusive roundtable and campaign briefing with high-level Democratic officials,\u201d according to a promotional brochure obtained by The Times.Another staff member, given the task of letting the Goldbergs down, knew they would be disappointed. \u201cI think the excitement of hosting at home was a big factor,\u201d he wrote. The Goldbergs pulled out of the fund-raiser.In some cases, the party offered donors the chance to join \u201croundtables\u201d \u2014 meetings for major givers disguised as high-minded discussions of national economic and social policy, where wealthy givers are treated as savants and sages.As is common in national politics, Democratic staff members kept detailed track of every dollar contributed by targeted donors, aiming to get each of the wealthiest givers to \u201cmax out,\u201d or contribute the maximum legal amount to each party account. The biggest national donors were the subject of entire dossiers, as fund-raisers tried to gauge their interests, annoyances and passions.\u201cJon has an off and on again relationship with the DNC.

As they looked to maximize opportunities to bring in money, the party\u2019s fund-raisers also grappled with delicate personal considerations among the Obama family, who were unenthusiastic about the demands of wooing donors.There was, however, one potential way to interest Mr. Obama in donor maintenance. In May, Mr. Kaplan emailed each of his regional fund-raising directors with a request: Send the names of donors who would be good golf partners for the president. Mr. Obama, it seemed, was looking to hit the links on his upcoming trips.\u201cLaugh as you may at this because I did \u2014 but if you had to pick people from your regions to play golf with POTUS, who would they be?\u201d Mr. Kaplan wrote.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Predict Tuition Increases Under Hillary Clinton\u2019s College Plan", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byIn recent decades, the federal government has significantly expanded tuition subsidies, only to watch the cost of college climb even faster. Some experts see evidence that colleges have responded to past increases in federal subsidies by raising prices.\u201cThe basic economics are pretty straightforward,\u201d said Taylor Nadauld, a finance professor at Brigham Young University and a co-author of the study. \u201cColleges have the opportunity to extract money from the federal government, and they do it.\u201dThe plan also nods at the other side of the equation: An outline released by the campaign promises to hold colleges \u201caccountable for reining in costs.\u201d But it does not explain how, and the campaign did not respond to a request for details.Colleges also have shifted their pricing models, charging higher list prices but offering more aid, so that lower-income students may actually pay less.The logic is straightforward. Imagine if the government started handing out gift cards that could only be used to buy Broadway theater tickets. As there are only so many seats available, the price of tickets would probably begin to climb.But efforts to measure the effect on tuition costs have ranged widely. Some studies have found little evidence of a significant impact. The New York Fed study, however, looked at three different increases in federal subsidies in recent years and found that each had produced a significant increase in college tuition.Another piece of evidence: The government limits the total amount undergraduates can borrow, but for the last decade it has allowed graduate students to borrow unlimited sums. Before the change, undergraduate tuition was rising more quickly than graduate school tuition. Since the change, the pattern has reversed, according to Andrew Gillen, an independent education analyst based in Washington.\u201cSchools are under tremendous competitive pressure to raise as much revenue as possible from every possible source,\u201d Mr. Gillen said.There is some evidence the impact is larger at private institutions. A sense of public mission or legislative barriers may prevent public schools from raising costs.The effect also appears to be larger when aid is extended to higher-income families. \u201cInstitutions know those families can afford to pay, and that they\u2019re going to send their kids to school anyway,\u201d Ms. Finney said.Under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, most students would not feel the pain of tuition increases. The government would pay their bills regardless. But that could make it easier for colleges to raise prices, as they would not need to fear a loss of customers.That puts the burden of cost control squarely on the government\u2019s shoulders. But even if prices do rise, the government may still be getting a good deal. Federal wage data shows that the value of a college education is higher than it has ever been.\u201cPurely from an economic standpoint, it has never been a better investment,\u201d Mr. Nadauld said. \u201cEven though costs are obscene, the returns are obscene, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Police officers used bikes to block the crowd, and a Secret Service agent strode into the throng, ordering them to halt. Some did, but others moved ahead, beckoned forward by fellow protesters, including one man who yelled, \u201cTake the ground they cede.\u201dThe protesters chanted, \u201cNot for sale\u201d and \u201cShame on the D.N.C.,\u201d and shouted against the influence of money in politics.

Then other protesters were climbing over one by one and submitting to being cuffed.Around 5:30 p.m. the calm was briefly broken when the protesters abandoned their tactic of waiting in line to cross the barricades at a single spot and instead began clambering simultaneously over different sections. Officers rushed forward, but relaxed when they realized these people, too, simply waited to be cuffed after climbing over.Ms. Millard was among those in that wave of protesters. A police officer suggested that she rest her foot on the frame of his bicycle to ease her move over the barricade. As she did, a female officer grasped her hand and helped her.

Its mission centers on building a high-speed train that can shuttle people or cargo in minutes rather than hours. Mr. Musk came up with the idea of a high-speed train, but is not associated with Hyperloop One.\u201cHyperloop is not a party trick,\u201d the plaintiffs write in the lawsuit. \u201cIt is a serious concept that deserves serious development.\u201dOrin Snyder, a lawyer representing Hyperloop One, said in an emailed statement: \u201cToday\u2019s lawsuit brought by former employees of Hyperloop One is unfortunate and delusional. These employees tried to stage a coup and failed. They knew that the company was aware of their actions, and today\u2019s lawsuit is their pre-emptive strike. The claims are pure nonsense and will be met with a swift and potent legal response.\u201dDespite skeptics, Hyperloop One was promising enough to draw a number of prominent executives in technology. Perhaps the most prominent example was Mr. Pishevar, a refugee from Iran who began life in America as a cabdriver, eventually becoming a venture capitalist who invested in the likes of Uber and Warby Parker. He is also a prominent Silicon Valley backer of both President Obama and Hillary Clinton.And Mr. BamBrogan was a senior engineer at Mr. Musk\u2019s SpaceX rocket company.A Hyperloop One director and a defendant in the case, Joe Lonsdale, is also a well-known venture capitalist who helped found the data analysis firm Palantir.But according to the lawsuit, Hyperloop One was run as the personal fief of Shervin Pishevar and Mr. Lonsdale, who together control 78 percent of its voting rights. The two men rarely spent time at the start-up except, the court filing claims, to give tours of the place to friends, celebrities and even a nightclub doorman.Mr. BamBrogan and his fellow plaintiffs \u2014 Knut Sauer, formerly Hyperloop One\u2019s vice president for business development; David Pendergast, former assistant general counsel; and William Mulholland, former vice president for finance \u2014 accuse Mr. Pishevar and Mr. Lonsdale of unfair favoritism toward relatives and associates.Mr. Pishevar, according to the lawsuit, once pressured a prospective investor into investing in his Sherpa Capital venture fund in order to invest in Hyperloop One.The suit describes an atmosphere of waste. Once Mr. Pishevar began dating Hyperloop One\u2019s public relations consultant, it says, he nearly tripled her monthly retainer to $40,000 from $15,000, more than any other employee in the company \u2014 only to dismiss her after their engagement was later broken off.But the main trouble for the plaintiffs arose after they wrote a letter to Mr. Pishevar, Mr. Lonsdale and the company\u2019s chief executive, Robert Lloyd, on May 26, expressing their concerns.Soon after, according to the lawsuit, Mr. Pishevar\u2019s brother, Afshin, left \u201ca hangman\u2019s noose\u201d on Mr. BamBrogan\u2019s chair. The complaint includes a still image from security camera video that, the lawsuit contends, depicts the act.Later, Mr. Lloyd told those who signed the letter that the company planned to fire Mr. Pendergast and Mr. Mulholland and demote Mr. BamBrogan. The lawsuit says Mr. BamBrogan, fearing for \u201chis physical safety,\u201d subsequently resigned, as did Mr. Mulholland, Dr. Sauer and Josh Giegel, a senior engineer.Mr. Pendergast was fired outright, the lawsuit states.On June 16, Mr. Lloyd told Hyperloop One employees that Mr. Giegel was joining the board \u2014 though Mr. Giegel, according to the lawsuit, was sending in his resignation. Mr. Giegel ultimately ended up staying and was given the title of co-founder.And Mr. Lonsdale, according to the lawsuit, sent an email to Hyperloop One\u2019s board and the company\u2019s engineering team describing Mr. BamBrogan as \u201cunstable\u201d and having \u201cgone haywire.\u201dOn Hyperloop One\u2019s website as of Tuesday morning, before the lawsuit was filed, Mr. BamBrogan and Mr. Mulholland were still listed as team members.

{"Headline": "Panama Papers Reveal Wide Use of Shell Companies by African Officials", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Entrepreneurs and corrupt officials across Africa have used shell companies to hide profits from the sale of natural resources and the bribes paid to gain access to them, according to records leaked from a Panamanian law firm.Some of the assets cycled through the shell companies were used to buy yachts, private jets, Manhattan penthouses and luxury homes in Beverly Hills, Calif., the law firm documents show.Mossack Fonseca has said it should not be blamed for wrongdoing by its customers. \u201cWe merely help incorporate companies, and before we agree to work with a client in any way, we conduct a thorough due-diligence process,\u201d the firm said in a statement. The statement noted that the firm had not been charged with criminal wrongdoing in nearly 40 years of operation.Several major figures examined in the new Panama Papers reports have previously been accused of wrongdoing, and some are under criminal investigation or have been charged. But the details of their use of shell companies had not previously been disclosed.The consortium identified 37 companies created by the law firm that had been named in court actions or government investigations involving natural resources in Africa. All told, Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files revealed offshore companies that were established to own or do business with oil, natural gas and mining operations in 44 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries.In one major criminal case, Farid Bedjaoui, a nephew of a former Algerian foreign minister, has been accused by Italian prosecutors of arranging $275 million in bribes to help Saipem, an Italian oil and gas services company, win pipeline contracts in Algeria worth $10 billion. Mr. Bedjaoui, called \u201cMr. Three Percent\u201d in news media reports for his purported share of the payoffs, has denied the charges.The journalists\u2019 consortium found that Mossack Fonseca had created 12 of the 17 shell companies linked to Mr. Bedjaoui that Italian prosecutors are investigating as possible conduits for bribes from 2007 to 2010. One of them, Collingdale Consultants Inc., was used to divert as much as $15 million to associates and the family of Chakib Khelil, Algeria\u2019s energy minister from 1999 to 2010, according to the charges.Mr. Bedjaoui, who has Algerian, French and Canadian citizenship, is accused of spinning a complex web to hide his money, with 16 bank accounts in Algeria, Dubai, Hong Kong, Lebanon, London, Singapore and Switzerland. His assets have been seized in Canada and France, where the police reportedly took a 140-foot yacht and paintings by Warhol, Mir\u00f3 and Dal\u00ed. United States officials are examining three New York properties bought by Mr. Bedjaoui, including a $28.5 million Fifth Avenue condominium, records show.Though the investigation of Mr. Bedjaoui first made headlines in February 2013, internal emails at Mossack Fonseca suggest that the law firm did not notice the trouble until seven months later, while conducting an internet search on another client.Pressed by officials in the British Virgin Islands, where most of the shell companies were registered, Mossack Fonseca said it was unable to provide contact details for employees at the law firm who had served as nominal directors for some of the companies under investigation.The law firm\u2019s managing director in the British Virgin Islands wrote in an internal email that not having \u201cthe basic information on employees is totally embarrassing,\u201d and might result in a fine.While Mossack Fonseca reported Mr. Bedjaoui\u2019s activities to the authorities in the British Virgin Islands in 2013, the law firm continued working with one of his companies, Rayan Asset Management, until at least November 2015.Offshore middlemen have incentives \u201cnot to know what the companies they are forming are going to be used for,\u201d said Heather Lowe, a lawyer at Global Financial Integrity, an anticorruption group in Washington. \u201cIf they know too much, they might have to turn away business.\u201dAs a result, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s often no gatekeeper to prevent illicit money from entering the financial system.\u201dKola Aluko, an oil and aviation mogul and one of four defendants accused of helping to cheat the Nigerian government out of $1.8 billion in proceeds from oil sales, was another jet-setting user of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s services who was examined by the consortium.Mr. Aluko told the journalists\u2019 consortium that he had never been convicted of a crime and that speculation about wrongdoing on his part was \u201cmisguided.\u201d\u201cAs a private citizen, I organize my business and family matters to maximize convenience, as well as operational and administrative efficiency,\u201d he said in a statement.In another case, the consortium found 131 companies set up by Mossack Fonseca for the Israeli mining magnate Benjamin Steinmetz and his holding company. (The holding company, BSG Resources, told the journalists\u2019 consortium that it had \u201cno familiarity\u201d with many of the companies.) One company, Koidu Limited, mines diamonds in Sierra Leone and is the target of protests and complaints from local residents and environmental advocates.More surprising, perhaps, is the use of shell companies by safari operators in several African countries \u2014 at least 30 offshore companies set up by Mossack Fonseca, the consortium found. As in other African ventures, the offshore operations make it possible to conceal money earned in developing countries but moved elsewhere from the tax authorities or the public.Advertisement"}

And despite what you may have heard, blue states are generally doing better.We identify blue states as the 18 that supported the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and red states as the 22 that backed the Republican candidate (alternative definitions yield similar results). If you compare averages, blue states are substantially richer (even adjusting for cost of living) and their residents are better educated. Companies there do more research and development and produce more patents. Students score better on tests of basic science-oriented skills like math.How can conservative commentators claim that red states dominate? A tactic favored by Mr. Trump\u2019s economic adviser Stephen Moore is to rely on measures goosed by population expansion, like job growth or a state economy\u2019s size.That\u2019s like portraying India as a beacon of prosperity because it has one of the biggest economies in the world and creates millions of jobs annually. Economic performance is measured in the lives of individuals, not aggregates.Another favorite approach is to cherry-pick a handful of red states with decent records and contrast them with the most troubled blue states. With Texas now stumbling as oil prices fall, the new conservative favorite is Utah.Utah\u2019s low poverty rate and long life expectancy are impressive, but spotlighting a single state ignores the more numerous red states that dominate the lowest ranks of state performance \u2014 whether for life expectancy, obesity, rates of violent crime and incarceration, or labor force participation of prime-age workers.Many of these differences are longstanding. Our reddest region, the South, has long been the poorest part, too. The gap between today\u2019s red and blue states was enormous for much of the 20th century. It then narrowed substantially, thanks in part to huge federal transfers to the poorest states to raise them toward the national level.Yet income differences between red and blue states stopped closing around 1980 and, in some revealing cases, widened. For example, Texas and Massachusetts \u2014 often considered exemplars of the red and blue models \u2014 had almost converged by 1980. Since then, Texas\u2019 per capita income has fallen significantly relative to Massachusetts\u2019. The same is true of Utah.Yes, the cost of living is higher in Massachusetts than it is in Texas \u2014 by about 11 percent in the last few years, according to recent government calculations by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But even this significant difference (surely longstanding) can\u2019t close the widened gap.This red-blue divergence is all the more striking because red states still receive much more in federal spending relative to the federal taxes their residents pay. In other words, blue states are generally outperforming red states even while heavily subsidizing them.Why are red states no longer consistently gaining ground? An important reason is that modern knowledge economies increase the rewards for education, research and development and urban hubs that promote the exchange of ideas and development of talent. This has made local conditions more important even in this age of globalization. And the places where these effects have been most successfully promoted are overwhelmingly blue.Yes, there are fast-growing red state economies. But many, like North Dakota, look more like Saudi Arabia than Silicon Valley. Not all states are sitting on huge fossil fuel reserves, and tapping these reserves isn\u2019t costless. It creates pollution and other problems \u2014 negative externalities \u2014 that go beyond states\u2019 borders, notably the costs associated with carbon emissions.Not all blue states are economically successful, of course, and not all red states are struggling. Some red state innovation hubs like Austin, Tex., are thriving (even if these \u201cblue islands\u201d are at odds with state governments over wage rules and public investments). Yet few of the cities that do the most research or advanced manufacturing or that produce the most patents are in red states.On the other side, blue states have found it difficult to maintain their historic investments in education and infrastructure. In some cases, state policies are to blame. Connecticut, Illinois and Rhode Island are now having to deal with badly underfinanced pension funds.But blue states have also been affected by cutbacks in federal funding for research, infrastructure and higher education \u2014 a reminder that federal policy still matters enormously.And blue states have higher average inequality than red states do (in part because of their success in promoting high-paying jobs), and their dense urban economies continue to harbor troublingly deep pockets of disadvantage.Local restrictions that stymie construction of new affordable housing play a big role. These policies not only hurt less affluent residents; they also make these states poorer because the most innovative cities are less dense and hence less productive than they could be.We should tackle these problems. But we should remember that the key drivers of growth are science, education and innovation, not low taxes, lax regulations or greater exploitation of natural resources.And we should be worried, whatever our partisan tilt, that leading conservatives promote an economic model so disconnected from the true sources of prosperity.Jacob S.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 2", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 His life took off, he said, when he fell in love with \u201cthat girl.\u201d He told a familiar love story, recounted in his memoir, about springtime at Yale Law School in 1971 and a \u201cmagnetic\u201d girl with thick blond hair and big glasses and no makeup and a long, white flowery skirt. He said when he first saw her in a political and civil rights class that he wanted to tap her on the shoulder but he knew if he did, he would be starting something beyond his control. With a sky-blue tie and silvery hair and an easy smile, the 69-year-old looked healthier than he has on the trail. And he was sharp. The Big Dog basked in the unique historic moment: a former president and a husband and a wannabe first lad making the case for a former first lady, a wife and a wannabe first woman president. In an act of amazing self-restraint, the man who relishes the word \u201cI\u201d managed to make the talk, as he prefers to call his folksy speeches, all about her. He was positively uxorious. She \u201ccalls you when you\u2019re sick, when your kid\u2019s in trouble or when there\u2019s a death in the family,\u201d Bill said of his partner of 40 years. It has been said that the essence of the Clinton marriage is coming to each other\u2019s rescue in critical moments. Or maybe more precisely, their byzantine conjugal dynamic works like this: One of them creates chaos \u2014 usually Bill \u2014 and then they get out of it together. Or as a former aide described the Clinton pattern: \u201cHubris. Funk. Reintroduction.\u201d \u201cOne of the most seductive characters we\u2019ve seen in American politics in our lifetime,\u201d as David Axelrod calls Bill Clinton, had to melt the sphinx-like aura of his guarded wife. Hill and Bill both have 100-percent name ID but Bill\u2019s task was to reintroduce her as \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever met in my entire life.\u201d A quarter-century after Clinton aides wrote memos about how to warm up and round out Hillary by raising her profile as a mother, Bill was still trying to drive that point home. It is another example of the overcorrecting that marks Hillary\u2019s career. In trying to feminize and maternalize Hillary, Bill almost went overboard about that \u201cgirl,\u201d as he called her three times. He poured on the estrogen, presaging his role as helpmeet in the East Wing. He never mentioned Donald Trump, the man he used to be friendly with and play golf with. He simply alluded to the way the Republican convention had tried to turn Hillary into a \u201ccartoon\u201d villainess. \u201cLife in the real world is complicated and hard,\u201d he said, and \u201ca lot of people think it\u2019s boring.\u201d \u201cOne is real, the other is made up,\u201d he said of the caricature of Hillary. \u201cYou nominated the real one.\u201d He implicitly compared his wife to her gilded rival, limning her as someone genuinely seeking a life of service. He talked about her summer sliming fish in Alaska and all her work for poor children. Hillary has said that she never realized how hard it was to be as great a persuader and performer as Bill until she tried to do it herself. Bill has now given 10 convention speeches and he has had awful moments and great ones. I was there in 1988 when he talked for 33 minutes and the Dukakis delegates began cheering when he finally said \u201cIn closing\u2026\u201d And I was there in 2012, when he won raves for selling Barack Obama\u2019s agenda, after the articulate-but-aloof president somehow wasn\u2019t able to, and had to appoint Bill as \u201cSecretary of Explaining Stuff.\u201d This speech was slightly over 40 minutes. Donald Trump had a soap opera actress speak at his convention but the Clintons easily topped that. Their lives have been an astonishing soap opera in which Bill has played many starring roles \u2013 the loyal spouse, the betraying spouse and the subconscious saboteur. Hillary chafed at eight years of the anachronistic role of first lady, even through slights like getting stationery with the restored middle name of Rodham missing as her husband campaigned for the White House. (She sent it back.) \u201cThat girl\u201d put up with the humiliations of Bill\u2019s hound-dog ways with \u201cthat woman\u201d and others, and let him hide behind her skirt. Bill tried to augment Hillary\u2019s sparse vision, talking about how she would be the right pilot for \u201cthe ride to America\u2019s future.\u201d PHILADELPHIA \u2014 If the media won\u2019t come to you, you go to them.Vermont cast its votes last, and Mr. Sanders smiled tearfully as the room applauded his effort in the Democratic primary. It was Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest show of graciousness in conceding the nomination to Mrs. Clinton. But for his most die-hard supporters in the audience, that was not an acceptable end to his time as a presidential candidate.\u201cWALK OUT! On the DNC and corporate politics,\u201d a neon green flyer distributed to the delegates read. \u201cAll participating delegates to walk out as one group.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s supporters marched to the huge media tents. Most of the protesters were silent, and some wore duct tape over their mouths as a sign of them being \u201csilenced\u201d by the Democratic National Committee. They walked into the media filing tent and were immediately mobbed by reporters.They held up handmade signs: \u201cDNC, you\u2019re fired\u201d; \u201cThis is what a stolen election looks like\u201d; \u201cThe Democratic Party just elected Donald Trump.\u201d Some used the hashtag #DemExit, a reference to Brexit.Kimberly Tucker, a Virginia delegate for Mr. Sanders, said she can\u2019t support Mrs. Clinton \u201cbecause I\u2019m not sure that she actually won.\u201d She said that while other die-hard supporters of Mr. Sanders\u2019s had been talking about leaving the Democratic Party, she intended to stay.\u201cI know a lot of people took their things and they\u2019re leaving, and I stand in solidarity with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also need to have Democrats that stay and force change from within, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dRashane Hamby, a young Sanders delegate from Kansas, said she hopes Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters will keep working on the movement at a local level \u201cafter the cameras are gone.\u201d\u201cThe thing is with Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t know who she is. Donald Trump shows me who he is each and every day. Hillary Clinton switches her position depending on who she\u2019s talking to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not with Black Lives Matter, but I know that my son\u2019s life matters, and if Hillary is in office, she needs to know that she will be held accountable. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201dMs. Hamby, who is black, said she is frustrated with both Mrs. Clinton and President Bill Clinton\u2019s response to Black Lives Matter protesters, and said she wished other people in the black community demanded more from them.\u201cWe give our vote away each and every presidential election, hoping that the person that spoke to the most churches will do something for us. Senator Sanders was the only person who handed his microphone over and allowed Black Lives Matter to use his platform,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really changed me.\u201dChris Pumpelly, another young Sanders delegate from Kansas, took a more pragmatic approach.\u201cBernie Sanders didn\u2019t win the nomination, and he just told us that we need to be supporting the Democratic Party and the most progressive platform that this party has ever seen. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of my friends disagree with supporting the party up and down the ticket. I understand that. But I see Donald Trump as an existential threat to the world.\u201dSusan Eacker, an Ohio delegate for Mr. Sanders, said she didn\u2019t know about the walkout until just before it took place.\u201cTell Bernie we said sorry we rained on his parade, but he taught us too well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was younger, he\u2019d be doing the same thing.\u201dPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Oh, remember those simple days when bizarre utterances disqualified a candidate?In his convention speech, Howard Dean, the former presidential candidate and governor of Vermont, just reminded us of those times when he reprised \u201cthe Dean scream,\u201d the call to arms he yelped after the Iowa caucuses in 2004. It effectively halted his presidential run that year and all but ended his electoral career.Then walked off the stage, laughing. Probably to tweet something.If you judge by America\u2019s ugly, raucous, invigorating and inspiring political history, it\u2019s clear that the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, just lost her job for doing it. Politicians are not popes. The leader of the D.N.C. must be a tough pol, more Rahm Emanuel than Barack Obama. Good leaders protect their party\u2019s interest fiercely, as Wasserman Schultz did in opposing a candidate who spent decades boasting of his disdain for her party. Today, with primaries empowering party members, not bosses, D.N.C. chairs are supposed to be neutral, but few pull it off. In 1976, Robert Strauss managed it, staying neutral and focusing on unifying Democrats once the surprise nominee, Jimmy Carter, emerged. The most successful recent D.N.C. chairmen have been passionate partisans like Ronald Brown and Terry McAuliffe, both big Bill Clinton fans. In 2008, Howard Dean, trying to preserve his grass-roots 50-state strategy, was better at balancing between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Let\u2019s stop pretending and welcome the mess. Even the emails speculating about trying to exploit Bernie Sanders\u2019s supposed atheism make sense: Politicians drill down on these perceived weaknesses because many voters care about them. Both parties need leaders who will defend partisan interests vigorously and assess the political environment honestly, as Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, repeatedly. Her successor will make similar moves \u2014 or she will fail her party. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The slow-motion withdrawal of Bernie Sanders and his increasingly obnoxious Bernie-or-Busters was not actually the first clenched-teeth confrontation between a losing leftie and a winning Clinton.It may be too late for Sanders to tame his following now, but that problem is largely of his own making. Sanders took far too long to concede that he lost the nomination race, and his endorsement speech for Clinton was a case study in churlishness. He talked mostly about himself and encouraged his supporters to go on fighting.He did praise Clinton\u2019s position on big issues, but gave the impression that he mostly wanted to take credit for getting her to agree with him. \u201cIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,\u201d he said, and added: \u201cBut I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee, there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns.\u201dThe platform? Seriously? The last time any candidate mentions the platform is on the day it is adopted. The job Sanders had to do was to get his followers to realize that if they stay home on Election Day, they will be helping Trump, especially the young ones who tend not to vote in large numbers anyway.He said it, sort of, in the middle of his long speech. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe this election is important, if you think you can sit it out, take a moment to think about the Supreme Court justices that Donald Trump would nominate and what that would mean to civil liberties, equal rights and the future of our country,\u201d he said.Then he skated on to talk about all the people he met during the primary campaign who really loved him.Perhaps Sanders was too worried that his supporters would riot if he did something like that. Or maybe he\u2019s just too cranky.In any case, Sanders waited until the very end of the long roll call \u2014 when even his own state had voted \u2014 to move that the \u201cofficial record\u201d show that Clinton won by acclamation.Exit Bernie Sanders, stage left.\u201cIt was 1969. I lived in Philly. I was going to Haverford High School and my 24-year-old brother, Sydney, was alarmed at my lack of dating. He was the one who introduced me to things that were \u2026 temptations. He went to Wesleyan, same school I went to. He got a master\u2019s in urban planning but he never used it. He became an automobile mechanic in Berkeley in 1973.\u201cMy dad died when I was a kid. I had just turned 8 but he\u2019d been sick for two and a half years. He had intestinal cancer. Anyway, my brother raised me to a large extent. He was seven years older and he knew what was hip. He decided he was going to set up a double date. So he asked which girls I knew, and he stood beside me while I made the phone call and then I had a list of, like, six conversation topics so I wouldn\u2019t run out of things to talk about with this girl I hardly knew, Sherry Lefevre.\u201cAnd he said, `You gotta come see this band, they\u2019re really good.\u2019 So he got the tickets and we went down to the Electric Factory & Flea Market to see a band called Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin. Well, I didn\u2019t know who she was but I immediately went and bought the record.\u201cSo we did double date and the four of us went down together and in those days, South Street was pretty funky. They didn\u2019t have a green room so the musicians, all the instruments were on the stage, but they stepped through the crowd. And we were all sitting cross-legged on the floor of this big concrete warehouse and Janis Joplin steps right over me and she pauses to say something to someone, and she had a paisley skirt on, a full-length paisley skirt, and she was just stopped there. And I wanted to see if it was silk or cotton and I just touched it, and she looked at me and went \u2018Down, boy.\u2019\u201cI was 17, I didn\u2019t know what to do. So then they played an amazing set. It was just when the record \u2018Cheap Thrills\u2019 came out and it had that song `Down on Me.\u2019 That was their closer, it was just a kick-ass.\u201d\u201cOnce a teacher, always a teacher,\u201d said Ms. Warren, a former Harvard Law professor. The slide show featured vintage photos of Ms. Warren mixed in with sleek graphics about the shrinking of the middle class in the last 50 years. \u201cThings were not perfect,\u201d she said, citing the racism, sexism and homophobia of past eras. \u201cBut over time, we were bending in the right direction, and these government investments in education, in infrastructure, in research, let us turn our hard work into real success.\u201d She then launched into a point-by-point indictment of trickle-down economics, offshore tax havens, predatory lending, corporate loopholes and the corrupting influence of money in politics. This was far from a political attack on Donald J. Trump, though she has proven adept at going after the Republican nominee. Instead, she gave the Warren wing of the party a mini-dissertation on the roots of economic inequality, and what she thinks the government should do to fix it. After a night of political theatrics, she seemed eager to get and get back to the wonky discussions she made a name for herself with. As Ms. Warren said that spending on direct lobbying has increased sevenfold since 1983, a slide showed the Capitol getting showered in gold coins. Another graphic demonstrating income inequality showed a scale with a Boston Red Sox baseball cap representing the bottom 90 percent of earners on the lower end, and a top hat representing the top 10 percent at the higher end. Per Professor Warren: In 1980, 90 percent of Americans got 70 percent of all new wealth generated. In 2016, the same share of Americans received less than 1 percent of the new wealth generated. She ended her speech by telling attendees to demand four things of the people they vote for: that they work to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, increase Wall Street regulation, raise taxes on the top 10 percent of earners, and increase funding for welfare programs. But she could barely get the word \u201cloophole\u201d out of her mouth before a man in the audience started clapping in agreement. \u201cAll I can say is, you\u2019re my kind of guy,\u201d she said. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In presidential election after presidential election, Republicans have presented themselves as the champions of \u201cfamily values,\u201d which is their synonym for a certain kind of traditionalism and religiosity, and they often chose a nominee who wore that label well. That was certainly the case in 2012, with Mitt Romney. It\u2019s not with Donald Trump. He has been married three times. He made much of his money from casinos. His lifestyle connotes showy materialism and hedonism. And he has a history of inflammatory remarks, including sexually blunt ones that objectify women. His perch is not exactly the peak of Walton\u2019s Mountain. And that may allow for some new positioning by Democrats, as Michelle Obama\u2019s speech to the Democratic National Convention made clear. Her message was squarely directed at American parents. It specifically concerned their kids. While it never mentioned Trump by name, it definitely asked what kind of example he\u2019d set, unmistakably advancing the idea that he\u2019d be a threat to any family trying to instill certain values \u2014 decency, empathy, politeness \u2014 in children. Watch and listen for other Democrats and for the Clinton campaign to continue taking this tack. Right near the start of her speech, the first lady described the challenges of getting her own children \u201cto ignore those who question their father\u2019s citizenship,\u201d to hold on to their dignity when \u201csomeone is cruel or acts like a bully,\u201d and to disregard \u201cthe hateful language they hear from public figures on TV.\u201d Is it possible that she had Trump in mind? \u201cWith every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us,\u201d she said of herself and the president. \u201cWe as parents are their most important role models. And let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady, because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country, kids who tell us, \u2018I saw you on TV.\u2019 \u2018I wrote a report on you for school.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s aimed at a group of voters who have favored Republican presidential candidates but, in the eyes of many Democrats, could be pried away from Trump. \u201cThe crassness of some of his commentary has potentially opened up an opportunity for Democrats to be the family-friendly party for a specific cohort of voters in particular: suburban mothers with kids,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a prominent Democratic strategist. He noted that in 2012, Romney won among married women in general and among women in the suburbs in particular. Kathleen Rice, a Democratic congresswoman from the Long Island suburbs of New York City, framed Trump\u2019s liability \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 opportunity \u2014 this way: \u201cYou can\u2019t be the party of family values if the values you\u2019re teaching your kids are hate and bigotry.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s lost on any parents in this country,\u201d she told me. \u201cDemocrats have the opportunity to regain the ground on the long-told political falsehood that Republicans are the party of family values.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t exactly surrendered the mantle of dutiful, loyal family man: Four of his five children spoke at the Republican National Convention, praising him as a terrific father and demonstrating obvious affection and respect for him. And he has drawn fresh attention to Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities, reminding Americans that the Clintons, as a family, have known plenty of mess themselves. Only 25 percent said that about Trump. The Trump children shone last week like beams in a storm: Tiffany (adorable); Donald Trump Jr. (enthusiastic); and Ivanka Trump (as polished and upbeat as a corporate recruiter, if about as credible). Melania Trump added elegance to the proceedings until she disgraced herself. And then there was Michelle Obama, who soothed the agitated, uplifted the fearful and gently pointed out our duty to unite in the face of the enemy, all with the steady warmth expected of a mom in chief. When you compare the United States with constitutional monarchies, you see that the president combines the roles of prime minister and king. (This is a political theory clich\u00e9, not an original observation.) Presidents rule executively, through the formal channels of power, and they rule symbolically, embodying the human qualities we hope to perceive in our bureaucratic state: strength, fatherliness, charisma. The Trumps\u2019 prominence also communicated an important message: that Donald J. Trump runs his business tribally, nepotistically, allocating power according to kinship rather than merit. Also, that he\u2019s not just a man, he\u2019s a corporate entity. Rule by Mr. Trump will be rule by the Trump Organization, whose day-to-day responsibilities fall more on the children than on the chief. I don\u2019t think Ivanka Trump was lying when she attributed family-friendly policies to her father that he has never endorsed himself. I think she believes she can talk him into them because she\u2019s always been his brain trust and he\u2019s never been a detail man. And she\u2019s Daddy\u2019s girl. None of this is unique to Mr. Trump. The Clintons are also a family business, also a reality show, also a fairy tale \u2014 a deconstructed, feminist fairy tale. The queen stands poised to take the reins of power. The once-great king verges on buffoonery. The princess\u2019s role is uncertain, but her young motherhood will surely be put to good political use. At various boo-spattered moments throughout yesterday\u2019s proceedings, both puckish conservatives and fretful liberals began wondering if the Democratic Party could end up having a more chaotic convention than the party of Trump did in Cleveland \u2014 more disrupted, more divided, with more overt hostility to the nominee.But even amid the heckling from Bernie Sanders\u2019s die-hards, what\u2019s striking about the Democratic Party\u2019s problems is how normal they seem compared with what\u2019s happened to the Republicans.Yes, the Sanders insurgency may betoken future divisions that ultimately split the Democratic coalition. But for today, in this election cycle, it has reached a very typical sort of endgame, characteristic of right-wing and left-wing primary challenges alike. His campaign clearly shifted the party and its nominee leftward, albeit not as far as his more zealous partisans had hoped; now he has endorsed the nominee and called for unity, like Bill Bradley in 2000 or Jesse Jackson in 1988 or Pat Buchanan in 1992. The only question is whether a minority of a minority of his supporters might vote for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson or just stay home.Of course the Democrats would rather that minority of a minority were firmly in their tent. But having a loosely attached fringe is a very normal political situation. (See, for instance, the Ron Paulistas in the G.O.P. in 2008 and 2012.) And so is the Democratic National Committee\u2019s collusive response to this fringe\u2019s champion, which our dear friends in Russia may have oh-so-helpfully exposed.There was schadenfreude from the beleaguered folks in the Republican National Committee as they watched Debbie Wasserman Schultz twist in the wind this week. But Schultz went down, in part, for doing the kind of very normal thing that they so egregiously failed to do \u2014 steering the party\u2019s nomination away from the candidate of a passionate plurality and toward the candidate who (for all her many flaws) is closer to the party\u2019s center, its consensus and mainstream.In other words: Schultz lost her job but kept her party; Reince Priebus kept his job but let a hostile takeover happen on his watch.And because the Democrats didn\u2019t endure such a takeover, the major evening speeches (which is all that most nonpolitical junkies see) should be unifying events in a way that nothing at the G.O.P.\u2019s Trump week could match. Instead of Melania Trump\u2019s plagiarism, Michelle Obama\u2019s eloquence. Instead of Ted Cruz\u2019s defiance, Bill Clinton\u2019s honeyed sales pitch. Instead of the party\u2019s past presidents and nominees as no-shows, a president with 50-plus approval ratings blessing his would-be successor.Because Trump\u2019s whole appeal is premised on the idea that our elites think things are under control when they actually are not, and his only path to victory is as a coalition-scrambling, both-parties-upending force. And what this convention is showcasing is a Democratic Party that\u2019s fully prepared to beat him under the normal rules of politics \u2026 but is not necessarily ready to adapt if events go wildly off that script.But there\u2019s yet another reason she was so raptly heard and rapturously received. She didn\u2019t speak as a politician. Just ask Hillary Clinton. As she stepped down from her position as the secretary of state and in the year afterward, a significant majority of Americans liked and respected her, as easy as that is to forget now. According to the Pew Research Center, 65 percent of Americans viewed her favorably in December 2012, 56 percent in October 2013 and 58 percent in August 2014. That was down to 43 percent by last August, which was about four months after she declared her presidential bid. Yes, her rosy period of above-50 ratings came before the revelation of her use of a private email server and her initial, clumsy attempts to shrug the whole thing off. Yes, it was before Republicans intensified their chant of Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi and refocused their fire on her in other ways. Yes, it was before a bruising Democratic primary battle in which Bernie Sanders painted her as a compromised tool of corporate interests. But her popularity during that period had as much to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t in the news every day, being forced to render opinions and stake out positions, and she wasn\u2019t making any self-serving requests of Americans. A campaign may be framed and pitched in terms of public service and patriotism, but it also comes across as precisely such a self-serving request. Clinton\u2019s path from first lady to senator, secretary of state and, now, Democratic presidential nominee guaranteed that there\u2019d be speculation about Michelle Obama\u2019s political future. But Obama\u2019s own actions have done nothing to encourage that guessing. \u201cWhen they set off for their first day at their new school, I will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just 7 and 10 years old, pile into those black S.U.V.s with all those big men with guns,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 \u201d She cited concern for her children when she addressed her future plans in a speech at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., in March. \u201cI will not run for president,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, nope, not going to do it.\u201d She added that while she intended to use her stature to effect change, she ideally wanted to do that in a nonpartisan fashion and \u201cimpact as many people as possible in an unbiased way.\u201d And then, there she was, the actual first lady, not a montage. As she spoke, the auditorium fell silent for the first time that night. \u201cWith every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let me tell you, Barack and I take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country, kids who tell us, \u2018I saw you on TV, I wrote a report on you for school.\u2019 \u201d I watch her, with avid eyes, and even as I do, I am afraid of my own avidity, of all of ours. These past eight years has been a time of watching her with my heart in my throat. I read the news and I am afraid of how quickly in this country admiration \u2014 especially for women, especially for women with big brains and hearts, especially for black women who have both \u2014 how quickly admiration can curdle into ridicule. It is a fine, fine line to walk. I watched Hillary Clinton walk a version of it when I was young. I thought a first lady who quotes African proverbs, who says, \u201cIt takes a village,\u201d has to understand me and the struggles of my family, and then I became, as the years went by, disillusioned. Twenty-four years ago, I was so unabashedly excited for Mrs. Clinton to be first lady that my sisters and I stayed up late to watch her at the convention. We made a Hillary Clinton button for our cat. I don\u2019t know that as an adult I will recapture that kind of blind devotion to a public figure, and I would argue, that\u2019s what growing older and asking questions is all about. But Mrs. Obama, somehow, is different. I watched her stand on stage (\u201cI think she\u2019s in body armor,\u201d a friend posted to Facebook) and saw how underneath the glare of the lights she didn\u2019t blink. She said this line, knowing it would be dissected and pilloried by many the next morning. But she said it, calmly, knowing it was the truth. I think that\u2019s why some of us watch her so closely. We want to figure out how to get to where she stands. The start of the Democratic convention offers reason to wonder whether the party is in the early stages of a new phase \u2013 a self-defeating phase in which a large segment of liberals would rather lose than compromise. Let\u2019s be clear: The hecklers in Philadelphia are doing Donald J. Trump\u2019s work. They are his allies, no matter how much they may believe otherwise and no matter how honest their passion. Their attempts to inject chaos into the convention will undermine the single best opportunity that Hillary Clinton has to make her case to voters. Whatever their motives, the Bernie-or-Busters are actually working to keep Citizens United as the law of the land. They are working to cut taxes on the rich. They are working to take health insurance away from families that have only recently received it. They are working for Big Coal and against the climate. They are doing the bidding of a candidate who has demeaned prisoners of war and the disabled, described Mexicans as rapists, referred to women as barnyard animals, called for banning Muslims from entering the country and cozied up to Russia\u2019s authoritarian president. There is still plenty of work for Sanders supporters to do. They can pressure Mrs. Clinton to hold fast to her campaign positions. They can identify and campaign for candidates who believe in a more radical liberalism than the Clintons or the Obamas. And they can do everything within their power to prevent a Trump presidency \u2013 a presidency with the potential to be more damaging to the country than any in our lifetimes. How\u2019d that work out for the liberal cause? PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Having served as Australia\u2019s first female prime minister, I often get asked for advice by bright young women interested in politics.What sustains someone through the rigors of modern politics, I tell them, are passion and purpose: knowing what you want to achieve for your nation and the world. Then I tell them to build a sense of self that can survive all the ugly sniping.This week at the Democratic National Convention, where I participated in a forum on women and leadership, I\u2019ve been asked what advice I\u2019d have for Hillary Clinton as she seeks to become her nation\u2019s first female leader. I\u2019m not egotistical enough to think that the most qualified and prepared presidential candidate the United States has ever seen needs my advice on policy. And she needs no lectures on sustaining a sense of self when under news media scrutiny or attack by her rivals. Few politicians have shown more resilience than Mrs. Clinton.But even someone of her vast experience has been buffeted by what I call the \u201ccurious question of gender.\u201d She knows what it\u2019s like to be the subject of the stereotype that a powerful woman cannot be likable, that if she is commanding then she must be incapable of empathy.Mrs. Clinton should not have to deal with this alone. Every Democrat, every Republican, every person who believes that women and men are equal should call out any sexism.I have often reflected how powerful it would have been if, at that moment, a male business leader, especially one who opposed my policies, said, \u201cI may not support the prime minister politically, but Australia must not conduct its democratic debates this way.\u201dUnfortunately, that never happened.To my dismay, some of the young women who chat with me are not asking for political insights. Instead, they tell me that, having seen how I was treated, they have decided politics is too punishing for them. I always try to talk them out of this position. Sometimes I succeed.In 2016, I hope there are many brave voices naming and shaming any sexism in the presidential contest. The next generation of potential female leaders is watching.Julia Gillard was the prime minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013.\nColumnist David Brooks and editorial board writer Elizabeth Williamson discussed Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, and what\u2019s to come.\nAdvertisement"}

(Ms. Murphy usually drives because she carries a lot of paperwork.) Mr. Murphy\u2019s 70-minute commute to his law firm is now a little longer than it was before. They had considered moving somewhere in between her job and his, but \u201cwhen we saw Red Bank, we were 100 percent set on being in Red Bank proper,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.The couple rented at first, then last summer, bought a 1904 colonial there with three bedrooms and two bathrooms for $389,000. The house is a block off Red Bank\u2019s bustling Broad Street, where the Murphys walk their dog, Sandy, and stop in at various coffee shops, restaurants and bars.\u201cWe wanted a place that was going to be completely urban, similar to Hoboken where we could walk to everything, but a little less intense,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.Red Bank, on the southern banks of the Navesink River and around five miles from the Atlantic Ocean, offers history, diversity, culture and entertainment for those seeking a hip, urban vibe.Scott Broschart and his wife, Gina Roselle Broschart, who both grew up in the area and met in college at Rutgers, came back to New Jersey in 2012, after stints in Texas and California, and ended up in Red Bank. In 2013, they bought a three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath 1927 colonial around the corner from the Murphys for $323,500.With its arts scene and access to New York City, Red Bank draws not only the young but also those at or near retirement.When Jim Yoshimura, 57, an information technology executive, and his wife, Tera, 61, an artist, moved from Houston to the East Coast in February 2015, they rented a three-bedroom house on Red Bank\u2019s west side. They didn\u2019t want to be tied down, knowing retirement was just around the corner.\u201cWe decided that rental life was the way to go, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d Ms. Yoshimura said. \u201cMy husband can be on Wall Street in under an hour, and the coastline is 10 minutes away, so I can go to the beach anytime.\u201d\u201cThe west side of Red Bank is exploding,\u201d said Chris Walsh, a Realtor with Re/Max. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into an artsy theater district. Four or five years ago you\u2019d never imagine dining out on the west side, and now there are restaurants popping up everywhere.\u201dMore densely populated than wealthy neighboring towns like Rumson and Middletown, the 1.7-square-mile borough of Red Bank is home to around 12,200 people, according to a 2015 census estimate. In 2010, around 34 percent of residents were Hispanic, and 12 percent African-American.There is a wide range of housing, from the large mansions along the Navesink River, where the television pundit Jon Stewart bought two adjacent homes six years ago, to the small Cape Cods and shotgun houses on the west side.Residential streets within walking distance of downtown and the train station are desirable, with a wide variety of mostly vintage homes, while an elevated section at the east end of Red Bank, known as Tower Hill, offers larger properties with somewhat newer homes.On July 6, there were 82 single-family and 12 multifamily dwellings on the market. Single-family properties at the low end included two two-bedroom co-ops in Warwick Gardens \u2014 for residents 55 and older \u2014 listed at $100,000 and $115,000, and a two-bedroom condominium in the Madison Commons complex, listed at $153,900; at the high end was a three-bedroom townhouse in the Corinthian Cove development for $1.399 million.As for rentals, two-bedrooms at some of the older complexes go for about $1,500 to $1,800 a month, while two-bedrooms in the new complexes range from around $2,700 to $3,400.Along Red Bank\u2019s main commercial thoroughfares are dozens of restaurants, cafes, shops, clubs and galleries, as well as numerous banks and brokerage houses.The closest beaches are Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach.Public school students attend Red Bank Primary School from prekindergarten to third grade and Red Bank Middle School for fourth to eighth grades, followed by Red Bank Regional High School in Little Silver, where they are joined by students from Shrewsbury and Little Silver. There is also Red Bank Charter School, which serves up to 195 Red Bank children from prekindergarten to eighth grade, with admission through a lottery that is now weighted toward low-income families.The high school, serving around 1,220 students, includes a vocational program, open to tuition-paying students from other towns in Monmouth County, with areas of concentration that include visual and performing arts, finance, technology, engineering and communications. The school offers 18 advanced placement courses and an international baccalaureate program. Average SAT scores for 2014-15 were 514 in reading, 533 in math, and 517 in writing, compared with state averages of 496, 518 and 494. The Seastreak Ferry from Atlantic Highlands, about a 15-minute drive, takes around 40 minutes to get to Wall Street during morning rush hour, and about an hour to get to East 35th Street in Manhattan, costing $26 one way or $45 round trip. (A 40-trip ticket book costs $655.) Cheaper options include the New Jersey Transit train to Penn Station, which takes about 80 minutes and costs $16 one way or $451 for a monthly pass, or the Academy Bus service from the Red Bank train station to the Port Authority, with rides taking roughly 65 to 80 minutes and costing $18 one way or $380 for a monthly pass.Named for the red banks of the Navesink River, the area became a manufacturing center in the 19th century for textiles, tanning and other products that were shipped to Manhattan. By the mid-1800s, ships were transporting passengers as well.Advertisement"}

Malone.Mr. Malone helped orchestrate a complicated stock swap last year that gave Lionsgate a stake in Starz \u2014 and himself a board seat on Lionsgate. The mogul controls the voting power at Starz as well.Lionsgate, the studio behind \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d movie franchise and \u201cMad Men,\u201d had long been considered as a likely buyer. Adding a cable channel could help provide scale at a time when other studios have been swallowed up by bigger entertainment giants, while providing ballast for a sometimes volatile movie business.Starz\u2019s resurgence has been led by Chris Albrecht, the former chief executive of HBO.In a call with reporters on Thursday morning, Lionsgate\u2019s chief executive, Jon Feltheimer, suggested that Mr. Albrecht would retain an important role in the combined company. \u201cWe expect Chris not only to continue to run Starz, but also to have a major participation and leadership of the entire combined company,\u201d he said.Speculation about a combination of Lionsgate and Starz had been percolating, heating up early last year when Mr. Malone engineered a stock swap involving the two companies. But there were several complicating factors then, including the ownership percentages that Mr. Malone and Lionsgate\u2019s biggest shareholder, the investor Mark Rachesky, would hold.As the talks progressed, other potential roadblocks emerged, like Starz\u2019s negotiations with DirecTV and the prospect of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union affecting Lionsgate\u2019s ability to garner the necessary financing.The terms of the Lionsgate-Starz deal are complex. Lionsgate will first change its stock, with each share splitting into half of a voting share and half of a nonvoting share.Then, owners of Starz A shares will receive $18 a share in cash and 0.6784 of a nonvoting Lionsgate share. Holders of Starz B shares will receive $7.26 in cash and both 0.6321 of a share of Lionsgate voting stock and 0.6321 of a share of Lionsgate nonvoting stock.The offer values Starz A shares at $32.21 each, based on Wednesday\u2019s closing prices, representing a roughly 14 percent premium.Class A shares in Starz rose more than 13 percent in early trading on Thursday, to $32.05.The deal is expected to close by the year\u2019s end, pending approval by shareholders and regulators.Advising Starz were LionTree Advisors, the boutique investment bank that has long advised Mr. Malone\u2019s empire, and the law firm Baker Botts. A special committee of Starz\u2019s board received advice from the Raine Group and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges.Lionsgate received advice from PJT Partners, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Dentons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gagosian Gallery to Pay New York State $4.3 Million", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byThe Gagosian Gallery, one of the most successful art dealerships in the world, failed to pay New York State sales tax on hundreds of art transactions over a decade, according to Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, who on Tuesday announced an agreement to collect $4.28 million in back taxes, interest and penalties from the business.\u201cThose who evade art taxes potentially deprive the state of millions of dollars,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cand ordinary New Yorkers are stuck footing the bill.\u201dInvestigators found that the gallery\u2019s affiliate in California, Pre-War Art Inc., sold and shipped nearly $40 million worth of art to customers in New York from 2005 to 2015 and should have paid sales tax on those sales, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The investigators said that a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d exists between the gallery and the California company. Larry Gagosian, the gallery\u2019s founder, is president of Pre-War as well as president of companies that control the rest of the gallery\u2019s operations, and Pre-War maintained an active bank account in New York.The investigation, which found no evidence of criminal activity, also concluded that the gallery failed to pay tax on the sale of other works in New York that were shipped out of state from 2012 to 2015. Mr. Schneiderman said that state law requires sales tax to be paid when possession of a good is transferred to a buyer within New York State and that the gallery, in handing over art to shipping companies that were not common carriers like FedEx or the United States Postal Service, was legally transferring possession to the buyer at that point.As part of the settlement with the attorney general\u2019s office, the gallery has agreed to set up a new shipping company of its own, so that it can comply with the letter of the law, and has also agreed that Pre-War will provide information to authorities for the next six years about its sales to New York.The investigation, conducted with help from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, is the result of a more aggressive stance being taken recently by the state toward the flourishing art market, which generates billions of dollars in annual sales and for which New York City and London are the primary hubs.Officials in the attorney general\u2019s office said that the settlement with Gagosian was the largest it had reached in a case involving an art gallery, though for a business as successful and sprawling as Gagosian \u2014 with locations in major cities around the world and tens of millions of dollars in annual sales \u2014 the amount will not be a body blow. (At the Art Basel art fair last month, the gallery offered a 1983 Gerhard Richter painting for $20 million.) The attorney general\u2019s office added that investigators believed other large art galleries in New York might also be avoiding sales tax through similar practices, but officials declined to discuss whether other settlements were being pursued.Joshua Rubenstein, a New York lawyer whose clients include art collectors, said he was surprised Mr. Schneiderman took the position that possession in art sales is transferred to a buyer when an artwork is handed to a contract carrier being paid by the buyer. \u201cIt very well may be that the attorney general has the law on its side,\u201d said Mr. Rubenstein, the national chairman of the trusts and estates practice for the Katten Muchin Rosenman law firm. \u201cBut it\u2019s a new interpretation.\u201dMr. Rubenstein, who was not involved in the Gagosian case but was apprised of its details, added: \u201cThis has huge implications for doing business in a way that everyone thought was acceptable.\u201d Along with art galleries, dealers of high-end furniture and other sellers of luxury goods could be affected, he said.The Gagosian Gallery declined to answer questions about the settlement beyond a statement: \u201cAlthough we cannot comment on these findings, we accept and will fully comply with the terms of the settlement to bring closure to this matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Monday, Mr. Lima was attacked and killed inside the Pav\u00f3n prison, Interior Minister Francisco Rivas said at a news conference. Twelve other people, including an Argentine model, Joanna Birriel, who was visiting Mr. Lima, were killed in ensuing unrest at the prison.The police retook control of the prison late in the afternoon.Mr. Rivas said the attack had been planned by another inmate, Marvin Montiel Mar\u00edn, known as El Taquero, who is serving an 826-year sentence for a 2008 attack on a bus that killed 16 people. Mr. Montiel and Mr. Lima led rival groups in the prison that clashed over drug sales, prisoner transfers and internal discipline, Mr. Rivas said.Mr. Lima, 46, was serving a 20-year sentence for the 1998 murder of Bishop Juan Jos\u00e9 Gerardi, who was bludgeoned in his quarters just two days after presenting a voluminous human rights report on atrocities in the civil war.Mr. Lima\u2019s life in the military and behind bars \u2014 where he made many enemies \u2014 offers a \u201ckey illustration\u201d of how clandestine structures inside Guatemala\u2019s military \u201chave been able to morph into criminal groups that have used their connections to gain power and economic benefit, either licitly or illicitly,\u201d said Adriana Beltr\u00e1n, an expert on the country\u2019s military networks who is a senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America.In 2013, Mr. Lima was stopped while traveling outside the prison, a capture that revealed he had been able to leave almost at will.The next year, the attorney general\u2019s office and Guatemala\u2019s anticorruption commission, a United Nations-backed panel of international prosecutors, charged him and the director of the prison system \u2014 a former military academy classmate \u2014 with running a vast extortion scheme.According to the panel, known as the Cicig, the racket charged prisoners for favors.Attorney General Thelma Aldana\u2019s office and the Cicig, which is led by Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian prosecutor, have been uncovering corruption scandals that are shaking the country\u2019s political and business power structure.Last month, Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina and former Vice President Roxana Baldetti were accused of running a scheme to give government contracts to prominent businesspeople in exchange for illegally financing the 2011 campaign.According to prosecutors, they received about $38 million in kickbacks.At a pretrial hearing in the case on Monday, Judge Miguel \u00c1ngel G\u00e1lvez announced Mr. Lima\u2019s death to the courtroom. Speaking to reporters during a break, Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina said he remained convinced of Mr. Lima\u2019s innocence in the Gerardi murder.Political tensions have been rising since the kickbacks case materialized. Last month, Ms. Aldana said she had received death threats and then suspended public activities before leaving the country for meetings in Colombia and the United States. She returned to Guatemala on Saturday.Mr. Rivas said the threats might have come from some of the suspects in the corruption cases. The kickbacks case shows how \u201ca criminal enterprise has been able to co-opt the state from within,\u201d Ms. Beltr\u00e1n said. \u201cIt has touched a lot of nerves.\u201dElisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Nic Wirtz from Guatemala City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Gets the Subsidized Apartments?", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialFederally financed affordable housing developments do not typically include yoga studios or rooftop clubs with spectacular skyline views. But in recent years, developers have been using public subsidies to build affordable apartments designated for artists that include such amenities.A new study of this kind of housing in Minnesota suggests it might worsen racial segregation by bypassing black and Latino people in favor of younger, white tenants.Such artist developments, which receive federal tax credits, became much more common after 2008, when developers in Minnesota persuaded Congress to exempt these projects from a law that required subsidized buildings to be open to anyone in the general public who met income guidelines. The exemption applies nationally but is heavily used by developers located in Minneapolis and St Paul.The artist exemption has allowed developers to build in well-to-do neighborhoods where they would have faced objections to housing for poor minority families. With the use of housing tax credits, historic buildings like the former Pillsbury flour mill in Minneapolis and the former Schmidt Brewery in St. Paul have been transformed into attractive buildings that help to revitalize the surrounding areas.While public subsidies keep rents affordable in these buildings, the study argues that these developments cost far too much per unit to build. The result is fewer units produced and fewer low-income families served.The study calls the Pillsbury mill development \u201cthe most expensive subsidized housing project in the history of Minnesota\u201d and says 251 apartments were developed at an average cost of $665,000 each. The authors also raise troubling questions about whether screening committees are shutting out families with children, the very poor and the elderly \u2014 three groups that are more likely to need affordable housing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Quiet Comeback of Reverse Mortgages", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byRetiringWHEN Peter and Joyce Hill wanted to buy a home in a community for people 55 and older in an area they had always admired in Lancaster County, Pa., they used a reverse mortgage to finance building in that development.\u201cA reverse mortgage gave us the option to build what we wanted,\u201d said Peter Hill, 79, who retired two years ago from a career in telecom engineering. \u201cThat appealed to us.\u201dReverse mortgages \u2014 which let homeowners 62 and older tap their accumulated home equity without facing monthly payments in return \u2014 earned a bad reputation over the years when they were subject to widespread abuses by lenders.The volume of these mortgages dropped to around 30,000 this year from about 115,000 at their peak popularity in 2009, according to the Federal Housing Administration. But with reforms in the system, they are making a modest comeback, seen as a way of helping some retirees fill gaps in their future income.Like a conventional mortgage, a reverse mortgage obligation is satisfied when the house is sold by the owners, the last owner has died or the home is sold by heirs. Any equity left over is kept by the last homeowner.Since these loans, also known as Home Equity Conversion Mortgages, are insured by the government, the Federal Housing Administration will cover any shortfalls between the final loan balance and net proceeds from the sale. That means you don\u2019t have to worry about being \u201cunderwater\u201d on the loan in case the home\u2019s value is less than the mortgaged amount.\u201cThey\u2019ve always been there as a last resort,\u201d said John Salter, a financial planning professor at Texas Tech. \u201cBut they make a lot more sense now because home equity can be a big part of net worth.\u201dAlthough still little used, reverse mortgages can allow retirees with only modest savings but little or no housing debt to stay in their homes, while also providing a financial backstop for those concerned about outliving their retirement funds.Ms. Hill noted that their reverse mortgage, which they took out on the new home they were building, took away the burden of conventional housing debt, the monthly payments of interest and principal, and assured their heirs that they would never have to make up any losses if the home sold for less than the value of its mortgage. \u201cThat gives us freedom of mind,\u201d she said.Reverse mortgages got off to a bad start when they were introduced more than 20 years ago, but they have redeemed themselves in recent years, supporters say, under tighter regulation from the F.H.A. and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Jamie Hopkins, a professor at the American College of Financial Services, said a combination of lower costs and better consumer protections \u2014 counseling is now required before lending \u2014 helped encourage some financial planners to start recommending them.Mr. Hopkins has found \u201cthat many people don\u2019t have enough money to get through retirement, so they have to consider using all of their wealth, including home equity as a retirement income source.\u201d\u201cPeople have peaks and troughs in demands for cash,\u201d said Peter Bell, president of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, an industry trade group. \u201cWhen they have peak demand, they may make poor decisions and cash in investments.\u201dAnother reason older people may turn to a reverse mortgage is to finance the costs of long-term care.Although a source of ready cash, reverse mortgages aren\u2019t right for everyone. If you want to provide a bequest to your heirs by allowing them to sell your home upon your death, a reverse mortgage can wipe out much of the equity in your home.\u201cReverse mortgages are off the table if you want to leave your home to your kids,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said.These loans are also challenging for those who have to move because of a disability, are selling a home after a short period or are relocating.When considering a reverse mortgage, take your time and do the math. How long do you plan to stay in the home? How much will you qualify for based on your age and home value? How will the cash be used? Will you need the cash right away? Would you prefer a line of credit that you can use at a later date?In addition to understanding how reverse mortgages would fit into your financial plan, you will need to shop around. Like other mortgages, they have closing costs, which range from $4,000 to $15,000, though those amounts typically are not paid upfront because they can be added to the loan\u2019s principal. Rates can be either variable or fixed.Keep in mind that even if you don\u2019t understand the terms of these loans at first, you will be required to speak with a trained counselor before you sign up for one. And there are plenty of rules you\u2019ll need to know. For example, the loans are not available for rental properties; they are available only for owner-occupied principal residences.You need to know all the features of these loans before approaching a broker or bank. Although they could appear to be ready, secure sources of cash during your most vulnerable years, they are still complex vehicles that ideally should be used only as part of a sound overall retirement plan.Advertisement"}

But Naomi, speaking to a group of professional women, is making a point less about her own feelings than about the gender stereotypes and sexist assumptions that prevail in the business world. She contends that, although women have grown more comfortable asserting their ambitions, they haven\u2019t fully embraced the competitive dynamic of modern capitalism.Not that Erin is especially ambivalent. Like her boss, she is committed to the path she has chosen, even if it means spending time apart from her husband and pretending to flirt with co-workers and clients. Naomi, simply by virtue of being a woman over 40, is expected to be warm and maternal, and Erin, for similar reasons, is expected to reciprocate, or at least to play along with, sexual attention from men. Nobody comes out and says anything gross or actionable \u2014 this is not \u201cMad Men,\u201d and every company has binders full of rules about appropriate conduct \u2014 but the lessons are clear, indisputable and dismaying.Which is to say about corruption, deceit and treachery, as well as sexism. There are plenty of men in the movie \u2014 not all of them bad guys, by any means \u2014 but, at heart, it is the story of three women. Naomi, Erin and Samantha (Alysia Reiner), a government lawyer who investigates insider trading and is an old acquaintance of Naomi\u2019s. As another important I.P.O. looms, there is plenty of jeopardy to go around, and the plot turns on a complicated series of alliances and betrayals.At several points, you are acutely aware of what might go wrong, not with Naomi\u2019s plans or Erin\u2019s ambitions or Samantha\u2019s case, but with the movie. It could easily have lapsed into didacticism, or into the kind of sentimental wishful thinking that so often afflicts Hollywood\u2019s attempts to deal with the seductive, morally ambiguous world of big money.\u201cEquity\u201d invites us to slot its characters into stereotypical frames and then breaks the glass. It would be easy to see Naomi as a cold and ruthless striver, Erin as a scheming underling and Samantha \u2014 who lives a respectably funky, middle-class life in Park Slope with her wife and their two adorable children \u2014 as the voice of justice and decency. One of the accomplishments of the movie, and of Ms. Reiner, Ms. Thomas and, especially, the amazing Ms. Gunn, is to make the viewer reflect on how deeply ingrained such images are, and to challenge them even as it exploits their tenacity.This kind of honesty is a little unsettling. Viewers seeking an ideologically reassuring ending \u2014 about the depredations of capitalism, the value of sisterhood or the glories of the free market \u2014 are likely to be frustrated, even shocked. But \u201cEquity\u201d pulls off a difficult balancing act with an elegance that should not be underestimated. It turns its unflappable gaze on a maddeningly complex reality and transforms it into a swift, clear and exciting story.\u201cEquity\u201d is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian), as in Ruthless.

{"Headline": "Is the Supreme Court Clueless About Corruption? Ask Jack Abramoff", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byOn Washington\u201cI continue to be concerned by what seems to be a lack of understanding on the part of the justices that a little bit of money can breed corruption,\u201d Mr. Abramoff said when I asked him about the McDonnell case.\u201cWhen somebody petitioning a public servant for action provides any kind of extra resources \u2014 money or a gift or anything \u2014 that affects the process,\u201d Mr. Abramoff said.He should know.Once a man with gold-plated Republican connections and easy access to the White House and Capitol leadership suites, Mr. Abramoff and his partners were masters of spreading favors around Washington. They parceled out tickets to major sporting events, escorted influential officials on all-expenses-paid golf junkets, paid the tabs for lavish dinners and cozied up to politicians at Signatures, a restaurant Mr. Abramoff once owned on Pennsylvania Avenue.All the while they were soliciting and obtaining help on issues ranging from gambling to wages to tax policy.Mr. Abramoff, now chastened and repentant, spent nearly four years in prison. Since his release, he has spoken out against the dangers of what he says is an inherently corrupt system where financial aid and other perks are provided to politicians who only naturally take care of benefactors they consider friends.\u201cPeople come to think those seeking favors and giving you things are your friends, your buddies,\u201d he said, remembering his own days as an insider. \u201cHuman nature is such that your natural inclination is, \u2018He has done something for me, what can I do for him?\u2019 The minute that has crept into the public service discussion, that is a problem.\u201dWhile the governor arranged meetings, made recommendations and appeared with Mr. Williams, the court ruled that he may never have committed an \u201cofficial act\u201d on Mr. Williams\u2019s behalf and that the jury should have received clearer instructions on that point.To many observers, the court essentially said that a politician can be found guilty of corruption only if the government can definitively show an official \u201cquo\u201d in response to a benefactor\u2019s \u201cquid\u201d \u2014 a very high bar in a world of winks and nods.\u201cWhen you have a system that defines the line between illegal and legal as it does, there are ways of kind of working through it,\u201d Mr. Abramoff said. \u201cMaybe 95 percent or 99 percent of what I did wasn\u2019t really illegal.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision was quietly celebrated by politicians who believe that prosecutors who are intent on criminalizing ordinary political wheeling and dealing have overreached in a number of cases and needed to be slapped down. They worry that too wide a net could eventually ensnare them and their colleagues.But the ruling was loudly protested by good-government advocates who worried that the court had thrown open the door to more misdeeds and undermined already flagging public confidence in government.In this case, the court seemed to accept Mr. McDonnell\u2019s argument that his efforts on behalf of Mr. Williams amounted to routine constituent work, something he might have done without the watch or the $15,000 for his daughter\u2019s wedding.During oral arguments in April, some justices seemed worried that politicians were at the mercy of vague rules that could leave them the prey of overzealous prosecutors.Mr. Abramoff said the justices seem far removed from the unpleasant realities of his old life.\u201cI do think there is a disconnect, and I understand it because none of them have been in the political process,\u201d he said of the justices.And that remove may now have diminished both the practice and public perception of politics.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Terrorism Scares Away the Tourists Europe Was Counting On", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The shocks have come one after another: Islamic State killings of civilians in Brussels and Nice. A deadly outburst of terrorism in Germany. A fresh terror-linked atrocity in a small French town. Warnings abound that more may be on the way.The surge of attacks in Europe has raised questions over whether a potentially durable new threat to stability is settling in. The political challenges for Europe\u2019s leaders are stark, and the impact on the region\u2019s economy may be just as profound.\u201cWe are experiencing a structural change, a phenomenon of war on our doorstep that didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d said Georges Panayotis, the president of the MKG Group, a tourism consulting company based in Paris. \u201cIf it\u2019s not resolved, the problem will continue.\u201dThe effects of that shift on businesses, large and small, have been deep.American and Japanese visitors in particular canceled reservations, even though the site, perched on an isolated rock off the northwest coast of Normandy, is far from Paris. Gilles Gohier, the chief executive, said he had to tell nearly a third of his 230 employees to go home for four months, and temporarily shut half of his five hotels and four restaurants. Since then, he has eliminated 17 positions and is hiring new employees only on temporary contracts.\u201cWhat happened in Rouen shows that it could happen here, or anywhere,\u201d Mr. Gohier said. \u201cThis makes it impossible to plan for business in the future,\u201d he added.All of that has hit the European economy in one of its most vital sectors, tourism, just as a tenuous recovery was starting to take hold.Uncertainty has multiplied in recent months as terrorist assaults have become more frequent and widespread. Investors have not pulled away. But visitors are rethinking Europe as a central travel destination, and the tourism industry, which accounts for 10 percent of economic activity in the European Union, has begun to feel the sting.European governments, meanwhile, are spending hundreds of billions of euros on enhanced domestic security and operations against the Islamic State, even as Brussels pressures countries to cut deficits.France, the European Union\u2019s third-largest economy after Britain and Germany, was already struggling to emerge from a long period of stagnation and high unemployment. France is the most visited country in Europe, attracting more than 84 million tourists last year, and economists had forecast a long-awaited uptick in growth for 2016. After the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks, the momentum slowed, and a slump in foreign tourism had only recently started to reverse.But when further Islamic State-inspired attacks were carried out in Europe, the impact was magnified.In France, growth in nightly hotel room bookings after the Paris attacks fell to single digits from 20 percent. After the Brussels bombings, bookings went negative, and after Nice, bookings fell by double digits, said Mark Okerstrom, the chief financial officer of Expedia, a global travel website.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a bounceback,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know for certain is whether there\u2019s an overall dampening impact to global travel, or to Europe specifically.\u201dAt Paris Plage, a makeshift beach erected along the Seine, a dozen armed police officers guarded an entry checkpoint on a recent day. Army troops marched past families playing in the sand and half-empty activity points along the river. The patrols, which cost taxpayers about 1 million euros, or $1.1 million, a day, will add to an already mounting bill after France pledged to spend \u20ac816 million this year to reinforce security.The ripple effect has been tangible.Rental apartments in Paris and Nice sat empty after people canceled plans to visit France, said Adrian Leeds, the head of the Adrian Leeds Group, a French real estate agency with properties in both cities. And clients who had been thinking of moving to France have suspended their property searches.\u201cIt\u2019s really affected things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people will come back when things have settled down.\u201dThe terrorism threat adds another layer of complexity in a region already grappling with a large influx of migrants and the repercussions of Britain\u2019s vote last month to leave the European Union.Finance ministers from the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, meeting last week in China, cited geopolitical conflicts and terrorism as growing threats to the global economy. \u201cThe world has already known terrorist attacks,\u201d said the French finance minister, Michel Sapin.\u201cBut today, the frequency of the attacks is creating a new situation of uncertainty,\u201d with economic consequences, he added.All that may turn travelers away from Europe\u2019s largest economies and toward calmer places like Spain, Greece or Scandinavia.That may not stop terrorism concerns from hitting the industries that make travel possible. Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, two of Europe\u2019s largest air carriers, recently slashed their profit forecasts for the year, citing repeated terrorist attacks in Europe as deterring tourists and business executives from traveling.The attacks have also taken a toll on the luxury industry, which relies heavily on foreign tourists, especially from Asia, for European sales. Leading brands like Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton and Prada have reported slumping sales as high-spending tourists stay away.On a recent morning, a handful of visitors flitted through Louis Vuitton\u2019s mammoth flagship store on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a contrast to previous years, when the summer tourist season would see the shop buzzing with customers. This week, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported flat sales in the first half of the year, citing a falloff in European tourism after the attacks.\u201cWe do not see any improvement in tourist traffic in France, and we will not see one while we are in a state of emergency, which prevents customers from coming,\u201d said Axel Dumas, chief executive of Herm\u00e8s, the maker of \u20ac10,000 Birkin bags.For Mr. Gohier, whose hotels and restaurants face the Mont-Saint-Michel, that can only be bad news for a smaller business like his.\u201cWhen you lose business, it has an economic impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThe terrorists want to create maximum damage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

New York and Florida were notably busy markets for law firm combinations.Over all last year, there were 91 law firm mergers, a number that could be exceeded this year as firms continue to look for ways to flourish, or just to keep afloat.\u201cSmall firms are increasingly vulnerable in the current market,\u201d said Eric A. Seeger, a principal at Altman Weil, a legal consulting firm in Newtown Square, Pa. \u201cThere\u2019s more competition for less work, and small firms need a strategy to avoid being squeezed out. That may mean building a bigger platform or being acquired by a firm that already has a broader foundation.\u201dIn the second quarter of 2016, 93 percent of the combinations involved firms with fewer than 25 lawyers. Almost half of the acquirers had 50 or fewer lawyers and focused on absorbing firms in the same city or state.Bigger deals combined firms in different geographic areas. The largest deal in the last three months was the merger of Husch Blackwell, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., and has 560 lawyers, with Whyte Hirschboeck Dudek, based in Milwaukee and with 144 lawyers, for an overall head count of more than 700 lawyers.New York City proved to be a deal breeding ground. Greenspoon Marder, a 172-lawyer firm with headquarters in Florida, acquired Jacob Medinger & Finnegan, a nine-person firm in Manhattan. Boies Schiller, a New York litigation powerhouse, added a specialist in white-collar litigation, O\u2019Shea Partners. Wilson Elser combined with Jankoff & Gabe, a three-lawyer firm in the city.Philadelphia-based law firms also were busy on the acquisition front. Cozen O\u2019Connor added Feldman Gale, a 15-lawyer intellectual property litigation firm in Miami. Fox Rothschild picked up Rothenberg Hyett Eisen & Lang, a three-lawyer firm in Boca Raton, Fla., and a second three-lawyer firm, Myers Kenney, in San Francisco.Also, in late June, Blank Rome, a large Philadelphia firm that this year acquired the former Washington firm Dickstein Shapiro, said it was adding Phillips Lerner, a four-lawyer family law firm in Los Angeles.In addition, four international deals were made in recent months. Three were unions of American and British firms. Holland & Knight expanded to London, acquiring Clark Ricketts, a six-lawyer transportation finance firm. Haynes & Boone planned to add its first European office by combining with Curtis Davis Garrard, a 20-lawyer London firm.Clyde & Company, an 1,800-lawyer London-based law firm, will open its sixth office in the United States when it acquires Thornton Davis & Fein, an 18-lawyer Miami insurance defense firm.And just as the second quarter was ending, legal giant DLA Piper announced it would acquire Gronberg Advokatbyra, a 21-lawyer Swedish law firm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Real Estate Developer Can Go Bankrupt. A President Can\u2019t.", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter the recent Brexit vote in Britain, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, commented on the fallout: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a plummeting pound. But if it does plummet, I do well.\u201dMost Britons have retirement savings and college tuition in pounds. For most Americans, a house is a major asset and a basis for a secure retirement, in addition to being where they live and raise a family.But not for Mr. Trump. In both cases, what is tumult for most people is for him just another way to win at the roulette wheel.The comments offered revealing glimpses into Mr. Trump\u2019s mind-set as well as the essence of his longstanding business code: turn the losses of others into opportunities for his own profit.What does Mr. Trump\u2019s record as a real estate developer say about him? From his extensive use of debt financing to his manipulation of government officials, he has demonstrated that he is resourceful, but also selfish and even reckless, with little regard for the public interest.In real estate development, you can take on staggering financial obligations with little personal risk. \u201cI\u2019m the king of debt,\u201d Mr. Trump recently proclaimed.Which it did \u2014 but the key words there are \u201cfor my benefit.\u201d That\u2019s the Trump theme song.Bankruptcy has been the building block for Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth accumulation. Indeed, looked at in light of the presidency, Mr. Trump\u2019s record in real estate development is almost entirely based on financing methods that are contrary to the laws governing the nation\u2019s debt.Few industries have as much direct contact with government as real estate. Public agencies issue building permits and certificates of occupancy and enforce zoning and environmental regulations. The typical developer tries to minimize government interference since it can slow down projects with requirements for community involvement, worker safety and sustainable construction.In his dealings with government agencies, Mr. Trump has a long history of misleading public officials. One of his earliest deals involved the Commodore Hotel, next to Grand Central Station. When the hotel\u2019s owner, the Penn Central railroad, went bankrupt in the 1970s, Mr. Trump, with the aid of his father\u2019s political allies, acquired the right to redevelop the hotel.As Wayne Barrett points out in his book \u201cTrump: The Greatest Show on Earth,\u201d banks were unwilling to provide financing for Mr. Trump to redevelop the Commodore unless New York gave him a tax abatement. The only way to get the abatement, Mr. Barrett wrote, \u201cwas to mislead the city into believing he already had the elusive financing.\u201dMr. Trump displayed his agility with the truth when, as Michael D\u2019Antonio notes in his book \u201cNever Enough,\u201d Mr. Trump deliberately sent city officials an agreement stating that Penn Central had designated him to acquire the hotel as developer. But it had only his signature, not that of the railroad.Mr. Trump used this partly signed agreement to win the city\u2019s support for his project, which he then used to get the Hyatt Hotel to invest in a new hotel (what\u2019s now the Grand Hyatt New York). Mr. Trump later took pride in his manipulation and said, as Mr. D\u2019Antonio reported: \u201cThey only asked to see an agreement. They didn\u2019t say it had to be signed.\u201dMr. Trump is not in the mold of visionary real estate developers like James Rouse, who preserved historic structures like Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston. The best developers forge partnerships that harness their private interests to public objectives. Smart developers recognize that the value of a property\u2019s value rises when the community around it thrives.A president does not govern by making a series of separate deals. Every decision in government is connected to everything else. But if you mess up in real estate, your investors absorb the loss.Mr. Trump argues that his business success qualifies him to be president, but precisely the opposite is true. His business practices would poison America\u2019s reputation as a land of economic stability and fiscal integrity. He also claims that he wants to put these skills to work for the public. But the Trump playbook is fundamentally wrong for the responsibilities of the White House.Mitchell L. Moss is a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watching Brazil\u2019s Rich: A Full-Time Job", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I remember when Latin America sent one of its tycoons to the top of the list of the world\u2019s billionaires. Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, the Mexican telecoms-to-retail magnate, leapfrogged past Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010 to become the richest person on earth.Slim\u2019s rise fit nicely into the story of what is the most inequitable region of the world \u2014 a continent where gargantuan wealth coexists with abject poverty. But he was hardly alone. In 2010, Forbes magazine, the global plutocracy\u2019s official score\u00adkeeper, counted nine Latin Americans among the world\u2019s 100 top \u00adbillionaires.Among them was Eike Batista, a spanking new magnate from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Nowhere on Forbes\u2019s list just three years earlier, he was by 2010 the second-richest Latin American and the eighth-richest person in the world. And he was setting his sights even higher. \u201cSlim had better clean his rearview mirrors because on one side or the other, I\u2019m going to pass him,\u201d he proclaimed to Charlie Rose.Batista \u2014 Eike to Brazilians \u2014 portrayed himself as a different breed of titan, not a lucky scion, inheritor of past fortune, but a builder of empire. Unlike other rich Brazilians, he claimed, he didn\u2019t make his money from government contracts and political connections. He was, of course, the son of Eliezer Batista, a former chief executive of Vale, Brazil\u2019s state-run mining colossus. Yet he represented himself as the American-style entrepreneur of legend, pulling himself up by the power of his talent, will and perseverance.Ultimately, though, Batista was peddling aspirations. Part visionary, part snake oil salesman, he may have thought of himself as a bona fide creator of wealth, unique amid Latin America\u2019s coddled barons of industry and commerce. But what he sold, to eager investors at home and abroad, was Brazil\u2019s dream of greatness. And just as Brazil\u2019s dream collapsed, Batista\u2019s billions evaporated.The rise and fall of Batista is dramatically rendered in \u201cBrazillionaires,\u201d Alex Cuadros\u2019s enjoyable, deeply reported account of Brazil\u2019s outsize collection of tycoons. Cuadros, a young American journalist, spent the last six years in S\u00e3o Paulo, mostly as the \u201cbillionaires reporter\u201d for Bloomberg News. His job included calculating and recalculating the wealth of titans like the Marinhos of the Globo TV empire, of construction magnates like the Camargo family and even of Edir Macedo, the founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.This reporting provides the book\u2019s backbone. But \u201cBrazillionaires\u201d offers more than a flat collection of billionaire tales. Cuadros shrewdly presents his collage of immense wealth against an underlying background of corruption. There are kickbacks for government contracts. There are gigantic taxpayer subsidies: In 2009 alone, the state-run development bank, BNDES, lent out $76 billion, \u201cmore than the World Bank lent out in the entire world.\u201d And of course there are lavish campaign contributions, attached to the inevitable quid pro quos. JBS, which leveraged government loans to become the largest meatpacking company in the world, spent $180 million on the 2014 elections alone. \u201cIf every politician who had received JBS money formed a party,\u201d Cuadros writes, \u201cit would be the largest in Congress.\u201dIn his telling, Brazilians seem to embrace the cozy relationship between business and government as a source of pride rather than a risk for conflicts of interest. In one passage, Cuadros underscores the contrast between Adam Smith and the 19th-century Brazilian thinker Jos\u00e9 da Silva Lisboa, viscount of Cairu. Lisboa\u2019s \u201cPrincipios de Econom\u00eda Politica\u201d was meant to be an adaptation of Smith\u2019s \u201cWealth of Nations.\u201d But rather than present a paean to the invisible hand of the market, the viscount offered a rather paternalistic view of economic progress.\u201cThe sovereign of each nation must be considered the chief or head of a vast family,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand thus care for all those therein like his children, cooperating for the greater good.\u201d Swap \u201cgovernment\u201d for \u201csovereign\u201d and the passage still serves as an accurate guide to the Brazilian development strategy. It\u2019s just that some children \u2014 the Marinhos, the Camargos \u2014 are cared for better than \u00adothers.Of course, Cuadros notes wryly, the winners in this rigged race to the top cannot help believing in their own merits. The nation, they insist, prospers because of them. They deserve their station in life. In a revealing moment, Batista tells Cuadros, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Brazil is the Brazilian dream, and I happen to be the example.\u201dBatista is Cuadros\u2019s main antihero, \u00adoccupying most of the book\u2019s second half. His virtue may have been timing. He burst onto the scene in 2008 just as Brazil seemed on the cusp of achieving its long-held aspirations to greatness, included alongside Russia, India and China in what came to be known as the BRIC countries. China was buying much of Brazil\u2019s production of iron and soy. Foreign investors poured money in.Batista wrapped himself in the flag. Backed with billions in subsidized loans from the state-run development bank, he sold himself as Brazil\u2019s future.By 2010, he had raised many billions of dollars from Brazilian and foreign investors for five of his companies. There was his mining giant, his power generator and his ports company. There was his manufacturer of platforms from which to drill for oil in Brazil\u2019s vast newfound reserves under the Atlantic. And there was the crown jewel, a petroleum company, which Batista promised would soon be pumping more crude than Oman.The government in Bras\u00edlia loved Eike\u2019s story, which fit snugly into its plan to build up national champions, lavishly funded with subsidized credit, that could go head-to-head with the mightiest multinationals in the world. BNDES, the only lender in Brazil that charged single-digit interest rates, lent billions to Eike\u2019s projects. And Eike loved the government back, providing lavish campaign contributions to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and his successor, Dilma Rousseff.When Batista\u2019s luck turned sour \u2014 the oil wasn\u2019t gushing quite as he had promised, a grand port project at A\u00e7u was years behind schedule \u2014 President Rousseff wasn\u2019t in a position to bail him out. She became entangled in her own problems; this year legislators began impeachment proceedings against her for using the state-run banks to finance the government on the sly, and she ultimately let Batista go.Brazil has stumbled from its decade of grace.

As part of the round, Pete Flint, the founder of the real estate site Trulia, will join the company\u2019s board.Among the investors in the round were Mr. Flint; Mr. Bonderman; Ray Lane, the former Oracle executive and venture capitalist; and Gigi Pritzker, a member of the wealthy Chicago family that built the Hyatt Hotel chain.The new money will help the four-year-old Peek build its employee ranks. The site operates in the same way as the restaurant reservation site OpenTable, but it focuses on offering deals on events and tourist activities in various cities.

{"Headline": "Gov. Cuomo\u2019s U-Turn on Mass Transit", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byEditorialFive and a half years into his tenure as governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo has finally said that he will make mass transit \u201ca personal priority.\u201dThat is an important shift for a governor who has largely kept his distance from his Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs subways, commuter rails and buses in the New York City region. As the largest mass transit system in the country, the M.T.A. serves a population of 15.3 million people. And as riders know, the whole network is overcrowded, overworked and falling apart.Mr. Cuomo said his grand transportation plan would eventually include revamping La Guardia Airport, redoing the Penn Station complex, fixing bridges, creating a new tunnel and repairing the old ones under the Hudson River and, of course, modernizing the M.T.A.Such an overhaul will cost enormous amounts of money. For the exciting parts, like new airport terminals or a new Hudson River tunnel, much of the financing will come from the federal government, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and private financing.But it is the M.T.A., an antiquated workhorse, that needs basic and sustained financial support. Ridership on subways, buses and railroads is up to 2.73 billion trips a year, almost double the number from 15 years ago. Delays have increased as workers struggle to maintain the network and to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy nearly four years ago.M.T.A. managers pleaded with Mr. Cuomo last year to help pay for a five-year capital plan of $32 billion for modernizing tracks, stations, signals and other equipment. The agency could come up with only $17 billion on its own. Mr. Cuomo was less than enthusiastic, and he dismissed the M.T.A.\u2019s budget as \u201cbloated\u201d even though most transportation advocates argued that it was short by billions of dollars.After the governor promised to contribute only about $1 billion in state funds, legislators and transit activists from the city lobbied for more. He finally agreed to provide $8.3 billion, with New York City increasing its contribution to $2.5 billion, and the M.T.A. agreed to scale back its costs to $27 billion.The Move NY proposal, which would need legislative approval, would raise about $1.35 billion a year in new revenue. It would adjust tolls on bridges \u2014 adding ones on Manhattan\u2019s four free East River bridges and lowering the cost for other bridges. Taxis and some cars like Uber and Lyft would be charged a per-mile fee for coming into the crowded parts of Manhattan. The extra money could go to adding subway lines in underserved areas outside Manhattan.Like raising the gas tax, getting Move NY through Albany would take sustained political effort by the governor. Mr. Cuomo has now declared himself to be New York\u2019s primary transportation advocate, and millions of commuters in the metropolitan area need him to act.Advertisement"}

Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina and the chairman of the caucus. \u201cAs of June 30, just a few days ago, 491 Americans have been fatally shot by the police; most of those were African-American.\u201dMr. Butterfield added, \u201cLast night, despicable crimes were committed against Dallas police officers, and when the dust settled five of them were dead as a result of an organized execution by criminals who possess guns and use them to the extreme. And so the Congressional Black Caucus convenes today to say to America we are continuing our fight to remove guns from the hands of terrorists and would-be criminals.\u201dFive officers were killed and seven others were shot during a protest in downtown Dallas.Democrats, including the 45-member Black Caucus, have been pushing Republicans to schedule votes on gun control proposals even though those measures are sure to be defeated and similar proposals have already failed in the Senate. They include an effort to block gun sales to individuals on the government\u2019s no-fly list, and a strengthening of mandatory background checks for gun buyers.\u201cRepublicans, what on Earth are you, why are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence?\u201d Mr. Butterfield said. \u201cWhy are you recoiling and not giving us a debate on gun violence? Why not give it a hearing, give us a debate, give us an up-or-down vote on our legislation on gun violence? Why?\u201dIn a floor speech, Speaker Paul D.

Let\u2019s not lose sight in our common humanity. The values that brought those protesters to the streets in Dallas, the values that brought those protesters to the streets in Washington last night.\u201dHe added, \u201cRespect. Decency. Compassion. Humanity. If we lose those fundamental things, what\u2019s left?\u201dMr. Ryan, however, did not immediately suggest any legislative response.Other members of the Black Caucus said they hoped to pursue legislation that would encourage communities to adopt voluntary performance standards for police officers, as well as legislation that would provide additional federal financing and other support for training law enforcement officers.Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who led an all-night sit-in on the House floor on June 22 to demand votes on the gun control legislation, urged peaceful protest, in the tradition of the Civil Rights movement of which he was a leader.\u201cThere\u2019s no room in our society for violence; we respect law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. But he added, \u201cThere needs to be greater training of law enforcement and sometimes I feel that maybe not only those of us that engage in nonviolent protest but police officers need to be taught the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence, to respect the dignity and the worth of every human being.\u201dHe said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether black or white, Latino, Asian-American or Native American; we are one family living in one house.

{"Headline": "Could Hillary Clinton Become the Champion of the 99 Percent?", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "FeatureA coalition of progressives has been quietly building a plan to bring Occupy-style ideas into the political establishment. Will the Democratic nominee get on board?Supported byIn the car, Wong heard the candidate say: \u201cThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201dOh, my God, Wong thought, I can\u2019t believe she just said that. Each time she repeated this story to me, she narrowed her eyes toward an imaginary car radio and pointed in disbelief.\u201cProsperity can\u2019t be just for C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers,\u201d the candidate continued. \u201cDemocracy can\u2019t just be for the billionaires and corporations.\u201dOh, my God, Wong thought again, I can\u2019t believe she just said that. It may have been political boilerplate, but Wong thrilled to it. Her incredulity had yielded to pleasure and admiration. Republicans, the candidate went on, \u201cpledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures.\u201dWong stopped the car to check her phone. Exultant emails were streaming in. \u201cThis is our plan!\u201d one Roosevelt board member wrote. \u201cThis is your plan!\u201d\u201cOur plan\u201d was \u201cRewriting the Rules of the American Economy,\u201d an inventive combination of narrative history and policy platform that Roosevelt published the month before. The report billed itself as a comprehensive agenda to ameliorate inequality. First, it said, inequality is a choice, not an inevitable byproduct of technology, globalization and the uneven distribution of personal virtue. Second, it held that the longstanding notion of an economic trade-off between growth and equality is a fiction.Unlike the myriad other white papers that each week were drafted, edited, somnolently received at other think tanks and shelved without fanfare, this report \u2014 original not so much in its ideas as in its clarity and vigor \u2014 had captured wide and consequential attention. In the months leading up to its publication, the Roosevelt team was in close touch with Clinton speechwriters and advisers, and in subsequent rallies the candidate continued to draw upon the report, even at the level of explicit language; calls to \u201crewrite the rules\u201d found their way into more of her addresses. The many news reports that linked the speech to Wong\u2019s organization consistently and erroneously relocated her team to Washington. (Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for \u201crevolution,\u201d finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party\u2019s near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment.As the party heads into its convention in Philadelphia, this coalition sees encouraging signals \u2014 perhaps most notably the role that Elizabeth Warren, a key Roosevelt ally, has come to play in the campaign \u2014 that Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic sympathies might ultimately lie further to the left than skeptics supposed. Roosevelt is a 501(c)(3), and though it does maintain a political-action arm, it does not work to elect specific candidates. Still, various representatives from Clinton\u2019s speechwriting and policy teams regularly solicit the organization\u2019s input. Roosevelt in turn has redoubled its efforts not only on advancing the ideas in \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d but also in recruiting the personnel necessary to carry them out, in the form of a methodical effort to find suitable candidates for economic positions in a future presidential administration.Rob Stein, the liberal operative whose establishment of the Democracy Alliance in 2005 did perhaps more than any other act to funnel new money and new ardor into progressive causes, told me: \u201cLike no other progressive institution, Roosevelt is bringing strategically relevant insight to the deeper structural problems of our economy.\u201d Part of the reason Wong and her team remain mostly unheralded is that they eschew power politics for the quieter work of developing networks to act on ideas. They thus do not see themselves as pushing or pulling or dragging the Democratic nominee to their position. They believe that this candidate, of all candidates, is unlikely to respond to public hectoring or ultimatums. The greatest incentive they can offer is a demonstration that Clinton may well already be the candidate that progressives \u2014 and the electorate \u2014 have been waiting for.One cold, dreary spring day I accompanied her to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. building on 16th Street NW, a foreboding grid of polished beige stone with a lobby dominated by a hallucinogenic two-story marble mosaic. Wong often proceeds by indirection, and the obvious contrast of this first meeting \u2014 between Big Labor\u2019s encumbrances and Roosevelt\u2019s dexterity \u2014 made, in retrospect, a deliberate point.Damon Silvers, the organization\u2019s policy director, greeted us in a cluttered low-floor office that looked as if it might belong to a law professor. He showed us seats at a wobbly round table and talked about wages and productivity and economic pain. \u201cThere have been a few years over the last 30 with broad-based wage growth,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut those are the outliers, the exceptions \u2014 a few years under Reagan, some under Clinton, but stagnation has been the regime since 1980.\u201d He praised Roosevelt as the source of \u201cheavyweight economic thinking\u201d on this, and for \u201cupping the ante.\u201dWong deflected the credit. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been saying this,\u201d she replied, \u201cand Elizabeth Warren says it, and Stiglitz has been saying it for 30 years, but now it\u2019s almost common knowledge.\u201d Wong was more concerned about how they planned to put that common knowledge into action before the looming convention.\u201cDespite President Obama\u2019s efforts, the rules of the economy continue to drive runaway inequality,\u201d Silvers went on. \u201cThe power dynamics that were in place in 2008 are still in place now, and we don\u2019t have all the time in the world to fix this.\u201dThis continued for a while, as Silvers relaxed into the comfortable contours of his analysis and Wong steered the visit toward what might actually be done. Eventually she was summoned to see the union\u2019s president, Richard Trumka, whose seigneurial berth looks down on the White House. Silvers directed me in the meantime to a vitrine of the fat blue bill-signing pens L.B.J. used to enact the Great Society \u2014 food stamps, public broadcasting, urban mass transport, water quality, wholesome poultry products. \u201cIf you want to see what structural change looks like,\u201d he told me, tapping on the glass, \u201ctake a look at this.\u201dThe progressive organizations in Wong\u2019s rotation take as a matter of course the idea that the Obama administration was a significant missed opportunity for transformation on that order. They do not entirely blame Obama. He had his legislative victories \u2014 most importantly in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but one lesson they drew from his time in office was that liberals had long been overly fixated on legislative success. (Johnson had a Congress he could work with; Obama mostly did not, and the next president probably won\u2019t, either.) The right has set the agenda for the past 35 years because they built their economic movement deductively (from the first principle of the unregulated market) and took their victories where they could find them. The left, by comparison, tended to moralize, and spoke in the language of justice instead of growth. When they did talk about economics, it took the form of individual issues \u2014 minimum wage, student debt, paid family and sick leave \u2014 rather than overarching pronouncements. This muddle worsened during the Bush era, when urgent noneconomic concerns forced the left to privilege short-term electoral tactics over long-term strategy.Roosevelt was designed to be a place, independent of the party establishment, to unite all of these factions under the banner of long-term, coherent economic thinking. Had such a movement existed in 2008, it might have seized on the financial crisis as an opportunity for structural economic reform. Obama\u2019s recovery model, to the group\u2019s lasting dismay, remained in thrall to old superstitions about growth. The goal of the bailout was to fix the existing financial system and get credit flowing back into the economy while keeping an eye on deficit spending. But today, though high-level macroeconomic numbers like monthly job growth or the headline unemployment rate have improved, almost half of the new jobs created in the first five years of the recovery were poverty-level. Repaired with a kludge, the system went right back to doing exactly what it did before: allowing the extraordinary concentration of power in the hands of the few to dominate the prospects of the many.Roosevelt and its allies believe that the crisis could have been an occasion \u2014 unseen since the New Deal \u2014 for the diffusion of authority, large-scale infrastructural investment, attention to low-wage growth and relief for the plight of overextended homeowners rather than banks. But that opportunity passed by because, in the absence of a strong, organized countervailing force, responsibility for the bailout simply defaulted to the claque of Citigroup veterans and sympathizers that had administered Democratic economic policy for what was now a full generation. The critics didn\u2019t think that these ex-bankers were unscrupulous, but rather that they acted in accordance with the free-market orthodoxy they inherited from their predecessors.With all this resentment of bankers, a news consumer might have thought the enthusiasm in this milieu \u2014 that is, all the groups that resisted the legacy of deregulated, race-neutral, free-market bipartisanship \u2014 would accrue to Bernie Sanders. But Sanders in fact came up only rarely in my conversations with them, usually in praise of the sincerity of his message. The common view of the Democratic contest was that Sanders did a great service in pushing Clinton to the left. Though in some senses this was clearly the case \u2014 on the minimum wage and on college tuition \u2014 there was an alternate interpretation. As Sanders gained traction, it seemed to Wong and her partners that Clinton had simply ceded to him the territory of aggressive financial reform. Sanders, in their view, hadn\u2019t so much pulled her to the left as pushed her to swivel.The Roosevelt coalition agreed by and large with the direction of Sanders\u2019s economic program, but they regretted the crudeness of his exposition. They understood, for example, the appeal of a call to break up the banks but found greater sophistication in Clinton\u2019s proposals to regulate \u201cshadow banking.\u201d They wished his advisers had been more careful with the numbers. And the personal iconoclasm and moral purity of the Sanders campaign didn\u2019t lend themselves to governance. How, given the way Obama\u2019s ideals foundered on a kind of Washington default mode, did Sanders plan to staff an entire administration?On the left, there are lots of small organizations in Washington that publish granular research on specific economic trends. But the most significant liberal think tank in recent years has been the Center for American Progress, founded in 2003 by the former Bill Clinton chief of staff (and current Hillary Clinton campaign chair) John Podesta as his party\u2019s answer to the conservative Heritage Foundation. CAP has done a lot of innovative policy work, especially on universal preschool and health care, but it was always less of a research organization than a shadow government for an opposition in exile. When Obama was elected, roughly a third of CAP\u2019s staff went into his administration. CAP was founded in an era when few liberals were of the opinion that the system itself was broken: If you just found slightly better Democrats, elected them to office and put smarter policies in their hands, they believed, the country would return to the prosperity of the 1990s. Liberal Washington was not equipped, when the financial crisis broke, to tender a holistic analysis of what was ailing the economy. (Today, CAP\u2019s economic ideas are more in line with those of Roosevelt, and in 2015 it released a report on short-termism that anticipated part of \u201cRewriting the Rules.\u201d)In 2009, a political scientist named Andrew Rich, known for writing about the \u201cwar of ideas,\u201d was drafted to reinvent the Roosevelt Institute as a place for the radical thinking that postcrisis politics seemed to require. Roosevelt at the time was an ad hoc collection of spare progressive parts, including the upkeep of the F.D.R. Library in Hyde Park, N.Y. Rich believed that if you weren\u2019t in Washington, and you weren\u2019t beholden to the party apparatus, and if you got the right people \u2014 people who were too idiosyncratic or rough-hewn for academia, or academics who wanted to be politically relevant but needed help with finding an audience for their work \u2014 you could create a new kind of institution on a looser, livelier model.At that moment of upheaval and administration dithering, financial reform was the new Roosevelt\u2019s obvious first priority. Rich brought on Stiglitz and Mike Konczal, whose pseudonymous financial-crisis blog had a cult following among progressives. In 2010, the organization held a conference that prominently featured Elizabeth Warren, then early in her career as a public figure. While Warren worked on the TARP oversight panel, she needed somewhere to park her aide-de-camp, Dan Geldon, to help draft the details of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was being set up on the basis of her ideas. He served as a fellow, and he and Warren maintain close ties to Roosevelt. Warren insisted I come into her office, though she was late to a vote, so she could tell me how enormously enthusiastic she was about Roosevelt\u2019s work: \u201cIt\u2019s a new voice in American political discourse. Their message is, We can do better than this! They\u2019re bringing fundamental optimism back to the center of American life.\u201dWhen Wong took over in 2012, she continued to recruit staff members and fellows who were at once nonaligned and well connected: to the A.F.T. and S.E.I.U., Demos, MoveOn, the Clintons. By January 2015, Wong had decided, along with her communications director, Marcus Mrowka, and her vice president of research and policy, Nell Abernathy, to prepare for the coming election by creating a full-dress economic agenda that would be there for the candidates\u2019 taking. \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d got funding from the Ford Foundation, whose decision last year to refocus around the issue of inequality was influenced by Roosevelt, and whose president, Darren Walker, effused to me about Wong as an \u201cincandescent leader\u201d for the progressive movement. While written by Stiglitz, the paper was worked out in consultation with labor officials, academics, congressional staff members and \u2014 unusually for a think tank \u2014 advocates from places like Color of Change, Naral and the Black Civic Engagement Fund.The report lays out a stark narrative about the American economy as it exists today. Inequality, it maintains, is a function not of economic laws but of the preferences awarded to the powerful to extract rents \u2014 to exploit people who have little choice \u2014 especially on necessary goods like housing and health care. This may have been old wine, but it was poured into new bottles; economists after Keynes lost the habit of talking about power, and Roosevelt stressed that this vision was about the way that power and prejudice created not only distorted markets but also nonfunctional ones. The economy has stalled because too much wealth is being generated in nonproductive activity, hoarded to preserve for the rich all the things government no longer provides. The long-run situation, as Wong put it to me once, is America as \u201ca fear-catalyzed gated community for a privileged few, and a violent, racially hostile, \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 race to the bottom for the rest of us.\u201d\u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d then moves on to 37 policy recommendations. Some seek to reduce concentrated power via changes to the tax code, financial reform and labor-market interventions: enacting financial-transaction taxes; taxing corporations on global income; strengthening the right to collective bargaining; and rewriting laws \u2014 on intellectual-property rights, lending practices, health care \u2014 that present unfair opportunities for monopoly profits. There is a parallel pocketbook agenda: a Fed policy of full employment, via low interest rates and access to credit markets, rather than one designed to control inflation; higher living wages; gender and racial equality in pay; affordable child care. Last is infrastructure: public spending for public goods, and not just roads and bridges but also broadband, high-speed rail, smart grid, green buildings \u2014 and especially investments in schools and housing that might end racial segregation. All three categories rest in part on public options. The role of an activist government, as Roosevelt sees it, is not to monopolize any given service, on a command-economy model, but to exist as a permanently nonextortionate market player. The report calls for a postal bank, which would expand access to banking services to the underserved; a public option for mortgages; Medicare open to all; and an expansion of Social Security via voluntary public investment accounts modeled on I.R.A.s.From a budgetary perspective, at least, the report takes care to present its recommendations as feasible and responsible, imagining that all of those public options (for example) would be run as break-even enterprises. \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d does call for an increase in top individual marginal tax rates to perhaps 45 percent, a substantial increase by today\u2019s Republican standards but well in line with contemporary Europe or 20th-century America. What was novel was that, unlike the usual centrist Democrat call for more job training and an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, this was not about tinkering with the old tax-and-transfer liberalism but about changing the fundamental structure of the economy. Their demands were vaulting, but they held that an agenda offering freedom from exploitation (rather than freedom from regulation), and insisting that greater fairness would benefit everyone, would resonate with all Americans.Everywhere it has been pointed out that this election feels like a prolonged rehash of 1990s enmities. Wong has a Faulknerian view: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the same fights,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the exact same people.\u201d The story goes that there were two distinct factions in the Clinton White House: the free-market, centrist, \u201cneoliberal\u201d wing that we now associate with such figures as Larry Summers and Robert Rubin and such institutions as the Democratic Leadership Council; and then people like Stiglitz \u2014 who was head of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years \u2014 and Robert Reich. The Summers/Rubin wing largely prevailed. An approach to crime and poverty was engineered to win back Reagan Democrats so they could pass a deregulatory program that would appeal to emerging managerial wealth. The party\u2019s Rubinite/Citigroup lineage extended through Rubin\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Michael Froman, who as part of Obama\u2019s transition team helped usher Tim Geithner into the Treasury Department. It was this legacy that had, throughout the primaries, prevented so many people from taking the former first lady \u2014 especially as she tied herself to Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 as a credible voice for the economic reforms of \u201cRewriting the Rules.\u201dThis Manichaean story is a vast oversimplification for a variety of reasons, but it did inform the way many voters, especially on the left, viewed the primaries. The fight between Clinton and Sanders often seemed like a choice between a repudiation of the long 1990s entirely (Robert Reich has been an outspoken Sanders supporter) or an avowal that this time the party will choose the vision of Stiglitz. The obvious mystery then becomes: Where does Hillary Clinton herself stand? The problem is not that there\u2019s no answer, Wong and Stiglitz think, but that it\u2019s a badly phrased question. To pretend the battles are the same as they were in 1994 ignores the fact that the economic realities have changed, economic thinking has changed, the party has changed and \u2014 perhaps more than anything \u2014 the electorate has changed.Now, though, there\u2019s no excuse. \u201cBetween 1990 and 2015 we\u2019ve had the financial crisis, growth of inequality to unbounded levels, slow growth over all for a third of a century,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a third of a century as an experiment, and if you don\u2019t see the results of that experiment now, that\u2019s willful neglect.\u201dWong was a White House fellow in the Clinton administration in 1998 and had her own objections to the positions of that White House, though for her at the time it had more to do with a policy of race neutrality than with neoliberalism. (She helped write an 800-page book, in the voice of the president, about racial healing; it was spiked in part because it didn\u2019t hew to the administration\u2019s official line.) For Wong, too, this election has proved not that the disputes of the 1990s must be fought anew but that they have already been won, decisively and across the board. They have been won on the data, now that we have another two decades of it. And they have been won on the demographics, as the millennial generation \u2014 boisterously represented at Roosevelt by a large collegiate network and, in their office, by a young former U.C.L.A. activist named Joelle Gamble \u2014 has never known anything but market precarity.Since the 1970s, movement conservatism has consistently outperformed progressives in laying a talent conduit. Heritage identifies young candidates and grooms them for a smooth climb through the system; adjacent to its headquarters is a library-dorm for its interns, replete with piles of free Hayek. One of Roosevelt\u2019s youngest fellows, the legal scholar K. Sabeel Rahman, likes to point out that Department of Justice regulators, drawn from conservative legal and economic circles and influenced by the ideas of Robert Bork, essentially rewrote the federal guidelines for mergers and acquisitions and thereby weakened the government\u2019s power to make antitrust cases.Roosevelt\u2019s project, likewise, is about finding people with the economic, legal and regulatory experience to change the country\u2019s balance of power. Wong and her staff have been clear that what they are compiling is nothing so simple as a list. It is, rather, a process by which qualified candidates from all 50 states might be matched to possible jobs. This goes for top positions, like cabinet secretaries or the heads of agencies, but also down to the deputy under secretaries and staff members, whom they could introduce to the system. The people who hold these jobs now are probably lucky if their own relatives know their titles, but theirs are positions with real leverage, especially collectively: the Treasury\u2019s Domestic Finance Department\u2019s chief homeownership preservation officer; HUD\u2019s Office of Housing\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for risk management and regulatory affairs; the Department of Justice\u2019s deputy assistant attorney general for economics. It\u2019s important to look at these jobs in aggregate because centers of power in Washington are not fixed: A position, like the chief of staff of the O.M.B., that is relatively weak when filled by one candidate might, occupied by someone else, represent a key node.The team had a few different sources for leads: securities and banking regulators at the state and local levels; the offices of the state attorneys general, especially assistants in the departments of consumer protection, education and welfare; academics in law, economics and business; and other think tanks and policy institutes. \u201cWhere,\u201d they would ask a local banking regulator or assistant city manager in Seattle or San Antonio or St. Paul, \u201cdo you think you\u2019d want to be in five or 10 years?\u201d The ideal candidates have experience taking (or advocating for) regulatory action, and would thus know how to use the varied, extensive antitrust powers that individual agencies like the D.O.J. and the Federal Trade Commission already possess. Many of the prescriptions advanced by \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d would require a congressional majority to make them real; the appointments project, by contrast, would help circumvent the congressional standstill on many issues where authority already resides in the executive branch.Wong thinks it\u2019s no longer accurate to even think of these issues in terms of left versus right. Instead, she holds, real political realignment means a long-term cultural change in the perception of government and its relationship to consolidated power. Wong has been resolute in refusing to draw a bright line, as some progressives would, to rule out bankers, in part because banks are only one element in the pattern. If most people have a hard time understanding or worrying about the concept of \u201cfinancialization,\u201d they have a much easier time recognizing \u2014 as Elizabeth Warren put it in a speech at the New America Foundation last month \u2014 that four airlines control 80 percent of American airline seats, three chains own 99 percent of drugstores and four companies sell 85 percent of the beef.The next day, I went to see Wong in her office. She did not want to seem na\u00efve, but she was optimistic. \u201cAll of my optimism now is based on all of the evidence \u2014 on all the polling, on all the people, on what the candidate herself has said. Hillary laid down a marker on Wall Street with her Roosevelt Island speech last year. We thought at the time, She\u2019ll move away from this, and she did. But it was there for her to go back to. And I think that\u2019s been vindicated in the last 48 hours.\u201dWong and I walked out into the blinding late-spring sun, and she put on her mirrored aviators. The famously infirm Citigroup Center, which had been built on feeble stilts reinforced in secret under cover of night, was reflected in them. \u201cMy optimism wasn\u2019t dumb. It wasn\u2019t just based on the academic views on the trickle-down experiment. Yesterday\u2019s speech was a great indicator. She hit every marker. I could go through every policy in that speech and tell you which constituency it was written for.\u201d After running down into the subway, Wong \u2014 who can\u2019t write a one-paragraph email without somehow mentioning eight books and 27 people \u2014 promptly emailed me an entire roster of the Clinton intimates who favored real reform, including Heather Boushey of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth; Maya Harris, one of Clinton\u2019s senior policy advisers; and Gary Gensler, the campaign\u2019s chief financial officer.Not all of Wong\u2019s allies take as rosy an outlook as she does. David Rolf, president of S.E.I.U. 775 told me, \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic enough to think that we\u2019re out of those woods yet. The Democratic Party, its leaders and its infrastructure, is very much of two minds about economics. The progressives have gained a lot of ground, but to think that the trickle-down elements of the party are gone?\u201d At Roosevelt\u2019s board meeting a few weeks ago, the Center for Popular Democracy\u2019s Marbre Stahly-Butts, an architect of the Black Lives Matter policy platform, worried that the evolving platform of the Democratic convention seemed \u2014 on matters of mass incarceration and policing in particular \u2014 to be anemically centrist.To Wong, though, much of the hand-wringing about Clinton is beside the point. People like to kibitz on the subject of who a politician \u201creally\u201d is, to claim that some votes or statements or gaffes or alliances are deeply revealing and others merely accidents, frivolities or improvisatory performances. We isolate and label a politician\u2019s essence in the hope we might predict with certainty how she\u2019ll behave in the future. But in Wong\u2019s view, the question of who a politician is \u2014 and above all who this particular presidential candidate is \u2014 is irrelevant. Her strategy is to proceed in public as if the candidate is certain to rise to the occasion.A few days after the speech, Wong wrote me an email at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, her favorite time to think. \u201cFor the 40 years that she has been in the public eye,\u201d she wrote, \u201cHillary Clinton has been the subject of constant political analysis, armchair psychoanalysis, horrible rumor verging on slander \u2014 and also adoration, especially from a number of women around her age who want to see her not just as a role model but a heroine.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe good news for those of us arguing strenuously for the wisdom of structural economic and political reform: Whether Hillary \u2018really believes in the cause\u2019 or not does not matter. This surfeit of attention leaves out a bunch of other politically relevant factors beyond what is \u2018true\u2019 about Hillary internally.\u201d\u201cAfter all,\u201d Wong said to me more than once, \u201cshe is unknowable. Nobody can know her. I certainly can\u2019t know her. All I can go by is what is on the public record, and who she\u2019s got around her. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be disappointed again. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll all be disappointed again. But I\u2019m only optimistic because there\u2019s evidence for me to be that way.\u201dAn article on July 24 about the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in Manhattan, misidentified the union chapter of which David Rolf is president.

{"Headline": "Calls for Social Security Expansion Grow Louder in Washington", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byRetiringJANA PANARITES was about to make a midlife career shift in 2010 when her father died. At age 50, she had completed a master\u2019s degree in cultural diplomacy at the University of Southern California and was looking for a position in the nonprofit sector. That plan ground to a halt when she moved back to Maryland, where she grew up, to take care of her mother.\u201cLike a lot of caregivers, I had no idea what I was getting into,\u201d she said. \u201cI wound up spending so much time taking care of her, there was no time to take care of myself, let alone produce an income.\u201dMs. Panarites has no regrets about the three years she spent caring for her mother, who now lives in an assisted-living facility in Florida. On the contrary, she said, \u201cit\u2019s one of the most important things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201dBut the detour damaged not just her career prospects but her future retirement security as well. Her annual Social Security income \u2014 projected at $18,500 if she files for benefits when she reaches full retirement age in 2026 \u2014 will be at least 20 percent less than she could have expected had she not left the work force, according to a rough estimate from the Social Security Administration.A growing number of legislators and policy makers would like Ms. Panarites and other caregivers to receive some relief as part of a broader effort to expand and modernize Social Security benefits.Expansion was a popular theme of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign; now Hillary Clinton has moved into the expansion camp, saying she would support higher benefits for caregivers and widows and widowers.Advocates were also elated recently when President Obama endorsed improving benefits. That was a shift from his earlier support for limited cuts at a time when he was hoping, in vain, to reach a grand fiscal bargain with Republicans in Congress.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to weaken Social Security,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech on June 1. \u201cWe should be strengthening Social Security. And not only do we need to strengthen its long-term health, it\u2019s time we finally made Social Security more generous, and increased its benefits so that today\u2019s retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that they\u2019ve earned.\u201dThe changing political winds have emboldened those who say that fears that Social Security will go bankrupt are overblown.\u201cI\u2019m delighted people are arguing for expansion,\u201d says Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cI\u2019ve always been against cutbacks, so now I\u2019m in the center of the debate.\u201dMore than 20 expansion bills have been floated by lawmakers, with proposals ranging from targeted increases for vulnerable retirees to larger increases in benefits for all retirees. At the same time, many of those pushing for increased benefits support dealing with Social Security\u2019s long-range imbalance by making cuts elsewhere and raising revenue to pay for both expansion and by closing the financing gap.The combined trust funds for Social Security\u2019s retirement and disability benefits are projected to be depleted in 2034, according to the annual report of the program\u2019s trustees. At that point, Social Security itself would have sufficient revenue from current taxes to pay only 79 percent of promised benefits.That problem could be avoided if Congress agreed to raise additional revenue, impose benefit cuts or do some combination of the two.Some targeted expansion recommendations come from centrist camps. For example, a recently issued report on retirement security by the Bipartisan Policy Center called for adjusting Social Security\u2019s progressive benefit structure to deliver higher amounts to lower-income retirees. The changes would increase benefits by $176 a month to the median recipient who files at full retirement age \u2014 an increase of 10 percent on a $1,700 benefit.The policy center called for lifting Social Security\u2019s minimum benefit for very-low-income seniors, and enhancing the program\u2019s survivor benefit. Currently, widows and widowers receive either their own benefit or 100 percent of a deceased spouse\u2019s benefit, whichever is higher; under the B.P.C.\u2019s proposal, survivors would receive their own benefit plus 75 percent of their deceased spouse\u2019s benefit.At the same time, the center recommended two across-the-board benefit cuts: gradually raising the normal retirement age and adopting a less generous annual cost-of-living adjustment.\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to show solutions that can emerge when you put people with very different ideological perspectives in a room and let them negotiate for two years,\u201d said Shai Akabas, director of fiscal policy at the center.As for caregivers like Ms. Panarites, some proposals would help bolster their retirement income by giving them extra credit for years devoted to taking care of a parent or child in need. Social Security benefits are determined by a formula based on the average of a worker\u2019s highest 35 years of lifetime earnings.Ms. Panarites\u2019s earnings peaked at $75,000 in 2006, before she left a job as a paralegal to pursue her master\u2019s degree. Her income has been negligible since 2008, although she has since started a career as an author and podcaster focused on the issues facing caregivers.\u201cYour 50s are supposed to be your peak earning years,\u201d said Ms. Panarites, now 56.Her lost lifetime Social Security benefit could easily top $125,000 if she lives to roughly 89, the expected longevity for a woman who reaches age 65.\u201cWhen people decide to leave the work force to do caregiving, they usually think, \u2018It will be just a couple years, and I can get by,\u2019 but they don\u2019t think of the implications 20 years later when they want to retire,\u201d said Gail Gibson Hunt, president of the National Alliance for Caregiving.Meanwhile, progressives who started the expansion movement are thinking bigger.\u201cThe real question is whether you expand Social Security across the board, so middle-class workers get an increase, or you don\u2019t,\u201d said Nancy Altman, co-director of Social Security Works, an advocacy group. \u201cThen, you can argue about how big to make the increase.\u201dExpansion would mitigate the erosion of benefits put in motion by the last major Social Security overhaul, enacted in 1983, which gradually raises the full retirement age from 65 to 67, effectively reducing, by 25 percent, the amount of preretirement income replaced by benefits.How would the government pay for Social Security expansion, while also helping close its solvency gap?The main vehicle would be through changes in the payroll tax on salaries and wages, which now collects 12.4 percent \u2014 equally split between employers and employees \u2014 up to a cap, currently set at $118,500.An option would be to raise the tax rate gradually. The Bipartisan Policy Center recommends raising the payroll tax another 1 percentage point, spread over 10 years.Others favor permitting Social Security to invest a portion of the trust fund in equities. By law, trust fund reserves must be invested in special-issue Treasury bonds that pay very low rates of interest. Some proposals call for allowing investment of 40 percent of reserves in higher-return equities, which could close about one-fifth of the long-term shortfall, according to Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration.The revenue solutions ultimately will depend on the breadth \u2014 and cost \u2014 of any expansion.\u201cMost of the expansion proposals have been modest,\u201d Mr. Goss said. \u201cPeople understand we have a shortfall to deal with, and across-the-board bumps get expensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As ISIS Loses Land, It Gains Ground in Overseas Terror", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In just the past few days, the Islamic State\u2019s evolving brand of terrorism has revealed its deadly, shifting faces.In Istanbul last week, Turkish officials say, militants guided by the Islamic State conducted a coordinated suicide attack on the city\u2019s main airport. In Bangladesh on Friday, a local extremist group that has pledged loyalty to the Islamic State butchered diners in a restaurant. And in Baghdad on Sunday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed more than 140 people.The three deadly attacks are already being viewed by intelligence and law enforcement officials as proof that the Islamic State, the only terrorist group to create a state with borders, is becoming a larger, more sophisticated version of its stateless chief rival, Al Qaeda, as it loses territory under traditional military attack in Iraq and Syria.Militant volunteers that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, began recruiting, training and sending to the West more than two years ago are now part of mature, clandestine networks, counterterrorism official say. The networks are increasingly responding to calls to accelerate attacks globally as the group suffers setbacks at home, like retreating from Falluja last month after an offensive by Iraqi forces supported by United States airstrikes and advisers.\u201cAttacks won\u2019t fill any particular mold \u2014 some will be centrally planned, some will have some connection to ISIS, and some will be local option entirely,\u201d said Andrew M. Liepman, a former deputy director at the National Counterterrorism Center who is now a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corporation.Combating this evolving, more complex array of threats \u2014 attacks loosely inspired by the Islamic State, attacks it directs from afar and those, as in Baghdad, that it carries out itself \u2014 demands more than just military strikes in Iraq and Syria, American officials acknowledge. Deterring, preventing and dealing with an expanding array of threats against far-flung and chiefly civilian targets is a growing priority for Western and other allied law enforcement and intelligence services.\u201cThe emphasis is changing on this global terrorism campaign, and that introduces new vulnerabilities,\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201dA visual tour of the 126 places that defined the group\u2019s territory.In recent interviews, John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has been unusually blunt about the slow nature of progress in the fight against the Islamic State outside Syria and Iraq, voicing fears that allied policy is not keeping up with an adaptive enemy.\u201cWe still have a ways to go before we\u2019re able to say that we have made some significant progress against them,\u201d Mr. Brennan told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations here last week.He warned that the trajectories for the ISIS religious state, or caliphate, and global violence point in opposite directions. \u201cAs the pressure mounts on ISIL,\u201d he said, \u201cwe judge that it will intensify its global terror campaign to maintain its dominance of the global terrorism agenda.\u201dIn an audio message released May 21, the Islamic State spokesman Abu Muhammed al-Adnani made clear that the organization would revert to its roots as a guerrilla insurgency, implicitly acknowledging that it would eventually lose its strongholds in Syria and Iraq and the very caliphate that has distinguished it from Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Mr. Adnani, who also oversees the Islamic State\u2019s external operations, repeated his call for supporters to attack the group\u2019s enemies wherever and however possible.The Islamic State operates clandestine terrorist cells in Britain, Germany and Italy, similar to the groups that carried out the attacks in Paris and Brussels, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said in April. Other intelligence officials said the Islamic State operated similar cells in Turkey, which were most likely involved in last week\u2019s assault on the airport in Istanbul.Some counterterrorism officials say the Islamic State\u2019s lashing out may backfire. \u201cISIS wants to deter and divide its enemies with these attacks, but it usually ends up provoking them,\u201d said Will McCants, a former State Department counterterrorism official now at the Brookings Institution. He said he anticipated that the attack in Istanbul would push Turkey to escalate its efforts against the Islamic State, just as the Paris attacks did for France.Against this shifting adversary, President Obama has sought to strike an upbeat message. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that this continues to be a difficult fight, but we are making significant progress,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement on June 14 after meeting with top national security advisers about combating the Islamic State. \u201cThis campaign at this stage is firing on all cylinders.\u201dNearly two years into the American-led air war against the Islamic State, military officials say they have finally corrected the poor intelligence collection and clumsy process for identifying targets that initially plagued the campaign, and are now hitting targets like oil rigs and secret cash coffers that finance the terrorist group\u2019s war machine.The American-led military campaign has slashed the group\u2019s oil revenue in half, but it still generates $150 million a year. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d said Col. Christopher Garver, a United States military spokesman in Iraq. \u201cYou can fund a lot of things across the globe.\u201dMore than 1,200 people outside of Iraq and Syria have been killed in attacks inspired or coordinated by the Islamic State.As a result, the Islamic State has slashed fighters\u2019 salaries in Raqqa, the group\u2019s de facto headquarters in Syria, by up to 50 percent, American intelligence analysts say.In testimony before a Senate committee on Tuesday, Brett McGurk, Mr. Obama\u2019s special envoy in the fight against the Islamic State, said the group had lost 47 percent of its territory in Iraq and 20 percent in Syria \u2014 territory used to extract oil from the ground and taxes from its residents, as well as to plot attacks against the West.\u201cThe attraction of the Islamic State was the state,\u201d Mr. Liepman of the RAND Corporation said. \u201cThe ideology lured people in, but the destination was more important: an idyllic Sunni land. When that goes away, I think much of the attraction of I.S. will go with it.\u201dMr. Liepman warned, however, that even if the caliphate failed, hundreds if not thousands of battle-hardened soldiers would return home to continue the fight. \u201cThis will be the challenge for a generation, in Jordan and Tunisia, in France and the U.S.: how to deal with the combination of a back flow of fighters and radicalized citizens as well,\u201d he said.Tighter border controls have curbed the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq, but the Islamic State has diverted hundreds of others to its foreign enclaves, like Libya.The Islamic State\u2019s ranks in Iraq and Syria have fallen to between 18,000 and 22,000, from a peak of about 33,000 combatants last year, American officials say. But another 20,000 or so militants rally under the Islamic State banner in at least eight affiliates, including in Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. By comparison, Al Qaeda at its peak had a couple of thousand fighters, Mr. Brennan said.United States officials say they are ill equipped to thwart technologically savvy young Islamic State terrorists who use encrypted communications that Western experts find difficult to hack.Even more worrisome, the propaganda and recruitment wars face steep hurdles. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a speech last week, shared a recent exchange with an African counterpart, who told him that violent extremists in the minister\u2019s region were recruiting and proselytizing children as young as 5 years old.\u201cYou know, they have a plan for 30 years or 35 years,\u201d Mr. Kerry said his foreign counterpart had told him. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a five-year plan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Ireland, they are celebrating them.Under a typical inversion deal, a United States company takes over a foreign counterpart and, in the process, shifts its headquarters overseas. The takeover targets for such deals are typically based in countries with low corporate taxes \u2014 like Ireland, with its 12.5 percent rate.The combined company\u2019s global profits are then reported in its new home base, regardless of where they are earned. In essence, Ireland\u2019s G.D.P. is artificially inflated.Inversions have drawn the ire of the Obama administration, since they put a greater burden on American taxpayers.Inversions like that were one of the main drivers for the sharp rise in G.D.P., according to Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office. The country\u2019s economy was also bolstered by the import of new aircraft for international leasing activities, another financial gimmick.Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, went to great lengths to explain that the recovery is real \u2014 and not the result of some financial good fortune.

Before I started training for the race on New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eve, I wondered how much this, my sixth marathon, would cost me. And not just the race fee \u2014 I knew that one, since I had signed up for the race in November \u2014 but the total of every little thing that I would spend money on to get me from my first training run to race day.After a deep dive into my personal finances and a talk with a professor of finance, I can tell you that it cost me a lot. Eighteen weeks of training and one marathon cost me more than $1,600. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I arrived at my number.How much did you spend training for a recent marathon? Tell us in the comments. For the 2016 New Jersey Marathon, the base cost at the time I signed up was $100, but I did so on Black Friday, and used a coupon code to save $20, plus a $6.40 service fee. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting from scratch, this number could be much higher, depending on how geared out you get. I already had a tube of Body Glide anti-chafing lotion. I already had a GPS watch. I already owned the shorts, hat and socks I wore on race day. So my gear costs are much lower than that of someone who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just starting out.

{"Headline": "The Silicon Valley of Space Start-Ups? It Could Be Seattle", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Inside an office in this city\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, engineers in lab coats fuss over a contraption unlike the usual creations flowing from Amazon, Facebook and other technology companies with offices nearby.There\u2019s more activity than ever in the commercial space race, with a new wave of entrepreneurs attempting to do everything from lowering the cost of putting something into space, with reusable rockets, to mining asteroids. With their mix of universities, government space facilities, technology talent and financial risk takers, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities have become especially fertile grounds for space start-ups.No single spot can claim to be the Silicon Valley of such companies yet, but Seattle is on the short list of contenders, investors and entrepreneurs say. The area is home to two tech billionaires \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft \u2014 who are funding ambitious, varied efforts to make space more accessible. They have been joined by a few smaller companies like Spaceflight, attracted by Seattle\u2019s abundant supply of software engineers from stalwarts like Amazon and Microsoft and aerospace experts from Boeing, the aviation giant that has major operations in the area.\u201cThe reason for it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Musk, also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, told an audience in Seattle last year at a recruiting event. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of talent in the Seattle area, and a lot of you guys don\u2019t seem to want to move to L.A.\u201d\u201cAbandoned in Place,\u201d a new book of photographs by Roland Miller, finds haunting beauty in derelict launch pads, rusting towers and other detritus of the American space race.One reason that Seattle is attractive is that space companies are no longer looking primarily for aerospace engineers.The company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Lewicki, said it planned to attach a probe to asteroids and use inflatable solar reflectors to concentrate the sun\u2019s energy on the surface of the asteroid, allowing Planetary Resources to capture water as it is baked out.The Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter. Here are some other spacecraft exploring our solar system, launched by NASA and the world\u2019s other space agencies.But Planetary Resources, which has attracted investments from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, top executives at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, first plans to use infrared and hyperspectral imaging sensors to analyze asteroids for the most promising targets, essentially a big data problem. The company will begin testing the sensors later this year when it plans to launch a new spacecraft, Arkyd 6, to scan the earth for natural resources.Money is flowing into the new space industry, though at a significantly slower rate than it is into more traditional technology companies. Since 2000, the investment in space start-ups has totaled $13.3 billion, including a record $2.7 billion last year, the Tauri Group, a research firm, estimated.How much of that found its way to Seattle is difficult to say, partly because Mr. Allen and Mr. Bezos, who are believed to be spending heavily, won\u2019t say how much they\u2019ve invested.\u201cMany of the current new space companies are not going to be around in 10 to 20 years,\u201d said Fred Wilson, Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s director of marketing and business development.Seattle has seen its space ambitions lose momentum before.Now, one of the big tenants is Amazon, which has a couple of warehouses there.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in which Boeing is based. It is Chicago, not Seattle. (Though the company moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle in 2001, about half of its workforce is still in Seattle.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "L Train Will Shut Down From Manhattan to Brooklyn in \u201919 for 18 Months", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe plan promises to upend the commutes of tens of thousands of people along a popular line that has become synonymous with the hipster culture of the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods. The reaction was swift, with regular L riders expressing despair.\u201cInstead of three stops, I\u2019ll have to take three trains,\u201d Marley Cavalcanti, 30, of Greenpoint, said as she waited on a platform in the Bedford Avenue station on her way into Manhattan on Monday.\u201cThis is the, \u2018Get in, get done, get out\u2019 option,\u201d said Veronique Hakim, president of New York City Transit, the authority\u2019s division that runs the city\u2019s subways and buses.In New York City, the L line currently handles about 400,000 passenger trips each weekday, with about 225,000 of those riders taking the line under the East River each day and the others traveling within Manhattan or Brooklyn.During the repairs, the trains will continue to operate in Brooklyn between the Williamsburg and Canarsie neighborhoods, but will not run west of the Bedford Avenue station in Brooklyn. All five L train stops in Manhattan will close, along with the tunnel.On Monday morning, New York City\u2019s first deputy mayor, Anthony Shorris, said the city was concerned that the state-run authority had not yet provided details on alternative service plans for L train riders.\u201cWhile we recognize the need for the M.T.A. to perform these important repairs and upgrades, we are deeply concerned that it would announce an 18-month shutdown of this critical service without a clear plan or a commitment of resources for mitigating the impact of this closure on hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers,\u201d Mr. Shorris said in a statement.The authority is considering several travel options, including extra subway service on nearby lines and new bus or ferry service. Cars are likely to be added to trains on the G line, which is known for having short trains that riders must sometimes scramble across the platform to board.Ms. Hakim brushed off the city\u2019s criticism, saying the authority had plenty of time to pull together a plan. \u201cWe have time to do this thoroughly and get it right,\u201d she said, noting that the authority would also examine an idea to create a dedicated bus lane on the Williamsburg Bridge.Asked about the closing, Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed Mr. Shorris\u2019s concerns, saying he would press the authority to make sure that riders have \u201cgood and consistent alternatives.\u201d A spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, John Kelly, said in a statement that service plans should be based on advice from local elected officials and riders.No matter what contingency plans are created, it is clear that travel will become more difficult and consume more time when the tunnel closes.Some fear the closing will push renters to leave the neighborhood, and local restaurants and bars will lose business. Blake Orlandi, 33, who works in e-commerce in Manhattan, said the decision might motivate him to move.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said of the 2019 starting date, adding that he might switch to Uber, the car service, if there were no L train.\u201cThis is just the cherry on top of the announcement,\u201d Mr. Orlandi, surrounded by the sweaty crowds, said.The L train tunnel, officially known as the Canarsie tube, was one of several subway tunnels swamped by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Authority officials have said that the tunnel is safe, but that it requires major work to fix crumbling walls and to repair tracks and cables. The tunnel repairs and improvements to stations on the line are expected to cost more than $800 million, with the federal government expected to finance a large portion of it, officials said.This year, Thomas F. Prendergast, the authority\u2019s chairman, told reporters that Hurricane Sandy had been the worst storm to hit the system. The L train repairs, he said, were \u201cby far, the most impactful capital construction project we have had to ever do on the system.\u201dCarlo A. Scissura, the president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, said that he supported the authority\u2019s decision, but that it would be a \u201cvery, very tough 18 months\u201d for riders and businesses who rely on the line \u2014 which, he noted, did not include just Williamsburg. The authority should provide round-the-clock bus service, even on weekend nights, he said.\u201cThis is going to take some creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can figure it out together.\u201dMegan Jula contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie\u2019s Movement Moves On", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign is officially over, yet his supporters have not fully accepted defeat.Throughout the week, a vocal faction of the Sanders delegation successfully drew attention to itself at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 protesting outside the Wells Fargo Center, booing prime-time speakers inside the arena and at one point staging a walkout.But beyond the political theatrics, people who devoted their time and energy to the Sanders campaign say they\u2019re just getting started. As Mr. Sanders has said many times over the past month, \u201cthe movement continues.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Sanders ran more than a good campaign, he ran one that upended almost all of the political establishment\u2019s expectations. Over the past year and over the past week, Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters have brought long-submerged elements of progressive politics to the forefront of political conversations. They may not be happy, exactly, with what happened in Philadelphia this week. But they are not just going to boo, or wear neon T-shirts. They are committed to carrying that banner for progressive change.Later that evening, after the oppressive heat segued into a thunderstorm, I met up with Molly Grover and a friend at the Las Vegas Lounge in downtown Philadelphia. Ms. Grover is a leader in the group Women for Bernie, and had taken the bus down to Philadelphia from Ithaca, N.Y., for the week. We were all drenched from the downpour outside, and seemed to be the only ones even vaguely interested in watching the Democratic convention\u2019s proceedings taking place five miles away. We ordered beer and grilled cheese, and settled into a booth to watch the speeches.On TV in the Las Vegas Lounge, Senator Al Franken and Sarah Silverman \u2014 a comedian who supported Mr. Sanders in the primary \u2014 came onstage in another attempt to show party unity. Mr. Sanders\u2019s vocal delegates in the audience booed. \u201cTo the Bernie or Bust people, you\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d Ms. Silverman told them.\u201cWow,\u201d Ms. Grover said. \u201cSarah sold right out there, huh?\u201d\u201cThat was pretty awkward,\u201d her friend said. \u201cYou have to affirm the movement!\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Grover invited me to a women\u2019s speak-out event at a church downtown that was organized by the social justice group Global Women\u2019s Strike. Inside the church meeting room, miniature windmills and origami birds hung from the vaulted ceilings, the stained glass casting a sepia light over the room. At the front of the room, a rotating set of speakers sat at a folding table to air their concerns on military intervention, water pollution in Flint, Mich., police brutality, indigenous rights. To the side, two young women noted agenda items on large pads of paper in marker on an easel.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.The event\u2019s attendees skewed older and much more local than the protest on Monday did. Here were people invested in the unglamorous work of coalition building \u2014 activists on the left who had been around before Mr. Sanders announced his presidential campaign, and who will stay involved long after November.The event received the fraction of the attention of the protests, but was more indicative of where Mr. Sanders\u2019s movement intends to go from here: not in the streets, demanding action from others with witty signs, but in stuffy church annexes and meeting rooms across the country, doing that action themselves.The event did attract some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters from out of town, though much fewer than the protests did. Yamina Roland, a Sanders delegate from Fresno, Calif., said she was disgusted with the first night of the convention, and exhausted after a long primary.\u201cThis has been over a year of my life that I subjected my 6-year-old to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is a revolution, and we\u2019re not going to just let that go.\u201dAnd so she was here, learning more about how to stay involved after the convention ended. A young woman with a translator went up to the table at the front of the room to speak about environmental activism in Honduras. She was Laura Zuniga C\u00e1ceres, the daughter of Berta C\u00e1ceres, an environmental and indigenous rights activist in Honduras who had been shot in March.\u201cThat\u2019s Berta\u2019s daughter?\u201d Ms. Roland gasped. Her eyes welled up with tears.Also at the women\u2019s organizing meeting on Tuesday was Louise Hanible, a longtime activist with the group Philadelphia Citizens in Action. You could tell she\u2019d been to countless organizing meetings like this one before, in other poorly air-conditioned rooms, doing the unglamorous work of coalition building that often falls to women of the movement. She told me that people inspired to action by Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy have to \u201cget on the bus,\u201d and stay on it.\u201cA lot of people vote people in, have a group and then they disband,\u201d Ms. Hanible told me. \u201cDon\u2019t come up with an excuse that you can\u2019t get on the bus. Get on the bus! I\u2019m 76 years old, and I will continue to get on the bus until the day God calls me home.\u201dShe later added that she thinks Mrs. Clinton would do a good job as president, but activists should continue to \u201chold her feet to the fire.\u201dMs. Grover took the bus back to Ithaca on Wednesday, disappointed but unbroken. She said that while she was \u201cangered and ashamed\u201d by the D.N.C. email leak, she was \u201cextremely proud of the grass-roots energy that we were able to whip up.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt that we strongly influenced the Democratic platform; Bernie\u2019s policy ideas are all over that document,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cBernie helped people in this country awaken to the sources of their pain, and we are not going back to the apathy and immobility that we felt in years past.\u201d\u201cEveryone is aware of the immensity of the work that is ahead, but we welcome the challenge with eagerness and passion,\u201d she added.That challenge will remain in the coming weeks, months, and years. It\u2019s up to Mr. Sanders\u2019s newly activated supporters to decide if they\u2019ll stay on the bus after the cameras are gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outdoor Art Across the City: 4 Things New Under the Sun", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewThere are at least two good things about the seasonal efflorescence of outdoor art in this city. One is that those who go looking for it may find their ways to places they\u2019ve not been before. The other is that seekers \u2014 as well as casual passers-by \u2014 get to see art outside the hygienic shelters of museums and galleries, set loose in the world, where the relationship between the object and its site may catalyze the stretching of minds. Four notable works currently on view here and there in New York do just that.\u201cCabin\u201d resembles a backyard tool shed or a mountain way station, except that it\u2019s made entirely of pale gray concrete and can\u2019t be entered. In fact, it\u2019s a cast of the inside of the original structure. What you see on its exterior is actually a reproduction of its interior walls and ceiling. Up close, you see a fossilized patchwork of corrugated metal, wood clapboards and other types of siding punctuated by blind, mullion-gridded windows.Park visitors here for the spectacular views of New York Harbor and the Manhattan skyline may wonder why this mute, opaque, tomblike work of art is here. \u201cCabin\u201d bears no readily discernible relationship to the island\u2019s geography or its history as the former site of a United States Army installation. Around the sculpture\u2019s base are cast-bronze assemblages of detritus recovered from around the island, apparently the only direct connection to the place.Approaching \u201cConcave Room for Bees\u201d from the park\u2019s main gate, you see a five-foot-tall, curving, Minimalist wall of dirt held in place by heavy wire mesh. Around the other side, at a point facing the river, an opening allows visitors to enter and discover a nearly 360-degree flower garden growing from concavely sloped ground and forming a wok-like bowl 70 feet in diameter. Here in this blossoming arena, you find yourself in a sacred space of geometric and botanical order, a place to meditate on the wedding of nature and culture and the place of humanity in the universe.The sculpture calls to mind the Trojan horse by which the ancient Greeks tricked their foes. This invokes a popular theory of avant-gardism, that of troublemaking art that conceals subversive purposes under cover of appealing aesthetics. The main clue to Mr. Puryear\u2019s intentions is in the gold shackle and the titular word \u201cbling,\u201d which refers to the sort of ostentatious jewelry favored by hip-hop artists of past decades. Bling subsequently came to refer to anything of flashy, exorbitantly pricey excess like yachts and multimillion-dollar artworks.Inserted into the middle of a city whose dominant industry is high finance, \u201cBig Bling\u201d may be seen as a messianic admonition to those who worship money. Value wealth above all, and it will shackle you to a blinkered existence of soul-eroding avarice, making you a slave of the capitalist machine. What\u2019s the alternative? Mr. Puryear\u2019s sculpture offers no explicit prescription, but in this presidential election year, it stands as a valuable monument to something greater than lucre, a call to liberate life from its chains of gold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Nonprofits, Former Koch Brothers\u2019 Associates, Fined by F.E.C.", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byMillions of dollars worth of those contributions were provided by an Arizona-based organization that, at the time, was a central hub of financing in the Koch network of donors and political groups. The Koch network has since cut ties with the groups, replacing them with political organizations more closely controlled by its own operatives.The F.E.C.\u2019s investigation provides a look \u2014 although a partial and dated one \u2014 into the interlocking networks of political non-profits on the right, through which vast sums of money flow each election cycle with little disclosure. Such groups are not required to disclose their donors and typically trade large tranches of cash during each election cycle, intentionally making it difficult for even tax or election authorities to judge which donor from which dollar is used for any particular activity.A spokesman for Freedom Partners, the group that now serves as the nerve center for the network, said that Koch organizations had not been involved with nor directed the particular spending at issue in the F.E.C.\u2019s investigation.\u201cThese complaints have nothing to do with our organization,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners.The F.E.C. found that Sean Noble, a political consultant then working with the Kochs, had closely directed the spending of the grants by the other organizations, even picking the races where ads were to be run. That violated federal rules requiring organizations to identity the source of any money earmarked for a political expenditure, the commission determined. The groups consented to pay a total of more than $200,000 in fines to settle the investigation, but without conceding they had violated the laws.\u201cThese rules provide some of the only windows into the funding of dark money groups, but the F.E.C. almost never penalizes groups that break them,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt is hard to overstate how significant this is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buy It With Cash, Mortgage It Later", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byAnthony Corbisiero wanted a quick sale on his studio pied-\u00e0-terre in West Chelsea, as he planned to use a portion of the proceeds for his daughter\u2019s looming college expenses.So he and his wife, Julie, who live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, were thrilled when three bids emerged within a week. Two were all cash. \u201cThe other buyer preferred to do it with financing,\u201d said Mr. Corbisiero, an independent stock trader. \u201cBut why should I wait for them to get a mortgage?\u201dIn any competitive market, all-cash offers typically win out. In neighborhoods and at price points where inventory is tight and bidding wars almost a certainty, the financing-free strategy at the bargaining table has become more commonplace \u2014 and more or less imperative, some real estate brokers say. A key advantage is that these deals are done more quickly than financed transactions, which appeals to sellers like the Corbisieros. There is no lender red tape to slow down the process, like appraisal requirements and concerns about whether those appraisals will come in high enough and whether buyers can borrow as much as they need.One solution for the reluctant cash buyer is to delay financing: Buy using all cash, but borrow soon after. Delayed financing can help buyers stay competitive in hot housing markets, and even negotiate a better deal, without tying up their assets for too long.In order to participate in the Fannie Mae program, borrowers must show, among other things, that there are no liens against the home and must document the sources of the cash for the purchase. They must also prove that the sale was at \u201carm\u2019s length,\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t buy the property from a relative or close business associate. Borrowers, however, are limited in how much they can cash out, depending on whether the property is a primary or second home. A maximum of 70 percent of its appraised value is allowed, according to Fannie Mae, up to local conforming loan standards \u2014 in Manhattan, that means a $625,500 loan amount on a single-family home.For larger purchases, in which the maximum-percent cash out would exceed the amount in the conforming loan standards \u2014 often the case in pricier markets like New York City \u2014 cash buyers can opt for delayed financing through non-agency \u201cjumbo\u201d loans that are not subject to borrowing limits and the strict conventional rules.The percentage of Manhattan homes bought with cash in the first half of 2016.\u201cSomeone puts in an all-cash offer and takes their liquid assets to buy the property for all cash, and then gets preapproval for a loan,\u201d said Bradley Wayman, the mortgage sales director at Citibank in Manhattan. \u201cIn many cases, they\u2019ll have a loan in process and close with all cash.\u201dMr. Milner said that these types of delayed financing transactions account for around 2 percent of his business, while Mr. Wayman said, \u201cOn average, our top loan lenders do one deal per month.\u201d And most of those deals, he said, involve homes priced below $4 million.Unlike the situation at the very high end of the market, \u201cwhen you go down the ladder, it becomes more competitive in terms of offerings \u2014 there are a lot less of them,\u201d said Michael Graves, a broker at Douglas Elliman, referring to homes for sale. For that reason, he advises the sellers he represents not to accept offers contingent on the buyer obtaining a mortgage. \u201cIn the last six years, there has been only one deal where we accepted a finance contingency. It\u2019s not up to us where the cash comes from, but it must be cash.\u201dHe continued: \u201cSome are borrowing from their 401(k)\u2019s; others are liquidating investments. Some are asking family members to help close. Many of them are selling another property. I\u2019ve seen pretty much everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy: You walk in and see the place for 10 minutes, and then you have to make a decision on it,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cBut after looking at so many properties for a year, you just know.\u201dHe added that \u201cthe only way to go was all cash at the asking price.\u201dMr. McDonald came up with the $3 million for the purchase after liquidating several investments, then three months later, took out a $1.95 million jumbo loan \u2014 a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 2.5 percent with Wells Fargo, he said \u2014 that enabled him to replenish much of his investment portfolio.His agent, Crystal Zahedi of Douglas Elliman, who also represented Mr. Corbisiero, said, \u201cWhen you get a well-priced apartment in this market, you do have to use that strategy \u2014 or, at the very least, have a deal not contingent on financing. That\u2019s the first step.\u201dWhile it\u2019s fairly common for buyers to forego a financing contingency these days, the all-cash, delayed-financing strategy has been slow to catch on, partly because many home buyers simply aren\u2019t aware of the option. (And in some co-op buildings, it also may not be feasible, because residents are required to have a certain amount of liquidity available after a purchase.)\u201cThis turned out to be a good move,\u201d Ms. Thomas-Senior said, \u201cbecause the property has since appreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Verizon and Yahoo: Internet Also-Rans With Big Hopes", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsVerizon is continuing to invest in ancient web history. The telecom company on Monday said it was paying $4.8 billion to buy Yahoo\u2019s core business. It effectively justifies rival T-Mobile\u2019s tongue-in-cheek claim earlier this year that Verizon is having a midlife crisis. The Verizon boss, Lowell McAdam, after all, is betting the deal will help attract digital advertisers by meshing the internet-search firm with AOL, another 1990s highflier that Verizon bought last year.It is an appealing idea. Yahoo brings with it not just its search and advertising units, but also content like sports and finance that could play well with AOL\u2019s assets like The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. Verizon will also get its hands on Yahoo\u2019s 600 million monthly mobile users.Yahoo shareholders, though, have an exceptionally gloomy view of the business. It does not help that the division\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, is likely to be just $770 million this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from $2 billion a decade ago. But investors do not even reckon the units being sold are worth anything. The overall company has around $5 billion in net cash and owns stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan that are worth some $41 billion, yet Yahoo\u2019s market value is just $37 billion.Mr. McAdam\u2019s vision ought to resonate on Madison Avenue. Advertising executives are nervous about the twin powers of Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which are expected to account for more than half of the American digital advertising revenue this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.They have shown little inclination to send more business to either of Verizon\u2019s dot-com 1.0 duo. Yahoo and AOL\u2019s collective slice of the $69 billion digital-ad market is expected to be 5.2 percent this year, eMarketer forecasts, and is likely to decrease to 4.8 percent in 2017.That has allowed Google and Facebook to gobble up most of the digital-advertising market. It may be that Tim Armstrong, who will run the combined AOL-Yahoo business, has a great plan to turn these two internet also-rans into a formidable force.

{"Headline": "SoftBank\u2019s ARM Deal May Signal Life After \u2018Brexit.\u2019 Or Not.", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byWhen Britain voted last month to leave the European Union, many deal makers predicted that future acquisitions there were all but dead.\u201cJust three weeks after the referendum decision, it shows that Britain has lost none of its allure to international investors,\u201d the British finance minister, Philip Hammond, said in a statement.But after digesting the politics, the question becomes: Does the acquisition of the semiconductor company ARM by the Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank pave the way for more British deals? Or is ARM an anomaly among British takeover targets?By and large, ARM is a special case for several reasons:\u25a0 Even if Brexit causes an economic slowdown in Britain, ARM would be relatively immune. ARM, which licenses chip designs to semiconductor companies all over the world, generates a mere 1 percent of its revenue from Britain, with only 9 percent from the rest of Europe. ARM derives a majority of its revenue from Asia, followed by North America.\u25a0 After Britain\u2019s vote to withdraw from the E.U., the pound plummeted relative to most currencies around the world, making imports into Britain more expensive. However, ARM does not require much in the way of raw materials to do business. Rather than manufacture the chips itself, ARM\u2019s engineers design the chips or parts of the chips and then sell that intellectual property to semiconductor companies. Much of ARM\u2019s cost basis comes in the form of engineers\u2019 salaries (its employees are spread out across Britain, Europe, North America and Asia).\u25a0 ARM\u2019s stock price gained as a result of Brexit because investors saw it as a safe haven in the region, given the company\u2019s global exposure. Because ARM was trading at its highest level this year before the deal was announced, its executives were more apt to sell, especially at the 43 percent premium SoftBank was offering.\u25a0 From a regulatory standpoint, the deal should not raise too many eyebrows. From an antitrust perspective, there is very little overlap between ARM and the businesses SoftBank owns. Additionally, Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, spoke with Mr. Hammond and Teresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, about the deal on Sunday before it was officially announced.\u25a0 The deal includes no visible cost-cutting, and SoftBank even pledged to increase the number of jobs in Britain. \u201cThe independence aspect of the deal is very important,\u201d said Simon Segars, ARM\u2019s chief executive.Mark Scott contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Selling a Business Involves More Than Money", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersTHE first time Chris Ludwig sold his refrigerant reprocessing company, he said he acted as if the deal was done long before it was. He beefed up inventory, added sales staff and generally increased his expenses.But as the buyers delayed, \u201cI got myself in a bad position,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s hurry up and close.\u2019 I didn\u2019t get near as good a deal as I should have.\u201dMatt Matich, who ran a trucking distribution company, said he realized during the sale of his business that he and his partner should have consulted a business adviser earlier because they could have expanded the company themselves and sold it for a lot more than they ultimately received.\u201cWe thought of the business as having three legs: you sell, you recruit, you operate,\u201d Mr. Matich said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t looked at the fourth leg, which was finance. Had we had the fourth leg, we would have gone a different route.\u201dThe mistakes people make in selling their businesses stay with them long after the check has cleared and their new life has begun. They may have a considerable financial cushion, but because their wealth came from building something from nothing, they had a deep attachment to the company. It was their livelihood and their path to wealth, but it was also a part of who they were. Not managing the sale as best they could continues to gnaw at some of them.For small-business owners seeking to sell in what remains a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions, the lessons learned by those who have gone before them can be instructive.\u201cSelling a business is not all about the financial side of it,\u201d said Terry Mackin, managing director of mergers and acquisitions at Generational Equity, a business brokerage. \u201cMost are focused on the dollars, initially. They want us to tell them how much their business is worth. But they find there\u2019s an emotional part to this. Eighty percent of the deals I\u2019ve done have not sold for the best dollar offer.\u201dJay Messing, senior director of planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank in the Northeast, said he often advised people looking to sell their businesses to become more formal with everything from books and records to how family members are treated in the business.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t as introspective as they could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not running the business as tightly as they could be because they\u2019re running it for themselves.\u201dThe first piece of advice is to start running the business as if a buyer will come along at any moment. \u201cWhether it\u2019s now, five years or 10 years down the road, if you\u2019re not ready and that buyer comes, you may not get that price that you want,\u201d said Karen Reynolds Sharkey, national business owner strategy executive at U.S. Trust.Dave Turbenson said he kept his company lean. In the years around the recession, his business, a leader in selling supplies for making beer and wine at home, grew at 30 percent a year for four years straight and was doing $15 million in revenue. But he said he was under constant pressure to manage his 70 employees and keep pace with internet orders coming in.In 2010, when Mr. Turbenson had his business valued, the business broker put its worth above what he had imagined. By the end of the year, he had sold the business and walked away three months after the deal closed.\u201cIt was striking while the iron was hot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it turns out, the whole industry had about 24 months left of sheer natural growth.\u201dAnother piece of advice is not to run the business as if the deal is done before it is. Mr. Ludwig learned his lesson. He and his partner bought back the company in the late 1990s and ran it until four years ago when they sold it a second time.When an offer came from a division of Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese conglomerate, Mr. Ludwig said the due diligence process was incredibly slow, but he kept running the business as if there were no buyer. When a tsunami hit Japan in 2011, Sumitomo withdrew its letter of intent.But eight months later, the deal was back on and the value of the company had increased.\u201cMentally, an owner has to understand that getting to that letter of intent and signing an agreement is Phase 1,\u201d Ms. Sharkey of U.S. Trust said. \u201cThe big part is going through the due diligence. It could take another six to 12 months after signing the letter of intent.\u201dPart of running a business to be sold is regularly reviewing how it is doing relative to its competitors. Mr. Matich said he built his trucking company, MSS Distribution, with clients in the automotive, window and door and retail sectors, over 15 years but sold it when he felt the business was stuck.\u201cI remember having this meeting with my customer and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t solve their problem; we don\u2019t have the size,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed to make a change to help service our customers, as they had greater needs.\u201dHe and his partner began looking for buyers in 2014 and sold the company to a private equity firm last year. During that process, though, Mr. Matich said he belatedly realized that he and his partner might have been able to expand the company on their own or at the least build a firm that would have been worth more.\u201cYou\u2019re worried about sharing your info, but when you\u2019re sharing your info you\u2019re also gaining insights on others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were systems and process guys but we needed a finance guy.\u201dAs to the financial offer itself, the amount is going to vary depending on the buyer and also what the buyer wants from the business owner. \u201cThey hope for the best offer and throw them the keys and go their merry way,\u201d Mr. Mackin said. \u201cOne of the things we tell them is that\u2019s not always the case.\u201dMr. Ludwig said he wanted an all-cash deal so he could retire. He got that, but had to agree to consult for two years. \u201cThey honored those consulting contracts and paid us but they never used us,\u201d he said.But, he added, good advice from their lawyer kept them from being dependent on any additional payments. \u201cOur attorney said what you walk away with is 80 percent of what you can count on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was some good advice.\u201dAlthough the money may be good, the buyer may not be right for the company. Rick Spilde said he and his partner sold their green energy company, Essential Energy Services, in 2009 to an investment firm in Texas, where the company was based. \u201cOur company was at a plateau,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed more management or more sales staff. We were maxing out our capacity.\u201dHe consulted for the investment group for two years and then moved to Florida to retire. But then the company began to fail.\u201cThe people who ended up buying us were probably not the best fit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey basically bought the company to own it, not to run it.\u201dA few years ago, Mr. Spilde and his partner bought back their company, paying far less than they sold it for, and put a professional management team in place.\u201cThe first time around, we were trying to build the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second time around, we\u2019re as busy or busier than before but we\u2019re letting our employees run the company. This time, if we go to sell it, we have some really key people in place who aren\u2019t owners and that means the company will survive.\u201dAnd that is a feeling about as sweet as the money itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Personal Finance Book for Millennials Advises Starting With Lifestyle Goals", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfWhen it comes to planning your financial future, you may be starting in the wrong place.That\u2019s the contention of a new book by Jason Vitug, a millennial who founded the lifestyle website Phroogal.He says mistakes tend to happen at the beginning of financial planning.The problem with that approach, he says, is that those decisions end up governing many parts of your life \u2014 financial and otherwise \u2014 and may not be aligned with what is truly important to you. If extensive leisure travel gives your life meaning, for example, he points out that having a house and car could tie you down.Mr. Vitug argues that you need to figure out your ultimate desires first \u2014 after all, as his book title states, you\u2019ve only got one life \u2014 and then set financial goals to help you achieve them.For example, if traveling for pleasure is most important, he writes, you should keep possessions to a minimum, find a job or start a career that allows for substantial time off and concentrate on saving enough money to allow you to indulge your passion. This, as his subtitle says, is \u201cthe road map to financial wellness and a purposeful life.\u201dWill this lead you to a purposeful life? Possibly.But financial wellness? That\u2019s an open question, because Mr. Vitug does not spend much time explaining how to achieve the financial goals you have set.While he does a terrific job of addressing the need to keep credit card debt to a minimum, explaining that high interest rates can be a significant drag on achieving your ambitions, he is short on many other specifics. For example, his section on investing is only two pages long.This is intentional, he says. He writes that it is important to understand that \u201cmanaging your finances responsibly can be summed up with the following advice: Save more than you spend, invest early and frequently, pay off debt and use credit sparingly, build assets and create passive income.\u201dBecause he assumes that readers know this, he appears to think that there is nothing further to discuss.PwC, the accounting and consulting firm that conducted the study, defined millennials as \u201cthe generation of Americans born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s.\u201d The study found that only 24 percent of them \u201cdemonstrated basic financial knowledge.\u201d The study concluded: \u201cAmong the overall population, millennials are the age group with the lowest level of financial literacy.\u201dIf Mr. Vitug is trying to educate millennials, then even a basic primer would have helped.But his bigger point is right. The life you want to live should determine your financial goals.Advertisement"}

Electricians installed security cameras on the redesigned plaza as carpenters put the finishing touches on a new cafe.Lex Horth, an amateur photographer from Gates Mills, an affluent village nearby, snapped photos and marveled at downtown\u2019s newest jewel. \u201cI haven\u2019t come down here in 25 or 30 years because it was so derelict,\u201d said Ms. Horth, 80, adding that she was blown away by \u201cwhat Cleveland has done.\u201dNow many of its homes are boarded up. The barber on Fleet Avenue has bullet fragments in his leg; rival gangs burst in last year and fired shots. Mr. Rajecki, missing teeth, cannot afford dentures. Mr. Smith calls the neighborhood \u201ca dive\u201d \u2014 \u201cyou don\u2019t even got a bowling alley anymore,\u201d he said \u2014 and Cleveland \u201ca broke city.\u201dAs Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump for president, and Democrats in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, the nation is in the thick of searing debates over terrorism, race and policing, gun violence and immigration. But the host cities, both in Rust Belt swing states, spotlight something Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton rarely discuss: the plight of urban America.Amid a widening gap between rich and poor, nothing screams income inequality louder than cities, including Cleveland and Philadelphia, case studies in renewal and gentrification, but also in crushing decline. And perhaps no Americans capture as well as those who live in and advocate for these cities the feeling that the nation\u2019s present cannot match its past.\u201cYou talk about third world countries? We\u2019re not that far behind here, with the circumstances that people have to live in,\u201d said Mr. Karakul, a former lawyer. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I don\u2019t see much coming out of any of the campaigns on what we can do for poverty.\u201dOnce symbols of American industrial might and prosperity, Cleveland and Philadelphia are among the poorest cities in the nation. In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the third-highest poverty rate (39.2 percent) among cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution.Like other World War II-era manufacturing hubs \u2014 Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Baltimore and even Boston and New York \u2014 Philadelphia and Cleveland hollowed out during the latter half of the 20th century, losing jobs and people.Today, both cities rely on \u201ceds and meds\u201d \u2014 educational and medical institutions \u2014 as engines for jobs and growth. But while Boston and New York had started to rebound in the 1990s, Philadelphia and especially Cleveland have had slower rebirths.In 1950, Philadelphia was the nation\u2019s third-largest city, with a population of nearly 2.1 million, and Cleveland was seventh, at about 915,000. By 2010, Philadelphia was down to about 1.5 million and Cleveland to fewer than 400,000.\u201cThe conventioneers will come here, and they won\u2019t get away from the stadium or the downtown \u2014 they\u2019ll think they are in a comeback city,\u201d said Ira Goldstein, who supervises research for Reinvestment Fund, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit investor in community development. But he said other neighborhoods \u201chave regressed over the last 10, 12 years.\u201dSitting on a park bench in Rittenhouse Square, Richard Kahr, a retired real estate developer from Manhattan, said Philadelphia had \u201cmassively changed\u201d since he arrived a decade ago. But he is troubled by \u201ctwo classes\u201d in the city, and the nation \u2014 \u201cthe people that like their life, and the people fighting for their life.\u201dMantua, a proud but downtrodden West Philadelphia neighborhood whose rich African-American history is chronicled in colorful murals, is where those two classes may one day meet.Mantua is part of a \u201cPromise Zone,\u201d an Obama administration initiative to help poor communities. Nearly two-thirds of Mantua households have incomes below $25,000; the typical home sells for between $10,000 and $15,000, Mr. Goldstein said. But Mantua also has a wealthy neighbor: Drexel University.Jimmy Allen, a retired teacher and 1960s street gang leader who functions as Mantua\u2019s de facto mayor, knows its ills: boarded-up houses, drug addiction, struggling schools. And he knows its strengths: leaders with deep community roots. But what Mr. Allen, 68, frets most over are its vacant lots.A former management consultant, Mr. Fry has worked hard to enlist neighborhood support; in 2014 Drexel opened a community center in a renovated mansion, with a computer lab and playground. Mr. Fry wants neighborhoods that surround Drexel to \u201cbecome stronger and better versions of themselves\u201d \u2014 a vision he says can coexist with his effort to \u201cposition Philadelphia as a place of enormous growth and development.\u201dMr. Allen is unconvinced. He worries that speculators will move in, destroying the neighborhood\u2019s character.\u201cDrexel has a law department; we can\u2019t afford a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how are you going fight the dragon? You can only duck and dodge, and hope you survive.\u201dThat tension over gentrification is the story of many old industrial cities; here in Cleveland it is playing out in Ohio City, where lively restaurants and boutiques are attracting hipsters and millennials. Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian vendors sell fruit and vegetables at the popular West Side Market there. \u201cI take master\u2019s degree in my country \u2014 now I sell fruit,\u201d said Chrestina Sedrak, a former psychology teacher who fled Cairo during the 2011 uprising.While Ms. Sedrak sees opportunity, Narrin Noud-Carberg, 52, who survived the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and arrived here in 1981, is less upbeat. The restaurants and shops are bringing in customers, but sales at her spice shop are flat; customers look but do not buy.Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself \u201cGuitar Man\u201d (\u201cI save Cleveland one song at a time\u201d), can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work.\u201cThis whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a nitty-gritty city, and not some posh resort,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said.Returning there one recent afternoon, he could not help but grow misty. The old neighborhood where he played on the railroad tracks \u2014 \u201cwe used to grease the tracks and watch the wheels spin like crazy\u201d \u2014 now resembles \u201cempty spaces between somebody\u2019s teeth.\u201dAbout 70,000 people lived in Slavic Village at its peak; the population is roughly 23,000 now. \u201cYou have a housing stock that\u2019s dysfunctional, a population that\u2019s migrated out and an economy that\u2019s flat,\u201d said Tony Brancatelli, a city councilman. \u201cThen you layer on the foreclosure crisis and it\u2019s the kiss of death.\u201dStill, there are bright spots. The local bank Third Federal Savings and Loan \u2014 whose owners, descendants of Polish immigrants, started the foundation Mr. Karakul runs \u2014 is helping to build and finance new homes that sell for as much as $130,000.On Fleet Avenue, a popcorn maker who sells his treats at the West Side Market is planning a new manufacturing plant. And on Broadway Avenue, in a long-shuttered butcher shop, a maker of cured meat and sausage is moving in.Mr. Brancatelli, who sees the foreclosure crisis and its fallout as the root of \u201csocial unrest,\u201d said the national conversation around \u201cold industrial cities\u201d like Cleveland had changed \u2014 for the worse. Eight years ago, when Barack Obama ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, they debated in Cleveland and their advisers participated in a forum on housing at City Hall.\u201cNow we are not hearing a peep about it,\u201d Mr. Brancatelli said. \u201cIt scares the heck out of me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(A provincial government history says that underground Communists took advantage of Liu Wencai\u2019s conflict with a rival to secure weapons from him.)Liu Wencai died in October 1949, the same month that Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People\u2019s Republic. In December, his brother Liu Wenhui openly joined forces with the Communists, and the Nationalists retreated from Sichuan to Taiwan.The Liu family, like many wealthy Chinese, considered fleeing to Hong Kong, fearing what might happen under the new Communist government, Mr. Liu said. But Liu Wenhui urged them to stay, insisting the family would be treated well as the party\u2019s friend.In 1959, the landlord\u2019s residence was turned into a museum, featuring a \u201cwater dungeon,\u201d an underground space half-filled with water. A woman who claimed to be the dungeon\u2019s sole survivor described it as filled with human bones.By the early 1960s, Liu Wencai was nationally notorious as the \u201cchief representative of the landlord class for 3,000 years.\u201d His brother Liu Wenhui, who in 1959 became forestry minister and escaped persecution under Zhou Enlai\u2019s protection, was powerless to reverse the propaganda campaign, though he was secretly upset.\u201cWhat the hell are they talking about?\u201d was his private comment on one newspaper article about Liu Wencai, according to his grandson Liu Shizhao.In 1965, the Sichuan authorities commissioned more than 100 life-size clay sculptures that the museum installed as the Rent Collection Courtyard, which purported to show how Liu Wencai and his lackeys bullied peasants to extract rents.Denunciations of the landlord and the evil he ostensibly personified surged during the Cultural Revolution. Family members came under attack. A cousin of Mr. Liu who fled to Xinjiang was murdered along with his wife and children, as were many other people in China branded as \u201clandlords.\u201dThe frenzy subsided only in the 1980s, when liberal voices were tolerated to some extent. In 1988, the provincial authorities admitted that the water dungeon was an invention, and it was drained. But these beginnings of a re-evaluation stalled after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown as the party tightened its grip, Mr. Liu said.In the museum, Mr. Liu pointed out items he said never belonged to his family.A visitor asked, \u201cThis is your family?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Liu Wencai\u2019s grandson,\u201d Mr. Liu said.\u201cCan we take a picture with you?\u201d the man shouted excitedly, pointing at his friends.Mr. Liu became the group\u2019s tour guide, and the man, a railway official from Guizhou who said he had visited the museum on a school tour in the 1970s, was startled when Mr. Liu said that nearly everything on display was fake.Xiao Shu, the pen name of Chen Min, who in 1999 published \u201cThe Truth About Liu Wencai,\u201d a book that was soon banned, said the party would be reluctant to restore to respectability a villain of its own making.His book was accused of \u201cnegating the legitimacy of the new democratic revolution,\u201d when the party persecuted landlords and distributed their property to poor peasants, he said. \u201cThis is the basis of the regime\u2019s legitimacy, so they don\u2019t dare face the truth.\u201dWu Hongyuan, 60, a retired county propaganda official who served as the museum\u2019s director in the 1990s, said the process of restoring the truth could not be rushed. \u201cThe museum is too sensitive, and Liu Wencai is too famous,\u201d he said.Mr. Wu said he tried to recast the museum to more accurately present Liu Wencai\u2019s life, but anytime he altered something, he said, former underground Communists in Anren would protest to the authorities.Li Weijia, 98, was one of those protesters.\u201cHe never protected party members!\u201d insisted Mr. Li, in a hospital ward reserved for senior officials in Chengdu. \u201cThat\u2019s confusing black and white!\u2019\u2019At the end of his trip to Anren, Mr. Liu visited Chen Fahong, 86, a former worker in Liu Wencai\u2019s manor.\u201cWe had rice and meat to eat then. He was kind,\u201d Mr. Chen said of Liu Wencai in his modest yard amid onion fields. \u201cAfter liberation\u201d in 1949, he said, \u201cwe had only bran and grass to eat.\u201dMr. Liu said that, looking back, the family regretted having trusted the Communists.He recalled a song sung in his family after Liu Wenhui sided with the Communists, envisioning a paradise under the party\u2019s rule.\u201cThere is a good place beyond the mountains,\u201d it goes. \u201cThere, rich and poor are equal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Fallen Presidential Candidates, Bold Money Ideas Worth Another Look", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyWelcome to the season of the big, political personal finance promises.We\u2019ll be hearing plenty more proposals like this at the conventions in the next few weeks. But as always in politics, the bigger the possible benefit or cut, the higher the price and the lower the odds that anything like it will ever come to pass.So let us turn instead to bold money ideas from the presidential candidates who did not get this far. The three proposals below, which involve student loans, credit histories and retirement savings, are notable for the measurable improvement they would offer and that they need not cost taxpayers much at all.They deserve another hearing, including by the surviving candidates.Some big ideas do come to pass. Obamacare did, after all. So let\u2019s assume for the moment that Mrs. Clinton gets elected and her college proposal becomes reality. There will still be students from families with incomes above $125,000 who may need to borrow. Others will need money for room and board, graduate school or private colleges (where tuition will not be free under the Clinton plan).And if she drops her plan (which was inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s more generous one), cannot get it through Congress or loses the election? All the more reason to consider Jeb Bush\u2019s proposal for a radical overhaul of the federal student loan program.Borrowers would pay through payroll deduction or quarterly payments, just as they now pay estimated taxes. This would reduce the (too large) number of people who are behind or in default, often because they are not aware of the confusing array of income-driven repayment programs that already exist.The big catch here is a proposed $50,000 borrowing cap. That\u2019s more than most undergraduates can currently borrow from the federal student loan program but much less than most graduate students can borrow. Many of the people who need more than that for advanced degrees, however, will probably be well served by lenders in the private sector. Teenage undergraduates with nonexistent credit histories might not be so lucky, according to Jason Delisle, who was an informal adviser to the Bush campaign. Hence the desire to do more for them.The law does currently require mortgage lenders to give all applicants the credit score that they are using. Moreover, any company that turns down customers because of their credit score or forces them to pay more than they might have otherwise is supposed to hand over the score it used.So given that these companies have the scores available or can easily gain access to them, perhaps the next president could try to require that every company hand out the ones they are using to any consumer who asks. People who ask for one but do not end up becoming a customer within a reasonable period of time could be required to pay a nominal fee to cover the company\u2019s costs.Mr. Birdthistle, who worked for a big law firm that defended troubled mutual fund companies before he became a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Chicago-Kent College of Law, points to the political pickle a candidate might be in for supporting the Thrift Savings Plan. Voters might blame a Democrat for not pounding the table hard enough for more guaranteed income from Social Security. A Republican, however, would be praising a giant government savings plan that offers better investments and lower prices than most of the private sector delivers.Wall Street would not be thrilled, and perhaps donors who work there made their feelings known to Senator Rubio after he spoke up in 2014.Opening the Thrift Savings Plan to everyone would have a cost, given the complexity of payroll withholding from untold numbers of new workers. Mr. Birdthistle suggested that the government might build a parallel program alongside the current plan so as not to impose those new costs on incumbent participants.Or you could do what a partner at Mr. Birdthistle\u2019s former firm told him and his fellow associates to do with their money. After getting them up to speed on their mutual fund clients and the various accusations of scandals and schemes they faced, he recommended a different investment firm, one that is best known for its index funds. That company is owned by its funds, which are owned by the shareholders.The solution, the partner told them, was simple. \u201cJust put your money in Vanguard,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this column misstated a calculation in Jeb Bush\u2019s student loan proposal. The repayment amount would be prorated to the exact debt; it wouldn\u2019t be based on $10,000 increments.@ronlieberAdvertisement"}

The move will cut the company\u2019s valuation in half, to about $2 billion.David O. Sacks, who replaced Mr. Conrad as chief executive, said in an email to employees that the decision stemmed from discussions with a number of the company\u2019s major investors, and that Fidelity, TPG, Andreessen Horowitz and Insight Venture Partners had all agreed to the deal.Under the new terms, the stake owned by investors in the company\u2019s Series C funding round will increase to 25 percent, from 11 percent. That group invested about $500 million in May 2015. Earlier investors will soon be offered an opportunity to own more of the company to offset the dilution of their stakes.\u201cAt some point, this company will want to sell its shares again, and future prospective shareholders will look closely at how we treated our current shareholders,\u201d Mr. Sacks wrote.\u201cOver the last six months, in the face of very significant challenges, David Sacks has shown incredible leadership,\u201d said Bill McGlashan, the founder and managing partner of TPG Growth. \u201cHe and the board have held the company accountable and done the right thing by customers, employees, regulators and investors.\u201dWhen it came to light that Mr. Conrad had created software, called the Macro, that allowed sales representatives to get around regulations, they maintained that they had overpaid for a piece of a company whose fast growth was built on false pretenses, according to two people with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Sacks, who has personally invested more than $12 million in Zenefits, stepped into the role of chief executive shortly after.\u201cWe self-reported the issue to regulators, brought our licensing into compliance, changed our leadership and governance, instituted new company values, and began to transform the culture,\u201d Mr. Sacks wrote in an email to employees on Thursday. \u201cIn many ways this is a different company than the one they originally joined, but our employees have embraced our new values and our mission to make small-business ownership easier and more accessible to everyone.\u201d\u201cZ2\u201d is expected to start in October, the company has said.Given how much Zenefits has changed under Mr. Sacks\u2019s leadership, a few weeks ago employees were given the opportunity to take a voluntary two-month severance package.

{"Headline": "What Trump and the G.O.P. Can Agree On: Tax Cuts for the Rich", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byLike Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republicans boast that most Americans will be able to file their taxes on a postcard.Like the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, they would eliminate deductions for interest payments for businesses and allow them to immediately write off all capital investments.Like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, they would no longer tax a company\u2019s foreign profits.But most significant, the blueprint, shepherded by Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, embraces a transformational shift promoted by both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, but not Mr. Trump: a move away from taxing income to a system that basically taxes consumption.Despite their conceptual differences, however, there is a crucial feature that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan and the House Republicans\u2019 plan share: The biggest tax cuts are reserved for the wealthiest.\u201cRelative to the current system, the plans are pulling in the same general direction, reducing taxation on capital gains and high-income households,\u201d said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H. W. Bush.Beyond sharply cutting income tax rates across the board, both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans would eliminate the estate tax (which currently applies to only about 5,300 of the richest families); end the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners\u2019 investment income, which helps pay for health coverage for lower-income Americans; and scrap the alternative minimum tax, which is aimed at making it harder for the affluent to take advantage of various tax breaks.But they reach those goals by different paths. While the Trump plan stays squarely within the traditional framework of an income tax, the Ryan plan takes a giant step toward taxing what people spend.Alan Viard, a tax expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a proponent of consumption taxes, explained the difference. The \u201cTrump plan has a bigger revenue loss and more harmful effects on the budget outlook,\u201d he said, while \u201cthe Ryan plan is more revolutionary from the standpoint of tax policy.\u201dThe best-known version of a consumption tax is the value added tax, or V.A.T., which functions like a national sales tax.Such taxes have long been popular among some economists, who argue that they encourage people to save for tomorrow, rather than spend today, and help foster more investment that leads to longer-term growth.But skeptics point out that unlike the rich, people on the lower end of the income ladder must spend most, if not all, of their earnings \u2014 on things like housing, food, cellphones, doctors, toothpaste, bus fare, jeans and haircuts \u2014 and have little left over to save. Taxing consumption means the burden inevitably falls more heavily on them.From this vantage point, a progressive income tax based on the ability to pay is the most practical way to ensure that the wealthy contribute their fair share to financing the government, particularly when wealth inequality has widened to the greatest levels since the Gilded Age.Supporters of a progressive income tax argue that it is fairer in another way because it taxes earnings from capital as well as labor (even if sometimes at a different rate). Workers who earn their money in the form of wages or salaries should not pay a larger share of their income, they say, than taxpayers who live off their investments and tend to be among the wealthiest Americans. Nearly 70 percent of capital gains benefits go to the top 1 percent.Those proponents also note that there is little evidence that lowering taxes on the wealthy leads to significantly stronger economic growth. There is no guarantee that the rich will not use their extra money to buy, say, a multimillion-dollar Picasso to hang in their living room or finance a company in China rather than plow the money into American businesses and their workers.Like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, the House majority has tried \u2014 as the song advises \u2014 to accentuate the positives and eliminate the negatives, by mixing and matching elements of both approaches.Individuals would continue to pay taxes on their income at mildly progressive rates. Instead of imposing a regressive tax on consumers at the checkout counter, however, the government would collect that money after it was spent, from businesses.Businesses would then be allowed to deduct all their expenses and investments right away, rather than depreciating them over time. But it would mean an end to the deduction for interest paid on loans, which can often favor industries that depend heavily on debt financing \u2014 like real estate, Mr. Trump\u2019s own business.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of a consumption tax on the business side and an income tax,\u201d said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump have indicated a willingness to compromise on details, but as Mr. Ryan told C-Span, \u201cOn the critical aspects of this agenda, on the foundations of it and the basic principles, we are in agreement on these things.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign team did not respond to repeated requests for comment.With only sketchy details, predicting how either plan would affect the economy and the federal budget is difficult. Both Mr. Trump and House Republicans contend that explosive growth unleashed by their proposals would make up for revenue losses.And so while Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals strike a more populist note, claiming to eradicate sweetheart deals for the rich, in reality both Republican plans offer the wealthy even better breaks than they get now.Take, for example, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed elimination of what\u2019s known as the carried interest loophole, which has enabled private equity and hedge fund titans to save billions of dollars. They are allowed to classify what are essentially ordinary earnings \u2014 taxed at over 40 percent for the highest incomes \u2014 as investment profits, which are subject to a rate of 23.8 percent.But as Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center sees it, \u201cTrump is closing one carried interest loophole and opening another.\u201dMany of those money managers could end up paying less than they do now \u2014 just 15 percent \u2014 by simply reclassifying their earnings as income from pass-through businesses or partnerships.That loophole would also get bigger under the Ryan plan, because the tax rate on capital gains would be reduced.When it comes to companies parking their overseas profits outside the United States, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump seem to stake out conflicting positions. The Ryan plan eliminates taxes on foreign earnings altogether, and instead taxes businesses on the basis of where their goods and services were sold.By contrast, Mr. Trump has promised a crackdown, forcing multinationals to pay United States taxes every year.As it turns out, the get-tough approach would not necessarily matter much. Because Mr. Trump promises to cut the corporate rate and allow credits for foreign taxes paid, many multinationals could end up owing nothing.\u201cSuperficially, Trump is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the House Republicans\u201d on this issue, said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut in practice, not that much.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTvideovideovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix Wall Street\u2019s Flawed System of Compensation", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneWhen a professor emeritus at the London School of Economics, who also spent many years as an adviser at the Bank of England, publicly endorses a much-needed \u2013 but generally overlooked \u2013 overhaul of Wall Street, that is an occasion for celebration.The distinguished economist in question is Charles Goodhart, who, speaking with considerable gravitas and wit last week at a European Central Bank forum in Sintra, Portugal, wondered aloud why prudential regulators of the world\u2019s financial system had spent so much time in recent years worrying about capital ratios and liquidity and so little time worrying about Wall Street governance and pay practices. These issues, he said, \u201cmuch more fundamentally influence personal incentives and therefore business decisions.\u201dProfessor Goodhart was not opposed to making sure banks have enough capital and liquidity. It is just that \u2013 my words, not his \u2014 the way Wall Street rewards its workers and the amount of money in question are a much more reliable barometer of how bankers, traders and executives behave every day. Financial regulators have not come anywhere near discussing the subject as publicly as they have other regulatory issues. But perhaps the time has come.\u201cOceans of ink,\u201d Professor Goodhart said in his speech, \u201chave been used to examine and deplore the incentive and moral hazard effect of deposit insurance, whereas much less attention has been paid to the much more powerful and similar implications of limited liability, especially on those in a position to influence a bank\u2019s decision.\u201dOver the last few decades, Wall Street firms have transformed themselves from small private partnerships into the publicly financed behemoths that we know today. Along the way, they lost the old way of doing things, where the operating capital came from the partners, who faced the ultimate liability for anything that went wrong, including losing their entire fortunes.Instead, the old partnership culture was transformed into a bonus culture where bankers, traders and executives have minimal accountability when things go wrong. Crises will continue to happen; Professor Goodhart predicted the next one would hit in 2025. But it is the creditors and shareholders who will pay, and pay dearly, for Wall Street\u2019s mistakes unless something changes. As the mantra of the 2008 financial crisis goes: The risks on Wall Street have been socialized while the profits have been privatized.It does not seem at all a coincidence that since the mid-1980s, there has been a marked increase in the frequency and intensity of financial crises and their effects as Wall Street banks made the transformation into public companies that award individuals bonuses based on the revenue they bring in. From 1987 to 2009, the flawed Wall Street reward system resulted in the crash of 1987, the credit crunch in the early 1990s, the internet bubble in the late 1990s, the Asian crisis, the Mexican crisis and, of course, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the Great Recession of 2008.That needs to change, Professor Goodhart told Europe\u2019s leading banking regulators and academics. His idea is to return the systemically important financial institutions \u2014 the so-called SIFIs \u2014 to a partnership model, \u201cwhere the executive decision makers \u2013 the partners \u2013 have in effect unlimited and much larger liability than is provided by limited liability,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that if a bank has to be bailed out, the partners should pay up all, or at least proportion, of what they have.\u201dOf course, it is unlikely that a place like Goldman Sachs could ever return to a private partnership, as it was for its first 130 years in business. Such a move would require a management buyout in the range of $100 billion and would require debt and financial risk well beyond what any sane prudential regulator would permit.But it is still possible to reintroduce an important, new measure of accountability into the Wall Street compensation system, which has became way too good at rewarding bankers, traders and executives for taking big risks with other people\u2019s money and absolutely terrible at penalizing them for their bad behavior.Given that every existing Wall Street firm has a partnership culture in its DNA, it should not be difficult to devise a new compensation system based on the old partnership ethic. What needs to happen, and soon, is for the top 500 or so executives at the remaining Wall Street firms \u2013 those people who are responsible for things like pay, promotion, allocation of capital and business strategy \u2013 to have their full net-worth at risk again. They should once again know that if their firm takes imprudent risks, chances are good that all the wealth they have accumulated over the years, in the form of salary and bonuses, would be forked over to the shareholders and creditors whose money they have gambled and lost.\u201cMy dearly beloved brethren,\u201d Professor Goodhart said last week, \u201clet me start by leading you in prayer: Lord forgive us because we have done those things we ought not to have done and not done those things we\u2019ve ought to have done. Life is full of sins of commission and omission.\u201dFixing the Wall Street compensation system so that it rewards behavior that does not condemn the rest of us to another financial calamity is one of the major sins of omission to which he was referring. Amen.Advertisement"}

Right is right, wrong is wrong. Take no prisoners. Divide and conquer.\u201cIt was such a nice, friendly atmosphere, because the movie was so evenhanded,\u201d said the longtime anti-Indian Point activist Marilyn Elie, who, with her husband, Roger Witherspoon, a veteran environmental journalist, and Brian Vangor, the senior control-room operator of the plant, are principal characters in the film and have appeared together at festival screenings.\u201cBut,\u201d Ms. Elie cautioned, \u201cit\u2019s not an advocacy film.\u201dAnd by not being one, \u201cIndian Point\u201d sets itself apart not only from the drift of current documentaries but also from much of the money available to make them \u2014 money coming from institutions that place considerable importance on a film\u2019s cause and its outreach plan (the organizational networking necessary to reach the audience sympathetic to that cause).There is also an implicit constraint imposed when a filmmaker has pitched a film one way, and the story goes another.\u201cAs one does, if one is doing a good job, we found out the story was different from our thesis,\u201d Ms. Grady said. \u201cLuckily, the money we\u2019d gotten was from the Ford Foundation, which was a no-strings grant maker.\u201dBut other foundations, like the MacArthur Foundation, are no longer providing grants for individual documentary projects, choosing instead to channel money thorough smaller institutions. That change \u201cwas very, very painful,\u201d said Julie Goldman, a producer of \u201cIndian Point.\u201d She said foundations have historically been places you could go for significant financial help \u201cand not have to scrap for every $15,000. But they both decided to do the same thing. So it\u2019s really challenging.\u201dThe alternative is going to financiers who often want a post-release plan from a filmmaker, in preproduction, about how the movie will create a conversation, online or off. \u201cThe reality is you end up kind of guessing a lot,\u201d Ms. Goldman said. \u201cLook, some things are going to be obvious \u2014 who the partners are, what you can do for outreach. When you\u2019re doing a film on Indian Point, it\u2019s a question.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s left to private foundations that are basically created to get tax deductions so they can work on social issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the role of a foundation is.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that social-issue films are getting money,\u201d she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s bad that nothing else is getting funded.\u201dOn the other hand, \u201cit\u2019s a question within the field right now about how much we\u2019re asking filmmakers to do other than being filmmakers,\u201d Ms. Halpin said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to drive these activist campaigns that can have career implications, because when you\u2019re speaking at churches and schools and libraries for two years after you\u2019ve made the movie, you\u2019re not making your next movie. And you only get to be a filmmaker once every four or five years.\u201dSignificant support for the filmmaker-sans-agenda has come from the Sundance Institute, where Tabitha Jackson, who runs the documentary fund, is widely recognized as sympathetic to the cause of the art documentary. A new Sundance initiative called the Art of Nonfiction is intended to support individual filmmakers, not strictly social-impact movies.\u201cIt felt like we were at danger point maybe a couple of years ago,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThere was a risk that an inappropriate form of measurement would tend to reduce the funding that filmmakers got unless they jumped through hoops, or pretended to be able to do things they couldn\u2019t. I think the conversation is different now. It\u2019s about sustainability and diversity.\u201dFor Ms. Meeropol, it\u2019s also about objectivity, and how it goes unrewarded.At a recent Q. and A., she said: \u201cI had not a single filmmaking question from the audience. So despite my best efforts, the film becomes an advocacy piece. And I am a reluctant poster child for the anti-nuke movement.\u201dAn article last Sunday about funding for documentary films misstated the Ford Foundation\u2019s policy regarding grant money for documentaries. Ford, through its JustFilms unit, continues to provide money to individual filmmakers; the organization has not stopped giving grant money to documentarians.Advertisement"}

Trump will have at least two or three appointments in a first term. And that will shape a number of important issues, including immigration, racial preferences, the role of unions and environmental issues.The significance is underscored by the last two presidents. Had Vice President Al Gore won the Electoral College vote as well as the popular vote in 2000, the court seats now occupied by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito would have been filled by more liberal jurists, giving progressives a majority. Likewise, if Republicans had won the White House in 2008, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wouldn\u2019t be on the court and conservatives would enjoy a comfortable majority.Mrs. Clinton hasn\u2019t gone that far, but she has vowed that any appointee would favor abortion rights and overturning the court\u2019s recent campaign finance laws.Activists on the right and left are ginned up and certainly will make the court part of their fund-raising.Conservatives have done a slightly better job of seizing on the issue. They may be helped this time by court decisions on affirmative action, abortion, same-sex marriage and upholding the Affordable Care Act that the right found disappointing.They aren\u2019t confident, however, that a President Trump, a recent convert to conservative causes, would be an ally, even though they liked his list of potential appointees.Miguel Estrada, one of the most prominent conservative legal intellectuals, though he is a fan of Mr. Garland, acknowledged that he probably wouldn\u2019t like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appointees. He\u2019s not assuaged, however, by Mr. Trump\u2019s list: \u201cIt\u2019s like a game of Russian roulette with Trump,\u201d Mr. Estrada said.\u201cHe\u2019s just as likely to appoint Judge Judy as anyone on that list,\u201d he added, referring to the star of a reality television program.Liberals hope Mr. Trump will stir their base, especially Hispanics. One of the deadlocked Supreme Court decisions this term effectively suspended President Obama\u2019s executive order aimed at preventing millions of undocumented workers from being deported. It is likely to be considered again.There are questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s court appointments, too. She once said that she\u2019d love to name Mr. Obama to the bench \u2014 William Howard Taft became chief justice after he left the White House \u2014 but that\u2019s unlikely.As president, she probably would like to tap someone younger, more liberal and of a more diverse background than the 63-year-old Judge Garland, who was first nominated in March. But to pass him over would be a rebuke not only to the respected judge, but also to Mr. Obama. That\u2019s probably not the way she\u2019d like to start a presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cheap Money Talks", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byWhat with everything else going on, from Trump to Brexit to the horror in Dallas, it\u2019s hard to focus on developments in financial markets \u2014 especially because we\u2019re not facing any immediate crisis. But extraordinary things have been happening lately, especially in bond markets. And because money still makes the world go \u2019round, attention must be paid to what the markets are trying to tell us.Some commentators blame the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, accusing them of engineering \u201cartificially low\u201d interest rates that encourage speculation and distort the economy. These are, by the way, largely the same people who used to predict that budget deficits would cause interest rates to soar. In any case, however, it\u2019s important to understand that they\u2019re not making sense.For what does \u201cartificially low\u201d mean in this context? Compared to what? Historically, the consequence of excessively easy money \u2014 the way you know that money is too easy \u2014 has been out-of-control inflation. That\u2019s not happening in America, where inflation is still below the Fed\u2019s target, and it\u2019s definitely not happening in Europe, where the central bank has been trying to raise inflation, without success.If anything, developments in the real economies of the advanced world are telling us that interest rates aren\u2019t low enough \u2014 that is, while low rates may be having their usual effects of boosting the housing sector and, to some extent, the stock market, those effects aren\u2019t big enough to produce a strong recovery. But why?So what\u2019s going on? I think of it as the Great Capitulation.Many people don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening, but raising rates in the face of weak economies would be an act of folly that might well push us back into recession.I know, deficit scolds would issue dire warnings about the evils of public debt. But they have been wrong about everything for at least the past eight years, and it\u2019s time to stop taking them seriously.They say that money talks; well, cheap money is speaking very clearly right now, and it\u2019s telling us to invest in our future.Advertisement"}

President, Dies at 89", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byJohn Brademas, a political, financial and academic dynamo who served 22 years in Congress and more than a decade as president of New York University in an all-but-seamless quest to promote education, the arts and a liberal agenda, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 89.His death was announced by N.Y.U.As a Democratic representative from Indiana from 1959 to 1981, Mr. Brademas became known as Mr. Education and Mr. Arts. He sponsored bills that nearly doubled federal aid for elementary and secondary education in the mid-1960s and that created the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities. He was also instrumental in annual financing of the arts and humanities and in the passage of Project Head Start, the National Teachers Corps and college tuition aid and loan programs.He opposed the Vietnam War and many defense measures, rebuked President Richard M. Nixon in the Watergate scandal and voted for civil rights legislation, environmental protections, day care programs and services for the elderly and people with disabilities. He became majority whip, the House\u2019s third-ranking official, and was re-elected 10 times in a mostly conservative district, winning up to 79 percent of the vote.But he was swept out of office in the 1980 Republican landslide that elected Ronald Reagan president. Mr. Brademas lobbied hard for the N.Y.U. job and, as president from 1981 to 1992, transformed the nation\u2019s largest private university from a commuter school into one of the world\u2019s premier residential research and teaching institutions.But he was a gregarious leader with voluminous contacts in government and corporate life. His skills as a politician and fund-raiser had been honed in a whirlwind of congressional and civic responsibilities. And, as his admirers came to believe, he was \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014 a natural university president.John Brademas was born on March 2, 1927, in Mishawaka, Ind., the son of Stephen and Beatrice Goble Brademas. His father, a Greek immigrant, ran a restaurant and quoted Socrates to him: \u201cThings of value come only after hard work.\u201d His mother was an elementary-school teacher, and one grandfather was a college professor. In 1945, he graduated from Central High School in nearby South Bend, where he was valedictorian and the star quarterback on the football team.He enrolled at the University of Mississippi, where he joined a Navy officer training program. After his freshman year, he won a scholarship and transferred to Harvard, a change he called head-spinning.He became a top student and president of the Wesley Foundation, the campus Methodist student group. In successive summers, he worked at an auto plant in South Bend, lived among Indians in Mexico and was an intern at the United Nations temporary headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y.After graduating from Harvard with high honors in 1949, he attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and in 1954 earned a social studies doctorate.Back home in northern Indiana, he resolved to run for Congress in a largely Republican district with diverse demographics: farmers, small-town retailers, auto-industry workers, members of East European ethnic groups, affluent and blue-collar voters, and college communities that included the University of Notre Dame.It took three tries. After losing races in 1954 and 1956, he gained political experience as an aide to two members of Congress and in Adlai E. Stevenson\u2019s 1956 presidential campaign. He taught political science at St. Mary\u2019s College for a year, was active in civic affairs and in 1958 finally won the seat for Indiana\u2019s Third Congressional District.She survives him, as do three stepchildren, John Briggs, Katherine Goldberg and Jane Murray; a sister, Eleanor Brazeau; and six step-grandchildren. His stepson Basil Briggs Jr. died in 2003.Mr. Brademas was the author of \u201cWashington, D.C., to Washington Square\u201d (1986) and, with Lynne P. Brown, \u201cThe Politics of Education: Conflict and Consensus on Capitol Hill\u201d (1987). From 1994 to 2001 he was chairman of the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and from 2004 to 2007 he was a member of the New York State Board of Regents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving the Economy the Help It Needs", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe economy added 287,000 new jobs last month, compared with 11,000 in May. Large month-to-month swings indicate statistical noise and one-off distortions, in this case, a strike by Verizon workers in May that was resolved by June. But the big picture is basically unchanged.On average, the economy added 147,000 new jobs in each of the past three months, a slowdown from an average of 196,000 new jobs a month in the first quarter of this year and 282,000 in the last quarter of 2015. Slowing job growth means tepid wage growth. A slight rise in average hourly earnings last month brought the increase in pay to 2.6 percent over the year, which by historical standards is subdued. Worse, the increase, such as it is, overstates the raises of most workers because it includes the large gains of executives and managers.The Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates low in light of the jobs data and other economic headwinds, especially the coming consequences of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Holding rates steady is the right, if defensive, move to keep the economy from backsliding. But on their own, low interest rates cannot propel the economy forward.The question is when, if ever, Congress will capitalize on the prolonged low interest rates by borrowing to invest in large (and overdue) productivity-enhancing projects, including rebuilding and modernizing roads, bridges, ports, rail, parks, school buildings, electrical grids and other infrastructure.Congress\u2019s squandered chance to authorize such spending during this recovery is born of partisanship, as congressional Republicans have sought to thwart attempts by President Obama and congressional Democrats to use fiscal policy to bolster the economy. Making matters worse, many Democrats faltered, embracing the misguided austerity policies championed by their political opponents, for fear of looking weak.Election season is upon us, which means Congress is unlikely to have a change of heart. But it also means that people will have a chance to choose leaders who recognize that aggressive fiscal policy can help ensure a full recovery from the ravages of the Great Recession.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Putin-Trump Admiration Society", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialOne curious aspect of the 2016 presidential campaign has been Donald Trump\u2019s startling affinity for Vladimir Putin, the increasingly authoritarian president of Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken admiringly of each other; exhibited similar strongman tendencies; and seemed to share certain views, notably a disdain for NATO. But would Mr. Putin really interfere in the American presidential race to help Mr. Trump, the Republican Party nominee, get elected over the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton?There is nothing new about intelligence services for the United States and Russia hacking each other\u2019s computer systems or trying to covertly influence other countries\u2019 domestic politics. In recent years, Mr. Putin has invaded Ukraine, stoking political tensions there and in the Baltic States, and financed right-wing politicians across Europe; during the Cold War, the United States secretly tried to influence elections in Indonesia, Italy, Chile and Poland. What seems new here is the idea that a government would publicly disclose information it got from hacking into the computers of an American political party in order to influence an election.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of commitment to the defense of NATO allies and his retreat from the world would unquestionably serve Mr. Putin\u2019s dream of unraveling the Western alliance and re-establishing Russia as a superpower. Although as a developer Mr. Trump never got the real estate foothold in Russia that he craved, he has spent 30 years courting Russian politicians. His campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has extensive financial and political dealings with business executives in Russia and Ukraine, and served as a political strategist for Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed pro-Russia president of Ukraine.If it is proved that Mr. Putin instigated the D.N.C. hack, it could backfire. But regardless of whether Mr. Putin is out to help Mr. Trump, voters would be right to question the judgment of a candidate who has shown so much admiration for such a dangerous adversary.Advertisement"}

United Healthcare Workers East. These were just three among at least a dozen six-figure contributions.Other gifts came from companies or people who did business with the city, including a $100,000 contribution from Two Trees Management Company, a real estate developer that had negotiated with the de Blasio administration over redeveloping the Domino Sugar Factory site in Brooklyn.Mr. de Blasio, who has raised money for the Campaign for One New York, has argued that the activities of the nonprofits tied to him are aboveboard because they voluntarily disclose all of their contributions, despite not being required to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s not dark money if it\u2019s disclosed,\u201d he said in February.But the board said the nonprofit\u2019s disclosures fell short of being \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and fully accessible to the public.On Wednesday, a spokesman for the mayor, Eric Phillips, said that Mr. de Blasio had been a \u201clifelong advocate\u201d of campaign finance reform, though he did not touch on the specifics of the legislation the Campaign Finance Board and watchdogs have suggested.\u201cHe looks forward to continuing the work to help get big money out of politics and to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.The board\u2019s actions were far more muted than its words.The board also clarified rules governing nonprofit advocacy groups that are affiliated with politicians. If such groups coordinate with a politician\u2019s campaign to promote the politician in the run-up to an election, anything they spend will be treated as a donation to the candidate and subject to normal campaign finance limits.A spokesman for the Campaign for One New York, Dan Levitan \u2014 who doubles as one of those consultants \u2014 said the group was \u201cpleased\u201d with the decision.\u201cThe Campaign for One New York was formed to advocate for New York City\u2019s progressive policy agenda,\u201d Mr. Levitan said in a statement. \u201cIt never engaged in any election campaign activity for any candidate and shut down more than a year and a half before next year\u2019s election.\u201dBut government watchdogs said the mayor and the nonprofit won a narrow victory on narrow grounds.\u201cI\u2019m looking at the philosophy underlying the campaign finance law, not whether this dollar or that dollar was spent for campaign purposes,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York. \u201cDon\u2019t give the appearance that you\u2019re selling out.

A website promoting Frankfurt as an attractive location to invest went live. A Berlin start-up published an online how-to guide for anyone looking to move to the German capital.Much remains up in the air, as the country embarks on a yearslong process to leave the 28-nation bloc. Britain hasn\u2019t even officially filed for divorce, and there will be painful negotiations on matters including trade and whether people from European Union nations will have the freedom to work in Britain, as they do now.Despite the high levels of uncertainty, others in Europe are, in effect, looking to gain from Britain\u2019s pain.Across the Continent, officials are already vocally trying to entice financial services firms, technology start-ups and others to forgo the British capital for cities like Paris, Luxembourg, Frankfurt and even the relatively tiny Lithuanian capital, Vilnius. They warn that businesses will suffer if they stay in a Britain that no longer has unfettered access to the European Union and its hundreds of millions of potential customers.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want the vote to turn out that way,\u201d said Tarek Al-Wazir, economics minister for the German state of Hesse, which includes Frankfurt. But, he added, \u201cwe prepared just in case.\u201dFew cities were as ready as Frankfurt.Frankfurt already has a strong claim as a regional banking center with a major stock market. But its local financial services industry is only about a tenth the size of London\u2019s. As with its rivals, even if it could attract a sliver of the investment currently in London, the gains in terms of jobs and tax revenue would be large.Several companies \u2014 including banks like HSBC and JPMorgan Chase and the telecommunications giant Vodafone \u2014 have said they will consider moving at least a few jobs to the Continent.\u201cA 2 percent loss for London is a 20 percent gain for Frankfurt,\u201d said Hubertus V\u00e4th, managing director of Frankfurt Main Finance, a coalition of businesses and local government organizations that were behind the campaign.When it comes to the financial services industry, several cities have rolled out the red carpet to lure London-based companies.Ahead of the referendum, local and regional government officials held an event in Paris at the offices of Euronext, the stock market operator. Called \u201cWelcome to Europe!\u201d it encouraged financial services companies to consider the French capital as an alternative.Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the president of the region that surrounds Paris, has extolled the city\u2019s virtues, noting the opening of new bilingual schools as well as its quality of life and available office space.\u201cWhen Britain goes out, a lot of firms will have to relocate in Europe,\u201d Ms. P\u00e9cresse said. \u201cThere is a competition that is going to take place. It is already taking place between the big metropolises in Europe.\u201dAlong with those large cities, smaller financial centers \u2014 in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 are also getting involved. Even Lithuania, a country not typically noted as a hub for business in Europe, much less high finance, is involved.On the day the referendum results were announced, Antanas Guoga, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, wrote to several financial institutions with large London staffs, suggesting they move some of their European operations to Vilnius, Lithuania\u2019s capital, with a population of just over 500,000.Mr. Guoga, a former professional poker player and chief investment officer for Vilnius, noted in his letter that the British bank Barclays, the Danish lender Danske Bank and the stock market operator Nasdaq all had operations in the city.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity now to let everyone know about our success stories,\u201d he said.Despite the overtures from elsewhere, officials in London still believe they will retain most of the business and finance that is currently based there.\u201cThe City of London has thrived as a financial and trading center for more than a thousand years,\u201d he said, \u201cand will continue to do so.\u201dThe competition, though, extends outside of financial services \u2014 Europe\u2019s tech hubs are turning on the charm offensive, as well.While cities are fiercely competing to steal companies from London, others are hoping to profit by helping companies sort through their options.Major law firms in the British capital are gearing up for a surge in business: A spokesman for Allen & Overy said that before the results of the referendum, 500 clients registered to take part in a conference call discussing the fallout from the so-called Brexit. After the results, 1,200 more signed up.Real estate agents in major cities across the Continent, including Stockholm and Frankfurt, are also reporting increased interest from banks and technology companies casting their eyes away from London.Officials in Ireland, for example, began discussing the possible outcome with international companies based in Ireland, and potential new recruits, months before last week\u2019s vote.Niamh Bushnell, Dublin\u2019s commissioner for start-ups, watched the referendum results in the Irish capital in a room filled with entrepreneurs and tech executives.As the realization that Britain had decided to go it alone set in, Ms. Bushnell said, the first reaction of those in the room was shock. That emotion, however, soon turned into something else: a sense of opportunity.\u201cWe saw this as a call to action to promote Dublin as an alternative to London,\u201d said Ms. Bushnell, who has been meeting with Irish ministers to discuss how to entice entrepreneurs away from Britain.Next week her team will open a website \u2014 roughly a year in the making \u2014 to promote Ireland\u2019s tech prowess.\u201cWe need to go out there, talk to entrepreneurs and sell them on what Ireland has to offer,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will do whatever it takes to help.

Their names: Jose, named after Representative Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of the Bronx, and Justin, after a certain pop singer. (Justin Beaver \u2014 get it?)Though the autoclaved aerated concrete walls have already been built, work is still underway at the 7,000-square-foot site: A large pile of construction debris and soil rises high beside Dumpsters, trailers and busy front-end loaders.Mr. Kiss, whose firm won the Public Design Commission Award in 2008 for its building plans, said that after a series of financing, management and permit delays, the River House should be finished by October and fully operational by November.Once it is completed, a geothermal system will help heat and cool the parks department building, he explained. Solar panels will cover the saw-toothed roof, providing 60 percent of the building\u2019s energy. Windows between the panels will provide light, making it unnecessary to turn on a light switch during the day. A screen wall with mesh wraps will host vines that will throw shade in summer and help modulate the building\u2019s temperature.A 10,000-gallon tank was recently buried at the site to collect rainwater, which will be used to feed the plants, flush the toilets and wash the two dozen boats kept on site. \u201cWhy waste the city\u2019s water?\u201d said Mr. Kiss.A moss wall will also help freshen the air inside the building.\u201cThe moss wall is experimental,\u201d Mr. Kiss said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to make it work.\u201dAn article in some editions on July 10 about the Bronx River House, an ecologically sensitive building, gave an incorrect figure from city officials for the size of the building\u2019s rainwater storage tank. It is 10,000 gallons, not 190,000.THE PARTICULARSAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Campaign Too Small? Or Is Clinton\u2019s Too Big?", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byNotebookBy the more-is-more arms-race logic that typically attends presidential campaigns, it sounds like an absurd question. Presently, the Clinton operation consists of about 700 paid staff members; Trump\u2019s is one-tenth that amount. Last month, Clinton\u2019s campaign and its allies spent $26 million in the battleground states; Trump spent zero.But the last Republican to win a presidential election, George W. Bush, had a paid staff of only about 220 in 2004. His former senior strategist, Matthew Dowd, describes Clinton\u2019s operation as an \u201cunwieldy tanker ship,\u201d adding: \u201cShe\u2019s also had an overreliance on paid political advertising. That money she recently spent in battleground states was totally wasted. She should be making more effective use of social media as a way of getting publicity. I know people say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s unique to Trump.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fully the case. He\u2019s shown how you can interject a new argument, put it out there and have it dominate discussion for the next five hours.\u201dThe vast gulf between the candidates\u2019 spending isn\u2019t likely to shrink much, according to the Trump campaign\u2019s national finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin. \u201cI think this is a very different campaign, starting with the fact that Donald has a broader following than just the traditional Republican Party,\u201d Mnuchin told me. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to spend the kind of money on ads that the Clinton campaign is spending. And Donald doesn\u2019t think we need 900 people on the campaign staff.\u201dBut Dowd argues that the Trump campaign could use \u201csome discipline and focus \u2014 to actually say, here are the eight states everyone in this building ought to be focused on.\u201d Mnuchin scoffs at so narrow a projection. \u201cDonald is saying he\u2019s not taking New York and California off the table \u2014 those are not states Hillary should assume she will win,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are states where he\u2019s within five or 10 [percentage points], where traditionally there\u2019s been a much wider gap. I\u2019d say we think there are more like 15 battleground states. I think he\u2019s doing extremely well in New Jersey, better than most Republicans have done. And I think he can win New Jersey. Obviously it would be an extraordinary thing if he won California or New York \u2014 if he could win either of those, the election would be over. Donald\u2019s appeal is so widespread that there is tremendous crossover potential like never before.\u201dOf late, the Trump campaign has taken steps to demonstrate that it knows the difference between a 17-candidate primary brawl and a general-election contest. It has added pollsters, communications advisers, Teleprompters and, in Mike Pence, a reassuringly predictable running mate. But his operation remains not just small but devoid of traditional campaign hierarchy. Although Paul Manafort has cemented his role as the campaign\u2019s primary strategist, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner maintains an ad hoc portfolio \u2014 de facto adviser, speechwriter and gatekeeper \u2014 that is as broad as his political experience is limited. For more than a month now, the Trump operation has lacked an actual campaign manager, and a senior adviser says that there are no plans to replace the previous one, Corey Lewandowski. Trump receives advice from Manafort and Kushner, but also occasionally from media personalities, and at times seems to give equal weight to all of them.When I spoke to Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, on the phone just after he landed in Philadelphia to attend this week\u2019s Democratic convention, he seemed confident that Trump\u2019s operation was too small to succeed. \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t follow him on Twitter, you\u2019re missing one of the best tech lessons of a generation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just won an entire primary based on social media. But organization matters. The average swing voter needs to be touched eight to 10 times, and swing voters aren\u2019t on Twitter. Republicans have lost five of the last six presidential elections, and the one they won\u201d \u2014 2004 \u2014 \u201cwas because they built a machine and blew out the roof on turnout.\u201dRobert Draper is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets, Even in Turmoil, Have a Place in a Portfolio", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOver the last five years, investors in emerging-markets mutual funds have paid plenty and gotten little in return.Emerging-markets funds lost an annualized average of 3.19 percent over the last five years, Morningstar said. Yet they are far more expensive, on average, than actively managed domestic large-cap funds, which returned about 10 percent a year annualized for the same period. Expense ratios for actively managed emerging-market funds were 1.55 percent, compared with 1.15 percent for domestic large-caps.Investors have responded by fleeing emerging markets; money is churning out of the sector\u2019s funds and E.T.F.s. Total net outflows hit a new high in 2015, when nearly $75 billion exited, according to EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass. Through June this year, $7 billion more has been withdrawn.The exodus is understandable, given both the returns and the worrisome headlines streaming in from around the globe. Just last month, the British referendum to leave the European Union roiled markets worldwide. MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index fell as much as the British-focused FTSE 100 in the days just after the ballots were counted. The vote was an additional bedevilment for emerging markets already made skittish by slower growth in China \u2014 some commentators fret about a real estate bubble and banking crisis there \u2014 and a political crisis in Brazil. On top of that, low prices for commodities, especially oil, sapped stock markets in places dependent on natural resources, like Russia, South America and the Middle East.The turmoil is a turnabout from just a few years ago. Then the acronym \u201cBRIC\u201d \u2014 for Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 was bandied about in investment circles as shorthand for the rise of a brash new bunch of economic powers. Lately, BRIC has become a four-letter epithet.The reaction of emerging markets to the British vote has also underscored a new reality for investors: Emerging markets no longer provide the diversification benefit they once did, said Roger A. Aliaga-D\u00edaz, senior economist with Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cCorrelations have increased since the 2000s between emerging markets and developed ones,\u201d Mr. Aliaga-D\u00edaz said.During the surge of the 2000s, one of the attractions of emerging markets was that they tended to zig when the developed world zagged. They could buffer the ups and downs of developed markets in a diversified portfolio. To a greater extent these days, developing and developed markets have tended to move together.Portfolio managers of emerging-markets funds say today\u2019s worries, like yesterday\u2019s euphoria, may be exaggerated.Even so, many emerging countries remain healthier than developed ones, with higher growth rates and lower debt levels, she said. And many of them have young, growing populations striving to join the world\u2019s middle class.That slowdown has caused worldwide commodity prices to sag. When China was investing heavily in infrastructure and industrialization, commodity producers thrived; now they\u2019re pinched.The emerging-markets sector is split by the debate over active management versus indexing just as every sector is.For the most part, the higher costs for active management haven\u2019t translated into better performance, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. Based on trailing returns, two-thirds of emerging markets funds underperformed S.&P.\u2019s emerging-markets index over the one, three and five years ending in December 2015, he said. \u201cOn the positive side, that means one out of three did outperform,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s some value to active management, but the cheaper your actively managed fund can be, the better,\u201d he said.Costs aside, Patricia Oey, a senior analyst for Morningstar, said that active funds aren\u2019t locked into the country allocations required by index funds. Both the Vanguard and iShares funds, for example, allocate about a quarter of their assets to Chinese stocks. That amount could grow in coming years, because China\u2019s domestic A-share market is opening to foreign investors, she said. Given the heft of China\u2019s economy \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest, after the United States \u2014 index providers might opt to include more Chinese companies.A way in which some emerging-markets managers avoid overexposure to any particular country is by also investing in developed-world multinationals that sell into the emerging world.\u201cIn my view, those aren\u2019t run for shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re run for the state,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather invest in an A. O. Smith, a U.S. company that makes water heaters. About a third of their revenue is from emerging markets, particularly India and China.\u201dJust as portfolio managers damp risk by diversifying, individual investors can do the same with their personal portfolios. Ms. Oey of Morningstar said holding 10 percent of a stock portfolio, mirroring the proportion of emerging markets in the world\u2019s stock market capitalization, would make sense for a long-term investor. A person with 60 percent of her money in stocks would then put 6 percent in emerging markets.Whatever else investors do, they should guard against the tendency to dump their holdings based on recent discouraging news or weak returns, Professor Harvey said. \u201cThe biggest mistake retail investors make is selling stocks if they go down and buying the ones that have gone up,\u201d he said.\u201cThis holds true for asset classes, too,\u201d he added. \u201cJust because emerging-markets equity has had low returns recently does not mean you should sell. One-third of world G.D.P. is being driven by emerging-market economies, and it makes sense that a globally diversified portfolio should have exposure to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Yahoo Ruled the Valley: Stories of the Original \u2018Surfers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported bySUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Back in the mid-1990s, before Google even existed, the world\u2019s best guides to the internet sat in Silicon Valley cubicles, visiting websites and carefully categorizing them by hand.They were called surfers, and they were a collection of mostly 20-somethings \u2014 including a yoga lover, an ex-banker, a divinity student, a recent college grad from Ohio hungry for adventure \u2014 all hired by a start-up called Yahoo to build a directory of the world\u2019s most interesting websites.Today, with more than one billion websites across the globe, the very notion seems mad. Even then, there was a hint of insanity about the enterprise.Two decades after Yahoo\u2019s founding \u2014 the equivalent of several lifetimes in Silicon Valley \u2014 Elvis still serenades the surfers at the headquarters here in Sunnyvale, and Yahoo is at a crossroads. The company, long since eclipsed by Google and Facebook, now commands just a tiny fraction of people\u2019s attention and advertisers\u2019 dollars.Yahoo is auctioning itself off. Bids are due on Monday, the same day the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is expected to report yet another quarter of dismal financial results.Most, but not all, of the surfers have scattered across Silicon Valley and the world. The careers of some followed the arc of the tech world\u2019s obsessions and idiosyncrasies over the last 20 years. Others took their stock windfalls and dropped out to pursue other passions. Taken together, the surfers, about 10 of whom are still in the building, embody the technological and cultural changes that transformed the valley and the world \u2014 and left Yahoo in the dust.Back in 1994, when the directory was born, search engines were rudimentary and ineffectual. Newbies were just learning how to navigate the World Wide Web. The very idea of a website was novel.Two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, saw opportunity. Working from a trailer on campus, they began compiling websites into a list, organized by topic. They eventually named it Yahoo, an acronym for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.It quickly became one of the most important gateways to the web. The value proposition was simple, said one longtime surfer, Dave Sikula: \u201cWe\u2019ve done the work for you \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through the web and these are the best sites.\u201dThat required an army of people, said Srinija Srinivasan, employee No. 5 at Yahoo, who was hired to build the original surfer team.It was serious work, deciding how to label things and where to put them. What do you call a category that includes skinheads and the Ku Klux Klan? What kind of pornography should be considered for inclusion, given that \u201csex\u201d was the most popular search term from the start?Much was left to individual judgment. Matthew Mustapick, who quit a job at Wells Fargo to become a surfer in 1995, recalled creating the \u201ccannibalism\u201d category. He found sites explaining how to butcher a human body but decided they were too distasteful to include.Amey Mathews, who worked as a Yahoo surfer from 1998 to 2002 (and is now married to Mr. Mustapick), discovered in the course of her work that the Irish originally carved their jack-o\u2019-lanterns from turnips, not pumpkins. After that, the surfers held a turnip-carving contest every Halloween.The directory survived until 2014. But by then, most of the surfers\u2019 time already went to other projects. Many of them worked to improve Yahoo\u2019s search engine as it battled with Alphabet\u2019s Google subsidiary. Still, Yahoo\u2019s star continued to fade, particularly with the rise of smartphones and social applications like Facebook and Twitter.Today, some former surfers ponder the company\u2019s fate with sadness and a hint of regret at opportunities missed. \u201cYahoo Mail is still my primary email. My home page is still My Yahoo. I still look at the sports page,\u201d said Mr. Sikula, who is a stage director and freelance editor after being laid off in 2010 as part of a big surfer cutback.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know why the company exists. And I think that\u2019s what they are trying to figure out, too.\u201dIf she hadn\u2019t chosen to study Japanese at Stanford, Srinija Srinivasan would never have found herself in charge of building Yahoo\u2019s directory into a guide to the internet for a curious world.Ms. Srinivasan, who grew up in Kansas, was an undergraduate attending a tech-focused Stanford program in Kyoto, Japan, when she got to know two fellow students over shared meals \u2014 Jerry Yang and David Filo. After graduation, she was working on the Cyc Project, an early effort to create artificial intelligence, when the pair asked her to help them turn their directory into a real company.\u201cJerry and David knew that I alphabetized my CDs,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan, 44, said in an interview in her Palo Alto, Calif., home. \u201cMy sock drawer is quite beautiful.\u201dWhen she joined, her business card read Ontological Yahoo, a term reflecting her philosophical approach to the job. \u201cThis is not a perfunctory file-keeping exercise. This is defining the nature of being,\u201d she said. \u201cCategories and classifications are the basis for each of our worldviews. \u201dFaced with the vastness of the web, Yahoo surfers hoped to identify the most complete, relevant or interesting sites on a given subject. To choose which topics to focus on, the surfers relied in part on a daily log of visitors\u2019 top queries.Once in a while, surfers made mistakes. For instance, they initially categorized Messianic Judaism as a Jewish sect, failing to notice that its adherents, who follow many Jewish traditions, believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, a defining trait of Christians. \u201cWe had faxes coming in nonstop from rabbis,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said.Yahoo also offered automated search tools by teaming up with various companies, including AltaVista and Google. Eventually, though, Yahoo realized that it had to develop its own version of the technology.Human judgment \u2014 what Mr. Yang referred to as \u201cthe voice of Yahoo\u201d \u2014 remained a core value of the company. When the Grateful Dead musician Jerry Garcia died in August 1995, Yahoo searches on him spiked immediately. The surfers put a Garcia link on the home page. \u201cThat was the birth of Yahoo News,\u201d Ms. Srinivasan said. Today, it remains one of the most popular online news portals.The surfers\u2019 role as corporate conscience expanded with the company. They worked on a child-safe version of Yahoo, called Yahooligans. They selected the news headlines worthy of home-page display. Over time, Ms. Srinivasan and her team even fielded questions like how much cleavage to allow on home-page ads.Despite its efforts, Yahoo kept losing ground to Google in search. Microsoft made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy the weakened company in 2008. Ms. Srinivasan left two years later, soon after Mr. Yang stepped down as chief executive. \u201cIn Japan, they have a saying: Leave when the cherry blossoms are full,\u201d she said.She also sits on the board of trustees of her alma mater, Stanford, a school that has churned out several generations of Silicon Valley moguls. But unlike many former technology executives, Ms. Srinivasan focuses her attention there on the arts and humanities.\u201cTech is sexy. It\u2019s employable. Parents love it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that isn\u2019t worth a hill of beans unless we know why, to what end. We call it the humanities for a reason.\u201dYahoo, like the early web itself, was largely focused on American content. But it had global ambitions. Seana Meek, an Alberta native and a single mother, was working for Futurekids, which taught children computer basics, when Yahoo hired her to organize the Canadian sites in its directory.For Ms. Meek personally, it kicked off a 20-year career odyssey through modern Silicon Valley and some of the tech industry\u2019s most significant trends: e-commerce, virtual reality, fraud-fighting \u2014 even a mobile haircut app.When she started, Yahoo was fumbling in Canada. Technically, it had a separate Canada site, but it relied on the American directory for its searches.Employees asked her why the most popular search term among Canadian users was the word Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mystery,\u201d Ms. Meek, 41, recalled saying. \u201cIn Canada, you do \u2018government\u2019 and you get American results. So you do \u2018government Canada.\u2019 You do anything and then you add \u2018Canada\u2019 to it.\u201dAfter the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Yahoo\u2019s dysfunctions began to surface. In 2002, the company transferred Ms. Meek\u2019s job to Toronto. Less than 90 days later, it closed that office and sent her and two engineers back to the American headquarters.She got a promotion from the mess: Yahoo put her in charge of the content, ads and business deals for Yahoo Canada. She was nicknamed Captain Canada and had a ringside seat to one of the company\u2019s biggest decisions \u2014 dumping Google as a search partner and switching to technology from its Inktomi acquisition instead. \u201cThey were scared to do it. So they did it in Canada first,\u201d she said.In 2008, she left the company, embarking on a journey through Silicon Valley\u2019s laboratory of business ideas, big and small. First she joined a tiny start-up, Picateers, that was trying to reinvent the school portrait business. It folded a year later.From there she went to Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life, the tech industry\u2019s first big foray into virtual reality. Players interacted with one another online in a 3-D simulated world, where they could buy and sell things, make friends, or just gawk at the scenery.Second Life was an extraordinary experiment in human behavior, she said. An employee could change something in the virtual world, then just watch what happened. \u201cYou are literally a god,\u201d she said.Next for her was Eventbrite, an online event-planning and ticketing company. There she worked to protect against credit card fraud.And she says, she is casting about for the next challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny time in my life where there is definitely no script,\u201d she said.Working long hours in close quarters, it was inevitable that some surfers would find romance.For Matthew Mustapick and Amey Mathews, working at Yahoo didn\u2019t just lead to love. The lessons they learned \u2014 and the money they made from the stock they received as early employees \u2014 allowed them to achieve a different kind of Silicon Valley dream: dropping out of tech to do their own thing.Ms. Mathews, who had a fine arts degree from Stanford, joined in 1998 after responding to an ad looking for a speaker of Scandinavian languages. \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t speak any Scandinavian languages \u2014 but I speak Italian and you should have someone who speaks Italian,\u201d she recalled during an interview at the couple\u2019s home in Soquel, Calif.Yahoo had an Italian speaker already, but she got a job anyway. Mr. Mustapick sat in a nearby cubicle, and they eventually became a couple.Surfers were free to reflect their personal interests in the directory. Ms. Mathews loved animals and indexed all the dogs, cattle, even miniature donkeys, she could find. Mr. Mustapick was fond of cataloging oddities like prosthetic testicles for pets that had been neutered.Mr. Mustapick left Yahoo in early 2002. Ms. Mathews followed later that year.\u201cI could afford to lose money for a whole year when no one came to my class,\u201d she said.Mr. Mustapick turned toward music. \u201cI always wanted to learn how to play electric guitar like Scott Henderson,\u201d he said, referring to the jazz and blues guitarist. That interest led him in an unexpected direction \u2014 he began building acoustic guitars with an eye toward selling them.Having looked at hundreds of thousands of websites while at Yahoo, he had a good sense of how to market online, well before the era of Twitter and self-promotion as a national pastime. He built a website and posted photos of guitars he was building so customers could watch the progress.And he consciously befriended the right people. \u201cThey just put the word out for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the sort of thing I learned at Yahoo that you could do.\u201dStill, she remembers Yahoo fondly. \u201cI loved being around that many smart, interesting, engaged people,\u201d she said. \u201cI actively miss that in my daily life \u2014 not enough to go get a job and give up what I\u2019m doing, but I do miss it.\u201dNine years ago, Gordon Hurd quit Yahoo for the second time. In June, he began working for the company again \u2014 Round 3 \u2014 this time as a freelance writer.In the intervening years, Mr. Hurd toured the struggling new-media landscape \u2014 first, the Yahoo archrival AOL; then, Interactive One, a network of black news and culture sites; later, First Look Media, created by the eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar; and most recently, a men\u2019s fashion site, Man\u2019s Life. There was even a brief stint at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm and \u201cthe most corporate place you could go,\u201d he said.Mr. Hurd\u2019s first run with Yahoo started in 1998 when he was hired to organize the business and finance parts of the directory. The starting pay was only $35,000 a year, he recalled. But there were stock options.\u201cI didn\u2019t make millions by any means,\u201d said Mr. Hurd, 45, in a phone interview from Brooklyn, where he lives. But he bought a house.A restless soul, he left Yahoo in 2002 to become an investigative reporter for a local magazine. Less than a year later, with a second child on the way, Mr. Hurd returned to Yahoo, eventually helping run the influential home page.In 2007, he hopped to McKinsey and then quickly to AOL, where he ran Asylum.com, a lifestyle site aimed at men age 18 to 34. The business model was to create vast amounts of content in the hope that visitors would click on ads.That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWhat it underlined is how much of a commodity content was,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. Asylum was shut down.Mr. Hurd moved on to Interactive One, the digital arm of Radio One, the largest black-owned radio broadcaster in the United States, which struggled to crack the content code, too. Volume trumped quality. \u201cYou know people will click on a subway-fight video, but you want to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a millennial of color,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.Which is how, today, Mr. Hurd is back at Yahoo, writing articles for its style site while he ponders his next move.More than ever, he thinks there is a need for the type of work that Yahoo\u2019s surfers did 20 years ago. \u201cThe web has gotten so big that you need people to curate it,\u201d he said.However, he sees that curation coming from subject experts, not mass-audience sites like Yahoo. Niche sites with a devoted following could work with select sponsors hoping to reach a particular audience, he said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019s really dedicated to the art of handmade knives, and you set out to categorize the sites of handmade knives, only you can do that. Google can never do that,\u201d Mr. Hurd said.When Becky Uline graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio in 1996, she didn\u2019t really know what she wanted to do with her life. A friend was raving that he had discovered paradise \u2014 living in Northern California and working for a company few people had ever heard of, Yahoo.She and another Bowling Green graduate, Michelle Heimburger, thought it would be a grand adventure. They both got hired as surfers and rented an apartment together.The building was so empty at first that surfers would zip through it on in-line skates. \u201cWe would sleep under our desks,\u201d Ms. Uline, 42, recalled during an interview at her current home in Oakland, Calif.In 2001, Ms. Uline gave her notice. She wanted to travel the world, financed in part by her Yahoo nest egg.Paris became a favorite haunt. \u201cI would sublet my apartment out for a few months and just go and work from wherever,\u201d she said. She freelanced for Yahoo and also tapped the vast network of surfer alumni, landing work at the visual-search start-up SearchMe and elsewhere.Yahoo\u2019s decline is sad, Ms. Uline said, but she still feels a connection. Her closest friends are former Yahoos, including Ms. Heimburger, who married yet another surfer and lives in London.A few months ago, Ms. Uline, said, she dropped Yahoo as her home page, but she missed it and changed it back. \u201cI still use Yahoo search. I want them to get the revenue,\u201d she said.When Yahoo set out to hire surfers, it invented a new job category. The closest match may have been bookstore clerk \u2014 and Kepler\u2019s Books in nearby Menlo Park turned into a recruitment hotbed. About a dozen surfers were hired away from the shop, including ConnieAlice Hungate.Ms. Hungate, 46, is still at Yahoo more than 18 years later, supervising what remains of the surfer team.

{"Headline": "A Remote Pacific Nation, Threatened by Rising Seas", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of the people of tiny Kiribati, and even the island nation\u2019s existence. The government is making plans for the island\u2019s demise.Supported byTARAWA, Kiribati \u2014 One clear bright day last winter, a tidal surge swept over an ocean embankment here in the remote, low-lying island country of Kiribati, smashing through the doors and windows of Betio Hospital and spewing sand and debris across its maternity ward.Beero Hosea, 37, a handyman, cut the power and helped carry frightened mothers through the rubble and water to a nearby school.\u201cIf the next one is combined with a storm and stronger winds, that\u2019s the end of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cover this whole island.\u201dFor years, scientists have been predicting that much of Kiribati may become uninhabitable within decades because of an onslaught of environmental problems linked to climate change. And for just as long, many here have paid little heed. But while scientists are reluctant to attribute any specific weather or tidal event to rising sea levels, the tidal surge last winter, known as a king tide, was a chilling wake-up call.\u201cIt shocked us,\u201d said Tean Rube, a pastor with the Kiribati Uniting Church. \u201cWe realized, O.K., maybe climate change is real.\u201dEven before that, scientists and development experts say, rising sea levels are likely to worsen erosion, create groundwater shortages and increase the intrusion of salt water into freshwater supplies.In response, Kiribati (pronounced KEE-ree-bas in the local language) has essentially been drawing up plans for its demise. The government has promoted \u201cmigration with dignity,\u201d urging residents to consider moving abroad with employable skills. It bought nearly 6,000 acres in Fiji, an island nation more than 1,000 miles away, as a potential refuge. Fiji\u2019s higher elevation and more stable shoreline make it less vulnerable.Anote Tong, a former president who pushed through the Fiji purchase, said it was also intended as a cry for attention from the world. \u201cThe issue of climate change is real, serious, and we\u2019d like to do something about it if they\u2019re going to take their time about it,\u201d he said in a recent interview.But packing up an entire country is not easy, and may not be possible. And many Kiribati residents remain skeptical of the need to prepare for an eventuality that may be decades away.The skeptics include the rural and less educated residents of the outer islands who doubt they could obtain the skills needed to survive overseas, and Christians who put more faith in God\u2019s protection than in climate models. \u201cAccording to their biblical belief, we\u2019re not going to sink because God is the only person who decides the fate of any country,\u201d said Rikamati Naare, the news editor at Radio Kiribati, the state-run broadcaster.As President Tong became a climate-change celebrity, invited to speak at conferences around the world, opponents accused him of ignoring problems back home, such as high unemployment and infant mortality. They derided the Fiji purchase, for nearly $7 million, as a boondoggle; dismissed his \u201cmigration with dignity\u201d as a contradiction in terms; and called his talk of rising sea levels alarmist and an affront to divine will.Mr. Tong, having served three terms, was not allowed to run for re-election this year, but in March elections the opposition defeated his party. The new president, Taneti Maamau, said he planned to shift priorities.\u201cMost of our resources are now diverted to climate-change-related development, but in fact there are also bigger issues, like population, the health of the people, the education of the people,\u201d he said during an interview at Parliament, which sits on reclaimed land at the edge of a turquoise lagoon.\u201cClimate change is a serious issue, but you can\u2019t do very much about it, especially if a big hurricane comes,\u201d he added with a hearty laugh.The Fiji purchase was not the first effort to address Kiribati\u2019s perilous future. The World Bank-led Kiribati Adaptation Program, begun in 2003, developed water-management plans, built coastal sea walls, planted mangroves and installed rainwater-harvesting systems. The bank says the project, which cost $17.7 million, has conserved fresh water in Tarawa and protected about one mile of Kiribati\u2019s 710 miles of coastline.\u201cAdaptation is just this long, ugly, hard slog,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Simon Donner, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cThe idea that an outside organization can just come in with money, expertise and ideas and implement something easily is na\u00efve. What you need is consistent, long-term funding \u2014 the type of stuff that\u2019s hard to pull off with development aid.\u201dDenis Jean-Jacques Jordy, a senior environmental specialist at the World Bank, acknowledged that \u201cwe had some issues\u201d with the first sea walls but said subsequent ones made of rock were better designed.There is no shortage of ideas to avert Kiribati\u2019s environmental fate. China\u2019s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea shows the promise of sophisticated island-engineering technology, experts say. Mr. Tong commissioned a study on raising Kiribati\u2019s coastline.But such measures are financially unrealistic for a resource-poor, aid-dependent country like Kiribati. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the place going underwater,\u201d Professor Donner said, noting that some of Kiribati\u2019s islands had actually grown in recent years because of land reclamation or natural coastal dynamics. \u201cIt\u2019s about it becoming prohibitively expensive to live in. That\u2019s the real challenge for Kiribati.\u201dThe parallel freshwater crisis is also fixable, at a cost. Clean drinking water is already scarce on several islands, and saltwater from high ocean tides has infiltrated some wells. Many residents of South Tarawa, home to half the country\u2019s people, now get their drinking water exclusively from rainwater tanks. Experts worry that as sea levels rise, Kiribati\u2019s fragile groundwater supply will face even greater risks, while the next drought could quickly exhaust the municipal supply and household rainwater tanks. Kiribati could invest in desalinization equipment or ship in drinking water, but this is a country with only one paved road.\u201cIt\u2019s all doable,\u201d said Doug Ramsay, the Pacific Rim manager at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a very expensive exercise.\u201dAnother novel response gaining attention lately is the idea of applying international refugee law \u2014 largely drafted after World War II to protect people fleeing political, religious or racial persecution \u2014 to those forced from their homes because of climate change.In 2012, a migrant worker from Kiribati, Ioane Teitiota, applied for asylum in New Zealand, arguing that he was unable to grow food or find potable water in Kiribati because of saltwater intrusion. His lawyer, Michael Kidd, said the distinction between environmental and political refugees was arbitrary. \u201cYou\u2019re either a refugee or you\u2019re not,\u201d he said in an interview.The courts rejected the argument, and Mr. Teitiota was deported from New Zealand last year. Mr. Kidd said he had appealed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Still, migration may become increasingly important. Mr. Tong said he hoped to prepare his people to move with job-training programs that would meet standards recognized in Australia and New Zealand.\u201cThe science of climate change is not 100 percent precise,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut we know without any argument that, in time, our people will have to relocate unless there are very, very significant resources committed to maintain the integrity of the land.\u201dCoastal threats are increasingly clear to residents of Buariki, an oceanside village of thatched-roof huts and towering coconut palms on the island of North Tarawa. Erosion along the beach has already toppled dozens of coconut trees. The World Bank estimates that 18 to 80 percent of the village, which sits on a peninsula not more than a few hundred feet wide, may be underwater by 2050.Some villagers said they were resigned to leaving. \u201cOur government already has land in Fiji for the Kiribati people, so if there are more high tides here, they\u2019ll bring people to live there,\u201d said Kourabi Ngauea, 29. \u201cBut it depends on the government, and if they can support us.\u201dOthers see no need to leave. \u201cThis is where I belong,\u201d Aroita Tokamaen, 76, said as she peeled a coconut on her patio. \u201cI would rather stay.\u201dThe tide that damaged the hospital here last winter was an exceptionally strong king tide, a surge that occurs twice a year when the moon is closest to the Earth. The waves also flooded the thatched-roofed outdoor meeting space of the local branch of the Kiribati Uniting Church.While some people were alarmed, the pastor, Ms. Rube, said she refused to accept the idea that Kiribati could disappear.\u201cWe are Christians,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t believe that God could have given us this world and then take it away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as a wealthy financier suddenly thrust onto one of the world\u2019s biggest stages, he is quickly confronting the scrutiny that accompanies the modern political power couple.The news had barely broken that Ms. May was taking office when headlines questioning a possible conflict of interest blared in the news media.For now, the optics of the criticism appear to outweigh the substance.Mr. May, a sunny man with a penchant for tailored pinstripe suits and brogues, does not run a rabble-rousing hedge fund that takes major stakes in companies and aggressively demands change from management. His employer is not a big bank that was bailed out by the government. He is not a high-flying, fast-moving trader.The new first man of Britain works at a low-key American investment firm as a client-relationship manager. He no longer invests money, but acts as a go-between with the firm\u2019s clients.Conjugal scrutiny is certainly to be expected, especially when there is the appearance of possible conflict.So far, the handful of dirt thrown at Mr. May has not stuck. The most damning comment to emerge in British news media from colleagues about Mr. May is that he is a fairly \u201chead-down\u201d type of guy, a politically quiet man who is happy to take a back seat.If anything, he has invited comparisons to Sir Denis Thatcher, the low-key husband of Margaret Thatcher, Britain\u2019s first female prime minister. Mr. Thatcher played a supporting role to the Iron Lady\u2019s career in the spotlight, and famously stated that a partner should \u201calways be present, never there.\u201d Mrs. Thatcher said that being prime minister had been a lonely job, but \u201cwith Denis there, I was never alone.\u201dMr. May has stuck with his wife through rough times, including the loss of her parents soon after they were married. Ever since the pair met at Oxford, at a Conservative Party disco, he has quietly supported her as they both rose early in careers in the financial world.He was by her side as Ms. May pivoted into British politics 13 years ago, first getting elected to Parliament and eventually serving for six years in the difficult cabinet post of home secretary, overseeing the nation\u2019s domestic security and immigration agencies. She has described him as her \u201crock.\u201dMr. May earned a reputation as an astute stock picker in the late 1990s when he ran pension funds for Prudential Portfolio Managers. He eventually moved to Capital Group in 2005, where he veered away from the money managing business and put his skills as a people person to use managing client relationships.As the new first gentleman, Mr. May will be scrutinized as never before, whether for his financial ventures or his sartorial choices. He can only hope the type of coverage likely to emerge in the British news media will be more along the lines of a headline that recently appeared Wednesday in the newspaper Metro right after Ms. May took office.\u201cTheresa May\u2019s husband steals the show in sexy navy suit as he starts new life as First Man,\u201d the headline read.\u201cOh,\u201d the article continued. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget those shoes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Interest Rates Dropping, Is Now the Time to Refinance?", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byMortgagesBut figuring out whether it makes sense for you requires considering a number of factors. \u201cThe key question is, how long am I going to be in the home?\u201d said Erin Lantz, the vice president of mortgages for Zillow. \u201cAm I confident that I am going to hold the mortgage longer than it takes for me to cover my closing costs?\u201dThis time around, Mr. Vendig said, they lowered their rate by nearly a full percentage point by refinancing into a 10/1 adjustable-rate mortgage: For the first 10 years, their rate is fixed at 3.125 percent, and then it shifts to a variable rate that adjusts annually. This structure made sense for them, because with two children, ages 2 and 5, they expect to outgrow their 2,100-square-foot space and move to a bigger home well before a decade is up. And the savings generated by the transaction will offset their closing costs \u2014 which were somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000, he said \u2014 within two years.\u201cWe definitely could have done a 5/1 or 7/1 ARM,\u201d Mr. Vendig said. \u201cBut we felt more comfortable with giving ourselves a couple more years to make an educated decision\u201d about where to move.Ms. Hanenkamp said she felt more comfortable sticking with a longer-term loan with a lower monthly payment because she has no plans to move \u2014 she married last year and is perfectly happy where she is \u2014 and wants the peace of mind of knowing she can cover her mortgage. And in any case, she added, \u201cif I have extra money, I can always apply it to the principal\u201d as an extra payment.Refinancing a co-op is less expensive than refinancing other kinds of residential property, Mr. Roth pointed out: Because co-ops are not classified as real property, some closing costs like title insurance do not apply. Still, borrowers may be limited in what they can do. \u201cSome co-ops may only allow fixed-rate products, or they may have very tight guidelines when it comes to cash-out and maximum LTVs,\u201d he said, referring to the loan-to-value, or the percentage of the property that is mortgaged.Another condition specific to New Yorkers: Homeowners may seek an exemption from the state\u2019s hefty mortgage recording tax when refinancing an existing mortgage, since they already paid it once. (Co-op owners do not have to pay the tax at all.) But if they are switching lenders, they must request that the existing lender assign, or transfer, the mortgage to the new lender through what is called a Consolidation, Extension and Modification Agreement (CEMA).Now, working with Mr. Prom of HomeBridge Financial Services, Mr. Tillu, the chief financial officer for an importer and manufacturer of home goods, is refinancing into a 15-year loan at the far better rate of 3.37 percent. \u201cI may pay $150 to $200 more a month, but because the property is fetching me good revenue, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Mr. Tillu, who is hoping to close on the loan in the next week or so. \u201cWith John\u2019s help, I\u2019m saving a lot in interest and cutting down the number of years.\u201dHe estimates that it will take him five or six years to cover his closing costs, but that\u2019s fine, he said, because he has no intention of selling.One way or the other, borrowers should be prepared for a rigorous review process. Given the tighter mortgage regulations since the recession and lenders\u2019 fairly conservative underwriting standards, \u201ceverything\u2019s much more difficult\u201d than it once was, Mr. Prom said. \u201cThe amount of data you need to get people closed is crazy in terms of what\u2019s required.\u201dMr. Shnayder, of Citizens Bank, also said that the documentation requirements can go \u201coverboard.\u201d But borrowers can avoid running into problems by seeking out an experienced mortgage professional who will foresee potential pitfalls and work around them, he said.Mr. Tillu said his lender did require extensive documentation, though he was able to supply it easily in digital format. As for the inconvenience, he regards it as similar to putting up with security checks at the airport. If tighter rules mean a more secure and stable financial system, he said, he\u2019s not going to complain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Are Charged in Hollywood-Style Bank Burglaries in New York", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byIt seemed like something out of a big-budget heist movie.Blowtorches were used to cut holes through the roofs of two bank branches in Brooklyn and Queens this spring. Ladders were lowered into the bank vaults, allowing the burglars to have their way with safe deposit boxes.Oxygen and acetylene tanks were found on the roofs. At the Queens bank, the investigators also found a grinding wheel, a tool to cut through steel or concrete.In all, the burglars made off with about $5 million in cash and valuables from the two banks.And then the three men returned to their lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn \u2014 seemingly unaware that they were already under surveillance.\u201cThis is some of the best investigative work I\u2019ve seen,\u201d William J.

Mr. Mazzara even went to a Home Depot store in Brooklyn, where he bought four sheets of plywood and a tarp, which the men used to build on top of one bank a small structure that shielded them from view as they bored through the roof.\u201cBy the time the bank reopened on Monday,\u201d Mr. Bharara said, \u201cthe men were long gone, leaving a jagged hole in the bank\u2019s roof and many victims in their wake.\u201dBut as carefully as their crimes were planned, they were also painstakingly investigated, according to law enforcement officials and a criminal complaint unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Over the past several years, the police and federal agents have been investigating a pattern of bank burglaries where the buildings were broken into via roofs or walls. As part of that investigation, a surveillance camera was mounted on a pole outside the Brooklyn residence where two of the men, Mr. Mazzara and Mr. Kerrigan, reside.The surveillance camera enabled law enforcement to compare images taken at the banks with those taken by the house.All three men were each charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of bank burglary; Mr. Mazzara and Mr. Kerrigan were also charged with a second bank burglary count.Mr. Mazzara\u2019s lawyer, Sanford Talkin, said his client \u201cdenies the charges and maintains his innocence.\u201d Mr. Kerrigan\u2019s lawyer, James Froccaro Jr., said of his client, \u201cHe\u2019s not guilty and plans on being vindicated at trial.\u201d Jonathan Marvinny, the lawyer for Mr. Mascuzzio, who was held without bond, had no comment. Mr. Mazzara and Mr. Kerrigan were detained pending satisfaction of various bail conditions.In announcing the bank charges on Tuesday, Mr. Bharara said that search warrants had been executed at seven locations and that the authorities hoped to be able to recover some of the stolen items and money, which would in hopes it can be returned to the proper owners.

{"Headline": "Yahoo and the Online Universe According to Verizon", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStill, there is a surprisingly ambitious, and risky, unifying theme hidden in the oddball assortment of websites and internet services that Verizon has acquired over the last year or so: The company is rethinking who its customer actually is.It is imagining a future when its most important client may not be a mother signing up for a family cellphone plan in the Verizon store. Instead, the customer will be corporations \u2014 advertisers \u2014 that want to reach that family, and that are willing to pay Verizon to help them do so.\u201cTheir goal is not to appeal to users in a different way,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIt\u2019s to appeal to advertisers in a different way.\u201dAlready, it is drawing Verizon into new controversies around privacy and net neutrality.But executives prefer to emphasize other aspects of their idea. They talk up how Verizon\u2019s existing assets \u2014 phone and data networks that knit together the nation \u2014 might be paired with its new media properties, which include The Huffington Post and Style Me Pretty, a website \u201cfor the modern bride.\u201dLocation information from wireless customers could mean better geolocated ads for smartphone users. National Football League games licensed for viewing on smartphones might be streamed on Yahoo sites as well \u2014 all in the service of selling ads. Taken together, Yahoo, AOL and Verizon\u2019s other websites still reach more than a billion users a month, a significant number even in Silicon Valley.And Verizon is eager to change the narrative.Picketers massed outside Verizon stores. Workers held a candlelight vigil at the home of Verizon\u2019s chief executive. Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d The Labor secretary finally brokered a truce.Everything about the old-school street fight was at odds with the kind of company Verizon has been spending billions of dollars trying to become.Yet change will come slowly for a company as big as Verizon. Valued at roughly $225 billion, Verizon is one of the 15 largest companies in the country by sales. Annual revenues exceed $130 billion and the work force is 160,000. Verizon is now the biggest wireless company in the country, selling voice and data plans to roughly one in three Americans.That is more precarious than it might sound. While Verizon is still adding wireless customers, its sales are no longer growing. Price wars with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile have limited how much Verizon can charge. This week, the company reported a rare decline in quarterly revenues. Profits were down too, hurt by the strike.This dynamic is unlikely to change soon. If Verizon remains a traditional telecommunications company, it is likely to face years of eroding sales and slumping profits.That\u2019s why Lowell McAdam, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, is trying to buy his way into the plump and growing market for digital advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s empire retention,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.If Verizon has its way, it will cast off its reputation as a big, boring telephone company battling a unionized work force and emerge as a digital media player mentioned in the same breath as Snapchat and Pok\u00e9mon.It\u2019s quite the pivot. At first glance, the acquisitions have almost nothing to do with Verizon\u2019s main moneymaking activity \u2014 selling data plans to its roughly 110 million cellphone customers.\u201cThere\u2019s not really any synergy between Verizon\u2019s core business and the AOL and Yahoo play,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.Yet even before it scooped up AOL and Yahoo, Verizon set about trying to remake itself. In recent years, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on deals.Some have been successful. EdgeCast and UpLynk, companies that serve video content and video advertising, still have growing revenues.A decade ago Verizon launched Fios, an expensive landline cable television and internet service. In doing so, it was taking on established cable giants like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Today, Fios has gained 5.5 million customers, and the business brings in about $10 billion a year.But other new ventures haven\u2019t panned out. CloudSwitch and Terremark, two recent acquisitions, were meant to be the foundation for Verizon\u2019s push into cloud computing, a growing industry dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. This year, Verizon pulled back on its cloud businesses, ceding ground in one of the most lucrative new industries in computing.Whether or not Yahoo and AOL can give Mr. McAdam the growth he needs isn\u2019t clear. Though the companies aren\u2019t in the same class as Facebook and Google, they wouldn\u2019t have to improve much to start making a difference at Verizon. Even if Verizon captured just 2 percent more of the global market for digital advertising, that would add more than $3 billion to the company\u2019s annual sales.\u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new,\u201d said Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s chief executive, who will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo. \u201cPeople act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dMr. Armstrong\u2019s answer to Facebook and Google is hardly a sure thing. Verizon\u2019s forays have already landed the company in hot water.The episode left privacy watchdogs wary of how Verizon would handle user data as its reach across the web grew.\u201cThere is some concern, especially given how reluctant Verizon was to own up to the issue with the supercookies,\u201d said Jeremy Gillula, senior staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt would be one thing if they had just owned up to it.\u201dGiving advertisers access to smartphone users\u2019 data without their knowledge could also be a problem for Verizon. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for using the consumer data they have, but they have to tread a fine line,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cEven if they get a user to opt in, it doesn\u2019t take many complaints to get hauled before the F.C.C.\u201dAnd in recent months, Verizon has come under fire for possible violations of net neutrality rules. In February, it emerged that Verizon had stopped charging its wireless customers for data if they were streaming video from Go90, a Verizon-owned site, leading to scrutiny from the tech press. \u201cThis sort of clearly favoring your own content raises all sorts of net neutrality concerns,\u201d Mr. Gillula said.Yahoo has popular franchises in sports and finance, and a well-trafficked home page. AOL continues to draw users, and also serves the ads for MSN, the Microsoft portal, which still attracts visitors. Additionally, Verizon now owns the Go90 video site and AOL sites including TechCrunch, and it co-owns Complex, a men\u2019s lifestyle website.Verizon has other plans as well. Mr. Armstrong said the goal was to amass an audience of two billion by 2020, and said the company was likely to continue buying websites. He promoted location-based advertising informed by the movements of Verizon\u2019s wireless subscribers, the potential for the companies to make money off the so-called internet of things \u2014 where your dishwasher or doorbell is connected to the web \u2014 augmented and virtual reality, and connected cars.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right industry.\u201dAdvertisers, worried that Google and Facebook are effectively becoming a duopoly, might bite. \u201cWith Facebook and Google taking an estimated 78 cents of every new digital dollar spent, having a viable third option is welcome,\u201d said Joe Marchese, president of advanced ad products at Fox Networks.\u201cAdvertisers want to make it work,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interest in supporting and propping up a well-run No. 3.\u201dYet for Verizon to believe it will have an easy path is \u201cwillful optimism,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. It ignores Google and Facebook\u2019s dominance of online advertising. Together the Silicon Valley rivals control nearly half of the worldwide online ad market, generating close to $80 billion in sales. In recent days both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported healthy quarterly results, suggesting that they are only growing stronger.At the least, Verizon appears to have gotten a good deal. It paid less than $9 billion for both AOL and Yahoo. That is a relatively insignificant sum for Verizon, which takes in more than that each month. And for that price, it obtained about 1.2 billion active users that it can use to lure advertisers.And even if Verizon\u2019s push into digital media doesn\u2019t transform the company, it has finally achieved what many knew was inevitable, but no one could previously achieve: the union of AOL and Yahoo.For years, AOL and Yahoo orbited each other like two dying stars. Rumors that one would buy the other were constant. But egos, activist investors and fluctuating share prices prevented the companies from going through with the union.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of people with a lot of ideas about doing this over a long time,\u201d said Mr. Armstrong, the AOL chief. He added that he had been aware of discussions about such a deal for more than a decade.How the companies will be integrated remains to be seen. But most analysts expect Mr. Armstrong to run the combined operation.What that means for Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, isn\u2019t clear.Big personalities aside, the true test will be whether AOL, Yahoo and the growing assortment of online properties Verizon is amassing can give Mr. McAdam the revenue increase he needs to please Wall Street.So far, there appears to be reason for some hope. Though Verizon doesn\u2019t regularly break out AOL\u2019s revenue, it said this week that the unit had $713 million in sales last quarter. This suggests that Verizon has managed to lift AOL revenue modestly over the last year.Advertisement"}

Verizon is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Bankers for Yahoo cast a wide net for the auction, and a number of potential suitors emerged. The field was winnowed down to a handful of bidders, which included AT&T; private equity firms like TPG Capital; and the Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert, who has received the backing of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway.But people involved in the process long believed that Verizon, with its enormous cash pile and its ability to wring out efficiencies by merging Yahoo with AOL, was the most likely winner.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, said that combining AOL with Yahoo would create a stronger No. 3 digital platform for online advertising, after Google and Facebook.\u201cThis is a 1 plus 1 equals 2\u00bd,\u201d he said.No final deal has been reached and the talks could still falter, the person briefed on the matter cautioned. One of the other finalists in the Yahoo auction process could also re-emerge with a higher bid.Yahoo would bring in a huge amount of additional news, sports and finance content \u2014 and the one billion people a month who visit Yahoo services \u2014 and would offer Verizon another set of sophisticated ad technologies.Yahoo\u2019s BrightRoll division in particular is a leader in delivering automated, real-time advertising, and could be merged with AOL\u2019s ad technology to deliver more appealing options to marketers, particularly in video.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be anybody\u2019s first port of call,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cBut they will have a deeper set of data than anyone except Facebook and Google.\u201dThat prospect alarms privacy advocates but elates marketers.\u201cGoogle has access to me on my mobile phone but is kind of missing the cable box and internet access data that Verizon has,\u201d said Shar VanBoskirk, a digital marketing analyst at the research firm Forrester.Consumers feel warmly about Yahoo as a brand, Ms. VanBoskirk said, even if they do not use many Yahoo services. By contrast, she added, \u201cpeople have a pretty negative attitude towards telecom.\u201d She said Verizon could rebrand some of its services with the Yahoo name to increase their appeal.Any purchase of Yahoo carries some real risks, however. In addition to the F.C.C. rules that would make the data sharing less valuable, integrating ad platforms is a complex challenge, usually plagued with delays. The companies also have a different incentive structure for their advertising sales forces, according to Mr. Wieser, and unifying them could be disruptive.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy.

{"Headline": "The Trumpian Dreams of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThere were more than a few dropped jaws when the Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel agreed to a prime-time speaking slot on the final night of the Republican National Convention, barely an hour before the acceptance speech of Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump wants to emboss a big fat T on government, promising huge infrastructure projects, starting with a wall between the United States and Mexico. What was a former Ron Paul supporter and proud libertarian like Mr. Thiel doing on the same stage?Mr. Thiel\u2019s endorsement puts him at odds with many Silicon Valley chief executives and investors who oppose Mr. Trump on issues like climate change, same-sex marriage and, of course, immigration (they want more visas available for software engineers). It is easy to depict Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, board member at Facebook and influential investor, as an outlier even in the oddball tech world: He believes there will be a cure for death, promotes the construction of floating islands exempt from society\u2019s rules and secretly financed a lawsuit to take down Gawker.But Mr. Thiel isn\u2019t just embedded in the business of Silicon Valley. He\u2019s also deeply embedded in the worldview of Silicon Valley that, despite many disagreements with the Republican platform, matches up surprisingly well with Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas about fixing government.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.For these companies, government regulation is the enemy when it fails to appreciate the genius of their schemes and tries to slow them with Old World concerns over safety, privacy or copyright infringement. They are also now coming under scrutiny for their lack of diversity. The fantasy of the early web \u2014 a world without color or sex \u2014 fostered a belief that the world was largely past issues like inequality. Companies that strive for greatness, some argue now, naturally seek out employees with elite backgrounds. Larry Page of Google could have been speaking for many in the Valley when he said that from the start, \u201cWe just hired people like us.\u201dBut Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t hate government categorically. When Mr. Thiel harked back to the great projects of the past, like building the atom bomb, creating the internet and landing a man on the moon, he was citing three of the most important United States government initiatives of the last century. He praised them in his speech for inspiring the tech dreamers of Silicon Valley, who today inspire America to be great again.Believing in greatness \u2014 especially great ambitious projects \u2014 is what Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump have in common. After all, what is the border wall but a giant undertaking, like the Washington Monument or the Hoover Dam, except that, Mr. Trump insists, it will pay for itself? By nominating Mr. Trump, Republican primary voters have abruptly left behind the party that believes in Ronald Reagan\u2019s gospel that \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d It is now firmly in the camp that believes that when it comes to certain issues, \u201conly government can do this\u201d or, in Mr. Trump\u2019s phrase, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dMr. Trump claims this because he is a builder whom we can trust to get things done. Mr. Thiel comes from Silicon Valley, where the belief in talent, and the rewards owed to talent, are paramount. \u201cMy industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software, and, of course, it\u2019s made a lot of money,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to someone like Mr. Thiel is that they both believe that government should be brash and bold, while politics as usual produces tame mediocrity. They also believe they are the right kind of people to change that.Noam Cohen is writing a book, \u201cThe Know-It-Alls,\u201d about the radical politics of Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

What happens to my favorite Yahoo services now that Verizon is buying the company?After the deal closes, Verizon intends to keep Yahoo and its services as separate brands, according to Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of Verizon\u2019s AOL unit. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands in the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be investing in it.\u201dWait, AOL?

Will I still see the Yahoo search box in my Firefox browser?The future of search is fuzzier. Yahoo\u2019s current chief executive, Marissa Mayer, has invested heavily in search, but the company has continued to lose ground to Google.Mr. Armstrong was noncommittal on search, saying that would be a topic of discussion between the two companies. \u201cYahoo has products that have not launched yet on search,\u201d he said, and Verizon wants to evaluate those.Under Yahoo\u2019s search partnership with Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser, anyone who buys Yahoo must offer a search product through the end of 2019 or pay a hefty breakup fee.What about my personal data? Will Verizon share data about my cellphone use to Yahoo\u2019s advertisers and will Yahoo use what it knows about my web surfing to sell ads on my phone?The Federal Communications Commission fined Verizon in March for tracking people\u2019s cellphone browsing habits without their consent. Now the company is banned from sharing data across its business units unless it gets the user\u2019s permission.But the F.C.C. is considering broader rules to govern such data sharing, and Verizon is one of several companies lobbying to loosen the restrictions.Advertisement"}

The tech overlords keep clear of writers who are not on their payrolls or at least in their thrall. Many in the valley feel that bringing the digital future to the masses is God\u2019s work. Question this, and they tend to get touchy. Anger them, and they might seek revenge. The billionaire investor Peter Thiel, outed by the local arm of the Gawker media empire, secretly financed a lawsuit to destroy it. Silicon Valley did not rise en masse and say this was seriously beyond the pale. No surprise, then, that there are so few books investigating what it really takes to succeed in tech (duplicity often trumps innovation) or that critically examine such omnipresent, comforting fables as \u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money.\u201dThere are other barriers to literature. A start-up is less a physical reality than the hype that surrounds it. (It\u2019s not lying if you believe it.) Boasts, threats, secret deals, betrayals are the coin of the realm, but lawsuits and news releases are the only things put in writing. Nailing this slippery culture would take an unholy combination of David Mamet and Tom Wolfe in their primes, but they would also have to be lucky enough to find a subject who did not realize he was a great subject and start censoring himself for fear he would never be hired again. Good luck with that.In the meantime, we have the next best thing: Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s \u201cChaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,\u201d a book whose bland all-purpose title belies the fact that this is a valley account like no other. The first hint that something is different here comes with the dedication: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d This is autobiography as revenge, naming names and sparing few, certainly not the author. \u201cI was wholly devoid of most human boundaries or morality,\u201d he notes in passing. In other words, he was a start-up chief executive.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez came to the valley in 2008 from Goldman Sachs, where he was a pricing quant who modeled credit derivatives. In the valley, he tried to do the same with chunks of human attention, which meant inventing digital ad systems. He started at a flailing firm named \u00adAdchemy; quit with two engineers to found a start-up; sold the start-up to Twitter but went himself to work for Facebook, where he lasted two years.Flatly summarized, it is not a very interesting career. The start-up, named AdGrok, was a company mostly in name; it was three guys in a dumpy room trying to hustle themselves in a world full of hustlers. The answer to the problem plaguing Facebook during Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s stint there \u2014 how can we use digital advertising to make some serious money? \u2014 was not solved by the author.No matter. Michael Lewis was never a top Wall Street bond salesman, but in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d he captured an era. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d aims to do the same for Silicon Valley, and bracingly succeeds. Nothing I\u2019ve ever read conveys better what it actually is like to be in the engine room of the start-up economy. There were moments I laughed out loud, something I never recall doing while reading about Steve Jobs. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez shows how a start-up is less about making a product that actually does something than desperately demonstrating you are worthy of being hired by Google, Twitter or Facebook. He describes the way the big companies resemble life in Cuba or Communist China circa 1965, with \u201cendless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader,\u201d not to mention the posters on the wall proclaiming, \u201cProceed and Be Bold!\u201d This is a place, he points out, where people take their laptops into a toilet stall and keep typing as they do what they came to do. If that strikes you as unseemly or unnecessary, you\u2019ll never make it in Palo Alto.The heart of the book is the period Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez spent at his start-up, which was intended to allow small businesses to efficiently advertise on Google. It was an auspicious moment. While the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the recession, the office parks of the valley were full of aggressive young men who had made pots of money by being early employees of Google. To prove they were not merely lucky, they needed to score again. Everyone was terrified of missing the next Facebook or, a little later, the next Airbnb or Uber. Smart entrepreneurs capitalized on these fears.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s big break was hyping his way into Y Combinator, in effect the valley\u2019s finishing school for innovators. He labels the YC entrepreneur profile as \u201cbomb-throwing anarchist subversive mixed with coldblooded execution mixed with irreverent whimsy, a sort of \u00adtechnology-enabled 12-year-old boy.\u201d He fit right in.Graduation from Y Combinator conveys the same prestige that a degree from Harvard does back East, and comes complete with an old boy \u2014 well, young men \u2014 network that is handy in all sorts of ways. \u201cAnyone who claims the valley is meritocratic is someone who has profited vastly from it via nonmeritocratic means like happenstance, membership in a privileged cohort or some concealed act of absolute skulduggery,\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez observes. All three helped AdGrok; at one point the author manipulated the numbers for his investors, \u201ccooking the books in the worst form. But it was either that or give up now, and surrender was unthinkable.\u201dThere are a few problems with \u201cChaos Monkeys.\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez likes footnotes way too much (on one page there are four) and the epigraphs to each chapter are numbingly heavy-handed, although the Latin American proverb about how for every beautiful woman there\u2019s a man tired of making love to her sums up nicely his feelings about leaving the Kingdom of Facebook. More problematically, there is much more about digital ad technology here than most readers could possibly want. The implications of the technology, on the other hand, are somewhat scanted.\u201cImagine that every time you go to CNN.com, it\u2019s as though a new sell order for one share in your brain is transmitted to a stock exchange,\u201d he writes. \u201cPicture it: Individual quanta of human attention sold, bit by bit, like so many million shares of General Motors stock, billions of times a day.\u201d That was the world Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was doing his best to create. For all his criticism of the valley\u2019s way of doing things, he never stops to wonder about ethics.But then, he\u2019s got a full plate. Early in the narrative Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez conceives a daughter with a woman a mere two weeks after they meet. \u201cIf you jump into the abyss, jump headlong,\u201d he observes. Eighteen months or so later, during breakup sex, a son is conceived. AdGrok officially opens for business on his daughter\u2019s first birthday, which he skipped. \u201cSuccess,\u201d he writes, \u201cforgives all sins.\u201dIn the end, though, his success as an entrepreneur was only middling. \u201cSuch is the greased pole of Silicon Valley fame and power; anyone can try to ascend, but nothing will arrest your fall,\u201d he writes. First prize in Silicon Valley is enough money so your family and descendants will never have to work again until the sun goes cold. Second prize is a whole heaping pile of money. Third prize is you\u2019re fired, which is often pretty sweet too. Three years after being escorted out of Facebook, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez is living on a 40-foot sailboat on San Francisco Bay.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times. He is editing a collection of interviews with J.D. Salinger for publication next winter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Accord Explained", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history, would set new terms for trade and business investment among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations \u2014 a far-flung group with an annual gross domestic product of nearly $28 trillion that represents roughly 40 percent of global G.D.P. and one-third of world trade.But the agreement, which requires the approval of Congress, has become a flashpoint in the United States presidential campaign, opposed by the nominees of both major parties as a symbol of failed globalism and the loss of United States jobs overseas.Many Democrats in Congress have voiced skepticism over the benefits. And opposition to the pact became a popular rallying cry in stump speeches by both Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, who has promised to tear up the deal, and Bernie Sanders, who argued during the Democratic presidential primaries that it would lead to a loss of jobs and competitive wages.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, supported the emerging Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state, but during the primary race, soon after the accord was concluded, she said it did not sufficiently protect American jobs.The pact is seen as a means of addressing a number of festering issues that have become stumbling blocks as global trade has soared, including e-commerce, financial services and cross-border internet communications.There are also traditional trade issues involved. The United States is eager to establish formal trade agreements with five of the nations involved \u2014 Japan, Malaysia, Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam \u2014 and to strengthen Nafta, its current agreement with Canada and Mexico.Moreover, as efforts at global trade deals have faltered (such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha round), the Trans-Pacific Partnership is billed as an \u201copen architecture\u201d document written to ease adoption by additional Asian nations, and to provide a potential template to other initiatives underway, like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Today, the United States and most developed countries have few tariffs, but some remain. The United States, for example, protects the domestic sugar market from lower-priced global suppliers and imposes tariffs on imported shoes, while Japan has steep surcharges on agricultural products including rice, beef and dairy. The pact is an effort to create a Pacific Rim free-trade zone.China has viewed the pact with concern, seeing a potential threat as the United States tries to tighten its relationship with Asian trading partners. But senior Chinese officials have hinted that they might want to take part at some point. At the same time, the deal provides China some cover as it pursues its own trade agreements in the region, such as the Silk Road initiative in Central Asia.United States officials, while making clear that they see the pact as part of an effort to counter China\u2019s influence in the region, say they are hopeful that the pact\u2019s \u201copen architecture\u201d eventually prompts China to join, along with other important economic powers like South Korea.Nafta, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, helped lead to a boom in trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada. All three countries exported more goods and services to the other two, cross-border investments grew, and the United States economy has added millions of jobs since then. But of course not all those trends were attributable to Nafta, and the benefits were not equal: The United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico when the pact was signed, but that quickly became a trade deficit that has widened to more than $50 billion a year.Critics of Nafta also point out that job growth in the United States does not account for the loss of jobs to Mexico or Canada; the A.F.L.-C.I.O. contends about 700,000 United States jobs have been lost or displaced because of Nafta.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Really in the Fight Against Doping? It\u2019s Clear Once Again", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byOn OlympicsDr. Don Catlin, the father of drug testing in the United States for Olympic sports, was on the phone Sunday morning from Los Angeles.\u201cOh, dear,\u201d he said.That was his reaction to being told the International Olympic Committee had decided against a complete barring of Russian athletes from the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.Referring to Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., Dr. Catlin said, \u201cI had hoped, I had thought, that Bach was going to be tough and strong.\u201dYet again, when faced with evidence of a state-sponsored system of doping, the I.O.C. professed zero tolerance but contradicted its stance with its politics.Ahead of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Juan Antonio Samaranch, then president of the I.O.C., sought to end boycotts that had threatened the Summer Games. So he awarded the Olympic Order, the I.O.C.\u2019s highest honor, to the East German dictator Erich Honecker.In bestowing that award, Mr. Samaranch gave tacit approval to the East German system of doping that was widely suspected at the time. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it was revealed that the East German system had involved as many as 10,000 athletes, some of them children as young as 11 who had unknowingly received steroids.\u201cThe worst thing is, he knew about it,\u201d Dr. Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, a former chairman of the I.O.C.\u2019s medical commission, said in an interview before Mr. Samaranch died in 2010.Actually, an argument can be made that the I.O.C. made the correct decision Sunday, that potentially clean Russian athletes should not be punished with guilt by association.But with the Rio Games starting Aug. 5, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for many Russian athletes to prove they have undergone regular, legitimate testing and are not using banned substances, Dr. Catlin said.As cases from Marion Jones to Lance Armstrong have demonstrated, an athlete\u2019s passing a drug test hardly means the athlete is clean. Drug use has grown increasingly sophisticated and furtive with microdosing and substances that can flush out of the body in hours.\u201cThe world considers that if an organization is doing testing, then the organization has clean athletes,\u201d said Dr. Catlin, who headed the drug-testing lab at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. We\u2019ve seen it over and over\u201d with the Olympics and professional leagues.Now the eligibility of Russian athletes in Rio is left to the international federations that oversee the 28 Olympic sports. Those federations have not exactly been vigilant when it comes to curbing the use of banned substances.The International Boxing Association conducted zero tests out of competition in 2015. Random, unannounced tests are considered the only effective way to catch athletes who dope.And while the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field\u2019s world governing body, has under widespread pressure barred Russian athletes from Rio, its former president, Lamine Diack of Senegal, stands accused of accepting bribes to cover up positive tests.International sports officials are more concerned with plausible deniability and five-star hotel suites than with combating doping, said Charles Yesalis, a retired Penn State professor and an expert on performance-enhancing drugs.\u201cIt\u2019s all about marketing and perception,\u201d Professor Yesalis said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the health of the athletes. Doping just distracts from the mom, apple pie, Chevrolet image.\u201dLegalizing the use of performance-enhancing drugs \u2014 with the caveat of not administering them to children \u2014 would \u201cdramatically reduce the hypocrisy, which at this point is nauseating,\u201d Professor Yesalis said.The Russia news underscores what long has been true about doping scandals. Drug testing has shown only limited effect. Instead, revelations have mostly been made by whistle-blowers, reporters, the police and federal investigators.The breadth of the Russian system became public only because Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the longtime director of the country\u2019s antidoping lab, revealed startling details to my colleagues at The Times.Rebecca R. Ruiz\u2019s indefatigable reporting also revealed that the World Anti-Doping Agency did little except twiddle its test tubes.\u201cIt just shows more proof positive of the impotency of drug testing,\u201d Professor Yesalis said.Retesting from the 2008 Beijing Games and the 2012 London Games has resulted in 98 positive tests that were previously undetected among 1,243 samples. That\u2019s nearly 8 percent, a startlingly high number and a further indication of how widespread doping seems to be.By comparison, when Major League Baseball conducted anonymous, penalty-free testing for steroids in 2003, when no antidoping program was yet in place, it found only 5 percent to 7 percent positive results.WADA has a budget of just under $30 million, but some antidoping experts believe that it would need a budget three times that to be considered effective.Richard W. Pound, an I.O.C. delegate from Montreal and a former president of WADA, has repeatedly questioned whether the financing and willpower are in place to combat doping in sports.In a 2013 report, he wrote that \u201cthere is no general appetite to undertake the effort and expense of a successful effort to deliver doping-free sport.\u201dAt a conference in April in the Netherlands, Yannis Pitsiladis, an antidoping expert and a member of the I.O.C.\u2019s medical and scientific commission, gave a sober message: The doping situation will \u201cget worse before it gets better.\u201dSo did the I.O.C. on Sunday effectively wave a white flag of surrender in the battle against banned substances?\u201cI\u2019ve got to think through that,\u201d Dr. Catlin said. \u201cI can see the point, but I don\u2019t like the idea. I\u2019m still believing somehow or another we can find a way to control doping, but I must say the whole Russian thing leaves me like a limp rag.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steinway\u2019s Grand Ambitions for Its Pianos in China", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byNINGBO, China \u2014 Dozens of girls in tiaras and boys in tuxedos who dreamed of becoming China\u2019s next musical sensation stared at the beast onstage. At nine feet long and nearly 1,000 pounds, with a steely black sheen and a price of more than $200,000, the Steinway & Sons D-274 concert grand piano seemed designed to intimidate.There were whispers that the piano had come from far away, in Germany; that it could kill you in an instant if it rolled off the stage; that it had the power to turn even the sloppiest of scales into material primed for Carnegie Hall.\u201cIt\u2019s flawless, exquisite, with a special sound,\u201d said Li Wei, the mother of an 11-year-old boy who had come to the theater to take part in the final round of the Steinway & Sons International Youth Piano Competition in China last winter.\u201cEveryone wants a Steinway,\u201d said Xiao Yunchu, a quiet 13-year-old who favored the pyrotechnics of the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt. \u201cBut none of us can afford it.\u201dSteinway, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious musical instrument brands, is looking to China to breathe new life into lackluster sales. To succeed, the company will need more than smart marketing. It will need to fine-tune a cultural mind-set in a country that once dismissed pianos as bourgeois luxuries.Steinway dealers have to convince their wealthier clientele that the instruments make good investments, avoiding the overly aggressive sales tactics that tripped up some early efforts. They have to educate parents about the potential payoff of buying a piano that can cost as much as an apartment. And they need to woo music students who are increasingly turning to lower-cost keyboards and so-called smart pianos, which use lights, iPads and other technical tools to teach basic skills.The company, known for its painstaking craftsmanship, has grudgingly entered the digital game. The new Steinway Spirio is a high-tech take on the jazz-era player piano, loaded with standard classical fare as well as Chinese tunes, including local pop hits like \u201cThe Moon Represents My Heart\u201d and compositions like \u201cThe Yellow River\u201d Piano Concerto, a piece that dates to the Cultural Revolution.In China, Steinway sees potential in what it calls the \u201ctiger mom\u201d phenomenon, middle-class parents willing to spend small fortunes to produce high-achieving children with musical talent. By some estimates, the country has as many as 40 million piano students, compared with six million in the United States.\u201cIn America, you\u2019ve already had the piano for hundreds of years,\u201d said Lang Lang, a classical pianist with a rock star flair who is one of China\u2019s most prominent musicians. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s fresher, it\u2019s newer. Everyone wants to play.\u201dSteinway has pitched its pianos both as durable instruments and luxurious artifacts. It has recruited celebrities like Mr. Lang to offer endorsements, which carry special force in the crowded Chinese marketplace. And it has infused its messaging with themes of success and ambition.As China\u2019s middle class swells to some 200 million people, many Western brands like Steinway have arrived in search of a new generation to offset slowing sales at home. Mattel, the toymaker, has entered the market with products like Violin Soloist Barbie. La Perla, an Italian lingerie maker founded in 1954, has 11 stores in mainland China, its fastest-growing market.For Steinway, China has proved to be a shot in the arm. Sales increased more than 15 percent a year over the last decade, far outpacing the single-digit growth of the United States and Europe. China is now Steinway\u2019s largest market for pianos outside the United States, representing about one-third of global sales. In a sign of China\u2019s importance, the company next year will unveil a 60,000-square-foot headquarters for Asia in Shanghai, complete with a recital hall.The youth piano competition in Ningbo from Dec. 10 to 13, the seventh of its kind on the mainland, was the marquee event of the year, a chance to imprint the Steinway lore into the minds of thousands of students, parents and teachers. Students ages 6 to 16 came from across China to Ningbo, a Silk Road trading port three hours south of Shanghai, to compete for an opportunity to perform overseas in Hamburg, the birthplace of Brahms and one of Steinway\u2019s main hubs.Over lunch at a downtown hotel, Steinway executives celebrated the success of the competition, which attracted more than 15,000 applicants, a record. Steinway executives said they dreamed of a day when the company\u2019s pianos filled living rooms across China and the company name was as well known in the country as Gucci. But they acknowledged that if Steinway were to thrive in China, it would need a cultural shift in a country where low-end pianos have dominated the market for decades.As the competition kicked off in Ningbo and children took to the stage to perform Mozart, Brahms and Gershwin, the president of Steinway\u2019s Asia division, Werner Husmann, said the piano maker would need to establish a new audience in China to survive.\u201cThese people are our customers of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep piano playing popular.\u201dWherever Mr. Husmann went during a trip to China for Steinway in the late 1990s, he saw what he began referring to as P.S.O.s, or piano-shaped objects \u2014 instruments that had long ago lost their music-making abilities. Some had uneven legs and drifted toward the audience during performances. Others sat on street corners, rain or shine.Even so, Mr. Husmann came away with a sense that there was a love of Western music in Chinese society, and there would soon be a market for high-quality instruments. When he returned to Hamburg to sell his colleagues on the idea, they laughed.\u201cThe first reaction was more or less that I should see a doctor to do a mental check,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What the hell can you do in China?\u2019\u201dSteinway had been selling its artisanal pianos, each consisting of more than 12,000 parts, to China since 1880. But many employees were wary of establishing a permanent outpost in a place where cheap manufactured goods were king.Fans liked to say Steinway invented the modern grand piano. The company has 127 patents. Unlike its competitors, Steinway refused to churn out hundreds of pianos each day by machine. And it kept factories in its two main bases in Queens and Hamburg, even as other instrument makers like Yamaha moved manufacturing operations from the United States to low-cost Asian countries.When Steinway opened an office in Shanghai in 2004, most of its sales in China were to music conservatories. It was not until the global financial crisis struck four years later that the importance of the Chinese market became clear.As the world economy weakened, piano sales in the United States and Europe, already in decline, fell sharply. In 1909, 364,000 pianos were sold annually in the United States; by 2009, that number had slumped to 30,000, according to the National Association of Music Merchants. Doomsday scenarios predicted the extinction of pianos.Despite Steinway\u2019s devout following \u2014 the company says it is the instrument of choice for 98 percent of the world\u2019s performing pianists, including Billy Joel and the Argentine musician Martha Argerich \u2014 it was not immune to the slowdown. Shipments of Steinway pianos dropped substantially in 2009, and the company was forced to lay off workers at its factory in Queens.While sales revived somewhat, the downturn exposed the limits of Steinway\u2019s traditional markets. As they looked to the future, Steinway\u2019s leaders decided to take the company private, away from the short-term glare of public shareholders focused on quarterly earnings.In 2013, Steinway was sold for $512 million to Mr. Paulson, and musicians worried he would interfere with Steinway\u2019s painstaking production process to increase revenue. Steinway was making only about 2,000 pianos a year in New York and Hamburg.But Mr. Paulson, an amateur pianist with four Steinway pianos, did not change the company\u2019s methods, which he believed were crucial to dominating the high-end market. He urged the company to move more aggressively in emerging countries, where a growing middle class was spending heavily on education. Steinway drew up plans for a hybrid acoustic-digital instrument and broadly ramped up production of traditional pianos to meet demand.When officials from Chongqing, a metropolis in southwest China, held a concert in 2011 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, they invited Steinway to take part. Li Yundi, a prominent pianist and endorser of Steinway, played a program of traditional Chinese songs. Onstage sat a nine-foot concert grand painted solid red, China\u2019s national color. A Steinway & Sons logo was displayed prominently on its side. Thousands gathered in the sweltering heat to watch the performance, and many lined up afterward to snap pictures with the piano.His father was skeptical. His mother worried he would drive the family business into turmoil.But Nick Liu, a 26-year-old heir to a large musical instrument company in eastern China, was determined. He would open a store focused exclusively on selling the brand of pianos he had worshiped during his days as a budding concert pianist.Mr. Liu\u2019s father had tried selling Steinway pianos a decade earlier with limited success. The concept of a high-end instrument is unfamiliar in a country where the average income for an urban middle-class worker was about $12,000, according to a report last year by Goldman Sachs. Most people won\u2019t spend more than $1,000 on a piano.Mr. Liu, who studied piano and finance at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, sensed an opportunity. He believed that China\u2019s nouveaux riches were in the market for new symbols of wealth. \u201cI knew rich people wanted something more subtle to show their taste and sophistication,\u201d he said.Shortly after New Year\u2019s Day last year, in a sleepy business complex in Ningbo that housed a fine-wine store and an art gallery, Mr. Liu opened a Steinway dealership, the latest addition to his family\u2019s business empire, Tianmu Music.Mr. Liu found the space with the help of Wang Zhaochun, a technology executive and one of Steinway\u2019s most enthusiastic Chinese customers, who owned the building.Mr. Wang was an avid fan of sports cars and watches. But his latest obsession was a red Steinway concert grand piano valued at more than $300,000, which he showed off to friends in a private salon decorated with fur rugs and bottles of Royal Salute whisky on the building\u2019s ninth floor.\u201cI wanted to buy something special,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a Rolls-Royce.\u201dIn his store on the ground floor, Mr. Liu arranged dozens of pianos, polishing them with cloths made of chicken skin to make each look as seductive as possible. He turned an empty wall into a timeline of Steinway history, beginning with a portrait of Henry E. Steinway, the company\u2019s founder, wearing a top hat and holding a cane. He created a mock living room, complete with Steinway-branded teacups and tissue boxes, to help customers visualize high-end pianos in their own homes.Yet Mr. Liu struggled to make a sale. \u201cIt was hell,\u201d he said. \u201cNo customers, just three employees in the store and me.\u201dHis sales team, accustomed to using a pushy manner to peddle far cheaper products, had difficulty connecting with elite customers. Mr. Liu, a classically trained pianist, felt more comfortable speaking about the musical aspects of the instruments than investment value.Selling a Steinway in China is a particularly trying task. Unlike sports cars or watches, pianos are not easy to show off. Many older people in China never developed a talent for playing the piano. The instrument was shunned during the Cultural Revolution, and widespread poverty in the ensuing decades made it inaccessible to many Chinese families.Steinway has depended on salesmen in more than 25 cities to educate and excite its customers. The company has instructed them to play up the potential return on investment of a Steinway \u2014 a message that resonates strongly with frugal Chinese families \u2014 and to speak at length about the company\u2019s history.Mr. Liu thought back to his days as an intern in China selling English lessons to working-class families. He remembered the time he had sold more than $6,000 worth of lessons to a woman who made only $460 a month.\u201cThat was an achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like \u2018The Wolf of Wall Street.\u2019 You have to figure out their motivations and their pressure point.\u201dMr. Liu invited families in for concerts. He began courting music teachers and local performers. He recruited a Bentley salesman to help market the pianos to affluent customers.\u201cWe had to convince them that pianos should be a noble good, not something people buy from the grocery store,\u201d he said.By March, Mr. Liu had made his first sale, and he was beginning to learn to accommodate the peculiar requests of his clients. A customer called one morning to say she wanted to buy a grand piano costing more than $20,000. But there was a catch: She demanded that it be delivered at 8 p.m. that same day, on the advice of her spiritual master, who had said that time would accord with the laws of feng shui.Mr. Liu scrambled to make it happen.By December, Mr. Liu had sold 50 pianos at his store in Ningbo. In his office, he kept a supply of single-malt whiskey he sometimes used to celebrate milestones. At the end of his first year, it had begun to run low.In a sleek office tower in the heart of Beijing\u2019s high-tech hub, 60 engineers and 20 musicians work day and night to perfect a product they hope will one day compete with traditional instruments from makers like Steinway.The device is a smart piano known as the One, and it uses synchronized lights and video games to show children how to play the piano \u2014 no teacher required. With a compact design and a price starting around $600, it has proved to be popular among Chinese parents; the company sold 85,000 units in two years.Founded by an engineer with no background in music, the company that produces the One, Xiaoyezi Technology, has not been shy about its ambitions. \u201cWitness the rebirth of the classical piano,\u201d reads one advertisement.There are now some 300,000 digital pianos in China, about the same number as acoustic pianos. Some forecasts say the total could reach one million within five years.For generations, Steinway has thrived by ignoring competitors claiming to have reinvented the piano. But the surging popularity of digital pianos like the One, as well as concerns that a slowing Chinese economy could hurt demand, has prompted the company to reconsider.In Beijing this month, Steinway unveiled a product that executives heralded as one of the most significant innovations in the company\u2019s 163-year history: Spirio, an acoustic piano equipped with a digital brain so that it can play without human intervention.Spirio, which starts at about $147,000 in China, traces its roots to a generation of player pianos that filled homes across America in the early 1900s, the golden age of pianos. It was a time when jazz and ragtime flew off the keys, and Steinway was producing more than 6,000 pianos a year, triple what it makes today.Steinway sees China as the best shot at rekindling the fervor of that era. Indeed, for two months last year, the company sold more grand pianos in China than in the United States.In a somewhat frustrating sign of the company\u2019s growing popularity in China, imitators have begun cropping up, including small piano shops that have repurposed Steinway\u2019s lyre logo. One company even usurped the name to sell water heaters for showers with built-in televisions.But Steinway executives face a persistent worry. No matter how much money the company spends promoting its craftsmanship, no matter how many performers endorse its pianos, China\u2019s middle class might ultimately be unwilling to make the leap to high-end instruments.\u201cWhen you rule the piano world for 160 years, you can get complacent,\u201d said Mr. Husmann, the company executive. \u201cIt can lead to a mentality of, \u2018Everyone needs a Steinway anyway.\u2019 Steinway has to be a fighting hero \u2014 we have to fight every day for our business.\u201dDu Ruizhe, a 15-year-old piano student in Beijing, was the model of a next-generation Steinway customer. She grew up revering the Steinway name, associating it with great pianists like Arthur Rubinstein. She practiced five hours a day \u2014 six on weekends \u2014 and was ecstatic when she learned she had qualified for the Steinway piano competition in Ningbo.But at home, she played on a grand piano made by Kawai, a low-cost Japanese maker. Steinway pianos, she said, were simply too expensive.\u201cIt feels like Steinway is getting famous,\u201d said the teenager, who plans to become a piano teacher. \u201cBut in many people\u2019s eyes it\u2019s still a luxury, and until that changes, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll be rushing to get it.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Sarah Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Tells NATO That \u2018Europe Can Count On\u2019 the U.S.", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byWARSAW \u2014 President Obama, acknowledging that the trans-Atlantic alliance faces an unprecedented array of threats from terrorism, migrant flows and an aggressive Russia, said on Saturday that \u201cin good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States \u2014 always.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t simply reaffirmed\u201d the alliance, Mr. Obama said at a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with the most significant reinforcement of collective defense any time since the Cold War.\u201dMr. Obama spoke in Warsaw at the end of a NATO summit meeting that illustrated how radically the global security situation has changed since he took office in 2009.Europe, the anchor of the trans-Atlantic alliance, is battling centrifugal forces unleashed by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Russia, with which Mr. Obama had tried to cultivate a friendly relationship, continues to be an implacable adversary.This was the president\u2019s last NATO summit meeting, and the mood was occasionally wistful. During a morning meeting, he chatted warmly with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, whose days in office are also winding down. Mr. Obama\u2019s fellow leaders showered him with praise and promised to stay in touch. But the challenges facing the alliance are so acute that the tone was for the most part more urgent than reflective.The message the leaders hoped to project was that the Western alliance remained united despite fraying ties within the European Union, particularly Britain\u2019s recent vote to leave it, known as Brexit.\u201cI think this summit has underlined one very important message,\u201d said Mr. Cameron, who after the vote for Brexit, which he had opposed, announced that he will resign by October. \u201cThat while Britain may be leaving the European Union, we are not withdrawing from the world, nor are we turning our backs on Europe or on European security.\u201dThe participants adopted a security declaration that expanded on an agreement in Wales in 2014. The member nations pledged to \u201cstand together and act together\u201d against an \u201cunprecedented range of security challenges\u201d that include terrorist attacks within Europe, Russian aggressiveness in Ukraine and elsewhere, and instability throughout the Middle East and North Africa.\u201cIt is a summit with a lot of substance, and it is historic because it takes place at a decisive point for our security,\u201d said the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.NATO had already agreed to establish battalions of 800 to 1,200 multinational troops in Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, as well as a brigade of four more battalions to be based in Romania and Bulgaria. The battalion in Poland is to be commanded by the United States and composed almost entirely of American forces.Mr. Stoltenberg called it \u201cthe biggest reinforcement to our collective defense in a generation.\u201dWhile the reinforcement was prompted by Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and by what the Western alliance regards as continuing belligerent behavior from Moscow, NATO leaders insisted the reinforcement did not constitute the advent of a fresh Cold War.Neither, Mr. Stoltenberg said, has the alliance achieved the closer relationship it wished to forge with Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u201cWe are in a new situation, which is different from anything we have experienced before,\u201d he said.Despite concerns that some NATO nations were softening in their support for sanctions against Russia, Mr. Cameron insisted that the alliance\u2019s message to Russia had not changed.\u201cWe are not seeking confrontation with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, we are working to prevent it. So we will continue to pursue a twin track of deterrence and dialogue.\u201dSome issues have not changed during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. NATO\u2019s leaders agreed to extend its mission in Afghanistan through 2017, after the president\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that the United States would keep 8,400 troops in the country. Mr. Stoltenberg said the alliance was close to reaching its goal of $1 billion to finance the Afghanistan mission.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made clear that worries about mass migration \u2014 one million migrants arrived in her country last year from Afghanistan and elsewhere \u2014 had factored into the decision to further support the Afghan government.She said NATO members had told Afghan leaders that they must fight corruption and improve life for the civilian population, \u201cbecause we saw last year in the great number of migrants who came from Afghanistan that the situation is not yet satisfactory.\u201dAfter focusing on strengthening forces within the alliance, NATO shifted its attention on the concluding day to addressing the instability in the Middle East, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Africa.\u201cThis instability has a direct impact on our own societies,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cIt has caused the greatest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II and terrorist groups have staged attacks on our streets.\u201dHe said NATO would concentrate its efforts on providing training for allies outside the alliance. \u201cIn the long run, training local forces is more effective than deploying large numbers of our own forces in combat situations,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said.NATO had already been training Iraqi forces, in neighboring Jordan, but under an agreement reached Saturday will begin using multinational troops to provide training within Iraq.A new \u201cintelligence infusion center\u201d will be established in Tunisia, Mr. Stoltenberg said, to better coordinate antiterrorism initiatives, and NATO surveillance aircraft will be used to provide direct support to alliance operations throughout the region.NATO\u2019s maritime forces in the Mediterranean will be expanded and the operation renamed Sea Guardian, working in closer cooperation with the European Union\u2019s efforts across the Mediterranean and its anti-smuggling efforts in the Aegean Sea.Alison Smale and Joanna Berendt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I love Yahoo and I want to see it into its next chapter.\u201d But she and Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, said it had not yet been decided if she would have a role at the company after the deal closed in early 2017.If she is terminated, she will be due severance of about $57 million. If she received that payout, her total compensation from Yahoo for her service so far would be about $218 million, according to the compensation research firm Equilar.Verizon, which has a vast amount of information about its customers\u2019 internet use, hopes the combination will help it create a strong No. 3 challenger to Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue.The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up, selling its core business to Verizon for a small fraction of what it was worth at its height in 2000.Mr. Armstrong said the acquisition strengthens Verizon\u2019s offerings to advertisers and consumers and gives it much more scale, since Yahoo claims one billion users who visit at least once a month.\u201cThis deal is a leap forward from serving millions of customers to billions,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said in an interview. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands on the planet.\u201dVerizon plans to keep most of Yahoo\u2019s current products, including its still popular email service, and invest in them to make them stronger. \u201cOur strategy is to structure ourselves as a house of brands,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. However, he said that Verizon has not yet decided what it wants to do in search, an area where Yahoo has waged a losing fight against Google for a decade.The Yahoo purchase carries risks for Verizon, which is well known for its wireless phone and internet services but has little experience in the cutthroat business of digital content. Analysts say that its purchase of AOL has yet to prove its value, although Mr. Armstrong is a well regarded operator.Ms. Mayer said Verizon would help Yahoo get better distribution for its mobile apps in areas like search, mail, news, weather and sports. Verizon, she said, could promote Yahoo services on its smartphones and in its retail stores.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cWe set out to transform this company \u2014 and we\u2019ve made incredible progress. We counteracted many of the tectonic shifts of declining legacy businesses, and built a Yahoo that is unequivocally stronger, nimbler and more modern,\u201d she wrote.Verizon agreed to pay an extra $1.1 billion on top of the purchase price to cash out Yahoo employees\u2019 restricted stock upon the close of the deal, Yahoo said. Many employees, particularly the senior executives, are also entitled to large severance packages if they are fired by Verizon.\u201cIt does mark the end of a particular time period for the company,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cThat said, there are great opportunities for Yahoo, for the brand, for the services, with Verizon.\u201dAfter the close of the deal, Yahoo shareholders will still own shares in what is left of the company, essentially an investment fund with two holdings: a 15 percent stake, worth about $32 billion based on its recent share price, in the Chinese internet company Alibaba; and a 35.5 percent stake, worth about $8.7 billion, in Yahoo Japan.The sale, which still must be approved by Yahoo shareholders and regulators, also does not include Yahoo\u2019s cash and its noncore patents, which it is trying to sell separately.\u201cFor investors, this came to the expected conclusion: Verizon was the front-runner very early on,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cThe real question for investors now is what\u2019s next?

{"Headline": "John Kerry Meets Vladimir Putin to Discuss New Syria Plan", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byBoth men said they were hopeful of reaching an accord. \u201cI hope after today\u2019s consultations you\u2019ll be able to advise him of the progress made and possible headway for us to make,\u201d Mr. Putin said, referring to conversations between Mr. Kerry and President Obama. Mr. Kerry responded: \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll be able to make some genuine progress that is measurable and implementable and that can make a difference in the course of events in Syria.\u201dThe proposed agreement calls for the creation of a joint military command center staffed by military and intelligence officers who would share information so as to permit \u201cintegrated operations.\u201d It has generated deep unease at the Pentagon and in some quarters of the State Department, where it is seen as too conciliatory to both the Russians and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.A top State Department official said in an interview on Thursday that critics of the agreement were being alarmist, pointing out that the proposal requires Syria\u2019s Air Force \u2014 which has routinely bombed civilian areas \u2014 to be largely grounded.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that much work remained to be done. \u201cWe\u2019ve always made clear that we would welcome a military contribution from Russia, as long as they were focused on ISIL and Al Qaeda\u2019s presence in Syria,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen them devote too much attention to using their military might to prop up the Assad regime.\u201dThe agreement has also raised alarms because it might lead the United States to countenance or even participate in strikes against groups fighting Mr. Assad. One of the great complications of the Syrian civil war is figuring out which groups should be considered rebels focused on ousting the Assad government \u2014 a goal the United States supports \u2014 and which are aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, organizations that Washington has designated as terrorist and has vowed to defeat.Andrew J. Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said in a telephone interview that the proposed agreement, if put in place, would ensure that the government remained in power, that the civil war in Syria would continue and that terrorism would continue to spread in the Middle East and around the world. \u201cThe Russians want Assad to stay,\u201d Mr. Tabler said. \u201cThey\u2019re very upfront about that. And by giving into this agreement, we\u2019re buying into that.\u201dRussia\u2019s stated position is that it is not wedded to Mr. Assad personally, but does not wish to see any head of state removed by what it sees as Western-engineered change.The other complication is that the Syrians and Russians have routinely undermined previous commitments regarding cease-fires and other measures to spare civilian lives. In just the past week, the Syrian Army has repeatedly announced cease-fires only to conduct an extensive military campaign around the rebel-held section of the stricken city of Aleppo, leaving about 300,000 people there besieged. The government is also advancing on the Damascus suburb of Daraya, one of the first areas to revolt against the government, with many of its 8,000 residents fearing an imminent massacre. In recent days, a refugee camp near the Jordanian border was bombed, and civilians were killed. Whether it was the Russians or Syrians who undertook the operation is not known.\u201cIt is true that Assad has, time and time again, broken commitments that either they had made or Russia had made on their behalf,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding that the Russians can get things done in Syria if they so choose. \u201cWe know that the Russian government has influence with the Assad regime in a way that can have a tangible impact on the ground; it\u2019s just a matter of President Putin deciding whether or not he cares enough about his own integrity to use it. And that\u2019s the question that they face.\u201dThe Nusra Front has been one of the most effective anti-Assad forces, and because of that United States-backed rebel groups often coordinate their activities with its units. Russia has argued that means that Washington is effectively supporting Nusra, and that the American-backed groups are legitimate targets. So a joint campaign against Nusra would not only appear to concede Russia\u2019s point, but could also bring American firepower to bear against the strongest anti-Assad military force and a sometime partner of Washington\u2019s allies.Up to now, the United States has carried out occasional strikes against what have been described as senior Qaeda figures in Syria. But it has refrained from systematic attacks against the Nusra Front, whose ranks are heavily Syrian, including many who left less extreme rebel groups because Nusra was better armed and financed. Faysal Itani, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, was also critical of the proposed military coordination with the Russians. He said that combined attacks against Nusra would effectively end the Syrian opposition, cementing Mr. Assad\u2019s grip on power and enraging most Syrians.The United States proposal states that American and Russian officials would share information on the locations of rebel groups to ensure that strikes aimed at Nusra did not hit United States-backed groups. In the past, those groups \u2014 as well as some American officials \u2014 have worried that Russia might use that information for targeting, rather than avoiding, them.The proposed agreement also raises questions of whether the United States would eventually come under Russian pressure to attack other rebel groups, like the Army of Islam, a leader of which led the opposition negotiating team at the last round of peace talks in Geneva.Nevertheless, the top State Department official, who requested anonymity to speak about a sensitive diplomatic matter, said that any military cooperation in the Syrian theater would have no effect on the wider relationship with Russia, adding that differences remained over Ukraine and Crimea.Gardiner Harris reported from Moscow, and Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon.

{"Headline": "Failed Spending Bills Pile Up in Senate Amid Dispute Over Budget Deal", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After years of warfare over fiscal cliffs, government shutdowns and the debt ceiling, congressional Republicans pledged in January to work diligently through the dozen regular spending bills needed to finance the federal government \u2014 and Democrats promised to cooperate.But as Congress prepares to recess until September, it has become clear that a presidential election year was not the ideal time to get back to so-called regular order.So far, only one Senate spending bill, for water and energy programs, has not been sabotaged by Washington\u2019s acidic politics.Democrats have accused the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, of backtracking on a deal reached last fall that, in hopes of avoiding another last-minute showdown, set top-line spending limits. Mr. McConnell and other Republicans say they have abided by the agreement all along, but Democrats accused the Republicans of trickery and said in effect that they were ending negotiations on the individual spending bills.\u201cWhat you saw was the appropriation process falling apart once and for all for the year,\u201d said James P. Manley, a former aide to the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and now a political consultant in Washington. Such an outcome could not be avoided in a big election year, he added.\u201cI, for one, am surprised that they made as much progress as they did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at some point, it was going to fall apart \u2014 and it did.\u201dThe demise of the defense appropriations bill \u2014 tied to a fundamental philosophical disagreement over spending \u2014 was perhaps the most inevitable.Republicans generally prefer to direct any increases in spending toward military programs, and Democrats said they feared that the adoption of the defense bill would allow Republicans to circumvent the rest of the process and seek to hold all other programs at this year\u2019s spending levels. The deal reached last fall called for parallel increases in military and nonmilitary programs.Mr. McConnell and other Republicans berated Democrats for obstructing the measure.\u201cIt is inexcusable to see Senate Democrats filibustering the defense appropriations bill, jeopardizing both our combat readiness and our national security,\u201d Mr. McConnell said last week. He noted that the bill had received the unanimous support of Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which he said had completed its work on the measure faster than at any other point in more than a decade.\u201cAt a time when we face an array of terror threats around the globe,\u201d he added, \u201cSenate Democrats are attempting to once again undermine efforts to support our troops as well as efforts to move the appropriations process forward.\u201dDemocrats showed no remorse.By effectively halting negotiations in their letter to Mr. McConnell, Democrats set the stage for an omnibus compromise to be negotiated later in the year, or perhaps a stopgap measure that would keep the government running until the new president and Congress take office in 2017.\u201cWithout strong, public assurance that you are committed to honoring the core tenets of the bipartisan compromise \u2014 including fair funding, parity and a rejection of poison pill riders \u2014 through the completion of the full appropriations process, we will no longer be able to support proceeding to new appropriations bills,\u201d Senate Democratic leaders, including Mr. Reid, wrote in their letter.Spending bills have fared somewhat better in the House, where Republicans control a bigger majority and do not face filibusters. On Thursday, the House passed a financial services and general government measure.But that success is an illusion, given that spending bills must be approved by both chambers. Senate Democratic leaders, in their letter, cited provisions inserted into House bills as a reason for their charge that the October agreement was falling apart.John Feehery, a veteran Republican political consultant who served as the top spokesman for J. Dennis Hastert, a former House speaker, said the problems ran far deeper than election-year politics and showed that the federal appropriations process was fundamentally broken.\u201cCongress only works when both parties have a shared interest in making the spending process work,\u201d Mr. Feehery said. \u201cBut because earmarks have gone away, there is very little to compel members to pass these bills. They used to have a vested interest in passing these bills because they could bring home the bacon. These days, it makes little difference to members whether they pass the bills or just wait for an omnibus in a lame duck.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama Governor Seeks Lottery Vote, Reigniting an Old Debate", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byGov. Robert Bentley of Alabama reignited one of his state\u2019s most bitterly contested issues on Wednesday by calling for a special session to seek a referendum on creating a lottery.The governor\u2019s action meant that the matter could go before voters as soon as November, and it started a campaign that will force Alabama to weigh the politics of public finance, poverty and piety.Mr. Bentley did not release details of his proposal, which he asserted would raise $225 million annually. He said his plan would direct lottery revenue toward \u201cbasic services that our state must provide.\u201d Mr. Bentley, who has long supported a statewide vote but has also expressed doubts about how far a lottery can go in curing the state\u2019s financial troubles, was not available for an interview.But to critics of gambling, the potential implications of Mr. Bentley\u2019s decision were alarming.\u201cI want to be optimistic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m also trying to be realistic.\u201dTo many lottery supporters in Alabama, the flood of money going elsewhere is reason enough to legalize such gambling.\u201cIt\u2019s time we stop supporting other states\u2019 budgets and keep our money at home to solve our own problems,\u201d said Mr. Bentley, who maintained his opposition to casino gambling.But some lawmakers and lobbyists said they believed Mr. Bentley had another motive for a lottery vote: to distract from discussions and investigations about his conduct. Representative Allen Farley, a Republican from suburban Birmingham who has criticized the governor, suggested that Mr. Bentley might be hoping that a lottery debate would effectively immunize him from impeachment by the State House of Representatives. (The governor has denied any criminal wrongdoing.)\u201cCould this be a decision to put himself in a posture where a majority of the 105 members would say, \u2018We don\u2019t need to talk about impeachment right now\u2019?\u201d Mr. Farley said. \u201cIn Alabama politics, you can probably come up with five or 10 different scenarios, and I think that each one of them would probably have a little bit of credibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Law Is Not Justice", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThis is the sixth in a series of dialogues with philosophers and critical theorists on the question of violence. This conversation is with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who is a university professor in the humanities at Columbia University. She is the author of \u201cAn Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization,\u201d and other books.When human beings are valued as less than human, violence begins to emerge as the only response. When one group designates another as lesser, they are saying the \u201cinferior\u201d group cannot think in a \u201creasonable\u201d way. It is important to remember that this is an intellectual violation, and in fact that the oppressed group\u2019s right to manual labor is not something they are necessarily denied. In fact, the oppressed group is often pushed to take on much of society\u2019s necessary physical labor. Hence, it is not that people are denied agency; it is rather that an unreasonable or brutish type of agency is imposed on them. And, the power inherent in this physical agency eventually comes to intimidate the oppressors. The oppressed, for their part, have been left with only one possible identity, which is one of violence. That becomes their politics and it appropriates their intellect.This brings us directly to the issue of \u201creasonable\u201d versus \u201cunreasonable\u201d violence. When dealing with violence deemed unreasonable, the dominating groups demonize violent responses, saying that \u201cthose other people are just like that,\u201d not just that they are worth less, but also that they are essentially evil, essentially criminal or essentially have a religion that is prone to killing.And yet, on the other side, state-legitimized violence, considered \u201creasonable\u201d by many, is altogether more frightening. Such violence argues that if a person wears a certain kind of clothing or belongs to a particular background, he or she is legally killable. Such violence is more alarming, because it is continuously justified by those in power.The fact is that when the pro-democracy spokesperson Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest there, she could bravely work against oppressive behavior on the part of the military government. But once she was released and wanted to secure and retain power, she became largely silent on the plight of these people and has sided with the majority party, which has continued to wage violence against non-Buddhist minorities. One school of thought says that in order to bring democracy in the future, she has to align herself with the majority party now. I want to give Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi the benefit of the doubt. But when the majority party is genocidal, there is a need to address that. Aligning with them cannot possibly bring democracy.However, rather than retreating back into focused identity politics, resistance in this context means connecting the plight of the Rohingya to global struggles, the context of which is needed in order to address any particular situation. Older, national, identity-based struggles like those you mention are less persuasive in a globalized world. All of this is especially relevant as Myanmar sets up its first stock exchange and prepares to enter the global capitalist system.In globalization as such, when the nation states are working in the interest of global capital, democracy is reduced to body counting, which often works against educated judgments. The state is trapped in the demands of finance capital. Resistance must know about financial regulation in order to demand it. This is bloodless resistance, and it has to be learned. We must produce knowledge of these seemingly abstract globalized systems so that we can challenge the social violence of unregulated capitalism.The passing of a law and the proof of its existence is not enough to assure effective resistance to oppression. Some of the gravest violations of rights have occurred within legal frameworks. And, if that law governs a society never trained in what Michel Foucault would call \u201cthe practice of freedom,\u201d it is there to be enforced by force alone, and the ones thus forced will find better and better loopholes around it.That is why the \u201cintuition\u201d of democracy is so vital when dealing with the poorest of the poor, groups who have come to believe their wretchedness is normal. And when it comes time to starve, they just tighten their nonexistent belts and have to suffer, fatefully accepting this in silence. It\u2019s more than children playing with rocks in the streets. It takes over every aspect of the people\u2019s existence. And yet these people still work, in the blazing heat, for little or next to nothing for wealthy landowners. This is a different kind of poverty.Against this, we have this glamorization of urban poverty by the wealthier philanthropist and aid agencies. There is always a fascination with the picture-perfect idea of poverty; children playing in open sewers and the rest of it. Of course, such lives are proof of grave social injustice. But top-down philanthropy, with no interest in an education that strengthens the soul, is counterproductive, an assurance that there will be no future resistance, only instant celebrity for the philanthropist.I say \u201cself-appointed\u201d entrepreneurs because there is often little or no regulation placed upon workers in the nongovernmental sector. At best, they are ad hoc workers picking up the slack for a neo-liberal state whose managerial ethos cannot be strong on redistribution,, and where structural constitutional resistance by citizens cannot be effective in the face of an unconstituted \u201crule of law\u201d operating, again, to protect the efficiency of global capital growth. The human rights lobby moves in to shame the state, and in ad hoc ways restores rights. But there is then no democratic follow-up, and these organizations rarely stick around long enough to see that.Another problem with these organizations is the way they emphasize capitalism\u2019s social productivity without mentioning capital\u2019s consistent need to sustain itself at the expense of curtailing the rights of some sectors of the population. This is all about the removal of access to structures of reparation: the disappearance of the welfare state, or its not coming into being at all.If we turn to \u201cdevelopment,\u201d we often see that what is sustained in sustainable development is cost-effectiveness and profit-maximization, with the minimum action necessary in terms of environmental responsibility. We could call such a thing \u201csustainable underdevelopment.\u201dToday everything is about urbanization, urban studies, metropolitan concerns, network societies and so on. Nobody in policy circles talks about the capitalization of land and how this links directly to the dispossession of people\u2019s rights. This is another line of inquiry any consideration of violence must take into account.After the revolution, in postcolonial Algeria and elsewhere, those women who were part of the struggle had to separate themselves from revolutionary liberation organizations that were running the state in order to continue fighting for their rights under separate initiatives. Gender is bigger and older than state formations and its fight is older than the fight for national liberation or the fight between capitalism and socialism. So we have to let questions of gender interrupt these revolutionary ideas, otherwise revolution simply reworks marked gender divisions in societies.I used the term \u201caffirmative sabotage\u201d to gloss on the usual meaning of sabotage: the deliberate ruining of the master\u2019s machine from the inside. Affirmative sabotage doesn\u2019t just ruin; the idea is of entering the discourse that you are criticizing fully, so that you can turn it around from inside. The only real and effective way you can sabotage something this way is when you are working intimately within it.This is particularly the case with the imperial intellectual tools, which have been developed not just upon the shoulders, but upon the backs of people for centuries. Let\u2019s take as a final example what Immanuel Kant says when developing his \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment.\u201d Not only does Kant insist that we need to imagine another person, he also insists for the need to internalize it to such an extent that it becomes second nature to think and feel with the other person.Leaving aside the fact that Kant doesn\u2019t talk about slavery whatsoever in his book, he even states that women and domestic servants are incapable of the civic imagination that would make them capable of cosmopolitan thinking. But, if you really think about it, it\u2019s women and domestic servants who were actually trained to think and feel like their masters. They constantly had to put themselves in the master\u2019s shoes, to enter into their thoughts and desires so much that it became second nature for them to serve.So this is how one sabotages. You accept the unbelievable and unrelenting brilliance of Kant\u2019s work, while confronting the imperial qualities he reproduces and showing the contradictions in this work. It is, in effect, to jolt philosophy with a reality check. It is to ask, for example, if this second-naturing of women, servants and others can be done without coercion, constraint and brainwashing. And, when the ruling race or class claims the right to do this, is there a problem of power being ignored in all their claimed benevolence? What would educated resistance look like in this case? It would misfire, because society is not ready for it. For that reason, one must continue to work \u2014 to quote Marx \u2014 for the possibility of a poetry of the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Keep Up, Big 12 Looks to Expand", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byOn College FootballPaul D. Ryan, the House speaker, turned to college football this week in persuading Texas delegates at the Republican National Convention to unify behind the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump.Ryan, of course, was booed. Under no circumstances does a Longhorns fan root for the Aggies, or vice versa.But earlier in his analogy, Ryan said something about the rivals that was nearly as tone-deaf, wistfully recalling the days \u201cwhen the Big 12 was the Big 12.\u201dAfter digesting the reports of two outside consultants, the 10 Big 12 members unanimously asked their commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, to vet several suitors for membership. That means that in the near future, the Big 12 could again feature 12 teams; it might even grow to 14.The Big 12 felt it needed to keep up.\u201cWe are continuing to operate in an environment that is filled with change, even over the period of a few days,\u201d the University of Oklahoma\u2019s president, David Boren, said, making sure to note that the annual media-rights payouts for Big 12 members would not be affected by any proposed expansion.It was less rah-rah, more green eyeshade.But such is life in the so-called Power 5 conferences, whose football and men\u2019s basketball deals add up to billions of dollars for their 65 member colleges. As an example: The 12-year College Football Playoff contract with ESPN, entering its third season, is worth $7.3 billion, with the vast majority of that money paid to those Power 5 leagues.That financial focus is especially the reality for the Big 12, which was born as a merger of two defunct conferences (the Southwest and the Big Eight); which lost members to three other leagues during the past several years of realignment; which suffered in 2014 when its lack of a conference championship game cost it a spot in the inaugural four-team national playoff (it will have a title game starting in 2017); and which is now the only Power 5 league without its own cable network, or plans for one.\u201cI believe schools added to our league will raise our national profile,\u201d John Currie, Kansas State\u2019s athletic director, said in an interview Wednesday.To take a cue from Ryan (and Trump), then, expansion will not make the Big 12 the Big 12 again. Nor will it restore longstanding annual rivalries that were obliterated by realignment \u2014 Kansas-Missouri or Texas-Texas A&M \u2014 or even bring about new ones. (There are teams in the Big 12 that Cincinnati, maybe the likeliest candidate for expansion, has never once played.)But expansion will spell greater stability and, eventually, more cash.The Big 12 is staring at an economically driven, zero-sum landscape in which other conferences\u2019 gains are frequently its losses. It is also looking at a media environment that seems rather resilient, despite the increased prevalence of so-called cord-cutters and cord-nevers \u2014 fancy words for people who no longer pay, or never paid, the monthly cable bills that finance billion-dollar rights deals.\u201cA digital network the A.C.C. is talking about with ESPN \u2014 it\u2019s a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not a big revenue generator,\u201d Pilson said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s added exposure. It looks good. It sounds good. But in terms of the real driver, which is revenue generation, I think the Big Ten is much more relevant.\u201dFor that reason, Pilson advised the Big 12 to take a page from the Big Ten\u2019s playbook. Much as the Big Ten, a traditionally Midwestern league, recently added Rutgers and Maryland to plant its flag near several East Coast population centers, the Big 12, whose members reside in Great Plains states and Texas (and West Virginia), ought to invite Connecticut to join, Pilson said.\u201cHaving Texas and Oklahoma and the other major Big 12 schools playing in the Northeast would create additional revenue opportunities and make it a more attractive conference in terms of new sponsors and a better linear television deal,\u201d Pilson said.Cincinnati and Connecticut \u2014 or Memphis, Brigham Young, Colorado State or Houston, to name a few other probable suitors \u2014 would find loveless marriages in the Big 12 compared with the passionate hatred that the Longhorns and the Aggies once consummated annually. But bringing them aboard would produce dollars and make sense.\u201cYou remember what Wayne Gretzky said,\u201d Kansas State\u2019s Currie said, paraphrasing the hockey star. \u201c\u2018I skate to where the puck will be, not where the puck is.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Singapore Cites Three Banks in Inquiry Into Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB Fund", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The authorities in Singapore said on Thursday that they had identified significant lapses in anti-money laundering controls at three banks tied to a global investigation into money from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.The Singapore authorities opened their own investigation into 1MDB-related flows of money last year. On Thursday, the authorities said they had seized 240 million Singapore dollars, or $177 million, worth of bank accounts and properties. About half of that belonged to the financier Jho Low and his immediate family, according to the statement from Singapore. Mr. Low is a friend of Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson and was named Wednesday in the Justice Department order, though he was not charged.Regarding the role played by DBS, Standard Chartered and UBS, the Singapore authorities said they had found \u201ccontrol failings\u201d at all three banks and, in some cases, \u201cweaknesses in the processes for accepting clients and monitoring transactions.\u201d The authorities also cited the banks for \u201cundue delay in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions,\u201d though they added that they had not identified misconduct by members of staff.In separate statements, the three lenders said that they took their compliance obligations seriously and had reported transactions to the authorities. They also said they were cooperating with the authorities.In the American investigation, the forfeiture complaint announced on Wednesday was issued by a unit known as the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and represents the largest such case brought by the Justice Department.The targeted assets include a $30.6 million Manhattan penthouse and a mansion in Los Angeles, properties that were bought by Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson, close friends and other associates after they diverted more than $3 billion from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, according to the complaint. Other high-profile outlays in the United States included the financing of movies like \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and the financing of purchases of paintings by Picasso and Monet.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Najib said his administration would \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the American inquiry. \u201cAllow the process to take its course, but I want to say categorically that we are serious about good governance,\u201d he said, according to The Associated Press.It also expressed \u201cstrong concerns at the insinuations and allegations that have been made against the Prime Minister of alleged criminal wrongdoing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back-Stabbing and Threats of a \u2018Suicide Parachute\u2019 at Hershey", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byHERSHEY, Pa. \u2014 One toasty afternoon in mid-July, four 10-year-old boys gave a tour of their home at the Milton Hershey School, a boarding school for at-risk children and one of many gifts bequeathed by the chocolate magnate to the community that bears his name.In the kitchen, a plate of brownies sat unattended. The boys yearned and stared \u2014 but kept their hands to themselves. This seemed so improbable that someone asked, Why aren\u2019t you guys grabbing dessert?\u201cWe\u2019re mature enough not to take stuff without asking,\u201d said Jayce, a blond-haired boy with a dimpled chin. \u201cBut if we were to ask,\u201d he added, raising a hopeful forefinger, \u201cwe would ask like this: \u2018May I please take a brownie?\u2019\u201dThanks to a historic gift by M.H.S.\u2019s founder, the Hershey Trust Company has an endowment of $12.3 billion and an ownership stake in Hershey Company, giving it control of the candy dynasty behind Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s and Hershey\u2019s Kisses, to name a few.With Hershey now the subject of a $23 billion takeover bid, the trust is enduring one of its periodic turns in the klieg lights, and the timing is hardly ideal. A leaked internal memo has revealed back-stabbing, allegations of insider trading and the threat of something called a \u201csuicide parachute.\u201dAll of this is happening as a dubious deal to buy a golf course continues to reverberate and as critics charge that members of the trust\u2019s board are more interested in earning hundreds of thousands of dollars on Hershey-related boards than in helping needy children.In the last 12 months the trust has spent more than $4 million on lawyers to investigate charges of misconduct that board members have lodged against one another. In one instance, Robert F. Cavanaugh, then the board\u2019s chairman, was accused of improperly securing a summer job for his son with JKMilne Asset Management, one of the trust\u2019s outside investment companies.In a sharp escalation, Mr. Cavanaugh, an M.H.S. alumnus who worked in real estate finance, accused two board members of trading Hershey stock on privileged information, which is basically the corporate version of crying \u201cMurder!\u201dAfter a small fortune in billable hours, all three board members were given a clean bill of ethical health. But this group operated in what was apparently a toxic atmosphere. Four board members have quit since late 2015, one after serving a mere three months.The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General sent a letter to the trust in February that gave the board until July 31 to adopt some changes or face possible legal action. On Friday, the attorney general announced a deal with the trust, unveiling an agreement that establishes term limits for board members and sets base compensation at $110,000 a year, before add-ons. Three trustees who have already served more than a decade will step down by the end of December. Two other long-timers, including the chairwoman, Velma A. Redmond, will stick around through 2017 to provide institutional memory.To the board\u2019s detractors \u2014 and there are many, in academia and in an alumni group called Protect the Hersheys\u2019 Children \u2014 the agreement is only the latest attempt at a tummy tuck for an institution that, they say, needs a heart transplant.Perhaps it is na\u00efve to expect that a treasure as immense as $12.3 billion could sit anywhere without producing at least some acrimony and intrigue. In a way, this is a tale about human nature, and how great gobs of cash evince both the best and worst of it. While the money is earmarked explicitly for disadvantaged children, its fate is decided by grown-ups. And while they may care deeply about the school, at the same time some are being enriched financially, and others \u2014 mostly elected officials \u2014 have shown motivations more political and economic than scholastic.During a recent interview at the Hershey Trust office, which operates out of the 22-room home that was once Mr. Hershey\u2019s, Ms. Redmond played down the internal squabbles. She and her colleagues were devoted to the school, she said, and ready to embrace change.\u201cThis is a new day,\u201d she said, as negotiations over the deal announced on Friday were unfolding. \u201cWe do have a heightened sensitivity to issues that have been brought up in the past, in terms of compensation, in terms of board collaboration. We are committed to a future in which we are more transparent and no longer carrying the baggage of the past.\u201dThis is precisely the kind of reset that has been promised for years, said Frederic Fouad, an M.H.S. alumnus and a Protect the Hershey\u2019s Children co-founder. He said the agreement changed nothing of substance and failed to address the systemic issues that have long plagued the trust.He and Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown, contend that it\u2019s absurd that board members are paid at all, other than to cover expenses. They say the school is more interested in bricks-and-mortar projects that help local vendors and the economy \u2014 more than $1 billion has been spent on upgrades and new construction in the last 20 years \u2014 than in expanding the student population.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a greater nonprofit scandal in the last 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Mr. Eisenberg, who has studied the trust and found its leadership and structure wanting. \u201cThe whole board needs to be replaced.\u201dThe warm, avuncular face of Milton Hershey beams from photographs hung just about everywhere here, the kind of ubiquity once associated mainly with communist nations and their maximum leaders. But Mr. Hershey, as everyone here calls him, more than 70 years after his death, is a kind of anti-Mao. The presence of his image seems like a token of heartfelt gratitude from locals who understand that the \u201csweetest place on earth,\u201d as it bills itself, would not exist without this mustachioed man and his chocolate fortune.He and his wife, Catherine, never had children of their own. In 1909 they founded the school, originally open only to white orphaned boys. Over the years, the criteria for students expanded and the student body now includes girls as well as children of all races, as long as they come from families at or near the poverty level.Lately, though, some of the biggest beneficiaries of the school are the members of its board. This stems from the odd structure that results when a nonprofit entity (the school) owns for-profit companies (the Hershey Trust Company, which is the source of the board members\u2019 salaries; the Hershey Company; and the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, which operates Hersheypark and other attractions).For years, three members of the trust board have sat on the board of the Hershey Company and one member has sat on the board of Hershey Entertainment. This makes a seat on the trust, which has paid about $100,000, a ticket to a perch on more lucrative boards: A Hershey Company board member is paid about $250,000.Trust watchers say the rancor may have originated with the extended tenure of people like Mr. Cavanaugh, who has served on the trust\u2019s board since 2003 and landed one of the trust\u2019s three Hershey Company board seats the same year. According to Hershey\u2019s most recent annual report to shareholders, Mr. Cavanaugh currently has $3.6 million in a deferred compensation account with the company.Historically, tenure on a board seat has had an informal 10-year limit. A few members elected in the early 2000s, including Mr. Cavanaugh, have stayed longer.When Mr. Cavanaugh learned last September that board members had apparently been conspiring behind his back, he expressed outrage, according to an internal memo that leaked to the news media.The memo, dated Sept. 30, 2015, and written by the former chief compliance officer of the trust, Marc Woolley, described a phone conversation in which Mr. Cavanaugh told Mr. Woolley he wanted to \u201ctake out\u201d members of the board who had run a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him. Mr. Cavanaugh also told Mr. Woolley that he was aware of a letter sent by four board members to every other member except for him.If that sounds high school, the tone of the conversation then took a dark turn. Mr. Cavanaugh threatened to deploy something he called a \u201csuicide parachute,\u201d though exactly what he meant is unclear. He also told Mr. Woolley, according to the memo, that he had \u201ca timeline mapped out\u201d of trades in Hershey stock by two board members, Joan Steel and James Nevels, implying that they were made improperly.\u201cHe stated,\u201d wrote Mr. Woolley in his memo, \u201cthat if I thought that the investigation into his dealings with J. K. Milne were long and expensive,\u201d that \u201cI had not seen anything yet.\u201dMr. Cavanaugh, in a statement, disputed Mr. Woolley\u2019s recounting of the conversation. \u201cI believe Mr. Woolley\u2019s memo contained a number of errors, misstatements and omissions that were self-serving and significantly changed the context of the conversation,\u201d he said. He said he had called Mr. Woolley to discuss matters involving board members and personnel, \u201cand to inform Mr. Woolley of my continued dissatisfaction with his job performance.\u201dIn the conversation, Mr. Cavanaugh also articulated his theory that a trust employee named John Estey was responsible for the friction on the board. Why he thought that, Mr. Cavanaugh did not say, but he told Mr. Woolley that \u201cJohn had better just continue to do work for the board.\u201dAs it happens, Mr. Estey\u2019s work for the board would soon end, though for reasons that had nothing to do with Hershey. A former state lobbyist, Mr. Estey had been caught in his former job in a 2011 sting by F.B.I. agents who were posing as favor-seeking executives of a fictional company. The \u201cexecutives\u201d provided Mr. Estey with $20,000 to give to lawmakers, a violation of state laws barring lobbyists from acting as conduits for corporate donations.But Mr. Estey handed over $7,000 to state politicians. The rest he kept. In May, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud. At that time, he was earning a salary from the trust of more than $900,000 a year.Mr. Woolley did not last at the trust much longer. In June, he was put on administrative leave. A few weeks ago, according to a spokesman for the trust, he was fired.The reason? \u201cThe trust considered Woolley a \u2018disgruntled employee,\u2019\u201d said a spokesman, Kent Jarrell, in an email. As evidence, Mr. Jarrell pointed to a letter, which Mr. Woolley helped write in November, in which he supposedly complained about the board.Reached by phone last week, Mr. Woolley said, \u201cI am anything but disgruntled. I\u2019m disappointed about the board and their issues, but I\u2019m passionate about the kids and the mission.\u201dA former farm boy, Mr. Hershey made chores a part of daily life for his orphans. Later, M.H.S. became known as one of the country\u2019s finest blue-collar vocational schools, with training in auto-body repair, carpentry, construction, printing and more. In an era without child welfare, it was a vast improvement over the alternative, which was destitution.Even during Mr. Hershey\u2019s time, money from the trust was used to develop the town\u2019s infrastructure and attractions. Usually these deals cause few ripples. But a 2006 purchase became a public relations disaster.The trust also spent $5 million on a Scottish-inspired restaurant and bar on the premises.After a torrent of negative publicity, the trust said that it had always planned to build student housing on the property as part of a school expansion. The original purchase announcement, though \u2014 issued well before the P.R. fiasco \u2014 stated that the acquisition \u201censures the long-term future of the championship-caliber course.\u201dGround is now being broken, according to the trust spokesman, for student homes on what was formerly known as Hershey Links.In 2010, Tom Corbett, then the attorney general, opened an investigation of the golf course deal. That inquiry was ultimately closed by the current attorney general, Kathleen G. Kane, soon after she took office in 2013. She found no criminal conduct and stated there was no evidence that Mr. Lenny participated in the trust\u2019s decision to buy the golf course. But she demanded reforms that were intended to curb pay, increase vigilance about conflicts of interest and hasten the recruitment of new members with backgrounds in at-risk children.Critics said there were no teeth in the agreement struck with the trust in 2013, which is why a do-over was required on Friday.Ms. Kane believes that the agreement simply needed an update. \u201cI would have been pleased if we didn\u2019t have to revisit the agreement,\u201d she said in a recent interview in her office, overlooking the State Capitol in Harrisburg. \u201cI thought at the time that what we signed in 2013 was a step forward, but times change, directors change, and you have to go back and make improvements.\u201dWhat, if anything, the recent agreement and the coming turnover of members mean for the Mondelez bid is unclear. Mondelez \u2014 the maker of Oreos, Ritz crackers and an assortment of gums, chocolates and mints \u2014 has not announced that it is giving up its pursuit of the company.On paper, the union makes a lot of strategic sense, according to Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar. Mondelez does not sell chocolate in the United States, and Hershey has never had a strong presence overseas.\u201cMondelez has vast geographic reach,\u201d Ms. Lash said. \u201cOnly 20 percent of its sales are in the U.S. Thirty-five percent are in Europe and the rest are in emerging markets, like Brazil, China, Russia and India.\u201dStill, for Mondelez to succeed, it would need to mount one of the greatest charm offensives in corporate history. To understand why, consider what happened in 2002, when board members of the school decided that the trust\u2019s portfolio was dangerously overweighted in Hershey stock. The group announced it was looking to sell Hershey, preferably to a company that could pay cash.It was a bold power play, possible only because it was supported by many of the people of Hershey and the Dauphin County Orphans\u2019 Court, which has jurisdiction over the trust.The plan was soon abandoned. Ten board members resigned.For good measure, the state legislature passed a law that year mandating that Hershey cannot be sold without the approval of the attorney general. While arguably a boon for the community, the law, according to Robert H. Sitkoff, a professor at Harvard Law School, was also indefensible.\u201cImagine if the legislature of New Jersey passed a bill that said Princeton had to invest more than half of its endowment in one local company?\u201d Mr. Sitkoff said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Pennsylvania Legislature did in 2002. It\u2019s outrageous. The trust is supposed to be rescuing needy kids.\u201dMondelez seems attuned to the obstacle course it would need to navigate to win Hershey. Already, the company has reportedly promised to relocate its global chocolate headquarters to Hershey, protect local jobs and take Hershey as its name.That\u2019s a start, said Mr. Fernandez, author of \u201cThe Chocolate Trust.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a great share price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about absolutely boosting the local economy, which is what the trust has been doing for years.\u201dMondelez, he said, might try to sway opponents of any deal by promising to add chocolate-making capacity in Hershey, or by naming trust board members to the Mondelez board.\u201cBasically, it will have to convince politicians in Harrisburg that it won\u2019t walk away in five years,\u201d he said.Whether a deal would be good for M.H.S. depends largely on whether the trustees properly manage the windfall. There are skeptics, such as Mr. Fouad of Protect the Hersheys\u2019 Children, who say the current members lack the kind of self-restraint demonstrated by those 10-year-old boys with that plate of brownies. But Mr. Fouad wants to see the sale anyway.\u201cThe board is incompetent,\u201d he maintains. \u201cBut it\u2019s far better to get the billions and then let the right people pressure them to reform. Failing to would be just another triumph of local interests and jobs over needy kids. And five decades of that is enough.\u201dAn article on July 31, about strife in the Hershey Trust Company, which controls Hershey, the candy dynasty, omitted a response from Robert F. Cavanaugh, the trust\u2019s former chairman, to an internal memorandum written by the trust\u2019s former chief compliance officer, Marc Woolley. In the memo, Mr. Woolley recounted a phone conversation in which Mr. Cavanaugh accused board members of running a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him. Mr. Cavanaugh\u2019s response disputed that memo, saying it contained \u201ca number of errors, misstatements and omissions that were self-serving and significantly changed the context of the conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And though Mr. Berlinger had final cut, it\u2019s hard to find a single moment here that would be out of place in a promotional video.If anyone has a complaint, we don\u2019t hear it. There are no in-depth interviews with employees or family members and no negative experiences. No film of Mr. Robbins\u2019s early seminars is shown, and nothing is revealed about his education or that of his small army of helpers. We alight only briefly on his childhood (the ghost of an abusive mother flits quickly past), and his wife joins a handful of lesser celebrities in admiring his authenticity.The rest is all hugs, tears and wrenching confessions, set to a meticulously curated soundtrack. Yet the film also dares us to write Mr. Robbins off as a huckster-genius; dipping behind the scenes, it exposes the intensive planning and detailed post-mortems that accompany each daily session. In those moments, we see a man who genuinely seems to care, zeroing in on at-risk souls and following up with money and referrals. But by restricting himself to showing how well Mr. Robbins does his job, Mr. Berlinger mainly reveals how narrowly he has done his own.\u201cTony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru\u201d opens Wednesday at IFC Center in Manhattan; on Friday it begins streaming on Netflix and opens in theaters nationally. It is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China\u2019s Economic Growth Figures Mean", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China on Friday reported its second-quarter economic growth figures. The numbers are among the world\u2019s most closely watched because the country has been a major driver of global economic growth. But data from China are notoriously questionable. This is what you should take away from Friday\u2019s results.China\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent compared with a year ago. Friday\u2019s figure suggests there\u2019s no reason to panic. China\u2019s economy is slowing but at a reasonable, steady pace well in line with Beijing\u2019s expectations. It also matches the first-quarter number, and still came in at a pace that other countries envy.Looking a bit closer, it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s slowdown is uneven. Some sectors, like mining and manufacturing, are being clobbered. Others, like e-commerce and nontraditional finance, are relative bright spots, while the housing market in some big cities is downright frothy.China\u2019s property investment in the first six months of the year rose 6.1 percent from a year ago, compared with 7 percent in the January-to-May period. That slight slowdown in June offers a reminder that new strength from China\u2019s property sector has been pretty uneven.To be sure, the rebound in the property market is helping to prop up growth across the country. Roughly one-quarter of China\u2019s economic activity is related to property. Last year a drop in the market hit China\u2019s growth results, as investors worried about an oversupply of unsold homes, especially in smaller cities, and put their money into stocks instead.Those worries appear to have been swept aside. Land purchases by developers have recovered as builders turn more optimistic. That is also good for local governments, which rely on revenue from land sales to fund a huge portion of their spending. New home sales and construction starts by developers are also rebounding strongly.The question is how sustainable this property recovery might be. Home prices in rich metropolises like Shenzhen and Shanghai are rising at rates reminiscent of dot-com stocks of another era. If the property market becomes just another Chinese bubble, it may not help offset the sharp slowdown among China\u2019s factories.China\u2019s June industrial production rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier, compared with 6 percent in May. Many traditional smokestack industries in China are still struggling, and that is dragging down the broader economy. Despite the slight rise in the June figure, industrial production data indicates that the manufacturing deceleration that China has seen for the last six years shows few signs of bottoming out.China\u2019s zombie factories \u2014 many state owned or state supported \u2014 continue to churn out goods that nobody buys. Weak overseas demand is another problem, and exports have continued to contract this year.There could be some light at the end of the tunnel. Factories would get a big lift if they could regain pricing power. Data on factory pricing shows that deflation appears to be easing at last after four tough years.But the bigger hope is that consumer demand can replace traditional industry as the main driver of China\u2019s economy.China\u2019s June retail sales rose 10.6 percent from a year ago. At first glance, Chinese consumers do appear to be stepping up their game, as June\u2019s figure was an improvement from May\u2019s. But May\u2019s figure was the weakest rate since the 2003 outbreak of SARS, once seasonal distortions like holidays are factored out.China bulls often point to the blistering pace of expansion of e-commerce as one of the country\u2019s brightest growth spots. Online sales of goods rose 27 percent in the first six months, data released Friday showed. Still, that is down sharply from their growth rate a year ago China bears would argue that online shopping platforms are just cannibalizing sales from traditional department stores.China has seen a dramatic falloff in investment by the private sector, previously China\u2019s biggest engine of investment growth. That could have been hugely destabilizing for employment, wages and the economy as a whole. But the government has stepped in with gusto, ramping up investment by the state.There are signs that Beijing is getting less bang for its buck, however, as new infrastructure works and other projects fail to generate the same economic returns that they did in years past. What\u2019s more, this investment surge is being bankrolled by an expanding credit binge. New bank lending has been growing gangbusters this year, raising the risk that China will face a painful day of reckoning further down the road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Uphill Fight to Curb the Pull of New York City\u2019s Lobbyists", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkIn a season rank with the stench of money in politics, you\u2019d think that a piece of legislation that would strike a small blow for better government, a wiser use of public funds, would sail through the New York City Council.You might think that, but you would be wrong.Right now, the speaker of the Council is sitting on a bill that would make sure that public money available under the city\u2019s imperfect \u2014 but pretty good \u2014 campaign finance law would not be used to bulk up the power of lobbyists.The speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, would not explain her thinking, when she might make a decision or whether she was speaking with lobbyists whose financial clout the new law would curb.In theory, under a law passed several years ago, people doing business with the city are limited to giving at most $400 per candidate. Look closely, though, and you can see the wormhole that hundreds of thousands of dollars flows through. Here\u2019s how it works.The city rewards campaigns that receive many small contributions, allotting $6 in public money for every $1 donated, up to a total of $175. A person can give as much as $4,950, but only the first $175 is matched. The law has the virtue of making a relatively modest donation of $175 worth $1,225 to the candidate. It is a democratizing force.Moreover, for people doing business with the city, nothing they give is matched with public dollars.The democratizing power of public financing is twisted in this process.Even though contributions from the bundlers themselves were not, in general, eligible to be matched with public money if they were doing business with the city, the individual contributions within their bundles did qualify. During the 2013 election, the public provided approximately $1.2 million additional money to what the bundlers brought in.In effect, the public was paying to give the bundlers even more clout.\u201cThe city should not be providing public dollars to amplify the already strong voices of special interests,\u201d said Ben Kallos, a Democratic councilman who is the chairman of the committee on governmental operations. In May, he held a hearing on a bill that would eliminate the matching contributions for money bundled by someone doing city business. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s counsel, Henry Berger, testified in favor.\u201cLobbyists play a number of roles in city government, some of which are very, very important,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cTheir influence on the electoral process as demonstrated in the 2013 campaign is significant, and can be reduced by this, and we think it is appropriate to do so.\u201dGene Russianoff, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, long an advocate for the public financing of campaigns, testified that the Council had first considered the loophole a decade ago but did nothing.\u201cThey made a mistake in 2006,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. The bundlers had every right to solicit money for campaigns, he said, but they should not be given public funds. \u201cWe have nothing against them expressing their views, but, you know, take your hands out of my pocket,\u201d he said.The money involved is only a tiny fraction of city spending, but Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, said, \u201cIt\u2019s really the principle behind it.\u201dMr. Russianoff said the Council could take a stand by passing the bill. \u201cIt has been a time of people\u2019s cynicism and despair in government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would benefit from this law not passing are those special interests.\u201dSuri Kasirer, a leading city lobbyist, said she was in favor of the bill; leaders of two other major lobbying firms, John Del Giorno and James Capalino, did not respond to requests for comment.Asked three times by email whether Ms. Mark-Viverito was speaking with lobbyists about the bill, her spokesman, Eric Koch, replied: \u201cSpeaker is reviewing the bill and it\u2019s going through our normal legislative process.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Navy Recovers Ship Containing at Least 300 Migrants\u2019 Bodies", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byOnly 28 migrants survived the shipwreck in April 2015; after the disaster, 169 bodies were retrieved. But the rest of the bodies \u2014 hundreds more \u2014 have remained trapped in the hull of the vessel for 14 months. With the ship now taken to shore, those remains will be removed for examination and identification by forensic experts, the Italian Navy said.The recovery project cost 9.5 million euros (about $10.5 million), took two months, and involved robots and remotely operated underwater vehicles. The effort was repeatedly interrupted because of adverse seas and weather, and the technical difficulties of extracting a wooden vessel from a depth of about 1,210 feet. Officials said the effort was important, not only to provide closure to relatives of the dead but also to draw attention to the horrific effects of human trafficking.\u201cI ordered the navy to recover the wreck to bury those brothers and sisters of ours who otherwise would have remained at the sea bottom forever,\u201d Mr. Renzi said. \u201cI did it because we Italians know the value of the word \u2018civilization.\u2019 \u201dThe dead migrants have a \u201cright to be remembered,\u201d he said.Italian firefighters were given the grim task of extracting the bodies from the vessel\u2019s hull and placing them in a refrigerated tent erected on the dock of a Sicilian military base.There, teams of forensic experts will work in shifts to inspect the remains, collecting items that the migrants might have carried and entering photographs and DNA samples into a database, where families may be able to confirm that their loved ones drowned.If the bodies are not claimed, they will be buried in Italy.On Thursday, even as the recovered vessel with hundreds of bodies was being towed toward Sicily, Italy\u2019s coast guard was carrying to shore those of 10 migrants from the waters near Libya. The migrants, all women, had died from either suffocation or being crushed during the sinking of a rubber boat, from which an additional 107 people were rescued.The coast guard also rescued yet another group of desperate people \u2014 116 migrants on a rubber dinghy \u2014 in roughly the same area on Thursday.Almost 70,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, slightly fewer than at this point last year, but with the milder summer weather, the number of arrivals is expected to increase.On Thursday, Italy\u2019s government repeated its call for Europe to increase efforts to save lives.Mr. Renzi has long advocated more financial help for Africa to tackle the issue at the source. Italy\u2019s government has proposed the issuance of \u201ceuro bonds,\u201d backed by the countries of the eurozone. These would finance the management of the migration crisis in countries that have been affected the most, like Italy and Greece, and encourage African countries to develop their economies, lessening the desperation that pushes migrants to risk their lives by fleeing.However, the economic terms of his proposal have so far been opposed by eurozone countries like Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Cars Are Too Expensive for the Typical Family, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserAS prices for new vehicles continue to rise, the cost of an average new car may be a stretch for typical households.\u201cThe new reality is that cars are becoming more expensive,\u201d said Steve Pounds, a personal finance analyst for Bankrate. \u201cPeople are having to make tough decisions about financing.\u201dBankrate calculated an \u201caffordable\u201d purchase price for major cities, using median incomes from United States census data, and factoring in costs for sales taxes and insurance. In San Jose, Calif. \u2014 the heart of Silicon Valley \u2014 the median income is about $84,000, and an \u201caffordable\u201d new car purchase price is about $33,000 \u2014 close to, but still below, the average new car price.In lower-income cities, however, affordable purchase prices for a typical family are far below the average cost of a new car. In Hartford, Conn., where the median income is about $29,000, an affordable purchase price is about $8,000 \u2014 about a quarter of the average new-car price.(Auto leases are also becoming more popular because they often offer lower payments than a traditional car loan. Leases accounted for more than 30 percent of new-car transactions in the first quarter, Experian reported. With a lease, the customer makes payments for a set period of time, then typically can choose either to return the car to the dealer or to buy it.)Bankrate noted that a traditional rule of thumb is the \u201c20/4/10\u201d rule: Car buyers should aim to put down at least 20 percent in cash, take out a loan for no more than four years and keep the cost of principal, interest and insurance to no more than 10 percent of household income.If you have to abandon those guidelines, the car you want may simply be too expensive. \u201cTo me, if you need to finance to five, six or seven years, you can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Jeff Bartlett, deputy cars editor at Consumer Reports.Here are some questions and answers about buying a new car:When is the best time to shop for a new car?While car sales may abound on holiday weekends like the Fourth of July, shopping on a run-of-the-mill weekday may actually be preferable. There is less traffic to deal with when taking test drives, and sales representatives have more time to answer your questions. \u201cBuy when it\u2019s right for you,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said, not just because dealers are promoting incentives.Mr. Pounds suggests shopping when car manufacturers are beginning to introduce new model years \u2014 typically in late summer or early fall. Prices may be more reasonable for the outgoing model year at that time. But be aware that you may have fewer vehicles to choose from.How can I make sure I\u2019m choosing the right financing option?People are often diligent about researching the type of car they want to buy, but they\u2019re much less likely to do their homework when it comes to financing the purchase, according to a report this month from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Should I buy a used car instead?Used cars, particularly those that are just two or three years old, often offer the best value, Mr. Bartlett said. Not only is the initial price lower, but costs like collision insurance and taxes are also lower. If getting the latest safety features, like automatic braking, is a priority, however, make sure to look only at very recent model years. And be sure, he said, to have a used car inspected by a reputable mechanic before you buy it.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Animating van Gogh\u2019s Life With 62,450 Oil Paintings", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byGDANSK, Poland \u2014 A project that daringly set out to bring to life iconic paintings \u2014 many created in just one day \u2014 has proved to be a staggeringly laborious cinematic effort taking years to realize.Of the 95 painters involved, 65 arrive every day at an enormous, sweltering hangar at the Gdansk Science and Technology Park here in northern Poland, to reimagine, amid thick fumes of oil paint, van Gogh\u2019s canvases.Last month, the hangar, filled with rows and rows of cubicles where the artists worked, was mostly silent, except for the sound of fans. Still, the atmosphere was charged.\u201cWhat is happening here may never happen again,\u201d said Hugh Welchman, a British producer who along with his wife, Dorota Kobiela, a Polish painter and filmmaker, has been directing \u201cLoving Vincent.\u201dThe Polish painter Jerzy Lisak, 39, in the last two years alone has painted more than 400 frames, or cels, and he agreed that the huge amount of effort involved may make this the first and last time for such an undertaking.\u201cIt\u2019s clear this is a realization of a dream,\u201d he said, working on a view of a room at the Auberge Ravoux, where van Gogh lived at the end of his life.Ms. Kobiela, who has made several animated shorts in a country that boasts an array of accomplished animators, supplied the vision. After rereading the artist\u2019s letters to his brother Theo, she decided to create an eight-minute painted animation based on van Gogh\u2019s work.\u201cI knew it would be difficult, bordering on crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vincent deserves more than eight minutes.\u201dMs. Kobiela, her face in her hands, still seemed overwhelmed by the project\u2019s magnitude.Ms. Kobiela and her team spent three years developing their painting technique, which they used to reimagine 125 of van Gogh\u2019s works. Live action was also involved. First, actors were filmed, either against a green screen or on sets built to look like the paintings. That footage then became a point of reference for artists, who painted over it with oil pigments, frame by frame.Each of the 1,009 establishing shots in \u201cLoving Vincent\u201d requires a new oil painting. To make the animation look fluid, every second of the nearly 87-minute film needs to consist of 12 hand-painted frames. Creating one frame takes from an hour to two days, which means that a painter may spend nearly a month on a single second of the film.At the end, there will be 62,450 frames, each of them complex oil paintings on canvas.There are, however, tens of thousands of frames still to go and not much time if the film is to be released, as planned, here in October. (The producers want it to be considered for the next Academy Awards.)\u201cThe biggest challenge now is to reconcile maintaining the high quality of painting with our very tight schedule,\u201d Ms. Kobiela said.Then production slowed when the pool of classically trained painters in Poland quickly dried up, and producers needed to look abroad for artists. After the trailer was posted, thousands of portfolios started to pour in from all over the world.Candidates were invited for tests and then 18 days of training, during which they had to master both van Gogh\u2019s style and the animation techniques.\u201cPeople had no guarantees that if they came here from, say, Canada, they would stay,\u201d the producer Sean Bobbitt said. \u201cThey knew we wouldn\u2019t reimburse them for the tickets or hotels.\u201dTiffanie Mang, 24, an artist from Los Angeles with short-cropped hair and green paint smudged on her nose, said she had no idea she would pass the test when she got on a 15-hour flight to Gdansk.\u201cI never traveled alone and lived on my own before, but I had to take this wild chance,\u201d she said on the 10th day of her training. \u201cThis film is going to make history, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Byzantine Path to Middle East Peace in \u2018Oslo\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-28", "News": "Supported byJ. T. Rogers shares that instinct. Unlike most of you, he has acted on it. Having combined investigative zeal and theatrical imagination with insider access, Mr. Rogers now invites you into the chambers where the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization were forged during nine fraught months in 1993.Yet what Mr. Rogers and the director, Bartlett Sher, have created is a streamlined time machine, comfortably appointed enough to forestall jet lag. Centering on one Norwegian couple who improbably initiated the diplomatic back channel that led to the epochal meeting of the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the P.L.O leader Yasir Arafat at the White House, \u201cOslo\u201d affectingly elicits the all-too-human factor in the weary machinations of state policy.Mona and Terje are (spoiler) more successful in their endeavors than Mr. Rogers\u2019s previous versions of such characters, at least in terms of immediate goals. But as embodied by (hooray!) Jennifer Ehle and Jefferson Mays, they are complicated beings in a less-than-perfect marriage with a sometimes faltering grasp of the international time bomb they have set ticking.It is Mona who serves as our wryly neutral narrator, sliding briefly and fluidly out of the action to place us on timelines and annotate references. She and Terje have been ingeniously conceived as perpetual, generally gracious hosts to the play itself and to the social encounters within, pouring drinks, moving furniture and overseeing the seating arrangements on Michael Yeargan\u2019s elegant, minimalist set.Of course, the gatherings they preside over have astronomically higher stakes than those of an average cocktail party. When the play begins, a dinner at Mona and Terje\u2019s home is interrupted by a phone call \u2014 two, actually, and simultaneous. It\u2019s Israel on one line and the P.L.O. on the other. The couple\u2019s guests, the Norwegian foreign minister Johan Jorgen Holst (T. Ryder Smith) and his wife, Marianne Heiberg (Henny Russell), are not pleased when Terje explains his goal of secretly bringing irreconcilable adversaries to the bargaining table.I leave it to historians to confirm or dispute the accuracy of Mr. Rogers\u2019s portrayals. But he has done a fine job of mapping the lively, confusing intersection where private personalities cross with public roles. The supporting ensemble members, some of whom are double-cast, create credibly idiosyncratic portraits, right down to the two-man security detail (Christopher McHale and Jeb Kreager) that arrives in the show\u2019s second half.Only occasionally does the script resort to the telegraphic shorthand of cute, defining quirks. The relationships that emerge from within and between the opposing camps are steeped in a poignant multifacetedness, as sworn enemies find themselves tentatively speaking the language of friendship. This is most eloquently embodied by Uri Savir, an Israeli cabinet member portrayed juicily by Michael Aronov as an exuberant rock-star dignitary, and Ahmed Qurie , the P.L.O. finance minister played with a careful balance of wariness and warmth by Anthony Azizi.The cast also memorably includes Daniel Oreskes and Daniel Jenkins as a pair of Rosencrantz-and-Guildenstern-ish academics from Haifa; Adam Dannheisser as an Israeli foreign minister with digestive problems; Joseph Siravo as a hard-line Jewish lawyer; and Dariush Kashani as a hard-line Marxist Palestinian. Mr. Oreskes also shows up as Shimon Peres. But the most famous power players in this drama, Rabin and Arafat, never appear, at least not in the flesh.However, at various points, different characters do imitations of the more famous politicians who remain in the wings. The ways in which these impersonations evolve, and the responses they provoke, create some of the play\u2019s tensest and funniest moments.It\u2019s no secret that politicians have to be actors, which the characters in \u201cOslo\u201d well know. Their understanding and re-creation of the signature styles of allies and enemies make for unexpected moments of personal catharsis and illumination. They also happen to be the stuff of crackling theater.Advertisement"}
