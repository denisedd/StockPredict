{"Headline": "Why Land and Homes Actually Tend to Be Disappointing Investments", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewBuy land: They\u2019re not making it anymore. That often repeated adage sounds like good financial advice.But over the long run, it hasn\u2019t been. Despite solid price increases over the last few years, land and homes have actually been disappointing investments. It\u2019s worth considering why.Let\u2019s start by looking at the numbers. The best long-term data on land in the United States is for farmland, which is valuable in its own right and can also be considered a great reservoir that can be converted to housing and other purposes at opportune times.What all that amounts to is that neither farmland nor housing has been a great place to invest money over the long term.For home prices, a good part of the answer comes from supply and demand. As prices rise, companies build more houses and the supply floods the market, keeping prices down.The supply response to increasing demand may help explain why real home prices nationwide fell 35 percent from 2006 to 2012 (and even more in some cities). Investment in residential structures in the United States was at near-record levels as a percentage of G.D.P. just before the price declines. Prices have been rebounding since then \u2014 and so has construction of new houses.But it is true they aren\u2019t making land anymore. And, in fact, farmland prices have done better than home prices over the last century as well as in the worst years for housing, the years bracketing the recent financial crisis. Real farm property values actually rose 21 percent over the full financial crisis, that is, between 2006 and 2012. For farmland, there was only a small 3 percent drop in real price from 2008 to 2009, which was quickly reversed.The effects of this revolution are complicated. One might think that progress that improves yield per acre would put upward pressure on land prices. But that is not necessarily so, if it occurs globally and prevents food price increases that would otherwise earn farmers more revenue.Of course, underneath every home is a piece of land. Although that is typically only a bit of former farmland, it is often in an urban or suburban area, where a plot of land tends to cost much more than in the country.Sometimes that little piece of land dominates the value of the home, particularly in dense urban areas. But if we are to understand long-term trends, we need to realize what land represents, even in Manhattan or Silicon Valley or any booming area. People in such places usually aren\u2019t buying land for its own sake but for the myriad services that housing provides. A home is not just a place to sleep and store clothing and keepsakes. It can be a place that is convenient to a stimulating place of work, good schools and entertainment and, indeed, part of an entire human community.These services have developed enormously over the last 100 years, changing the spatial and geographic dimensions of housing. There are vastly more highways and automobiles, telephones and various electronic connections, enabling people to leave center cities and still obtain the housing services they want. Thus, from a long-term perspective, these developments relieved a great deal of the upward pressure on home prices in cities.When you add all this together, the slow long-term pace of farmland and home price increases is not surprising. Nor would it be shocking if this trend continued for the next century, despite price surges over the last few years.A more extreme outcome is also quite plausible. In a hundred years, we might even see much of our former farmland converted back to wildlife preserves. In fact, it\u2019s far from inconceivable that the real price of land could be even lower than it is right now.ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May, New British Prime Minister, Gives Boris Johnson a Key Post", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported bySpeaking as she arrived at the prime minister\u2019s office at 10 Downing Street, Ms. May, 59, who had served for six years as home secretary, sought to position herself firmly in the tradition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism, stressing her commitment to helping the underprivileged and pledging to fight \u201cburning injustice.\u201d She also promised to preside over an economy that benefits everyone.\u201cAs we leave the European Union we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not just for a privileged few but for every one of us,\u201d Ms. May said, as her husband, Philip, stood nearby.Another notable appointment was that of David Davis, a former minister for Europe and a longstanding Euroskeptic, to lead a new department responsible for exiting the European Union. Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, will take charge of international trade.Ms. May has effectively handed Mr. Johnson, Mr. Davis and Mr. Fox the responsibility for successfully carrying out the withdrawal \u2014 known as Brexit \u2014 which they repeatedly promised would yield new opportunities.Putting crucial international portfolios firmly in the hands of Brexit supporters was perhaps an astute move for Ms. May, who had argued, tepidly, for Britain to remain in the European Union.Even so, Mr. Johnson\u2019s elevation to such a prestigious post represents a remarkable change of fortunes in a career that has had its share of them. He played a key role in the extraordinary national dramas of the last few months, abandoning Mr. Cameron, who desperately tried to keep Britain in the European Union, and cheerfully becoming the public face of the Brexit campaign.Yet when Mr. Cameron announced his resignation after the referendum, Mr. Johnson\u2019s hopes of succeeding him as Conservative Party leader were undermined by another Brexit supporter, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, who threw aside his support for Mr. Johnson and announced his own candidacy. Mr. Gove argued that Mr. Johnson was not up to the job.Ms. May herself recently mocked Mr. Johnson\u2019s negotiating skills over London\u2019s purchase of used German water cannons when he was mayor. She blocked the use of the cannons, citing fears that they could cause serious injuries.Among other appointments, Ms. May promoted Amber Rudd, former energy secretary, to home secretary. That ensures that one of the biggest political offices \u2014 and Ms. May\u2019s old job \u2014 remains in the hands of a woman. The new prime minister chose Philip Hammond, who had been foreign secretary, as chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing George Osborne, a close Cameron ally.Just an hour or so before Ms. May spoke outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron stood in the same spot, flanked by his wife, Samantha, and their three children, paying tribute to his family and his key staff members who had supported him.\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as the leader of my party for almost 11 years,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cMy only wish is continued success for this great country that I love so very much.\u201dMr. Cameron cited the nation\u2019s economic recovery as his top legacy. \u201cWith the deficit cut by two-thirds, two and a half million more people in work and one million more businesses, there can be no doubt that our economy is immeasurably stronger,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m delighted that for the second time in British history, the new prime minister will be a woman, and once again a Conservative,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cI believe Theresa will provide strong and stable leadership in fulfilling the Conservative manifesto on which we were elected, and I wish her well in negotiating the best possible terms for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\u201dOn Wednesday, the discussion was more respectful \u2014 and lighthearted \u2014 than usual, as Mr. Cameron\u2019s political adversaries and allies paid tribute to him.An article on July 14 about the appointment of new ministers by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain referred imprecisely to soccer teams in Britain in relating a joking comment from a Northern Ireland lawmaker in Parliament to the departing prime minister, David Cameron, about vacant leadership roles he could fill. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own teams (and the English manager position was open at the time), but outside of special events (like the 2012 Olympic Games), there is no soccer team for all of Britain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Strain Grows From \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The financial strains from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union are starting to show, as worries ripple through the country\u2019s real estate market.In the most prominent sign of the pressure, three major real estate funds have frozen withdrawals in the last two days, to slow the exodus of nervous investors. By doing so, the funds are trying to prevent a vicious cycle of selling that could force them to dump assets at ultralow prices, deepen losses and prompt more investors to rush for the exit.The turbulence after the so-called Brexit vote has been high, as investors rapidly exchange risky assets for safer havens. Yields on American Treasuries have touched new lows, while the pound is down sharply. Stocks have been shaky, and shares in some British real estate companies have shed more than a third of their value.The three real estate funds \u2014 run by Standard Life, Aviva Investors and M&G Investments \u2014 each pointed to heightened levels of stress in the market prompting investors to sell. A top British regulator on Tuesday highlighted the potential risk to such funds, which invest heavily in assets that are tough to sell quickly.\u201cThe reality is we don\u2019t fully know what the economic impact of the Brexit is going to be,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, a British financial services company. \u201cThe concern is it\u2019s going to be negative.\u201dAuthorities around the world are paying close attention to the economic, financial and political fallout of the vote, and have plans to move quickly to keep the damage from spreading too far and too fast. The reverberations could test whether, since the global financial crisis, officials have put in place the necessary measures to protect the broader system from a shock.The Bank of England, Britain\u2019s central bank, warned on Tuesday that the environment had become \u201cchallenging,\u201d noting that there were \u201ctightening credit conditions\u201d in the commercial real estate market. To help provide support for the economy, the central bank cut the buffer that British banks need to keep on their books, a move that should allow them to lend more to business and consumers.\u201cWhen combined with the already strong balance sheets of U.K. banks, today\u2019s action means that U.K. households and business who want to seize viable opportunities in a postreferendum world can be confident they will be supported by the financial system,\u201d the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said on Tuesday. \u201cFinancial institutions, like the rest of us, desire certainty in order to plan for the future.\u201dFunds that invest in the British property market look particularly vulnerable in the wake of the Brexit vote.Real estate, particularly high-end properties in London, boomed in recent years as interest rates remained at record lows. Investors, in turn, chased yield, creating huge demand for mutual funds that invested heavily in the country\u2019s malls, office towers and residential developments.While they represent a small piece of the mutual fund world, such investments have \u00a325 billion in assets under management. The Aviva, Standard Life and M&G funds account for about one-third of that market, according to Mr. Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown.Even before the vote, the signs of stress were apparent in the real estate market. Ever-rising prices prompted concerns about a property bubble. Construction activity in Britain posted its weakest performance in seven years in June, driven in part by a steep decline in residential construction ahead of the referendum, according to the latest Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which was released on Monday.But the sector has been shaken by new uncertainty since Britain decided to exit the European Union. London\u2019s future as a regional hub for commerce is in doubt. Cities across Europe are looking to lure companies and jobs. An economic slowdown is an increasing possibility.Mutual funds that focus on real estate face a particular problem in the current tumult. Such funds hold assets that are difficult to trade, but investors can ask for their money back at anytime. When investors panic, the redemption requests can quickly exhaust the funds\u2019 cash on hand.Last December, an American mutual fund run by Third Avenue ran into a similar problem, reflecting the portfolio\u2019s significant exposure to the riskiest types of high-yield bonds. Rather than unload assets into a difficult market, the managers opted to bar the door.With withdrawals mounting, the managers at Aviva Investors, M&G Investments and Standard Life decided it was prudent to do the same.A day earlier, Standard Life Investments, the asset management unit of the large British insurance company, also halted redemption requests in its U.K. Real Estate Fund. It said it had seen an increase in requests for redemptions \u201cas a result of uncertainty for the U.K. commercial real estate market following the E.U. referendum result.\u201dSuch funds are already proving a point of concern for the British authorities.The Bank of England\u2019s report on Tuesday noted that \u201cvaluations in some segments of the market, notably the prime London market, had become stretched.\u201d It warned that any fall in commercial property prices could be \u201camplified\u201d by investors and real estate funds.\u201cThese open-ended funds could be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet redemptions,\u201d the report noted.At a news conference after the release of the report, Andrew Bailey, the head of one of Britain\u2019s financial regulators, said that so-called open-ended real estate funds faced a structural problem, in that their assets did not \u201crevalue naturally\u201d in the market.Mr. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said it was \u201csensible\u201d to suspend all withdrawals, because authorities did not want those who \u201cget to the door quickly to get a better deal than those that don\u2019t.\u201dBut he conceded that the authorities believed there was a mismatch between such tradable funds and their investments in illiquid real estate assets, and needed to look at \u201cthe design of these things,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.Officials from the Financial Conduct Authority were to meet with major asset managers on Tuesday to discuss the impact of the Brexit referendum, a spokeswoman said.The Investment Association, an industry group that represents British fund managers, said that the use of suspensions of redemptions is an important tool that prevents fund managers from being forced to sell too quickly and achieve better results for clients.\u201cSuspension is a mechanism that is laid out under stringent F.C.A. regulations, and when it is employed by one of our members, it shows that the regulations are working as they are supposed to,\u201d the group said.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Failure of 2 Health Insurer Mergers Is Unlikely to Stop the Efforts", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byNo matter the fate of the deals between Anthem and Cigna, and Aetna and Humana, hospitals, doctors\u2019 groups and even insurers are almost certain to continue their scramble to find partners in a rapidly changing environment. Blockbuster deals may slow, but smaller combinations will remain attractive.The reason: Size matters. As hospitals combine with other hospitals and doctors\u2019 groups, their growth is fueling health insurance companies\u2019 desire to merge, to get more clout in negotiating how much they will pay for care.\u201cWhile these two large mergers are the largest deals to be done historically, if they don\u2019t go through, you\u2019re still going to have the same challenges,\u201d said Bret Schroeder, a health care analyst for PA Consulting Group. \u201cYou\u2019ll absolutely see activity.\u201d\u201cThe insurance mergers are a direct result of the provider mergers over the last five years,\u201d Mr. Schroeder said.Instead of five large health insurers, the mergers would leave three enormous entities that could potentially dominate different segments of the market.People who are covered through their employers would most likely have fewer choices of plans, and they might have fewer options when shopping for an individual policy on the state exchanges or picking a private Medicare plan in some areas.The companies argue that the mergers would help them become more efficient and better able to provide care at reduced cost. But skeptics say such that mergers rarely, if ever, benefit consumers and that they hope the federal government\u2019s actions will give pause to some of the plans.\u201cI hope this will have the effect of throwing a large bucket of cold water on the mindless urge to merge,\u201d said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University.But Mr. Gaynor acknowledges there are many forces driving the consolidation, and he expects efforts to combine will continue.\u201cI don\u2019t think this means a cessation in merger activity in health care,\u201d he said.If the Justice Department blocks the mergers \u2014 a decision is expected within the next week or so, according to a person briefed on the matter \u2014 the largest companies may be more reluctant to try combining with another large entity. UnitedHealth Group, for example, appears very unlikely to try to acquire Anthem, which is its closest rival.\u201cIt does make it more challenging,\u201d said Ana Gupte, a health care analyst for Leerink Partners, referring to the expected action by the Justice Department.But the large insurers could set their sights on one of the publicly traded companies that specialize in Medicaid, like WellCare, as a way of broadening their presence in that market.And Humana, the smallest of the four insurers now in play, could still be appealing to one of the other suitors if the deal with Aetna falls through. Humana specializes in private Medicare plans and could add more of a presence in that market to companies wanting to increase that business.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question Anthem or Cigna goes after Humana,\u201d Ms. Gupte said.Analysts say Anthem, in particular, may be on the prowl. The company operates for-profit Blue Cross plans in 14 states and has a history of buying nonprofit Blue Cross plans as a way of extending its reach.\u201cThey are going to feel some pressure to do some sort of smaller buys out there,\u201d said Paula Wade, an analyst with Decision Resources Group, who follows the industry. \u201cIt would be very small and gradual.\u201dThe insurers could also look further afield. UnitedHealth, with its Optum unit, is a skilled builder of a portfolio of diverse businesses. The other insurers could follow suit by buying a pharmacy benefit manager, a chain of urgent care centers or something similar, said Ms. Gupte.Even if the largest insurers avoid big deals, they are most likely to pursue buying somewhat smaller companies \u2014 acquisitions that are unlikely to raise the ire of regulators.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be massive pressure for consolidation, just based on the A.C.A.,\u201d said Rob Fuller, a former hospital executive who is a lawyer at Nelson Hardiman, referring to the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in significant changes to health insurance and the overall market.The law encourages much closer coordination in health care, he said, and insurers and hospitals need more customers to be much more efficient. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to achieve the economies of scale unless you allow consolidation,\u201d he said.He described the challenges by the F.T.C. and the Justice Department as \u201ca Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of thing,\u201d with some areas of the government actively pushing consolidation and others opposing it.Analysts see little to stop the fundamental drive toward these combinations as health insurers and hospitals seek the kind of scale necessary to invest in technology and data tools and worry about being left out as others partner.\u201cThe direction that health care is going is very much favorable to that concentration,\u201d Ms. Wade said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Postpones Naming Running Mate", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump said on Twitter that he was delaying his announcement after the \u201chorrible attack\u201d in Nice. He did not specify when the event would go forward.In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.Before the attack in southern France, Mr. Pence, a mild-mannered Midwesterner popular with conservatives and evangelical Christians, appeared to be all but locked in as the Republican nominee for vice president \u2014 the last man standing after a madcap selection process unlike any in recent presidential politics.But a certain resolution to the process remained elusive after several days of unusually frenzied and public deliberations by Mr. Trump and his family, as well as extraordinarily overt campaigning for the job by several potential running mates. After huddling with Mr. Pence in Indiana, flying multiple other candidates to Indianapolis for last-minute interviews, hinting to party leaders that his decision had been made and then frantically denying it to the news media, Mr. Trump delayed his decision entirely.Against a backdrop of images from Nice, Mr. Trump repeatedly described himself as the \u201claw-and-order candidate\u201d in the presidential race.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers told national Republican officials that they were preparing to make an announcement with Mr. Pence, and people close to Mr. Pence notified his political allies that they expected him to be chosen, according to numerous people with knowledge of the conversations, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.On Thursday afternoon, television stations in Indiana and New York reported that Mr. Pence had flown from Indiana to Teterboro Airport, arriving in New Jersey late Thursday afternoon for the planned Friday morning event in Midtown Manhattan.But Mr. Trump himself has sent conflicting signals in recent days, as he has subjected his potential running mates to a final round of screening. As of Thursday afternoon, he had not yet formally invited Mr. Pence to join his ticket, nor had he notified two other contenders, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, of his decision, according to people with direct knowledge of the process.Mr. Trump has appeared to vacillate over his choice. Long accustomed to making important strategic decisions by sheer improvisation, he is now faced with the most permanent, and perhaps most important, decision of the campaign.The delay has the potential to complicate a partnership with Mr. Pence, who must file papers in Indiana by noon on Friday withdrawing from his re-election campaign in order for Republicans to field a new candidate for the race.Paul Manafort, the chairman of the Trump campaign, said at midday Thursday that the campaign had not notified anyone of a final decision.\u201dWe have not been reaching out to Washington to tell them to prepare for any particular candidate,\u201d Mr. Manafort said by phone.Mr. Pence\u2019s staunch conservative views on certain social issues, like gay rights and abortion, may inject a new set of concerns into the general election debate that have been largely overlooked with Mr. Trump at the top of the Republican ticket.Mr. Gingrich added that he had told Mr. Trump that a Trump-Gingrich combination would be a bolder pairing of \u201ctwo pirates\u201d on the same ticket.Selecting Mr. Pence, by contrast, might ease relations between Mr. Trump and Republicans in Washington, where party leaders have eyed his every move with grave apprehension.Republicans on Capitol Hill spoke approvingly of Mr. Pence on Thursday: He is seen among his former colleagues there as a conventional politician with standard-issue conservative beliefs, including on some subjects where his policy instincts plainly conflict with Mr. Trump\u2019s.Mr. Pence has endorsed free-trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Asian trade deal that Mr. Trump has described as a \u201crape\u201d of the American economy. As a House member, Mr. Pence also voted for the Iraq War, which Trump has condemned, and last winter he denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s call to ban all Muslim immigration into the United States.If those views place Mr. Pence at odds with Mr. Trump, they are in line with the outlook of Republican leaders in Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s no secret I\u2019m a big fan of Mike Pence\u2019s,\u201d said Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House from Wisconsin. \u201cWe\u2019re very good friends. I have very high regard for him. I hope that he picks a good movement conservative. Clearly, Mike is one of those.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said picking Mr. Pence would be a \u201cgood move by Donald Trump.\u201d Mr. McConnell, who has sharply rebuked Mr. Trump in recent weeks for his indiscipline on the campaign trail, said he would \u201clook forward to enthusiastically supporting the ticket.\u201dTo Democrats, Mr. Pence cuts an unimposing profile, and party officials said Thursday they considered him unlikely to transform Mr. Trump\u2019s deeply unpopular public image. On the contrary, his archconservative social views could help motivate liberal voters and young people to turn out for Hillary Clinton in the fall.At the same time, Democrats have looked with some dismay at Mr. Trump\u2019s tenacity in the Midwest, and at his unusual popularity with white men. Mr. Pence could reinforce Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths in both areas.The Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, indicated that the focus of the fall campaign would be Mr. Trump himself.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to help him that much, no matter who he picks,\u201d Mr. Reid said.For Mr. Trump, selecting Mr. Pence would be a sharp departure from habit, and the surest sign yet that he intends to submit to at least some standard political pressures in the general election.Mr. Pence\u2019s public audition for the No. 2 spot, when he appeared with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at a rally in Westfield, Ind., went well. Standing ramrod straight, Mr. Pence offered five and a half minutes of high-energy remarks, frequently turning his fire to Hillary Clinton in an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he could be an attack dog against her.But in the past, Mr. Trump has leaned heavily on a tiny circle of trusted friends and advisers, and has crafted his major political decisions to shock and titillate the news media and Republican primary voters.Mr. Pence is a laid-back personality who does not have the same set of showman\u2019s instincts as Mr. Trump or other vice-presidential contenders like Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Christie.And the Indiana governor has only the scantiest of personal relationships with the man whose political future has rapidly melded with his own.David M.

{"Headline": "Democrats, Looking Past Obama, Are a Party Without a Cause", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 When President Obama takes the stage here this week to begin his monthslong political farewell, it will mark a bittersweet moment for Democrats.But without the unifying presence of Mr. Obama in the White House, or the organizing aim of expanding health care, it is unclear who will hold the party together and what will be the next great project of liberalism.For the moment, Hillary Clinton and her party have an industrial-strength adhesive: keeping Donald J. Trump out of the Oval Office. But interviews with a range of Democrats indicate that, if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she will lead a party that is unified around social tolerance, but sharply divided over how to achieve economic justice in an era of upheaval.There is still a shared view that broadening opportunity for all remains at the heart of the Democratic Party. \u201cThe bumper sticker is now \u2018income fairness,\u2019\u201d said Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman.Yet there is no consensus over how to address the country\u2019s persistent wage stagnation, or even if any sweeping legislation can be achieved at all in a time of deepening polarization and when the Republican Party has little desire to compromise.For now, many in the party whose presidents ushered in Social Security, the G.I. Bill and civil rights seem most focused on infrastructure.\u201cWho\u2019s against infrastructure?\u201d Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said.Yet beyond this short-term objective, there are clashing views about how to further the cause of economic equality at a moment of technological transformation. Centrist Democrats are focused largely on changes to the tax code, work-force development and other incremental steps to help people adjust to a shifting workplace.Last week in Cleveland, New York Times photographers covered the Republican National Convention at \u2014 and outside of \u2014 Quicken Loans Arena.\u201cWe all believe in economic opportunity for everybody,\u201d Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said. \u201cThe difference between myself and Senator Sanders and Senator Warren,\u201d he added, referring to Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, \u201cis they think that\u2019s not happening because the system is rigged, and I think it\u2019s not happening because the system is changing.\u201dThe strength of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, however, has emboldened liberals and made them unwilling to settle for small-bore changes to the political system.\u201cMany working people were inspired by his message of aiming higher, not for continuity,\u201d said Larry Cohen, the former president of the communications workers\u2019 union and a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders. Echoing the former candidate, Mr. Cohen said major changes were needed to the country\u2019s campaign finance laws, banks and trade laws.\u201cThe way we put food on the table and higher education within reach is to create a democracy where working people count as much as wealthy people,\u201d he said.Mary Kay Henry, the president of the service workers\u2019 union, said the party\u2019s liberal platform reflected Democrats\u2019 \u201cchoice to meet the moment\u201d and the pressure that progressive activists have applied to the party elite.\u201cWe think that government now has to play a role in backing the collective action happening all across the progressive movement,\u201d Ms. Henry said, pointing to efforts to organize fast-food workers as one example.But for Democrats facing re-election in two years, especially in more competitive parts of the country, there is more of an appetite for conciliation than for confrontation.\u201cIt\u2019s important to show the American people that Washington can work,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \u201cI personally feel urgency about getting some things done.\u201d\u201cPurity tests,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, \u201care not a recipe for getting things done.\u201dEven if Democrats could agree on their next grand ambition, it would be difficult to push through a Congress where at least one chamber is likely to still be controlled by Republicans.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, as Ms. McCaskill ruefully noted, is unlikely to take up legislation to make college tuition-free. (Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act at a time when his party had overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate.)So what to do when facing the demands of an energized left in a period of divided government?Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies say they expect she would compromise to make what progress she can.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine are making their debut after she named him her running mate.

We remember the victories, but too often we forget the game.\u201dMs. Abrams pointed to a need for progress on crucial quality-of-life issues, made more urgent by changes in the family and workplace that she said highlighted the need for expanded family leave and child-care benefits.\u201cDemocrats are the architects of health care and Social Security,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now that we\u2019ve got the foundation in place, we need the caulking that holds society together.\u201dMr. Warner has also been focused on the passing of laws to better reflect the country\u2019s shifting economy. \u201cThirty-five percent of the work force is at some level of contingent work status,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the social contract is set up on the basis of the full-time worker. So we need portable benefits now.\u201dIf it is all something of a scattershot approach, that is in part because if reflects both the political limitations of the moment and the thorny nature of addressing economic opportunity at a time of persistent wage stagnation.But Democrats take solace in what has taken place in this most unlikely of elections, with an avowed democratic socialist emerging as a political force in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party being seized by a candidate who ran explicitly against key elements of the party\u2019s free-market orthodoxy.\u201cIf you look at Trump voters and you look at our primary, there seems to be willingness for bolder answers,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cWe can\u2019t reach Trump voters on nativism, but we can reach them on bolder answers to economic challenges.\u201dIndeed, many Democrats believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s populism has sent a shudder through Republican ranks, driving home the need to respond to economic anxieties with something more potent than tax cuts.Or as Mr. Frank put it: \u201cEvery time we used to bring up income inequality, we were dismissed with two words: class warfare. Well, that ended this year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Little of its market is actually in Britain, so it won\u2019t be affected if the United Kingdom has a recession. It doesn\u2019t have higher raw materials cost, something affecting other British companies as the pound fell after the decision to exit from the European Union. The company is well run and doesn\u2019t need fixing.That does make ARM something of a special case. But with the pound down and the dollar and the yen up after the so-called Brexit, it\u2019s almost certain that plenty of bankers working for tech companies are looking to buy. And there are more British assets that could go to foreign hands.If the issue is tech companies that don\u2019t rely on the British economy, there is also Inmarsat, a 37-year-old operator of a global satellite communications network. Its customers are global. ARM\u2019s future, and one reason SoftBank bought ARM, is the growth prospects of the sensor-rich internet of things. Satellite communications, and the communications spectrum that Inmarsat has, also look strong.Perhaps the greatest British tech assets are big phone companies like BT Group or Vodafone, which both operate across scores of countries. Those would be enormous acquisitions, of course; at a dinner with AT&T executives last week, I was told that the telecommunications firm, one of the few that could afford such an acquisition, is not interested.There are other British businesses with large foreign presences, like Shazam, the music service; SwiftKey, which uses artificial intelligence to make phone keyboards easier to use; or a number of companies in cloud computing. Of course, pretty much any company that lives primarily on the internet has no need to depend on a country\u2019s local market, and can easily move many of its assets to another location.There is one more British asset that can easily slip the British market: people with good tech skills. Those are not companies, but they have no problem taking their most valuable skills somewhere else. Of course, many of them already have, at the British offices of companies like Google, Facebook and Apple.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Purged Chinese Leader\u2019s Inside Look at Communist Leadership", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 Retired and dead Chinese Communist Party leaders who join the official pantheon are usually feted with the publication of their collected works. Generally, the fat volumes of speeches and writings are rarely read by anyone except the occasional scholar and party members ordered to study them.Now, however, an unnamed group of Mr. Zhao\u2019s former associates, in cooperation with his family, has published \u201cCollected Works,\u201d a four-volume set of his speeches and writings from the 1980s, when he helped steer China\u2019s economic overhauls and increasingly clashed with conservatives who opposed his ideas for a measure of political liberalization.\u201cAs an academic publishing house that takes a neutral stance, the Chinese University Press continues its work as normal,\u201d Ms. Gan said.Even so, the unnamed Chinese compilers omitted major speeches that Mr. Zhao made in 1989, when he was forced from power after Deng authorized using armed force to clear student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square, Ms. Gan said. The soldiers pushed into Beijing on June 3, killing hundreds of people by many accounts, and they took the square in the early hours of June 4.Ms. Gan said the editors of the collection deliberately avoided speeches that Mr. Zhao gave around the time of the Tiananmen protests because the issue was \u201ctoo complicated.\u201d The main objective of publishing his works, she said, was to \u201csum up the experiences and lessons of the first decade of reform and opening up.\u201dBut \u201cCollected Works\u201d will add nuance to understanding his time, and they vividly show an abiding problem for Chinese leaders, even today: how to square economic liberalization with the ideological underpinnings of Communist Party power.In the 1980s, conflicts between those priorities grew increasingly acute. Mr. Zhao was promoted to premier in 1980 on the basis of his success in southwest Sichuan Province, where he loosened controls on farming and industry. He was promoted to party general secretary in 1987, succeeding Hu Yaobang, whom Deng had demoted for his failure to extinguish dissent and student protests.Mr. Zhao\u2019s speeches as party leader show him trying to mollify ideological conservatives, alarmed by the spread of liberal ideas and dissent, while preserving the momentum of economic adjustment. And all the time, he had to satisfy the party elders, especially Deng, watching over his shoulder.Those tensions became increasingly sharp from early 1987, when Deng began a campaign against \u201cbourgeois liberalization,\u201d a term for liberal and dissenting ideas. Mr. Zhao strained to carry out the campaign while keeping a firewall to ensure that it did not spill over into the economy and reverse market reforms.\u201cWe must determinedly struggle against the wave of bourgeois, but at the same time must be extremely careful about policy boundaries,\u201d Mr. Zhao said in a speech in January 1987 reprinted in \u201cCollected Works.\u201d \u201cIn fact, failing to reform would surely spur on bourgeois liberalization.\u201dIn his memoirs, Mr. Zhao described how he only haltingly came to believe that successful economic change would also require overhauling China\u2019s political institutions, allowing for greater public participation and official accountability. He was never a fully fledged democrat but came to believe that China\u2019s top-down government needed to adapt to changing times.One of the most interesting documents in the works is Mr. Zhao\u2019s blueprint for political reorganization from October 1987. There and in an accompanying speech, Mr. Zhao argued that the party could maintain control while introducing changes that removed it from day-to-day government administration and gave citizens and businesses more autonomy and say over their affairs.\u201cReform of the political system must proceed in a measured, orderly way under the leadership of the party,\u201d the blueprint said. \u201cOf course, no matter how much forethought is given, it will be hard to avoid a few problems.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wine of One\u2019s Own? They\u2019ll Drink to That", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Supported byThe French region of Bordeaux is the sacred home of Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild and Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, so it would seem unlikely that wines named Duke of Juice or Bone Ami would come from there.But some winemakers insist on it. And they are entitled, because they pay $12,500 to $25,000 a barrel or $44 to $87 a bottle to create personalized Bordeaux wine and labels.\u201cI had dreamed about someday buying a vineyard, but it\u2019s a very capital-intensive and thankless business,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Boucraut, 46, a French commodities executive based in Dubai who flies in with two longtime friends to sample their Viniv creation. \u201cI thought this was brilliant. You can make your own wine with all the advantages and none of the inconveniences.\u201dThey named their wine Racine Carr\u00e9e de Neuf, or \u201csquare root of nine\u201d in French. The three share a tech background, hence the nerdy label.It sounds a bit like Build-a-Bear for oenophiles, but Viniv has cachet and a growing clientele across Europe, Australia and the United States. D.I.Y. cabernet sauvignon isn\u2019t the only enticement. Stephen Bolger, 52, the C.E.O. and founder of Viniv, describes his business as an \u201cexperiential luxury company.\u201dAnd \u201cexperiential luxury\u201d is the new Birkin bag. Nowadays, marketing experts say, the affluent are not content merely to own expensive things, like Cartier watches or Ferraris. Increasingly they prefer to collect one-of-a-kind moments, and perhaps post them on Instagram.\u201cWealthy tourists don\u2019t want to sit with other tourists; they want to connect with real people and get a story, something they can describe as a really cool, unbelievable experience,\u201d said Jack Ezon, president of Ovation Vacations, a luxury travel agency that arranges for clients to dance in a rehearsal of the Bolshoi Ballet, throw pots with Peruvian artisans or design their own shoes in the Salvatore Ferragamo studio. (Mr. Ezon also does bar mitzvahs \u2014 in Sardinia.)Travel agents like Mr. Ezon are selling veritable virtual reality: a fantasy adventure with real people and no goggles.Conspicuous consumption hasn\u2019t gone away. Sales of yachts, sports cars and jewelry are higher than they were before the 2008 financial crisis, according to Wealth-X, a research firm that focuses on U.H.N.W.I.: ultra high-net-worth individuals.But the global recession did calm things down a bit at the top end. \u201cThere was a values shift after 2008 away from ostentatious materialism,\u201d said Marie-C\u00e9cile Cervellon, a professor of marketing at the French business school Edhec. High-end consumers are instead spending on personal fulfillment and family bonding, albeit in rarefied places.Jeff Fromm, a partner at the Barkley ad agency and co-author of \u201cMarketing to Millennials,\u201d calls it a version of a \u201cmillennial mind-set\u201d that is spreading across generations. \u201cOne in four millennials would prefer to pay money for an experience rather than for a product,\u201d he said.In 2014, the Boston Consulting Group warned, \u201cNo luxury firm can ignore the accelerating shift from \u2018having\u2019 to \u2018being.\u2019\u201dMr. Johnson, 45, a custom cigar maker and entrepreneur in Los Angeles, has made five vintages since then, including Bone Ami, in homage to his Rottweiler, and Tatouage French for tattoo, in homage to his ornately inked forearms. (Duke of Juice is also his.) He figures he has spent more than $150,000 making wines at Viniv, not including airfare and hotels.\u201cI am making the best possible wine for my palate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your two-buck Chuck.\u201dViniv caters to clients who are willing to commit the time, travel and expense \u2014 and break a Bordeaux taboo. Mr. Bolger offers customers three grape varietals from 13 different vineyards, allowing them to mix a cabernet sauvignon from Pauillac with a merlot from Pomerol. For the wine establishment of Bordeaux, blending grapes from different appellations is the vintner\u2019s equivalent of fantasy football, or eugenics.\u201cI recently had an older farmer who refused to sell me his vines,\u201d Mr. Bolger said. But he also said rejections were rare because Viniv wines are not commercially sold; they are savored by their creators.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a gimmick,\u201d Mr. Bolger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real and entirely different way of producing fine wine.\u201d And make a splash. \u201cI think it\u2019s fun at dinner parties to pour my own wine for friends instead of something banal,\u201d Mr. Boucraut explained.Many clients say they go there not just to make wine, but to enter a sophisticated world closed to ordinary tourists.In the spring, the vineyards around Pauillac are lined with wild poppies. Wisteria twists over the walls of stately chateaus and medieval churches. The bistros serve oysters from Arcachon Bay. And Mr. Bolger organizes tastings and private meals at neighboring chateaus, including even Chateau Petrus, which for ordinary tourists is harder to visit than Norad.Ch\u00e2teau Lynch-Bages also provides private tours, tailored to V.I.P. customers. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimate, not a typical tour where they give you a thimble of wine and a canned speech,\u201d said Hank Werronen, 73, a retired health care executive and entrepreneur in Arlington, Va. He discovered Viniv after winning a trip to Bordeaux at an American Heart Association benefit auction.\u201cI\u2019m not just making a wine, I\u2019m making a memory,\u201d he said.He blended one barrel in 2015 with the 2014 vintage, then in 2016 recruited friends to share the cost of five more barrels with the 2015 vintage. \u201cIt\u2019s the engagement that is so rewarding,\u201d Mr. Werronen said. \u201cYou develop deeply personal relationships with the winemakers of Ch\u00e2teau Lynch-Bages: It\u2019s a family business.\u201dThe owners of Lynch-Bages, the Cazes family, are multigeneration winemakers, led by the patriarch, Jean-Michel Cazes, 81, who looks like a better-fed John Huston. His grandfather, a farmworker, bought the vineyard during the 1930s depression when most of the grand Bordeaux family vineyards went bust.In the early 1970s, when the wine business was particularly bad, Mr. Cazes began courting American tourists and welcoming them to his own chateau. By the 1980s, the dollar was so strong that his wife, Thereza, felt besieged by houseguests. He said Mrs. Cazes eventually put her foot down. \u201cShe told me, \u2018I am tired of having breakfast with total strangers in their pajamas.\u2019\u201dCh\u00e2teau Lynch-Bages gets about 20,000 visitors a year. Viniv has more than 500 clients.Over the years, Mr. Cazes developed Bages, a tiny, once-deserted farm community into a microvillage of about 100 residents that looks like a set from the movie \u201cChocolat.\u201d There is no pharmacy or post office, but the family created a charming bistro, a boulangerie and a gift shop that sells books and wine but no gaudy souvenirs. \u201cWe are not Mont-St.-Michel,\u201d Mr. Cazes said primly.Crushpad fell on hard times and closed in 2012, but by then Mr. Bolger had paired up with Mr. Brill to create a Bordeaux branch, which he spun off into its own company in 2009. Viniv really took off, he said, when the Cazeses became co-owners in 2012, adding their prestige and winemaking operation to the project.Viniv clients get to actually taste their wines. Mr. Werronen said he invited his wine partners to blind-test their blend with a French one in the same price category, a Petit Haut Lafitte that sells for about $40 to $50 a bottle.The verdict was unanimous, Mr. Werronen said. \u201cWe thought ours was measurably better.\u201dAn article last Sunday about do-it-yourself wine blending and other luxury experiences referred incompletely to V.I.P. tours that include lunch and a shoe-designing experience. The lunch is with Salvatore Ferragamo, the grandson and namesake of the founder of the Ferragamo shoe company, not the founder himself, who died in 1960. The shoe studio is owned by the Ferragamo company, not the younger Mr. Ferragamo, who is a winemaker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, the World Is Going Berserk, but Inner Peace Is Still Possible", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byEssayTo all but the most flamboyantly neurotic residents of Manhattan, who feel that anything more than 25 minutes spent in the woods will devolve into a horror movie, it is clear what is unnerving about metropolitan life: both human and vehicular congestion and the pollution, aural and environmental, to which they give rise. Our biggest cities are plagued by housing shortages, egregious displays of income inequality, status anxiety, inadequate schools and ailing infrastructure. This, if we allowed our imaginations to be colonized by stories like the one of a Minneapolis bridge collapsing over the Mississippi River nine years ago, killing more than a dozen people, would mean we would rarely travel over water or under it. In pedestrian friendly cities, there is the worry of pedestrian fatalities. In New York, in the summer, you will always find a contingent of people nervous about air-conditioners falling out of high-rise windows and killing them.These are merely the baseline triggers of distress. We can add to them the potentially catastrophic twin threats of terrorism and climate change, fears against which neither money nor position provide much of a buffer. Crime has plummeted during the last two decades, but a shattered relationship between the police and the public has replaced it as one of the country\u2019s most pressing civic problems. The last eight months have passed as a calendar of tragedy: Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, Orlando, Baton Rouge, Dallas, Nice. Terrible things can and do happen anywhere, of course, but they have been happening with greater frequency and rippling devastation in major cities.Will this cause a retrenchment from the opportunities that cities offer, an exodus? It is possible, but current demographic predictions have the world\u2019s urban population surpassing six billion by 2045. In 1990, there were 10 \u201cmegacities\u201d in the world, meaning cities with inhabitants of 10 million or more. By 2014, that number had nearly tripled. Within the next 15 years, the United Nations projects, there will be more than 40 megacities. By 2050, about 70 percent of the world\u2019s population will be urban. After 9/11, you often heard people talk about leaving New York \u2014 perhaps it was safer to live in the country. Some people did move, but the population of the city has grown over the last 15 years \u2014 in Lower Manhattan, it has doubled. And since 9/11, the city has witnessed one of the most aggressive real-estate booms in its history.Every generation surely finds cause to believe it is living with more dread and turmoil than the last. In his epic poem, \u201cThe Age of Anxiety,\u201d published in the 1940s, W. H. Auden seemed to recognize this, \u201cNow is the age of anxiety,\u201d he wrote. But we could reasonably ask how, individually and collectively, the urban psyche might be managed during this particularly tense and fractious time.On a certain level, the culture is engaged in this management reflexively. One way to understand a widespread cosmopolitan trend like the farm-to-table movement, which has taken over culinary life, is to see it as a sublimation of our apprehensions about a world in which terrible threats to our survival come from ever expanding maps. The appeal of the locovore life, the chalkboard menu, the craft-paper tablecloth, the cream from the cow that lives in a meadow no more than 108 commuter minutes north of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is the illusion of a controlled intimacy we\u2019ve lost in a world where public space seems so imperiled by the maniacal expression of distant values and ideologies. The hunger, for derivation, has been literalized.In some ways, we may even be turning away from some of the anonymity the online world affords. The digital economy has given birth to dozens of online meal-delivery services during the last few years. You can order meals from restaurants several neighborhoods away, or you can receive a recipe with all the premeasured ingredients to make a dinner yourself. A new company, called Umi, imagines that if you don\u2019t have time to make dinner yourself, you might want to have a neighbor make it for you. Not too long ago, I attended a street fair in my neighborhood in Brooklyn where a middle-aged woman, an eager home cook who lived a few blocks away, handed me a small bag of granola she had made as a sampling of what she might do if I signed up with the service. Immerse yourself too deeply into the world of online retail and you can exclude yourself from a good deal of everyday human interaction, but here was a model that tried to, or might at least might help, promote relationships among people living relatively close to one another who might otherwise be strangers.When something terrible happens, you need to be able to rely on those near you. For their part, municipal and other local leaders need to communicate effectively during times of crisis to reduce panic. In terms of what can be done to that end during the course of more ordinary life, leaders can help us edit down our worry list. Two years ago, when the arrival of Ebola was causing concern, Mayor Bill de Blasio, in New York, handled the moment with great equanimity and reason, refusing to stoke fears (Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo talked instead, at one point, of the possibility of casual transmission on subways, a notion based in uncertain evidence and one with no potential to soothe.)After the killings in Orlando and Nice, many civilians might find comfort in an approach to counterterrorism that, beyond the purview of foreign policy and law enforcement, incorporated some of the work of social service agencies. In each of those mass killings, the perpetrators had a history of domestic violence. Is there a way to divine what sort of abusive personalities might be prone to extreme acts of violence? Can they be helped before they act? The \u201csee it, say something\u201d aphorism deployed in New York City after 9/11, mostly for the purpose of registering lone packages in mass transit, might be broadened to include getting people the help they need. Are we sufficiently investigating how much can be done on the mental-health side in terms of prevention?Given that horror repeats itself, that faith in our political institutions is low, that new ways to kill people (weaponizing trucks) are devised too often, it can seem almost irrational not to worry. But maybe, inner peace experienced at least sometimes isn\u2019t as elusive as we think.Advertisement"}

Instead, we all just sort of bounce along in the present, caught in the headlights of a tomorrow pushed by a few large corporations and shaped by the inescapable logic of hyper-efficiency \u2014 a future heading straight for us. It\u2019s not just future shock; we now have future blindness.It didn\u2019t have to come to this. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as the American government began to spend huge sums in the Cold War, futurists became the high priests of the coming age. Forecasting became institutionalized; research institutes like RAND, SRI and MITRE worked on long-range projections about technology, global politics and weaponry, and world leaders and businesses took their forecasts as seriously as news of the present day.In 1972, the federal government even blessed the emerging field of futurism with a new research agency, the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which reviewed proposed legislation for its long-term effects. Futurists were optimistic about lawmakers\u2019 new interest in the long term.\u201c\u2018Futurist\u2019 always sounded like this weird, made-up, science-fiction term,\u2019\u201d Ms. Webb said, even though in its early years, people were doing deep, nuanced research on how various tech and social movements would shape the world.The end of the Cold War and a rise in partisan political interests also changed how lawmakers saw the utility of looking at the future. In the Reagan years, many on the right began to see the government as the cause of most of the nation\u2019s ills. The idea that the government could do something as difficult as predict the future came to be considered a ridiculous waste of money.Yet without soliciting advice from a class of professionals charged with thinking systematically about the future, we risk rushing into tomorrow headlong, without a plan.\u201cIt is ridiculous that the United States is one of the only nations of our size and scope in the world that no longer has an office that is dedicated to rigorous, nonpartisan research about the future,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t do that is insane.\u201dOr, as Mr. Toffler put it in \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d \u201cChange is avalanching upon our heads and most people are grotesquely unprepared to cope with it.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

Trump.And with the Republican nominee basing his campaign on his background as a businessman, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media executive and philanthropist, may help counter the Trump sales pitch.It is unusual, but not unheard-of, for a speaker who is not a member of a political party to address that party\u2019s convention. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to speak on Wednesday, the same evening as President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Bloomberg and Mrs. Clinton are not personally close but had a positive working relationship when he served as mayor and she as a senator from New York.Mr. Wolfson said the Clinton campaign had contacted Mr. Bloomberg several weeks ago to ask if he would be willing to address the convention. Mr. Bloomberg, he said, mulled over the idea and ultimately agreed to speak, after drafting a speech that reflected his distinctive set of political views rather than a boilerplate Democratic message.Mr. Wolfson also said Mr. Bloomberg was pleased by the selection of Senator Tim Kaine, a former governor of Virginia and a strong supporter of gun control, as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate.Mr. Bloomberg is not an entirely natural fit for the Democratic Party of 2016: Though he has been an energetic advocate on issues related to guns, immigration and climate change, he has also been a vocal ally of the financial services industry and has defended the strict policing tactics his administration employed in New York.Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, said Mr. Bloomberg would bring to the convention \u201ca unique and important voice that lays out the choice in this election.\u201d\u201cAs a business leader and philanthropist, Michael Bloomberg has lived his values and fought to make a difference for others,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the past, Mr. Bloomberg has rebuked Democrats for attacking Wall Street \u2014 a part of his record that may sit uneasily with liberal Democrats, and especially with the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who are already smarting from his defeat.Mr. Bloomberg has been quiet in recent months about the presidential race. But in the past, he has criticized Mr. Trump in stark terms, describing him as a threat to American security.Mr. Bloomberg castigated Mr. Trump at the time for his proposals to ban Muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, as well as his pledge to launch trade wars with China and Japan.\u201cThese moves would divide us at home and compromise our moral leadership around the world,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg wrote. \u201cThe end result would be to embolden our enemies, threaten the security of our allies, and put our own men and women in uniform at greater risk.\u201dIn April, he warned in a commencement address at the University of Michigan that the country faced an unprecedented political threat from \u201cdemagogues\u201d in both parties.Mr. Bloomberg, who served for 12 years as the mayor of New York, has never addressed a political convention in a partisan capacity.

{"Headline": "Theresa May, Untested and Ascending to Manage \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBut her steady and cautious public profile, and her swift, ultimately unchallenged ascent in the wake of the political chaos set off by the country\u2019s stunning decision to leave the European Union, has left supporters and opponents alike lacking a clear sense of whether she is up to the job.The task before her is daunting. She must negotiate the terms of the country\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc in a way that minimizes the economic damage but lives up to the spirit of the vote, especially in limiting immigration, while at the same time seeking to maintain British influence on the global stage.She is confronting strains on the continued existence of the United Kingdom as currently constituted, with Scotland again agitating for independence and some republicans in Northern Ireland trying to use the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union as reason to advance the cause of unification with Ireland.And like leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, she is facing populist political forces that are challenging traditional ideologies and electoral coalitions, introducing a volatile element into governance.But the circumstances also provide her with a fair amount of room to maneuver. Nearly every other senior figure in the governing Conservative Party was either sidelined or put in political peril by the vote on Europe, leaving a leadership vacuum that she is now filling with support from across the party\u2019s fractious elements. The opposition Labour Party is in disarray and at risk of splitting.In her one substantive campaign appearance before the rapid sequence of events on Monday that cleared the way for her to take power, she set out a vision of a Conservative government intent on doing much more than decoupling from Europe and eager to seize the political center. Seeking to address the underlying causes of the vote to leave the union, she suggested that she would address the anxieties and frustrations of the British who feel left behind or imperiled by globalization and its effects, including inequality.\u201cWithin the Conservative Party some of her obvious foes have either been undermined, or have undermined themselves, so she does have a clear opportunity,\u201d said Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. He also said that the Labour Party was \u201calmost in an existential crisis and those who are talking about it possibly splitting are not too far-off.\u201dMr. Cowley said that Ms. May faced formidable challenges, but added that there was a golden rule of sorts in British politics: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Theresa May.\u201dHer transition moved ahead rapidly on Tuesday. Prime Minister David Cameron chaired his 215th and final cabinet meeting, planned to go to Queen Elizabeth II with his resignation after a final appearance before Parliament on Wednesday and was already preparing to move out of 10 Downing Street to make room for Ms. May.She will take office on Wednesday, though little known internationally and having never held an economic or foreign policy position in government.Though Ms. May has sometimes been compared to Britain\u2019s previous female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, Ms. May\u2019s centrist-like speech in Birmingham provoked comparisons to the agenda of the former Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband. One former Labour adviser, Tom Baldwin, posted on Twitter: \u201cTory PM-elect steals Ed Miliband\u2019s slogan.\u201dMs. May is expected to make big changes in the current cabinet. Among those at greatest risk is the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who was once a rival and the leading contender to succeed Mr. Cameron but whose prospects were wrecked by his aggressive campaigning for Britain to remain in the union.Ms. May\u2019s speech on Monday hinted that Mr. Osborne had presided over an economy that contributed to a referendum result that many see as the consequence of a broader malaise in Britain. \u201cThere is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said in the speech.The daughter of a clergyman, Ms. May was regarded as a modernizer in the Conservative Party before taking over at the Home Office. In 2002, she told Conservative Party activists that they risked being known as members of the \u201cnasty party.\u201dYet the issue of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will almost inevitably define Ms. May, too, because her primary task is to negotiate a new relationship with the bloc. She has made clear that the outcome of the referendum is the final word on Britain\u2019s membership in the union, but she appears intent on moving cautiously. That is, in part, because she sided with those who wanted to remain, so her every move will be watched closely by those in her party who championed leaving.One important issue is when the government will begin negotiating formally with Europe by invoking Article 50 of the union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty, which effectively gives a two-year deadline for a deal on withdrawal to be reached.Ms. May does not plan to depart the union quickly because it could put Britain\u2019s negotiators under pressure, and at a disadvantage.Some Brexit supporters want to move fast to lock in the referendum result. Nigel Farage, who recently announced his resignation as leader of the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, said in a statement that \u201cto hold faith with over 17 million voters who opted for Leave, she must trigger Article 50 at the earliest realistic opportunity,\u201d adding that \u201cUKIP will be watching like a hawk to ensure that there is no backsliding.\u201dOne challenge for Ms. May is that the country did not vote on a specific plan to replace Britain\u2019s current relationship with Europe.\u201cThe problem is that nobody knows what Brexit means,\u201d said Professor Cowley. \u201cAlmost anything she can deliver is going to disappoint somebody \u2014 perhaps by being insufficiently restrictive on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those who voted for Brexit expecting big cuts in immigration \u2014 or even repatriation \u2014 are going to be disappointed,\u201d he added.Talks on the exit are most likely to come down to a trade-off between the amount of access Britain wants to Europe\u2019s single market of goods and services and the extent to which it curbs the free movement of workers that this entails. While big business will press for access to the single market, Ms. May will be under pressure from Brexit supporters to deliver cuts in immigration.And the longer Britain drifts, the greater the uncertainty for businesses that could postpone investment decisions until things are clearer, potentially pushing the nation into a recession.The financial markets have been encouraged by Ms. May\u2019s appointment, but they are not celebrating yet.\u201cThe speed at which the Conservative Party has rallied around May is heartening and promises greater clarity around upcoming negotiations. This is probably the most important political development, and a positive one,\u201d wrote Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC global asset management.\u201cOn the other hand, tangential Brexit risks have become more dangerous,\u201d he added, citing Britain\u2019s commercial real estate market where there are fears that foreigners will relocate their businesses and homes abroad.Delivering Brexit will therefore be Ms. May\u2019s defining task and, as Mr. Cowley puts it, this will hardly be easy. \u201cIf the pessimistic scenario for Brexit comes true, she is going to be delivering all this against the background of economic difficulty,\u201d he added.Follow Stephen Castle on Twitter @_StephenCastleAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Deal on New Jersey Gas Tax, Christie Orders Shutdown of Road Projects", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byFor months, Gov. Chris Christie had said that New Jersey\u2019s transportation funding was not in a crisis, even as the state inched closer toward exhausting its principal fund for roads, bridges and mass transit.But after Mr. Christie embraced plans this week to raise the state\u2019s gas tax, and the Democratic-led State Senate balked at the proposed trade-offs, Mr. Christie quickly changed his tune.Shortly after 11 p.m. on Thursday, Mr. Christie declared a state of emergency and moved to shut down most road work. Allowing the transportation fund to go broke would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d and jeopardize people\u2019s safety, Mr. Christie said in an executive order.By raising the prospect of potholes going unfixed and construction workers being laid off, Mr. Christie ratcheted up the pressure on state lawmakers to reach an agreement. But his sudden turnabout stunned politicians and interest groups in the state.The governor directed the state transportation commissioner and the executive director of New Jersey Transit to submit plans by Saturday night for an \u201cimmediate and orderly shutdown\u201d of most work funded by the state transportation trust fund. Any work that is federally funded or necessary for safety reasons could continue, Mr. Christie said.Mr. Christie, a Republican, had reached a deal with the Democratic-led State Assembly earlier in the week to raise the state\u2019s gas tax in exchange for lowering the sales tax. But on Thursday, Democratic leaders in the State Senate said they could not support the agreement because it would harm the state budget.State transportation officials said that stop-work orders were unlikely to go into effect quickly enough to affect the Fourth of July weekend and that such work was rarely scheduled for holiday weekends.Still, concerns over snarled traffic could cause some people to think twice about using the roads, said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University who had been closely watching the debate over transportation funding.\u201cEven if the average New Jerseyan doesn\u2019t see this over the weekend, there is an element of uncertainty that is damaging to the state,\u201d she said.The surprise order came as Mr. Christie was being vetted as a possible running mate for Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Mr. Christie had agreed to support a gas-tax increase in exchange for lowering the state sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent by 2018.Lowering the sales tax would cut revenue by about $1.7 billion each year after it is fully implemented, while the changes to the gas tax would increase revenue by about $1.1 billion each year, according to the state\u2019s Office of Legislative Services.On Thursday night, Mr. Christie rebuked Senate leaders for failing to approve the legislation. The transportation trust fund is expected to run out of money by August, the executive order said.State Senate leaders favor an earlier plan supported by some lawmakers in both houses to raise the gas tax and phase out the estate tax. Under both proposals, the gas tax would rise by about 23 cents per gallon.Mr. Christie\u2019s decision could intensify political pressure on the Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat who has close ties to labor unions and may run for governor next year.\u201cYou can bet that organized labor and all of the associated businesses will be putting pressure on Sweeney to compromise in some way,\u201d Professor Harrison said.On Friday, Mr. Sweeney said in a statement that he was disappointed by the governor\u2019s decision and that it would lead to layoffs.It was unclear when lawmakers might return to Trenton to address transportation funding; Vincent Prieto, the Assembly speaker, said negotiations could resume during the second week of July. Mr. Christie is expected to attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which starts on July 18.For years, lawmakers and transit advocates have raised alarm about the need for a new source of funding for the state\u2019s roads, bridges and transit system. But Mr. Christie, who ended his presidential campaign this year, was reluctant to raise taxes and said the funding was not in crisis.New Jersey\u2019s gas tax is the second lowest in the country, at 14.5 cents per gallon. Both proposals would raise it to about 37.5 cents per gallon, still less than New York State\u2019s gas tax.On Friday, Mr. Prieto said the Assembly was willing to compromise with the Senate on the legislation.\u201cWe all know we need a transportation funding plan the governor will sign and we need it as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Prieto, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cThis is too important for jobs \u2014 especially in our construction industry \u2014 and our economy to allow this to continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attack in Nice, France, Represents Terrorism\u2019s New Reality", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterFor all the years of worry that terrorists would develop more sophisticated methods, Thursday\u2019s attack in Nice realized a fear that turned out to be far worse: a form of violence so crude that it renders many of our usual defenses useless.The attacker, in ramming a plain white truck through crowds of holiday revelers, killed 84 people and remade an everyday vehicle, a familiar sight on streets around the world, into an object of menace and fear.No group has claimed the attack. The attacker\u2019s motivation remains unknown, as do questions of whether he acted alone.And yet this act, whatever its particulars, represents the culmination of long-building trends, in which terror tactics become more rudimentary and the targets more random. It is forcing a recognition that security and intelligence measures, long the core of Western thinking, are of limited utility and can never provide total safety from an individual who decides to kill.This is shifting pressure onto more abstract and unproven counterterrorism methods that do not promise to halt violence but merely ameliorate underlying political or social drivers. And it is straining the politics of Western countries, where leaders have spent the past 15 years describing terrorism as a war that could be won.The populations targeted by terrorism are confronting a difficult new reality, in which the danger can be managed or policed but perhaps never entirely overcome.The attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, established a narrative that has shaped Western thinking on terrorism ever since, even as many analysts consider that view obsolete.The enemy, whether Al Qaeda or some other group, became seen as a cohesive group that operated from far away. That enemy coordinated complex, military-style assaults against a subset of targets that, while civilian, held symbolic or political value. Governments could anticipate and defend the targets, monitor or disrupt the groups, and ultimately defeat them by targeting their leaders and seizing their territory.But the threat has evolved into something much harder to counter. Insurgent groups in mid-2000s Iraq, unable to defeat the American-led occupation force, instead targeted Iraqi civilians wherever they gathered, establishing a method that terror groups now deploy internationally.Then came the rise of \u201clone wolf\u201d attackers who acted on their own, without training from or often even contact with the terrorist groups they claimed to serve. Attacks are planned within the minds of individuals whose intentions remain hidden until the shooting begins.Such attacks predate the Islamic State, though the group emphasizes them, disseminating propaganda that provides tactical guidance and ideological justification available to anyone with an internet connection.The use of a truck in Nice was new only in the specifics and in the degree to which it has forced a realization increasingly difficult to ignore: In the world of lone wolves and Mumbai-style attacks, more barricades and metal detectors and monitoring programs can improve security, but can\u2019t guarantee it absolutely.10 PhotosAs terrorism itself becomes harder to prevent or defend against, policy experts say that governments should instead address two deeper but murkier problems: the ideology that calls for such violence and, even harder, the social and political factors that drive an individual to accept that ideology.But how do you defeat an ideology? Destroying the Islamic State\u2019s so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, some argue, would undercut its grandiose claims and dampen its appeal. It would also limit the group\u2019s ability to coordinate large-scale attacks, which in turn help inspire lone actors who may, or may not, be driven by ideology.Still, even as the group loses territory, its propaganda would survive online. And the problems that contributed to that ideology\u2019s rise in the Middle East would remain: authoritarian states that often use violence themselves, religious institutions often seen as complicit, stifled economies that grant young people few opportunities, and a cycle of conflict that encourages tribalism and extremism.This is why many analysts are urging Western governments to look at their own populations and ask not whether terrorist ideologies can be eradicated, but why individual citizens might become susceptible to messages telling them to kill on behalf of a foreign terrorist group.\u201cIt\u2019s a social and political problem,\u201d said Peter Neumann, a professor at King\u2019s College London and the director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization.Mr. Neumann said that, increasingly, Western citizens who turn to terrorism \u201care not deeply ideological or even religious.\"Rather, such individuals often seem to come to terrorism as a way to bring meaning to their lives or to explain their own sense of helplessness or isolation.Survivors of the attack in Nice, France, describe a windy night at the beach, fireworks, and then terror.Muslim or migrant populations have struggled to integrate into Western European countries, often left feeling excluded from national identities that stress secularism and are rooted in specifically European heritage.\u201cGhettoization, polarization, and alienation in a country like France are profound,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBottom line is: it\u2019s about feeling like you belong.\u201dWestern governments have tried to address this by providing greater welfare programs to disadvantaged communities or, often, by more forcefully policing them.But these, Mr. Neumann said, risk deepening the polarization between communities, which can be bridged only by building an \u201cinclusive sense of national identity.\u201d European societies have resisted this, instead giving rise to right-wing politics that emphasize ethnic and religious heritage.\u201cI think this will be with us for a long time, sadly,\u201d he said.Since Sept. 20, 2001, the day that President George W. Bush declared a \u201cwar on terror,\u201d Western leaders have used the terminology of war both to explain the threat and to articulate their response.A decade and a half of war has not delivered Western populations to safety, highlighting the gap between rhetoric and reality. But politicians have been constrained by this language, unable to acknowledge that, while war is a struggle that pulls a nation together and can eventually be won, the realities of terrorism can only be managed and the threats, at some point, merely endured.13 PhotosBut political leaders, compelled to promise an answer to this week\u2019s violence in Nice, returned to the familiar formulations.\u201cWe have an enemy that will continue to strike all people, all countries that have liberties as essential values,\u201d France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said.Hillary Clinton told CNN on Thursday that \u201cwe are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent.\u201d Though she urged enhanced intelligence gathering to combat terrorism, she has previously called for more aggressive use of force against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.Donald J. Trump, in an interview with Fox News, said he would ask Congress to declare war on terrorism.While this framing might reassure, it raises a question: Why does the war never feel as if it is approaching victory?This question\u2019s unanswerability perhaps contributes to the fear that is increasingly destabilizing Western politics. And it creates space for right-wing populists, rising throughout Europe, to present more aggressive policies as the answer.Mr. Valls, the French prime minister, perhaps sought to break this cycle on Friday when he said, \u201cThe times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Pulls Back from Deals in Coal Mining Sector", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byPressured by environmentalists and worried about big losses from a troubled industry, many large banks and other lenders have made a hasty retreat from coal mining in recent years.But even in these dark times, there was one bank that many coal miners could still count on for financing and advice: Deutsche Bank.Not any longer.The German banking giant is pulling back from the embattled coal sector, another sign of the increasing risks for banks that finance industries that contribute to climate change.Last week, six senior members of Deutsche Bank\u2019s metals and mining investment banking team, which was responsible for overseeing deals in the coal industry, said they were decamping for Jefferies, a smaller, scrappy New York investment bank that has a knack for scooping up investment bankers who increasingly feel out of place at larger, more heavily scrutinized global banks.A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the bankers\u2019 exodus. But industry analysts said the move was partly related to Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to back away from working on certain coal projects.Deutsche Bank has no immediate plans to replace the six bankers, who helped the German bank secure the largest market share of metals and mining revenue in the Americas among banks last year. That ranking was up from sixth place in 2011, when many of them joined Deutsche from the Swiss banking rival UBS.Dan Chu, a prominent coal banker at Deutsche Bank, will be global head of metals and mining investment banking at Jefferies.\u201cThe large banks are under significant pressure from environmental groups to limit their activity in fossil fuels and mining across the board,\u201d said Ted O\u2019Brien, chief executive of Doyle Trading Consultants, which focuses on the coal sector. \u201cThis move might reflect an investment banking team that was no longer that important to a large bank and that will now be able to practice their niche under somewhat less scrutiny.\u201dOnce a precious and sought-after resource, coal has fallen on hard times. Earlier this year, environmental groups like the Rainforest Action Network faulted Deutsche Bank for not going far enough in shunning coal.Banks are leaving coal for economic reasons, too. Just a few years ago, coal was surging, swept up in a global commodity craze, as mining companies sought to satisfy a seemingly insatiable demand from China.As recently as 2011, the top 10 investment banks in the sector took in more than $1.6 billion in investment banking revenue from metals and mining deals globally, including coal deals. By 2015, that total had fallen to just $820 million, according to Dealogic.The American coal industry, in particular, is now suffering a plague of bankruptcies. Power utilities are increasingly turning to cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to replace coal. Demand for coal from China has also cooled as its economy slows and the Chinese government tries to shift to cleaner energy sources.In the first three months of the year, American coal production plummeted to the lowest levels in 35 years, in large part because the winter was so warm. And the spring brought no respite. May\u2019s production of 50 million tons represented a 28 percent decline from May 2015, according to the Energy Department.In recent days, Murray Energy, a coal giant based in Ohio, sent notices to its employees that said it could be forced to lay off 80 percent of its work force, or roughly 4,400 employees, across six states because of the widespread depression in the industry.On Thursday, Alpha Natural Resources \u2014 which acquired the former Massey Energy in 2011 \u2014 received a judge\u2019s approval to exit bankruptcy. As part of a deal in the bankruptcy with the Sierra Club and other environmental groups in West Virginia, Alpha agreed to give 53 million tons of its coal to a nonprofit group for the purpose of its never being mined or burned \u2014 a sign of just how little value this commodity holds at the moment.As the coal industry undergoes what many analysts and investors expect to be a permanent downsizing, environmental groups have faulted Deutsche Bank for helping to sustain some life in the sector.In recent years, Deutsche has assisted one of mining\u2019s few durable operators, Blackhawk Mining, based in Lexington, Ky., which has been snapping up some of the best mines of bankrupt or nearly bankrupt companies such as Patriot Coal and Arch Coal.Blackhawk declined to comment.In more recent months, Deutsche Bank, which prides itself on being one of the top financiers of renewable energy projects in Europe, has taken a tougher stance against coal.At the annual general meeting in May, Deutsche Bank executives said the bank would not expand its activities in the coal sector, adding to an earlier pledge to \u201cphase out\u201d debt and equity underwriting to companies that engage in mountaintop removal.\u201cDeutsche Bank supports a well-balanced overall energy mix that takes account of economic conditions as well as environmental and health and safety considerations,\u201d a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement.Such considerations can go against the very grain of investment bankers, who are conditioned to work on as many deals as possible, not to cap activity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "National Health Spending to Surpass $10,000 a Person in 2016", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 National health spending will average more than $10,000 a person this year for the first time, the Obama administration said Wednesday, a milestone that heralds somewhat faster growth in health spending after several years of exceptionally low growth.By 2025, the administration reported, health care will represent 20 percent of the total economy, up from 17.8 percent last year. By 2025, one of every five Americans will be on Medicare, and the program will spend an average of nearly $18,000 a year for each beneficiary. Medicare spent about $12,000 per beneficiary in 2015.From 2015 to 2025, health spending is expected to grow an average of 5.8 percent a year \u2014 1.3 percentage points faster than the economy, measured by the gross domestic product. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation.By 2025, the report says, Medicaid, a program for lower-income people, is expected to spend an average of nearly $12,500 a year for each beneficiary, up from about $8,000 in 2015, and spending by private insurers is expected to average almost $8,600 for each person covered. Private insurers spent $5,400 per insured last year.\u201cHealth spending growth is likely to accelerate in response to improvements in economic conditions that are projected over the coming decade,\u201d said Sean P. Keehan, the lead author of the report, who is an economist in the actuary\u2019s office at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As the economy improves, he said, consumers are likely to have higher incomes, allowing them to spend more on health care goods and services.Another factor fueling the growth of health spending, he said, is the \u201cuse of high-cost specialty drugs and faster growth in drug prices.\u201dThe report estimates that national health spending increased 5.5 percent in 2015, to a total of $3.2 trillion. The expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act, through Medicaid and subsidized private insurance, contributed to higher spending on hospital and doctors\u2019 services, \u201cwith fewer people reporting that they had skipped needed medical care because of cost concerns,\u201d the report said.The growth of actual and projected health spending has slowed considerably since the early 1990s. In 1993, when Bill and Hillary Clinton were leading a national campaign to remake the nation\u2019s health care system, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that health spending would account for 20 percent of the economy by 2003. The Obama administration now says that milestone will not be reached until 2025.Officials predict that health spending will grow an average of 5.7 percent a year from 2017 to 2019 and then 6 percent a year from 2020 to 2025.Inflation, in the health care industry and in the general economy, was exceptionally low last year, with medical prices rising less than 1 percent, the administration said. Officials foresee \u201can uptick in projected medical price growth,\u201d driven in part by higher wages for health care workers, the article says.The deep recession of 2007 to 2009, followed by a slow recovery, curbed the growth of health spending, and many economists say that some provisions of the Affordable Care Act have also put downward pressure on spending.The new report, by career employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, suggests another factor that may moderate the growth of health spending: Consumers are wary of using doctors\u2019 services because they face higher out-of-pocket costs, including higher deductibles and co-payments.At the same time, the report says, insurers will try to prevent sharp increases in prices by using narrow networks of health care providers, which limit consumers\u2019 choice of doctors and hospitals.Advertisement"}

Wages of high school dropouts are lower than they were at the turn of the century in real terms. The same goes for workers with a high school diploma, and also for workers who went to college but stopped short of a bachelor\u2019s degree.This stagnation kindles the insurgent campaign of Donald Trump, who promises to somehow fix everything by walling off Mexico and slapping anti-dumping tariffs against China.An overwhelming majority of economists have panned his \u201csolution\u201d as a distraction \u2014 indeed, a surefire way to cripple the economy. Still, the appeal of Mr. Trump\u2019s message underscores the hopelessness of many workers and the helplessness among policy experts struggling to find a fix for a labor market in which it has become increasingly tough to make a living. As manufacturing\u2019s share of jobs dropped to 10 percent from 25 percent over the last four decades, millions have been relegated to a low-paid service economy with no benefits, uncertain hours and little job security.But are there really no ideas, short of throwing a wrench into the gears of the global economy? Ms. Edwards illustrates a surprisingly simple one: training for skills that are in demand. For some reason, this is a strategy the United States has not pursued earnestly in quite a long time. That looks like a mistake.From 2011 to 2013, about 1,300 unemployed or low-wage workers were enrolled in the programs. They included support services like job placement and post-employment counseling on how to move up the career ladder.But the main twist was the training, targeted at the most promising sectors. Per Scholas and the other nonprofits that took part in the experiment had to link up with employers in their areas to figure out what kind of skills were in demand and might open the door to a career path of rising wages.Their results were heartening. After two years, participants made 14 percent more on average than workers in a control group, who did not benefit from the new approach. That amounts to $1,945 a year.Workers who had been on unemployment for a long time when the study started, a group that tends to have a hard time finding a job, had an earnings bump of $2,347 \u2014 21 percent compared with the control group. Notably, the gains did not come only from working more but also from higher wages.It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, of course. Per Scholas\u2019s I.T. training managed to bump workers\u2019 wages by 26 percent after two years: an average increase of $3,746 per year. But elsewhere, identifying the proper skills that local employers needed was tricky. St. Nicks Alliance, for instance, which offered training in asbestos removal and other environmental remediation tasks, was caught unprepared by the abrupt slowdown in the construction industry in New York City.One might think that such an obvious approach \u2014 which helps businesses find the workers they need while improving the outlook for America\u2019s beleaguered workers \u2014 would be central to any national strategy to improve the workings of the job market.Some states have invested in sectoral training, offering programs at community colleges and work force development centers to equip adult workers with the skills most in demand in local job markets.But why hasn\u2019t the nation invested more heavily in job training? I\u2019m told job training got a bad reputation years ago because it was poorly coordinated with employers\u2019 needs. Workers coming out of training programs had just as hard a time finding a good job as those going in. Why spend the money, the thinking went, if one could get similar results with straightforward job placement services, which are much cheaper?The entire funding for the act, which includes services like training and job placement, adds up to less than $3 billion.That looks like a penny-wise, pound-foolish strategy. Sure, training is expensive. The WorkAdvance program cost $5,200 to $6,700 per worker, much more than running a job placement operation. But too often, \u201cjob placement\u201d represents little more than a database of available work. It does nothing to help workers develop careers.By contrast, $6,700 spent to provide one low-wage worker with the skills employers need is a small amount compared with the wage gains she could make in a few years. And there are other savings to keep in mind. More than one-third of workers who entered the WorkAdvance program, for instance, were getting food stamps, which they would not need if they earned more.Or consider that it costs $31,000, on average, to keep an American in prison for one year. One-quarter of the workers enrolled in the WorkAdvance experiment had a criminal record.According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States government spends only 0.03 percent of its gross domestic product on worker training. Denmark, whose policies to bring workers into work have gained praise around the world, spends proportionately almost 18 times as much. France spends 12 times as much; Germany seven times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Rejects Account of How Malaysia\u2019s Leader Acquired Millions", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 A United States Justice Department complaint filed in federal court this week directly contradicts repeated assertions by the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, about the origins and purpose of hundreds of millions of dollars that ended up in his personal bank accounts.While Mr. Najib and other Malaysian officials have insisted that the money was a gift from an unidentified Saudi donor, the Justice Department said that it was stolen from a Malaysian government investment fund that Mr. Najib oversaw. Mr. Najib has said he never received any money from the fund.The revelations could undermine his credibility and give new ammunition to a movement to force him from office. However, he maintains firm control over his governing party and has successfully stifled opposition with the firing of critics from party posts, the closing of online news outlets and the criminal prosecution of social media detractors and political opponents.Mr. Najib, who has acknowledged receiving the money but said he broke no laws and took nothing for personal gain, told reporters on Thursday that his government would \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Justice Department action.\u201cAllow the process to take its course,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want to say categorically that we are serious about good governance.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Najib, reached late Thursday, said that the prime minister had not changed his position that the money he received was a gift from a Saudi donor and that he gave most of it back because he did not need it.The Justice Department complaint alleges in 136 pages of blow-by-blow detail that huge sums were diverted from the government fund, routed through bank accounts in various countries and then spent on high-end real estate, artwork, gambling and various luxury goods by Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson, friends and associates.The Justice Department filed a complaint on Wednesday in federal court in California to seize $1 billion dollars in assets said to be stolen from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund. Here is the complete court filing.The court filing seeks to recover more than $1 billion in assets bought with money that prosecutors say was stolen from the fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.Those assets, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said Wednesday, \u201care just a portion of the more than $3 billion that was stolen from 1MDB and laundered through American financial institutions in violation of United States law.\u201dThe case, she said, should be seen as a sign of the country\u2019s \u201cfirm commitment to fighting international corruption\u201d and the department\u2019s determination \u201cto protect the American financial system from being used as a conduit for corruption.\u201dWhile the federal complaint does not identify Mr. Najib by name, it cites $731 million in funds that came from 1MDB that were deposited into accounts belonging to a government official identified as \u201cMalaysian Official 1.\u201dHowever, Mr. Najib is clearly recognizable in the descriptions and actions attributed to that official.Large transactions by \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d described in the complaint are identical to those previously acknowledged by Mr. Najib. The complaint describes the official\u2019s role in managing the fund, which matches Mr. Najib\u2019s role. And it says \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d is a relative of Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson.A person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d was Mr. Najib.The complaint does name Mr. Aziz, and a family friend, Jho Low, who played a key role in establishing the fund. Both are cited as possessing assets bought with money stolen from 1MDB.Mr. Najib\u2019s advisers have said Mr. Najib received about $1 billion in 2013, most of it donations from a member of the Saudi royal family to help him fight a tough election campaign that year.On Thursday, Mr. Apandi issued a statement asserting that no investigation had found evidence that 1MDB funds had been misappropriated. He said he had \u201cstrong concerns at the insinuations and allegations\u201d against Mr. Najib in the Justice Department complaint.The Saudi gift was also confirmed by Saudi Arabia.Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in April that Mr. Najib had received a \u201cgenuine donation\u201d from a Saudi donor. He did not specify the amount or provide any details.A Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman did not respond Friday to requests for comment.The Justice Department complaint mentions no such gift.The complaint says that $681 million transferred to Mr. Najib in 2013 came from a Singapore bank account held in the name of Tanore Finance Corporation. It says the money originated from $3 billion in bonds underwritten for 1MDB by Goldman Sachs.The Singapore account was controlled by Tan Kim Loong, also known as Eric Tan, an associate of Mr. Low, the complaint says.Four months after receiving the $681 million, Mr. Najib transferred $620 million back to the same Tanore account, according to the complaint.The complaint offers no explanation for why the prime minister received the money, held it for four months, then returned part of it. It is also unclear what happened to the $61 million he kept, although advisers have said he needed money for parliamentary elections that year.Mr. Low and Mr. Tan used money from the Tanore account to buy expensive artwork and an interest in the Park Lane Hotel, a luxury hotel overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, the complaint says.The complaint also says that \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d received $20 million in stolen 1MDB funds in 2011. The money, the first he received from the fund, was transferred from an account held in the name of a Saudi prince, the complaint says. It does not identify the prince.He received $30 million in 1MDB money in 2012 from a separate account, the complaint says.The prime minister\u2019s office did not respond to inquiries about those two deposits.The two transactions bring to $731 million the amount of money Mr. Najib is said to have received from the government fund he oversaw.Mr. Najib created 1MDB in 2009 to promote Malaysia\u2019s economic development. He oversaw the fund as chairman of its advisory board, a position he recently relinquished, and as finance minister, a position he still holds. The fund is wholly owned by the Finance Ministry.The fund\u2019s goal was \u201cimproving the well-being of the Malaysian people,\u201d Ms. Lynch said in announcing the civil action. \u201cBut unfortunately, sadly, tragically, a number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account.\u201dThe F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service took part in the investigation and relied in part on bank transfer data, 1MDB memos and internal emails. Special Agent Darryl Wegner, chief of the F.B.I.\u2019s International Corruption Unit, said that leaders of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission showed \u201ctremendous courage\u201d in pursuing the investigation.The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission\u2019s investigation was shut down by Malaysia\u2019s attorney general.In Washington, the White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that President Obama had discussed the scandal with Mr. Najib during a visit to Malaysia last fall.\u201cThe president reiterated how important it is, particularly for a fast-growing country like Malaysia, to be transparent, to demonstrate a commitment to fair play and good government and a business climate that will allow that country\u2019s economy to continue to succeed,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Louise Story contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Will Food Issues Be on Politicians\u2019 Plates?", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byInside, another celebrity chef was just getting started. Tom Colicchio, the politically focused New York culinary personality, picked up a microphone and began speaking to a crowd of about 100 people who seemed to be at the party as much for the free brisket and strawberry brambles as for the discussion.One was Congressman Lamar Smith, the conservative from Texas. As Mr. Colicchio linked the plight of farmers to immigration, the environment, health care costs and the national security threat posed by overweight soldiers, Mr. Smith added another piece of smoked turkey breast to his plate and sneaked upstairs to eat.He was followed by a reporter, who asked whether food issues were gaining traction among lawmakers, and whether the nation\u2019s food system may get any attention in the presidential election.\u201cI\u2019m going to disappoint you,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that. The barbecue is good, though.\u201dEven though the cultural conversation around food and agriculture seems to grow louder every day, the American food system was on the sidelines here last week, as it is at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week. Even among those most likely to push for it, food isn\u2019t getting much attention as a political issue.\u201cWhat people think is cool about food and what people think is cool about politics are different,\u201d said Matt Birong, a Democratic delegate from Vermont who continues to support Senator Bernie Sanders.\u201cFor the national delegation, it might come up as a sidebar conversation for a few of us,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as far as a functional initiative, it has never been approached.\u201dGranted, it would be especially difficult to wedge food issues into what is shaping up to be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. And terrorism, immigration, racism and gun control seem more pressing than school lunch.Still, food could soon become a more lucrative piece of political currency, some politicians, pollsters and convention veterans say.\u201cIs a person going to choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton based on food issues? No,\u201d said Jerry Hagstom, an agricultural journalist who has been to every presidential convention since 1984. \u201cBut politicians are getting into it from a policy standpoint in areas like health and food waste and food safety because it\u2019s becoming a big issue of concern to voters.\u201dPolitically, the ubiquity of food is both a strength and a weakness. Food can be a hunger issue, an immigration issue, an animal welfare issue, a labor issue, an environmental issue, a farming issue, a health issue, a trade issue.Where there is political opportunity, there are gaffes.People who think food needs to be higher on the national agenda should do a better job connecting the dots, said Bob Kerrey, the former governor and United States Democratic senator from Nebraska.\u201cYou need to start off by understanding that agriculture is primarily a manufacturing business and make food an economic issue, rather than labeling it as a health or environmental issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you have to walk across the gulf between that and the people who are actually buying the food.\u201dTo draw attention to the cause, organizers recruited Larry Robinson, who sells rum cake and jambalaya out of his food truck in Miami. His truck, rebranded with the Plate of the Union logo, traveled to both conventions and will pop up in a dozen more cities before the election.\u201cI\u2019m not here for the politics,\u201d said Mr. Robinson, who has family members with diabetes. \u201cWe need kids to get healthier food.\u201d\u201cTo some degree, it really does blur party lines,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-minded Republican from Kentucky who is popular with some members of the Tea Party and raises grass-fed cattle. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity among politicians.\u201dMillennial voters are more articulate about food issues than any generation before, and less apt to be loyal to any one political party. And food is one of the few issues in which lawmakers from different parties can find common ground, Mr. Massie said.Voters, conservative and liberal, are concerned about the environmental impact of certain industrial agricultural practices and understand the connection between food and health. Large-scale agribusiness and powerhouse farming organizations still hold great sway over agricultural policy, but \u201cthe degree to which big ag lines politicians\u2019 pockets has reached the point where they can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Mr. Massie said.Farmers and ranchers are frustrated with taxes and regulations that put what many consider unrealistic limits on labor, conservation practices and food labels. \u201cThey feel beleaguered,\u201d Mr. Hagstrom said.Many recognize that it\u2019s time to do a better job explaining their side of agriculture to urban consumers, college students and \u201cpeople who live in a loft,\u201d David Daniels, the director of the Ohio Agriculture Department, said at the lunch.They may find more common ground than they think. Consider Michael Brinkley, a conservative North Carolina farmer who raises hogs and vegetables on what used to be tobacco land, and Emily Evans, a liberal Ohio State University senior who is studying sustainable community development.He looks for someone who may help remove federal regulations that get in the way of raising the food he sells to farmers\u2019 markets. She looks for candidates who care about the exploitation of farmworkers and food inequality. But they both consider a candidate\u2019s position on food when they vote.\u201cFood is not a red or blue issue,\u201d she said.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

What are you doing here? If you are a parent keeping a child in the city on an especially brutal weekend, when you might simply be forced to stay inside revisiting the entire Pixar canon, it can feel as if you are imposing what would count as a code-red abuse among the affluenza class, roughly equivalent to permitting the consumption of a street vendor\u2019s hot dog.During periods of intense heat, mayors stress the importance of air-conditioning, as Bill de Blasio did this month, while also stressing that you shouldn\u2019t use too much of it. Setting temperatures below 78 degrees is bad citizenship because it can threaten the power grid. Air-conditioning is never quite right in New York, as anyone who has lived here knows \u2014 in offices it is too cold; in homes it is not cold enough. Water, of course, is elusive. This year, though, the mayor committed to keeping certain large public pools open until 8 p.m. and playground sprinklers on until dark. He also reminded New Yorkers that they can travel to a local fire station \u2014 if they are able to prove that they are 18 or older \u2014 and obtain a spray cap with which to open a fire hydrant safely.The idea is to build a collection of these houses no more than two and a half hours outside major cities around the world.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 3", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 Is it possible to stand up to Donald Trump, make clear what a false prophet he is and somehow come across as an even less endurable narcissist? Ted Cruz managed it. And it was clearly a game to Cruz, who constructed his remarks in a manner designed to leave the audience guessing for as long as possible about whether he\u2019d ever work his way around to even the tiniest, most tentative pitch for the party\u2019s nominee. There was a flickering promise of it at the start. \u201cI congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.\u201d But while he detailed those principles, he never did connect them to Trump. \u201cCongratulate\u201d was the sum of his good will \u2014 and the end of it. It didn\u2019t foretell anything more specific. It didn\u2019t build to anything grander. When Trump supporters finally realized that it wouldn\u2019t and that Cruz was just running out the clock, they booed him, loudly enough to drown out some of his final sentences. It was stunning to behold. And it wasn\u2019t the last surprise. Just then, Trump decided to make his entrance into the arena, pulling the attention \u2014 and the cameras \u2014 away from Cruz. The boos turned into applause. The cameras didn\u2019t even bother with Cruz\u2019s exit from the stage. But Cruz had made his point and done his damage, providing the latest (and most vivid) illustration of how little control Trump has been able to exert over his own coronation, how much rancor he has failed to exorcise, how few bridges he has succeeded in repairing, how far short he has fallen in making these four days in Cleveland as dazzling and exciting as he\u2019d long promised they would be. Cruz took that balloon and stomped on it, smiling all the while and turning a dull affair into a freak show. At the conclusion of his remarks, his wife, Heidi, had to be escorted from the convention floor by security officers as some delegates screamed at her. Cruz had been invited to speak because, well, he had to be, given how much support and how many delegates he\u2019d amassed during the Republican primaries. He\u2019d earned the right, and there were people in the arena eager to hear from him. But he had no obligation to accept that invitation, not to a convention that was being skipped by so many of Trump\u2019s other vanquished rivals, including John Kasich, the Ohio governor, whose own state was playing host to the event. By saying yes, Cruz was suggesting that he\u2019d play nice and play along, or at least that\u2019s what he should have been telegraphing. If his convictions precluded such obedience, he could have stayed home. He could have stayed mum. That would have spoken plenty loudly. But Cruz isn\u2019t much for mum. It violates his very nature to resist an audience of millions of television viewers and the chance to make an elaborate show of principle, even if it\u2019s a much greater exhibit of self-regard. Bygones were not bygones. He didn\u2019t update his onetime description of Trump as \u201cutterly amoral\u201d with anything newer and gentler. He talked of himself, of America and of Election Day, saying: \u201cWe deserve leaders who stand for principle, unite us all behind shared values, cast aside anger for love.\u201d He clearly wasn\u2019t evoking Trump, and he seemed not to realize that he was listing virtues that he was ignoring at the very moment, with those very words. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience.\u201d It was then that his smile was naughtiest, because he\u2019d put \u201cyour conscience\u201d where he could so easily have tucked \u201cfor Trump.\u201d \u201cVote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution,\u201d he continued. Candidates plural. Not the singular candidate whom the evening was supposed to exalt. Later, Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, made his big convention speech, but it was doomed before it started, because there was no way it could garner the attention that Cruz\u2019s did. Cruz had to know that. It didn\u2019t throw him off his revenge, and it threw this mess of a convention ever further off the rails. Fortunately, Donald Trump likes it rough. The violent incidents at his rallies, he told me once, didn\u2019t worry him. He felt it added a frisson of excitement to the proceedings. So he probably loved Loser Night at his convention. Three of the men he beat \u2013 he would call the final rivals \u201cthe remainders\u201d or \u201cthe leftovers\u201d \u2013 had to suck it up tonight and bow down to the Bling King. Scott Walker appeared on stage and endorsed The Donald. Marco Rubio gave Trump his due in a video. But then it was Lyin\u2019 Ted\u2019s turn, and that\u2019s when things got ugly. The bitter roundelay between the men started earlier in the day. As Ted Cruz had a campaign-style rally in Cleveland, with 2020 wafting in the air, Donald Trump\u2019s plane flew over and drowned Cruz out.  The Cruz fans erupted in boos at the cacophonous Trump plane and Cruz noted dryly: \u201cAll right, that was pretty well-orchestrated.\u201d  But this evening, the boos were going in the opposite direction.  At first, the crowd was enthusiastic about Cruz. But soon Cruz began to seem like the guy who comes to your book party and starts brandishing his own book. When he had been speaking for quite awhile without endorsing the nominee, only perfunctorily congratulating him on winning the nomination, and when he advised everyone to vote \u201cyour conscience\u2019\u2019 up and down the ticket, the crowd turned ugly.  Suddenly Trump, certainly irritated at not hearing the glorious sound of his own name in an elongated address by a \u201closer,\u201d entered the arena. He was once more soaring in, drowning Cruz out.  All eyes went to Trump as they dimmed the lights on the stage and the nominee regally walked in, a procession of one, to sit with his family in his stadium box with gold-and-black striped railings. The crowd got even more feral toward the former rival suddenly trapped onstage, looking like he didn\u2019t know how to finish and finally slinking off. Delegates near me started booing and jumping up and pointing at Cruz and screaming, \u201cTrump, Trump Trump!\u201d Others shouted \u201cHe\u2019s full of baloney!\u201d and taunts pocked with \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cmoron.\u2019\u2019 Cruz finally escaped with his wife, Heidi, after she was escorted off the floor as a delegate shame-shame-shaming her with the name of her former employer: \u201cGoldman Sachs!\u201d  Asked about the kerfuffle, Marion Ashley, an alternate delegate from California, summed it up to The Times\u2019 Sam Purdy this way: \u201cTrump used \u2018Lyin\u2019 Ted.\u2019 It looked like he proved Trump right.\u201d This convention is getting so gladiatorial that Cruz was probably lucky the crowd didn\u2019t start screaming \u201cLock him up!\u201d After getting a little bloodlust, the crowd seemed to perk up, just in time for Mike Pence. I could have waited to break the news. But it had to be done. I sidled up to some South Carolina delegates who had come to watch Donald Trump drop out of the sky in a helicopter. I happened to be wearing a pink palmetto cap from Charleston, so I got a warm Southern welcome. Ida Martin, a 61-year-old first-time delegate rocking a flag scarf and a blue shirt with little white stars, said she was from Kingstree, \u201ca sportsman\u2019s paradise and a woman\u2019s nightmare.\u201d \u201cSort of like this convention?\u201d I asked. She replied with a grin and a nod. She said she was \u201cworn-slam-out\u201d because they were \u201cramming a lot into this one thing\u201d but having fun. She liked watching Trump \u201crarin\u2019 down\u201d in his copter. She wasn\u2019t bothered by that little plagiarism episode with Melania and Michelle that kicked off the convention. \u201cMichelle didn\u2019t invent the wheel and she didn\u2019t invent all those little words everyone uses, like \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018the,\u2019\u201d Martin said. It was time to end the pleasantries and break the news. Based on his experience skipping golf to binge-watch Ken Burns\u2019s series on the war, Trump said that he felt that \u201cthe South overplayed their hand.\u201d Ida Martin\u2019s friend, Peggy Upchurch of Lake Wylie, an alternate delegate also spruced up in red, white and blue and an elephant necklace, blanched. \u201cThe South didn\u2019t overplay its hand,\u201d she said starchily. \u201cThe North overplayed its hand. Abraham Lincoln did not necessarily want to go to war. If he had just waited a bit.\u201d But it all worked out in the end, she said, since she married \u201ca Yankee.\u201d That other Yankee, Donald Trump, doesn\u2019t know much about being civil. He probably doesn\u2019t know all that much about Abe Lincoln, either, since he told The Washington Post that he has never read a biography of a president. \u201cI\u2019m always busy doing a lot,\u201d he said. But he knows how to go to war with Republicans. Now he must figure out how to parley his civil war with his party the way he wanted the earlier one settled: without bloodshed. There has been lots of venom here at the Republican National Convention, and today it came down to this: A Trump delegate and adviser publicly urged that Hillary Clinton should be put in front of a firing squad and executed for treason. Look, people always engage in hyperbole about people they disagree with, but this Republican convention has taken it further than I\u2019ve ever seen. It opened with a prayer that denounced Democrats and Clinton as \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Then last night, Ben Carson tried to link Clinton to Satan. And the convention delegates have periodically chanted \u201clock her up.\u201d In democracies, it\u2019s natural to denounce opponents. But it\u2019s in tin-pot dictatorships that opponents are locked up. When you\u2019ve covered autocracies in countries where politicians are actually locked up after losing power struggles, you really don\u2019t aspire for that in your own country. This trend toward demonizing the opposition reached its apotheosis with Carson tying Clinton to the devil and Baldasaro saying that she should be executed. \u201cThis whole thing disgusts me,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason.\u201d Baldasaro later stood by his remarks when journalists reached out to him. On Twitter, he wrote, \u201cAs an American, I believe in the Constitution, freedom of speech and the rule of law: No one is above the law, not even Clinton.\u201d When a presidential campaign has to clarify that it does not favor executing its opponent, maybe that reflects a larger problem. CLEVELAND \u2014 \u201cThe left makes it look as though we\u2019re anti-woman or anti-gay,\u201d said Johnna Beuerlein, a Donald Trump supporter since she saw him speak at a rally in Mobile, Ala., last year. Diamond and Silk, two African-American video bloggers, came to the rally with the message that \u201cjust because you\u2019re black doesn\u2019t mean you have to vote Democrat.\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at the conservative website Breitbart who is gay, told the crowd that the left does not \u201crepresent diversity\u201d and that \u201cgroups it thought it had in the bag it doesn\u2019t own anymore.\u201d Some see Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy as an opportunity to broaden the Republican Party\u2019s appeal. Kathryn Serkes, a co-chairwoman of the group Women Vote Trump, said in an interview that Mr. Trump offers \u201ca major disruption\u201d that could \u201cshake up the Republican Party and start to move it in a direction that will be more inclusive.\u201d Ann Stone, also a co-chairwoman of Women Vote Trump, said many members of an abortion rights group she founded, Republicans for Choice, were also Trump fans. She isn\u2019t worried that Mr. Trump will mount an assault on Roe v. Wade through his Supreme Court picks. \u201cI think ultimately he\u2019s going to use good judgment,\u201d she said. Camilla Moore, an alternate delegate from Georgia, said she would support Mr. Trump. But, she said, \u201cas a billionaire, he\u2019s lived a life that has precluded him from understanding the sensitivity of a lot of ethnic groups.\u201d As an African-American voter, she said, she\u2019d been heartened by his track record with the L.G.B.T. community and his history of hiring women at the Trump Organization. Now, she says, \u201che needs to be himself and speak from his heart and stop speaking just to get ratings.\u201d Abbi Cobb, who\u2019d come from Minnesota as the guest of an alternate delegate, thought Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about women during the primary campaign could hurt him with female voters. Angela Mingo, an alternate delegate from Ohio, said Mr. Trump might still be able appeal to female and minority voters. But she added skeptically, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d I\u2019ve been wondering why Donald Trump wants everyone to call him Donald J. Trump. Even regular delegates often call him that when you talk to them. Even his wife, Melania, called him Donald J. Trump. Who does that with a spouse? Is Trump worried that people will confuse him with some other Donald Trump? Or that people will think his son Donald Jr. is running? Does he think the middle initial gives him more gravitas?* Or is he preserving the distinction between Donald Trump the real estate guy who lives off the Wall Street banks and Donald J. Trump the presidential candidate who trashes Wall Street? Just in case things don\u2019t go well this November and he has to pick up his old brand? About midway through the Republican platform, there appears this statement: \u201cWe support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investments.\u201d It\u2019s a head-scratcher, because reimposing Glass-Steagall would be an about-face for Republicans. The law, which forced financial institutions to separate commercial and investment operations, was a Democratic, Depression-era creation. The long effort to weaken it started with Republicans. By the time the law was repealed in 1999, revisions had made it toothless; Republicans controlled Congress; and most Democrats, led by the Clinton administration, had embraced their opponents\u2019 anti-regulatory thinking. The platform language is odd in other ways. Some politicians, notably Bernie Sanders, have called for what amounts to a new Glass-Steagall, embodied in a break-up-the-banks bill sponsored in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren and John McCain. Their rationale for the bill is that behemoth banks helped cause the financial crisis, that they still pose a threat, and that breaking them up is the best defense. By contrast, the Republican platform asserts that the crisis was caused not by the banks, but by government housing policies. But if the banks did not cause the crisis, why break them up? The platform doesn\u2019t say. Nor does it say whether the party wants to reinstate the enfeebled version of Glass-Stegall that existed shortly before repeal, or whether it wants a vigorous new law \u2014 which seems unlikely given that Republicans have never favored major pro-regulatory bank reform. Calling to reinstate Glass-Steagall gives Republicans a retort, however slippery, to criticism that they have no plan to regulate Wall Street \u2014 criticism validated by other parts of the platform that are devoted to tearing down the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010. In effect, the platform pairs the party\u2019s crusade to end Dodd-Frank with a call to reimpose Glass-Steagall. But that would not add up to financial regulation. Even if Republicans were serious about breaking up the banks, Dodd-Frank reforms would still be needed, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and regulation of derivatives. CLEVELAND \u2014 This is the first time I\u2019ve covered a presidential convention, and this entire week I have felt woefully unprepared. I forgot to pack my recorder, my congressional press badge or even a notebook. I don\u2019t know where any of the swanky after-parties are happening. I don\u2019t have business cards to hand out. But what really put me to shame was meeting two teenage girls who are hustling around the Quicken Loans Arena this week, covering the convention as kid reporters. So far this year, Kyra \u2014 who lives in Dublin, Ohio \u2014 has gotten to cover a presidential debates, a Trump rally and now the Republican convention. This is an unusual year to cover a presidential election, especially if it\u2019s your first time paying attention to politics. Kyra said the Trump rally she attended in March was \u201ckind of a little bit nervous making, because there were a lot of people in the crowd that disliked the media.\u201d At the convention, Kyra said she created a group text with two of her best friends to keep them updated on her plans and reassure them that she\u2019s safe. \u201cThis particular one has a bunch of my friends freaked out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are very nervous for me because they are all worried about security.\u201d Maple Buescher, 13, is reporting on the convention for Time for Kids. We talked in the lobby of the Hilton Downtown Cleveland while older delegates and journalists milled about. \u201cThis is the biggest story I\u2019ve done, definitely,\u201d she said, adding that she has also done \u201ca few book reviews\u201d for the magazine. Maple, who lives in Cleveland Heights, said she was \u201ca little nervous\u201d about going to the convention at first, but was reassured by the police presence downtown. So, what does she make of the election? \u201cHonestly, I really don\u2019t have that much to compare it to. I was 9 when the last presidential election happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can tell that it\u2019s crazy and just like a bunch of people don\u2019t support either candidate.\u201d At the end of our interview, Kyra handed me her business card, which listed her newly created Twitter account. She told me that she\u2019s been encouraged to see other kids her age taking an interest in the election. She was amazed to find her two 10-year-old neighbors were interested in politics, and struck up a conversation with them about the election recently. \u201cWhen I was their age, I didn\u2019t even care about politics,\u201d she said. Today\u2019s mini-event to mark Trump\u2019s return to Cleveland for the last two days of his Keystone Konvention was typical. I get why Trump chose it, since it\u2019s a declaration by the character that he will prevail in a nearly impossible contest to win the hand of an ice princess. But it\u2019s still wrong. He should be playing \u201cVesti la giubba\u201d from \u201cPagliacci,\u201d which translates \u201cPut on the costume\u201d and is sung by a clown. It should have been \u201cThe Ride of the Valkyries,\u201d the song the deranged air cavalry officer played by Robert Duvall blared from his helicopters in the film \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d It would have been a lot more interesting for Trump to have stepped up to the microphone and announced, \u201cI love the smell of napalm in the morning,\u201d paused dramatically, then added, \u201csmells like victory,\u201d than for him to have said he was happy to be back in Cleveland. O.K., that last bit about wanting to talk about you is wrong, but you get the idea. The organization, which formed last year to advocate for Latino and Chicano communities, had been \u201clooking for a way to turn the wall against him,\u201d said Marisa Franco, the group\u2019s director. They settled on hundreds of feet of canvas, painted with bricks, chain link and slogans like \u201cWall Off Trump\u201d and \u201c#No Mas Trumpadas.\u201d Some parts of the \u201cwall\u201d are banners that protesters could carry. Others parts the organizers cut into ponchos, which the group members wore. As he held up a section of the wall, Ramon Mejia, a child of Mexican immigrants and a Muslim, said Trump voters should \u201ctake the time to actually learn who we are.\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re their community members, we\u2019re here to stay and we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Sabiha Kazi, a Code Pink member, wore a pink tiara and a pink sash identifying her as \u201cMiss Immigrants Welcome.\u201d As as a child of Muslim immigrants whom Trump wants to ban, she said, \u201cit was really nice to be out there, and to have my voice heard.\u201d Several activist groups in Mexico, including La Burra Blanca and Libre y Sin Temor, had sent donations to support the wall. For the members of Mijente and Latino communities, Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda \u201cmeans sending some of us back to the back of the bus, to the back of the kitchen, back inside the closet and back into the shadows,\u201d said Ms. Franco. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people understand that people are not going to take that lying down.\u201d As they stood in the street near the arena, their wall spanned two city blocks, fulfilling Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise in a way he probably never imagined. \nThe illustrator Peter Arkle illustrated the issues \u200breaders said mattered to them, live.\nBut rank and file Republicans seem unlikely to take on the mammoth industry any time soon. According to xHamster, one of the leading aggregators of online porn, traffic from users in Cleveland spiked significantly this week as the Republican National Convention got underway. Viewership in the city shot up by 184 percent from its pre-convention average, surpassing traffic the site gets from people in large cities including New York, Miami and Los Angeles. \u201cThis increase is unprecedented,\u201d said Mike Kulich, a spokesman for the web site. \u201cThey\u2019re making porn great again.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time xHamster has involved itself in Republican politics. After North Carolina passed a discriminatory law that banned transgender people from using public restrooms consistent with their gender identity, the web site banned users in that state from accessing the site for a day. After access was restored, North Carolina users were required to state in a pop-up box that they were opposed to the law before being allowed to access videos. Earlier this month, the site published a map with the top search terms in states that traditionally vote Republican. The prevailing one was \u201ccuckold.\u201d Mr. Kulich said the company is analyzing and publishing data from Republican states in an effort to \u201cshow the hypocrisy of what\u2019s going on in this country.\u201d He said people in the porn industry were not concerned about a government crackdown, but that if that were to happen, \u201cyou\u2019d have to put a lot of people out of work and send those jobs overseas.\u201d In its press release about the Cleveland traffic, xHamster noted that Donald Trump has become a leading search term because Trump porn parodies have become crowd pleasers. Others popular search terms in Cleveland this week: \u201cteen, cuckold and granny.\u201d No less than the late Antonin Scalia and the now-defunct Bush dynasty, Ailes helped build and define a long era in conservative politics. But more than other conservative institutions, his wildly successful network \u2014 which came relatively late to the conservative scene, well after the Reagan\u2019s presidency \u2014 also embodied the tensions that Trump has exploited in putting that era to the torch. By this I mean that Fox News has always had two faces. There is the serious, right-leaning newschannel, the Fox News of Brit Hume and Chris Wallace and Bret Baier, in which sober conservative pundits from the Beltway right\u2019s intellectual factions joust with their peers on the center-left. And then there is the Fox of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity and their various epigones (plus the flaring comet that was Glenn Beck). Its animating spirit is an aggrieved, \u201cwho\u2019s looking out for me?\u201d resentment mixed (in Hannity\u2019s case, especially) with hackish partisanship. And its stars trafficked in a kind of white identity politics long before Trump\u2019s ascent. A marriage of conservatism and populism is hardly unique to Fox, of course. It\u2019s been part of the right\u2019s DNA since William F. Buckley brought conservative thought down into the grubby world of Republican politics. Now the populism has basically devoured, for this election season at least, the conservatism of the other Fox \u2014 the conservatism of Charles Krauthammer or George Will or Bill Kristol. And the questions facing the Republican Party after Trump are not unlike the questions facing a post-Ailes Fox, and a post-Fox Ailes. Does the Fox fusion still have a future? Will the Murdoch heirs try to gradually de-Hannitize? Could a Trump Network (with a vengeful Ailes as its impresario) rise to claim the populist audience? No matter what, the revolutions will be televised. They will give Republicans a chance to rue the path that their primary voters have chosen. But I would encourage Republicans who care about the future of their party to reflect on something beside the Rubio or Walker fantasy. Keep in mind Trump won the nomination handily. No establishment candidate \u2014 not Rubio, Walker, John Kasich or Jeb Bush \u2014 came anywhere close to beating him. In hindsight, the scenario in which one of them is the nominee looks like a triple bank shot. The more productive source for Republican regret is how this could have happened. How could a clear plurality of party voters choose a business executive with a spotty record who has never held elective office, who regularly demeans large groups of Americans and who tells many, many more untruths than Hillary Clinton? How Republicans can fix this situation is the real subtext to what-if night. \nJohn Weaver, campaign manager for John Kasich, speaks with Elizabeth Williamson about Trump.\nInstead, Mr. Palomarez was hosting his own event about a mile from the Cleveland arena where the Republican National Convention\u2019s lions of protectionism were roaring. He sat down with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to interview him about the Hispanic chamber\u2019s priorities, and what the state\u2019s businesses had to offer the hispanic community. It was an affable chat about jobs, growth and the value of fracking to the Ohio economy \u2014 the American Petroleum Institute was a sponsor, and Jack Gerard, its chief executive, opened the program. It had been more than 24 hours since the convention opened with hours of prime-time speeches tarring immigrants as menaces, but Mr. Palomarez was still seething. He kept wanting to know what Mr. Kasich, once one of the more moderate Republican presidential contenders, thought about the man at the top of his party\u2019s ticket. \u201cAw, come on, Javier,\u201d Mr. Kasich said more than once. Why, Mr. Palomarez wanted to know, wasn\u2019t Mr. Kasich attending Donald Trump\u2019s convention? \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to go to that \u2014 it\u2019s not what I\u2019ve stood for in my campaign,\u201d Mr. Kasich said, adding, \u201cBut you know what happens when you\u2019re self-righteous. You get hoisted on your own petard.\u201d Nobody invited Mr. Palomarez to speak at the convention. He was talking in a conference room to about 100 Spanish-speaking business executives, and some journalists. But his message was stark. The day is coming, he told Mr. Kasich, when no one in America, no matter what party or for what office, will be elected \u201cwithout courting Hispanics.\u201d Did Mr. Kasich know, he wondered, that every 30 seconds, a Hispanic in America turns 18? \u201cThat\u2019s 52,000 Hispanic voters turning 18 every month,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will continue for the next 20 years.\u201d \nJames Bennet, the editorial page editor, talks with columnist Charles M.

{"Headline": "The Loneliness of Being Black in San Francisco", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Gerald Harris was walking along Ocean Beach, the blustery coastline at the western edge of the city, when he passed Danny Glover, a star of Hollywood action movies and a San Francisco native. The men exchanged glances.\u201cWe were the only two black people in the area,\u201d Mr. Harris said.San Francisco was once a national beacon of African-American culture, home to a thriving jazz scene that had so many clubs it was known as the Harlem of the West. But these days, blacks say they take notice when they see another African-American in affluent and middle-class neighborhoods.The jazz clubs of the Fillmore neighborhood have been replaced with upscale shops. Marcus Books, a cultural anchor of the black community and one of the first bookshops in the nation to focus on African-American topics, closed in 2014. Other black landmarks that have long since disappeared are commemorated with remembrances embedded in the sidewalk like tombstones to a forgotten culture.The decline has been steady and noticeable. One of seven residents was black in 1970. Today, it is nearly one of 20, with most of the city\u2019s 46,000 blacks living in public housing.\u201cMy prediction is 10 years from now, we won\u2019t have 20,000 blacks in this city,\u201d said the Rev. Amos C. Brown, the pastor of Third Baptist Church, a historically black church founded in 1852.Yet one of the city\u2019s most prominent African-Americans, Willie Brown, a former mayor and former speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not believe the shift could be reversed. There is no point in trying to engineer the city\u2019s ethnic population, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would put a whole lot of time and energy into doing anything,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201cexcept making sure there\u2019s equal access and equal opportunity and equal resources.\u201dHe called the current mix \u2014 with whites, Asians and Latinos making up the largest segments of the population \u2014 a \u201cnew reality.\u201dThe reasons for the migration are in large measure economic: Skyrocketing real estate prices fueled by high-paying tech jobs have priced out middle-class residents of all ethnicities. But the exodus was also accelerated by a domino effect of black businesses and families moving away, many of them to Oakland and other cities along the East Bay.When black communities, which were splintered into three areas in San Francisco, lost their barber shops, restaurants and clubs, they lost their centers of gravity, according to Mr. Brown. Black residents moved to places where they felt more \u201ccomfortable socially,\u201d he said.The tech industry, the motor of San Francisco\u2019s economy in recent years, has accelerated the decline. The tech industry skews white and Asian. John William Templeton, a local historian and an advocate for greater black participation in the industry, said it was disappointing that blacks were not more involved in one of America\u2019s most successful industries.Around 1 percent of employees at tech companies in the Bay Area are black, down from 4 percent in 1998, according to Mr. Templeton.The shift was also partly encouraged by what is now recognized as an extensive and misguided city policy of eradicating what was called \u201curban blight.\u201d Thousands of homes in black neighborhoods were razed in the name of redevelopment from the 1950s to the 1970s. Theodore Miller, an aide to Mayor Edwin M. Lee, called it a \u201cterrible undertaking that had catastrophic consequences.\u201dThe city is by no means empty of African-Americans, especially in the business district; many blacks commute to work from other cities in the Bay Area.Still, Mr. Harris said he often found that he was the only African-American in restaurants or at the Commonwealth Club, where he helps organize seminars on science and technology.Frederick E. Jordan, a business leader who talks about the need for a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to woo more blacks to the city, says \u201cthere are no jobs and no contracts\u201d for blacks.\u201cOur backs are against the sea; we\u2019re almost out,\u201d said Mr. Jordan, who owns an engineering firm and is the chairman of the San Francisco African American Chamber of Commerce.\u201cWe have to rebuild our African-American middle class,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the mayor\u2019s aide. The majority of blacks who remain are disproportionally poor, with median incomes for blacks at $27,000 compared with $89,000 for whites, a disparity twice as large as the national average.The report found that while African-Americans make up about 6 percent of the city\u2019s residents, they constituted about 40 percent, 20 of 51, of the victims of officer-involved shootings from January 2010 through July 2015. In addition, the study found evidence of racial disparities in the rate of police stops and searches of African-Americans.Mr. Glover, who took part in the protests as a student, said the black exodus from the city made him \u201csad and angry.\u201dThe larger question, he said, is whether San Francisco is becoming an enclave for the rich.\u201cIt\u2019s a question about who we are and our responsibility to build our communities,\u201d he said, \u201cand not just based upon who has the ability to pay.\u201dThe frustration is keenly felt among those whose neighborhoods have lost their core. Many say they feel like strangers in their own city.\u201cYou get the feeling that people are thinking, \u2018You\u2019re still here?\u2019\u201d said Barbara Gainer, a probation officer and a jazz singer. She lives in the western reaches of the city, a neighborhood that was once predominantly black but now is mostly Asian-American, a segment that now makes up 34 percent of the city\u2019s population, up from 13 percent in 1970.Ms. Gainer says she is regularly asked if she wants to sell her house; her mailbox fills up with solicitations. The inquiries were flattering at first because they reminded her of the value of her property, but now she feels singled out. She remembers one couple in particular who approached her four or five times about selling. She tried to dissuade them.\u201cI said: \u2018Even if I sold you my house and you gave me this big price, why would I do that? Where would I live?\u2019\u201dThe reply stunned her: \u201cYou should go to Antioch. That\u2019s where your people go.\u201dAntioch, a city about 50 miles northeast, has a sizable African-American population.At Mr. Brown\u2019s Third Baptist Church, attendance has been steadily declining; on a recent Sunday, around 150 parishioners worshiped in a sanctuary that seats 1,100. \u201cWe pray that we would never be cut flowers, that we would always have roots,\u201d Mr. Brown told the congregation.Mr. Brown then told the story of hearing a radio program lamenting the looming extinction of a type of butterfly.\u201cAnd yet,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the basic compassion and common sense to realize that blacks are an endangered species in the city of San Francisco.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barclays Profit Down as It Accelerates Plans to Close Some Business", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Barclays, the British bank, said on Friday that its profit had fallen 41 percent as it accelerated its plans to sell or close businesses and assets that it no longer considered crucial to its strategy.James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, has said that disposing of those noncore businesses was a key to unlocking the earnings potential of the bank.Since joining the bank in December, Mr. Staley has sped up those moves and has been focusing the bank\u2019s strategy on two divisions: the British consumer bank and the corporate and investment bank.\u201cThe strategy remains the right one, in our view,\u201d Mr. Staley said during a conference call with journalists. \u201cOur strategy is anchored on the belief that you want to be a large diversified financial institution because we\u2019re not going to escape the volatility that you have in economic cycles. That is particularly noteworthy as we came out of the \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote.\u201cMr. Staley said the bank saw \u201cno reason\u201d to adjust its strategy or change the pace of its delivery, in light of the outcome of the June 23 referendum to leave the European Union, a departure known as Brexit.Uncertainty about the economic effect of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc has roiled the financial markets and hit bank stocks particularly hard across Europe.Barclays shares fell almost 22 percent in London between the vote and Thursday\u2019s close. But its shares were up 6 percent, at 155.35 pence, in morning trading in London on Friday.Since the British vote, the Bank of England has strongly signaled that economic pressures could prompt it to cut interest rates as soon as next month.Barclays said that its operating income, which is similar to revenue in the United States, declined 10 percent, to \u00a35.48 billion, in the second quarter, from \u00a36.07 billion in the period last year. Operating expenses were down 14 percent in the quarter, to \u00a33.87 billion.Barclays\u2019 noncore businesses reported a loss of \u00a3887 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of \u00a3324 million a year earlier.During the quarter, Barclays took a one-time loss of \u00a3182 million with the restructuring of a portfolio of loans made to the local authorities in Britain.Barclays also recognized an impairment of \u00a3372 million related to its consumer banking, life-insurance and wealth and investment management operations in France.A sale would complete Barclays\u2019 exit from retail banking in continental Europe. It has sold operations in Italy, Portugal and Spain in the past year.Mr. Staley said on Friday that the bank expected the drag of the noncore business on its expenses to fall significantly in 2017 as it continued to sell and close operations.Mr. Staley added that he expected expenses from its noncore business to be in the range of \u00a3400 million to \u00a3500 million in 2017. By comparison, the estimated expense cost from the noncore division this year is \u00a31.6 billion, he said.\u201cGiven the strong level of interest in the asset, we have increased confidence in our ability to deconsolidate Africa,\u201d Mr. Staley said.In its corporate and investment bank, profit declined 15 percent, to \u00a31.17 billion, in the second quarter, from \u00a31.38 billion in the period last year.The British consumer bank reported a profit of \u00a3141 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of \u00a3174 million in the second quarter of 2015.Advertisement"}

And his missive fails to address several more immediate concerns \u2013 not least how to finance his ambitions.Mr. Musk titled his post \u201cMaster Plan, Part Deux,\u201d \u2013 a reference to the \u201cSecret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)\u201d that he wrote almost 10 years ago to the day. That detailed how he was building an electric sports car to raise money to manufacture family-friendly vehicles. He has largely succeeded, which lessens the conceit of drafting a new outline for the next decade.Unlike in 2006, though, Mr. Musk\u2019s ideas are now mainstream. Larger carmakers have caught on to the appeal of both electric and self-driving vehicles \u2013 as have the likes of Google and Apple. Everyone is grappling with the concept of people sharing private vehicles or using a taxilike fleet.Tesla may have an advantage in some areas. It is, after all, solely committed to electric and autonomous cars while traditional players still concentrate on gasoline engines. But Daimler, Ford, Toyota and others have deep pockets, whereas Tesla is still losing money and has to raise capital just to make sure it has the cash to develop its more affordable Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk\u2019s vision also includes electric passenger buses and heavy-duty trucks. Those are not just expensive propositions; they\u2019re also technologically tough at present as batteries powerful enough to propel them are not yet commercially viable.In the more immediate future, shareholders have another concern: Mr. Musk\u2019s desire to combine Tesla with SolarCity, his home solar panel company. The plan does nothing to allay fears about the motives for the tie-up or the governance issues it raises.Mr. Musk\u2019s determination to think far ahead is a positive and infectious antidote to short-term financial markets. But it is also a stark reminder that shareholders are not even riding shotgun.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bull Market Blues", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe answer, I\u2019d suggest, isn\u2019t entirely positive. In fact, in some ways the stock market\u2019s gains reflect economic weaknesses, not strengths. And understanding how that works may help us make sense of the troubling state our economy is in.The truth, in any case, is that there are three big points of slippage between stock prices and the success of the economy in general. First, stock prices reflect profits, not overall incomes. Second, they also reflect the availability of other investment opportunities \u2014 or the lack thereof. Finally, the relationship between stock prices and real investment that expands the economy\u2019s capacity has gotten very tenuous.On the first point: We measure the economy\u2019s success by the extent to which it generates rising incomes for the population. But stocks don\u2019t reflect incomes in general; they only reflect the part of income that shows up as profits.On the second point: When investors buy stocks, they\u2019re buying a share of future profits. What that\u2019s worth to them depends on what other options they have for converting money today into income tomorrow. And these days those options are pretty poor, with interest rates on long-term government bonds not only very low by historical standards but zero or negative once you adjust for inflation. So investors are willing to pay a lot for future income, hence high stock prices for any given level of profits.This may seem, however, to present a paradox. If the private sector doesn\u2019t see itself as having a lot of good investment opportunities, how can profits be so high? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that these days profits often seem to bear little relationship to investment in new capacity. Instead, profits come from some kind of market power \u2014 brand position, the advantages of an established network, or good old-fashioned monopoly. And companies making profits from such power can simultaneously have high stock prices and little reason to spend.In other words, while record stock prices do put the lie to claims that the Obama administration has been anti-business, they\u2019re not evidence of a healthy economy. If anything, they\u2019re a sign of an economy with too few opportunities for productive investment and too much monopoly power.So when you read headlines about stock prices, remember: What\u2019s good for the Dow isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or vice versa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If a $2 Trillion Saudi Aramco Goes Public, Will It Withstand Outsider Scrutiny?", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewSimon C. Y. Wong is an independent adviser affiliated with Northwestern University and London School of Economics and Political Science.The Saudi Arabian government\u2019s potential plan to take the oil giant Saudi Aramco public has generated considerable excitement as well as concern. Once listed, Aramco will face the herculean challenge of answering to the differing priorities and demands of private shareholders and the Saudi government.Whether it lists in New York or London \u2013 favored destinations for an initial public offering that could put Aramco\u2019s market value at an astounding $2 trillion or more \u2013 the company will need to elevate its governance practices to retain the support of Western institutional investors, many of which have become increasingly activist on governance and sustainability.It is especially pressing in Aramco\u2019s case because the World Bank has found that the governance of national oil companies \u201ctypically compares unfavorably to private sector standards or other state-owned enterprises, whether it is regarding transparency, accountability, commercial oversight or management structures.\u201d Crucially, according to the multilateral institution, governance weaknesses hinder national oil companies\u2019 ability to \u201ccreate value.\u201dTo its credit, Saudi Aramco has taken steps to bolster its governance by appointing experienced independent directors to its board and signaling that once Aramco is listed, projects it undertakes on behalf of the Saudi government will be \u201cdelineated.\u201dBesides its core petroleum activities, Saudi Aramco operates hospitals, runs schools and provides other social services. Given Aramco\u2019s reputation for efficient management, several years ago the Saudi government even tasked it to build a new university. Recently, the government assigned the company a major role in helping develop the kingdom\u2019s non-oil economic sectors.Once Saudi Aramco becomes a publicly traded company, however, outside shareholders will probably insist on a stronger commercial focus.While it is understood that state ownership of commercial enterprises typically means that they will not focus exclusively on generating profits, there is growing support for the view \u2013 already adopted by countries like New Zealand and Finland \u2013 that social and public policy objectives should be explicitly agreed upon and the costs borne by the controlling government.The Saudi government\u2019s recent announcement that activities carried out by Aramco for the government will be delineated \u2013 but not eliminated \u2013 suggests that noncommercial objectives will remain a part of Aramco\u2019s remit.Ideally, those noncommercial objectives should be defined narrowly and be closely related to its sector and competence, with the Saudi government committing to pay the costs of pursuing them. Upon listing, information should be published regularly on how these obligations have been carried out and their costs, which should be independently verified.Aramco\u2019s chairman recently declared that one objective of going public is to \u201cremove this notion that Saudi Aramco is not transparent.\u201dWhile this is an encouraging signal, Aramco and the Saudi government should not underestimate the intensity of scrutiny that will come their way \u2013 particularly given the significance and prominence of the oil sector \u2013 or the demands for sunlight on wide-ranging areas, which could create considerable tension and discomfort given Saudi Arabia\u2019s reputation as a highly secretive society.Aramco has become more transparent in recent years. It has, for example, published an annual review in English for around a decade. But it has not furnished to the public detailed, audited financial figures, including independent verification of its declared oil and gas reserves.Furthermore, disclosure on Saudi Aramco\u2019s governance arrangements is sparse and clarity is limited on the respective responsibilities of the Supreme Council and board of directors, membership of the Supreme Council, whether any board committees exist and how top executives are remunerated.Lastly, outside investors are likely to demand detailed information on related-party transactions, particularly Aramco\u2019s transfers to the Saudi government and royal family.In many countries, there have been meaningful efforts to strengthen the autonomy of boards of state-owned enterprises from government, including through professionalizing the nomination process, introducing independent directors, and limiting the appointment of government officials and politicians.Given Aramco\u2019s history and role in the Saudi economy, it is not surprising that its top governance bodies \u2013 the Supreme Council and board \u2013 are dominated by government representatives. At present, Aramco\u2019s nine-member board comprises three government ministers \u2013 including the Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources as chairman \u2013 and an adviser to the Royal Court.Although Western investors will probably be pleased that Saudi Aramco has appointed Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s former chairman, Mark Moody-Stuart, and the former chairman of BG Group, Andrew Gould, as independent directors, the dominance of government representation on its board \u2013 if it persists after an I.P.O. \u2013 is likely to spur concern among Western investors that the company will not be sufficiently independent of government.In Norway, active politicians, government ministers and state secretaries are not permitted to sit on the boards of state-owned enterprises to \u201cavoid problems of partiality and conflicts of interest\u201d that could arise \u201cwhen the interests of the shareholders as a whole are not fully in harmony with the interests of the state.\u201dIn the past, Aramco\u2019s board appeared to have played a limited supervisory role. Ultimate responsibility for the company\u2019s strategy, planning, budget, policy and major appointments was handed to the Supreme Council for Petroleum and Mineral Affairs, the predecessor of the current Supreme Council for Saudi Aramco, which came into being a year ago. Going by the announcement last September that Aramco\u2019s current chief executive was appointed by the new Supreme Council \u2013 rather than by its board \u2013 this demarcation of authority looks to have stayed in place.By contrast, some countries such as New Zealand and Singapore have granted the boards of listed state companies full authority for direction and management, and confine their intervention largely to voting at shareholder meetings.The listing of enterprises that were previously wholly state-owned alters the power dynamics in ways that few governments fully appreciate at the outset. For state-owned enterprises with Western institutional investors on their shareholder registers, the state\u2019s control can weaken \u2013 particularly regarding the pursuit of social and public policy objectives \u2013 to a greater extent than its remaining equity stake, even at 95 percent as is likely to be the case with Aramco, would suggest.If Saudi Aramco feels unable to align its governance to international norms, it may be better off to remain private or list a subsidiary where these considerations can be taken fully into account.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Will Need His Oratory Powers to Sell Globalization", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byWhite House LetterWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Obama travels to North Carolina and Europe this week, he will press an argument that could define foreign policy in the last six months of his presidency: that Americans and Europeans must not forsake their open, interconnected societies for the nativism and nationalism preached by Donald J. Trump or Britain\u2019s Brexiteers.Few presidents have put more faith than Mr. Obama in the power of words to persuade audiences to accept a complex idea, whether it is the morality of a just war or the imperfect nature of American society. Yet countering the anti-immigration and anti-free-trade slogans in this election year will require all of his oratorical skills.\u201cPresident Obama has made a valiant attempt to build support for freer trade,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cBut the arguments in favor of free trade lack rhetorical and political resonance, especially amidst a heated political campaign.\u201dThe case for ambitious trade deals, Dr. Prasad said, is that they allow the United States to set the rules for its dealings with other countries, and to wield greater geopolitical influence. Yet those arguments are easily overshadowed by the simple, if dubious, assertion that the losses to the American economy from these deals are greater than the benefits.\u201cObama\u2019s ability to sway the debate about free trade has been hampered by those in his own party feeling the heat from constituents who are up in arms about weak employment and wage growth,\u201d Dr. Prasad said.White House officials said Mr. Obama would not hesitate to make a strong case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the campaign trail. But Josh Earnest, the press secretary, said the president\u2019s remarks on Tuesday in Charlotte would probably focus more on areas where he and Mrs. Clinton agreed.\u201cHis timing is pretty good,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIf he arrived the week before, the party would have been rip-roaring. Now everybody is sitting there with an ice pack on their forehead. They might be ready to listen to some sensible advice.\u201dThe departure of Britain from the European Union is likely to have significant, if not immediate, effects on Europe\u2019s security. Some experts express fear that it will weaken the response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, for example. At the Warsaw meeting, a senior administration official said, Mr. Obama plans to emphasize the need for the European Union to cooperate more closely with NATO.This has long been a goal of the United States, but the exit of Britain from the union makes it more urgent, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in advance of the NATO meeting. NATO and the European Union could collaborate in countering cyberattacks, coordinating military exercises and patrolling the central Mediterranean.But Britain\u2019s departure could pose problems for NATO. European diplomats said they expected France and Germany to consider closer military integration within the European Union \u2014 something Britain and the United States have resisted because they view it as competing with the alliance.The problem, the president said, is that it is too late to turn back.\u201cRestricting trade or giving in to protectionism in this 21st-century economy will not work,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cEven if we wanted to, we can\u2019t seal ourselves off from the rest of the world. The day after Brexit, people looked around and said: \u2018Oh! How is this going to work?\u2019\u201dBy recognizing people\u2019s fears while making the case for an interconnected world, Mr. Axelrod said, the president has found the \u201csweet spot\u201d in the debate. But telling people that they can do nothing to stem the tide of globalization is not a particularly appealing message.While Mr. Trudeau was talking about whether Canada would export more hydroelectric power to the United States, Mr. Obama began scribbling notes. When it was his turn to speak, he abruptly veered into a discussion of the meaning of populism, a term often used to describe the political appeals made by Mr. Trump or the pro-Brexit campaigners.\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that\u2019s been popping up is populist,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He described his own agenda as populist, in that he wanted to help ordinary people get economic opportunities, working mothers get child care and children get access to education. A candidate who has never worked on behalf of social justice or the interests of the poor, he said, could not be a populist.\u201cThat\u2019s not the measure of populism,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s nativism. Or xenophobia. Or worse.\u201dWhen he had finished, an obviously worked-up Mr. Obama apologized for the digression, saying that as he neared the end of his presidency, he felt entitled to go \u201con these occasional rants.\u201dThe next day, Mr. Earnest was asked if the president planned any more of these rants. \u201cConsidering we\u2019ve got another six and a half months to go before the end of the presidency,\u201d he replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s likely we\u2019re all going to get to enjoy at least one more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iraq Report Prompts More Defensiveness Than Regret From Tony Blair", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byJudging by much of the media reaction, he would have done better to save his breath.He has few defenders, especially within his own party, which was split at the time by his support for the war and has since shifted leftward again, repudiating much of what he stood for.Mr. Blair is such a pariah on the left, said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham, that \u201cif he says \u2018black,\u2019 almost everyone else will say \u2018white.\u2019 \u201dMr. Fielding added, \u201cIn the party he once led, to be described as Blairite is the greatest insult that can be leveled.\u201dMore broadly, Mr. Blair has failed to rehabilitate his image since leaving office, and in some ways has added to his problems.Though he set up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, intended to counter religious conflict and extremism, its work has been overshadowed by his business interests. Mr. Blair\u2019s wealth, and his willingness to advise nations with poor human rights records such as Kazakhstan, has fueled another strand of criticism: that he was always too impressed by those with power and money. And his diplomatic work, trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ran up against the intractability of the conflicts in that region.\u201cThere will not be a day of my life where I do not relive and rethink what happened,\u201d Mr. Blair said, referring to the Iraq war. \u201cPeople ask me why I spend so much time in the Middle East today. This is why. This is why I work on Middle East peace, on the dialogue between faiths on how we can prevent young people growing up with hatred in their hearts towards those who look, think or believe differently from them.\u201dThe 2.6-million-word report released on Wednesday was a savage indictment of Britain\u2019s involvement in Iraq, condemning it as ill prepared and poorly executed, and concluding that it was based on flawed and unchallenged intelligence.In confronting the charges against him, Mr. Blair spoke sometimes in confessional terms, acknowledging those failings with \u201cmore sorrow, regret and apology and in greater measure than you can know or may believe.\u201dBut what he did not do was to accept the fundamental premise of many of his critics: that he had been wrong to sanction military action against Saddam Hussein.The view of many of the protesters who gathered on Wednesday waving placards reading \u201cBLIAR,\u201d and of relatives of some of those who died in the conflict, is that he is culpable for taking Britain into a disastrous war on false pretenses. There have been attempted citizens\u2019 arrests of him on war crimes charges.As one of his Labour Party critics, Diane Abbott, said on Thursday, Mr. Blair\u2019s reputation had \u201cbled to death in the sands of Iraq.\u201dMr. Blair was always unpopular among the left of the party, who felt he had gone too far in abandoning core principles for the center ground while embracing central elements of Thatcherism.Even they would admit that he was good at winning elections: He scored his third victory in 2005, after the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Blair presided over a generally healthy economy and helped build peace in Northern Ireland.But many Britons found it inexplicable that he chose to go to war alongside Mr. Bush. In 2003, Mr. Bush was unpopular in Britain, and so was going to war in Iraq.Mr. Blair has sought to address his critics previously, but not at such length and with such public emotion as he has since the publication of the new report on Wednesday. The gist of his response was that his job as prime minister was to make tough decisions and that while he regretted many of the consequences of this one, he stood by it as the best available option at the time.\u201cThe world is better off without Saddam,\u201d Mr. Blair told reporters in London, adding that had the Iraqi leader been left alone, he would have remained a threat to peace. And, had Mr. Hussein survived until the Arab Spring of 2011, he would have clung to power \u201cwith the same deadly consequences as we see in the carnage of Syria,\u201d Mr. Blair suggested.\u201cI will never agree that those who died or who were injured made their sacrifice in vain,\u201d said Mr. Blair, while acknowledging that some of the families of those casualties \u201ccannot and do not accept this is so.\u201dIn that he is correct.After the report\u2019s publication, Sarah O\u2019Connor, the relative of one victim, called Mr. Blair \u201cthe world\u2019s worst terrorist.\u201d Reg Keys, another victim\u2019s relative, described Mr. Blair as a \u201cconsummate actor\u201d and said that his long public statement resembled \u201cthe ramblings of a madman.\u201dWhile the report, seven years in the making, provides a damning indictment of sloppy decision-making, cataloging a host of policy and other failings, it does not accuse Mr. Blair of lying \u2014 a point to which the former prime minister returned frequently.Over the years, Mr. Blair has been accused by critics of deceiving Parliament and the public, and on Wednesday he said accusations of \u201cbad faith, of lying or deceit or deliberate misrepresentation\u201d should be laid to rest.\u201cI did not mislead this country,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cI made the decision in good faith on the information that I had at the time.\u201dHis unequivocal support for Mr. Bush was essential to prevent the United States from pursuing a unilateral foreign policy, Mr. Blair argued, rejecting the characterization of himself as the president\u2019s \u201cpoodle.\u201d He defended a message sent to Mr. Bush, before the decision to invade, including the phrase: \u201cI will be with you, whatever.\u201d That statement was, Mr. Blair said, \u201cnot a blank check.\u201dYet 13 years after Mr. Blair ordered British troops into action, his response to the latest inquiry is unlikely to bring closure because he is not budging on one central point.\u201cWhat I cannot do and will not do,\u201d Mr. Blair said, \u201cis say we took the wrong decision.\u201dMr. Fielding said history\u2019s judgment on Mr. Blair\u2019s premiership may be more positive, but that Mr. Blair has refused to do the one thing that might soften the damning verdict of his contemporaries.\u201cIf he was ever going to, this was the moment for him to apologize and say, \u2018We should not have done this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Fielding said. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t going to say this now, he will take this to his grave.\u201dAn article on July 8 about the defensive response by Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, to a damning report on how he led Britain into the Iraq war in 2003 misspelled the surname of a Labour Party critic who said his reputation had \u201cbled to death in the sands of Iraq.\u201d She is Diane Abbott, not Abbot.Follow Stephen Castle on Twitter @_StephenCastle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s What\u2019s Going Right, and Wrong, in the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsSeven years into the economic recovery and three months before a presidential election, how is the United States economy doing? Two reports released on Friday reveal the ways in which the economy is humming along brilliantly \u2014 and the things that are very worrying.We\u2019ll start with the good news. G.D.P. Better Than It LooksThe big headline about second-quarter G.D.P. was that the economy grew at only 1.2 percent, far below the 2.5 percent that analysts had forecast. But the shortfall was almost entirely because of a contraction in business inventories, which generally doesn\u2019t say a lot about the future.If we look at \u201cfinal sales,\u201d G.D.P. excluding inventories, the economy grew at 2.4 percent, a nice rebound from the winter months and in line with forecasts. Final sales tends to be a better measure of the underlying rate of growth, while inventories swing around without reflecting any long-term trend.Consumers Spending MoneyThe largest component of the economy, personal consumption expenditures, grew at a whopping 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter. That\u2019s evidence that a long-awaited rise in consumer spending from an improving job market and cheaper fuel prices is finally materializing. Americans are feeling a bit richer, and showing up in stores, restaurants and auto dealer lots ready to spend. For the first six months of 2016, total retail sales were up 3.1 percent over the same period of 2015.Wages Rising More QuicklyThe other good news in Friday\u2019s economic data involves wages. The employment cost index may not get as many headlines as G.D.P., but it is an important data set for understanding what employers are spending on employee pay and benefits.The total number was up 0.6 percent in the second quarter and is up 2.3 percent over the previous year. But the details of the report are more interesting. The wages and salary component of compensation is now up 2.5 percent over the last year; that same reading was only 2 percent in the second quarter.It\u2019s just one number, but it points to this conclusion: Worker pay is not just rising; it\u2019s also starting to rise at a faster pace. And it\u2019s coming in the form of cash compensation, not being eaten up by health insurance and other employer-provided benefits.So Americans are starting to see bigger paychecks, and are spending that money. What\u2019s the bad news?Investment ShrinkingThings aren\u2019t looking so great in the business sector. Investment in business structures, equipment and intellectual property fell for the third consecutive quarter.A decline in investment in energy exploration, because of a drop in the price of oil and natural gas, appears to be a major part of that decline. A strong dollar is hammering American exporters, another squeeze to profits that businesses are facing as they pay higher wages.The simple fact is that consumers are driving the economic train now, and businesses are pulling back. Eventually something will have to give \u2014 either businesses will have to increase investment to fulfill all that consumer demand, or weak business investment will translate into fewer jobs and weaker consumer spending.And that isn\u2019t altogether unrelated to the last, and most worrying, angle to pull out of Friday\u2019s economic data.Poor Productivity Growth Over time, it is worker productivity that determines how rich a society will be: How much economic output can be created from an hour, or a day, of human labor?The labor market, a downward blip in May aside, was quite strong through the first half of the year, with steady growth in the number of people working and the hours they put in. But according to the new G.D.P. numbers, the economy grew at only a 1 percent pace over the six-month span.Yes, inventory numbers may not tell us much about the future of the economy, but they do mean that a big portion of the demand for goods in the economy was fulfilled by taking stuff off warehouse and store shelves, but not to be replaced by workers making more stuff. So in the calculus of productivity, the fact that G.D.P. growth is so low matters, despite the role of inventories.Translation: Labor productivity fell 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to previously released data. New data to be released next Tuesday will probably show a gloomy story.What drives productivity is poorly understood, so it doesn\u2019t lend itself to easy solutions. The Federal Reserve can\u2019t magically flip a switch to increase productivity. But the new data is just the latest evidence that weak productivity growth is a grave threat to the United States\u2019 long-term prosperity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Child Care Expansion Takes a Toll on Poorly Paid Workers", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byCarmella Salinas has worked steadily for 14 years as an early-childhood-education teacher, taking care of 4- and 5-year-olds at the nonprofit Family Learning Center in the hardscrabble community of Espa\u00f1ola, just north of Santa Fe, N.M. Even so, she rarely earns enough to cover all her bills, and has more than once received a disconnection letter from the water, gas or electric company. A few months ago, she arrived home with her 10-year-old son, Aaron, to find the electricity shut off.\u201cBut Mom,\u201d she recalled Aaron saying, \u201cdon\u2019t they know it\u2019s your birthday?\u201dBut as the academy researchers concluded, \u201cAdults who are underinformed, under-prepared, or subject to chronic stress themselves may contribute to children\u2019s experiences of adversity and stress and undermine their development and learning.\u201dMs. Salinas, 43, knows such stress too well. After 14 years, she earns $12.89 an hour, but her work week is capped at 32 hours. If she worked more than that, the nonprofit center would have to provide her with benefits, which it cannot afford. In past years, enough parents managed to pay tuition during the summer, but not this time. As a result, she is without a job until state funding for prekindergarten starts to flow again in September.For a while, Ms. Salinas got a second job to supplement her paycheck, but the extra money meant she no longer qualified for food stamps and Medicaid.Without public assistance, she was unable to afford the two inhalers \u2014 one was $200, the other was $75 \u2014 that she needed for her chronic asthma. \u201cI was hospitalized last year from complications from asthma,\u201d she said. \u201cI was rationing the medication. I am supposed to have four puffs, but I would think, \u2018Can I get by with one?\u2019\u201dNor could she afford enough groceries. When her food stamps came through a couple of weeks ago, she stocked the refrigerator. Unaccustomed to seeing such a crowd of yogurt, carrots, strawberries, lunch meat, milk and orange juice, her son asked, \u201cMom, are we rich now?\u201d\u201cNo, baby,\u201d Ms. Salinas recalled saying with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re really, really poor.\u201dMs. Salinas said she could not manage at all if she had not inherited her mother\u2019s house a few years ago. But staying on top of the bills is still tough. When her 1999 Dodge Durango broke down last year, it took her four months to save enough to get it fixed.New Mexico, like some other states, provides limited stipends to help teachers earn the credentials they lack. But the money, Ms. Salinas said, is only enough to cover one class each semester. She has been taking weekend or evening classes since 2005 to get a bachelor\u2019s degree.After eight years of similar part-time schooling, Mona Zamora, now 33, earned her diploma while working at a child care center in Las Cruces. At a job fair, she learned about an opening for a kindergarten teacher in Mesa, Ariz., where she is now moving with her two children. Her salary will be $38,000 a year \u2014 almost a third more than she earned in New Mexico \u2014 plus health insurance and a retirement program.\u201cOnce I graduated and got my degree, the job that I was working at for over eight years wasn\u2019t able to compete with the pay and benefits,\u201d Ms. Zamora said.Public schools, even in poor states, generally pay better than nonprofit and private child care centers. At the same time, elementary school teachers tend to earn twice as much as prekindergarten teachers, and caretakers of toddlers and infants are further down on the income scale, according to the Berkeley report.Ms. Whitebook at Berkeley acknowledged that while many mothers did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, handling a roomful of children required different skills from caring for one\u2019s own. \u201cThe work of caring for and educating the youngest children is as complex and requires as much knowledge as working with kids 5 to 8,\u201d she said.She commended states for focusing on improved training and qualifications, but said it was not enough. Child care workers need professional support in the classroom, she said, and \u201cwe need to raise the floor so people are making a living wage.\u201dBut using standards for teachers at public school as a benchmark troubles Katharine Stevens, an education policy researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\u201cIt\u2019s a model that has largely failed disadvantaged kids,\u201d Ms. Stevens said, noting that early childhood education offers a particularly potent opportunity to help level the playing field for poor children, who can lag as much as two years behind by the time they start kindergarten. \u201cThis is a crucial area and we need people who are good at it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a college degree may not be necessary to be a very good caretaker of infants and toddlers.\u201dChild care workers deserve more than poverty wages, Ms. Stevens said, adding: \u201cLeaping to a just-add-water-and-stir solution is going to backfire. We don\u2019t know what credentials or what training leads to child care workers and teachers being effective with very young children.\u201dAnd raising wages would also make child care more expensive \u2014 putting it further out of reach for low- and moderate-income families, and stretching already tight state budgets.The Berkeley researchers counter that the push to expand child care has come at the expense of the poorly paid women who do the work. \u201cA major goal of early childhood services has been to relieve poverty among children, yet many of these same efforts continue to generate poverty in the predominantly female, ethnically and racially diverse early-childhood-education work force,\u201d the report states.Despite all of her own financial hardships, Ms. Salinas in Espa\u00f1ola said there was no other job she would rather have. \u201cI realized that this was my calling in life,\u201d she said, making the discovery after finding a part-time job at a day care center when her two older daughters were living at home.Even so, Ms. Salinas and her colleagues have families of their own to support. On a trip to lobby for education funding at the state Capitol in Santa Fe, she remembered meeting with a senator who told her, \u201cYou don\u2019t get into this for the money; you\u2019re paid in love.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d she replied. \u201cWhen my landlord comes, can I just give him a hug?\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption with this article reversed the given and surnames of a photographer.

{"Headline": "Pointing a Finger at the Fed in the Lehman Disaster", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseThe widespread anger, frustration and disillusionment that has fueled the rise of Donald J. Trump can be traced to Lehman\u2019s collapse, the bailout of Wall Street and the ensuing Great Recession.No wonder the debate over Lehman\u2019s fate, and whether it could have been avoided by Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, hasn\u2019t subsided.In especially strong language for an academic, Professor Ball takes issue with the established narrative that the Fed was powerless to lend to Lehman in its waning hours: \u201cFed officials have not been transparent about the Lehman crisis. Their explanations for their actions rest on flawed economic and legal reasoning and dubious factual claims.\u201dBy focusing narrowly on a claim by the Fed that it had no choice but to let Lehman fail, Professor Ball, in his 214-page paper, has brought much needed clarity and rigor to the historical record. His conclusions directly contradict accounts in testimony, memoirs and myriad media interviews by the principal decision makers \u2014 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman; and Timothy F. Geithner, who was president of the New York Fed.That\u2019s because by statute the Fed can make loans only to institutions it believes can pay them back. Again, to quote Mr. Bernanke: \u201cThe company\u2019s available collateral fell well short of the amount needed to secure a Federal Reserve loan of sufficient size to meet its funding needs.\u201dBut after what seems an exhaustive review of a now voluminous record of transcripts, exhibits and other evidence from multiple official inquiries, Professor Ball concludes there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the decision-makers \u201cexamined the adequacy of Lehman\u2019s collateral, or that legal barriers deterred them from assisting the firm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s out of the mainstream of what most academics do,\u201d David Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, told me this week about Professor Ball\u2019s paper. (Professor Romer read and commented on an early draft.) \u201cIt\u2019s likely to offend some people and be controversial. But with respect to the specific questions he asks\u201d \u2014 did the Fed have the legal authority to lend and was it forced to shut Lehman down \u2014 \u201cI find his answers pretty compelling.\u201dProfessor Ball has an impressive roster of mainstream economics credentials: He has a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, taught at Harvard and Princeton, is a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund and is a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\u201cLarry Ball\u2019s carefully researched work is incredibly important for drawing the proper lessons from the 2008 crisis,\u201d said Athanasios Orphanides, an economics professor and expert on central banking at M.I.T.\u2019s Sloan School of Management.I did speak to several people who remain unpersuaded (none willing to be identified), and it\u2019s fair to say no one paper will ever fully resolve this debate. Several said that, however impressive in the abstract, Professor Ball\u2019s analysis was missing a real-world perspective, which was that almost no one believed at the time that Lehman was solvent and virtually nothing short of a politically untenable federal takeover of Lehman would have staved off a run. Defenders of the theory that Lehman was deeply insolvent also point to the fact that Lehman\u2019s creditors ended up suffering tens of billions of dollars of losses in the bankruptcy.None of the principals themselves have budged from their oft-stated positions that the Fed\u2019s hands were tied. Mr. Paulson said he stood by earlier comments he gave me: \u201cWe were united in our determination to do all we can to prevent a systemically important institution from going down.\u201d He added, \u201cAlthough it was Ben and Tim\u2019s decision to make, I shared their view that Lehman was insolvent and I know the marketplace did.\u201dMr. Geithner said he had not read the paper and thus could not comment. Mr. Bernanke didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.That isn\u2019t to say that, during the maelstrom of events that precipitated the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s legal authority wasn\u2019t the subject of continuing concern to Treasury and Fed officials. But it also was not the be-all and end-all that it was eventually characterized as in subsequent accounts of the crisis, which also had the self-serving effect of absolving the officials of any blame for what, with benefit of hindsight, seems a deeply flawed judgment call.\u201cI\u2019d always had these nagging questions about why the Fed stepped in with Bear Stearns and A.I.G. but not Lehman,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cThe explanations never really made sense.\u201dAs one example, he noted the oft-cited rationale that Fed officials \u201cshouldn\u2019t lend into a run\u201d and that a loan to Lehman would have been \u201ca bridge to nowhere.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsensical,\u201d Professor Ball said. \u201cIt\u2019s Economics 101. That\u2019s exactly when the lender of last resort needs to lend.\u201dOne of the more intriguing questions Professor Ball tackles is why Mr. Paulson, rather than Mr. Bernanke, appears to have been the primary decision maker, when sole authority to lend to an institution in distress rests with the Fed. The answer, he suggests, is to be found more in psychology than data.\u201cBy many accounts, Paulson was a highly assertive person who often told others what to do, and Bernanke was not,\u201d Professor Ball writes. \u201cBased on these traits, we would expect Paulson to take charge in a crisis.\u201dThere\u2019s no way to know whether lending to Lehman that weekend would have staved off a financial crisis, or significantly reduced its magnitude.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to judge them or say I or anyone else would have done any better,\u201d Professor Ball said. \u201cThere was extraordinary political pressure not to bail out Lehman, and it would have been very difficult to go against that. But that\u2019s completely different from what they\u2019ve said. The record needs to be set straight.\u201dProfessor Ball concludes: \u201cLehman might have survived indefinitely as an independent firm; it might have been acquired by another institution; or eventually it might have been forced to wind down its business. Any of these outcomes, however, would likely have been less disruptive to the financial system than the bankruptcy that actually occurred.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is Athanasios Orphanides, not Athansios.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Future of Natural Gas Hinges on Stanching Methane Leaks", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byDAMASCUS, Ark. \u2014 In the energy business, natural gas is supposed to be one of the good guys \u2014 the cleaner-burning fossil fuel that can help wean the world from dirty coal during the transition to a low-carbon future.But when natural gas escapes unburned, as it often does during production and distribution, it is a big troublemaker. Its essential component, methane, is particularly pernicious \u2014 a greenhouse gas that is more than 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over 20 years as it dissipates.That is why, on a recent sweltering day, a team of Southwestern Energy technicians went hunting for leaky pipes and wells on the rolling cow pastures of northern Arkansas. They rode in pickup trucks, outfitted with infrared cameras and laser-beam scanners.Wearing hot, fire-retardant suits, they pulled up to a compressor station called Yogi 1, and, enduring the station\u2019s deafening noise, spent 90 minutes with their high-tech detection gear looking for leaks. Finally finding one, on a gas line connector, they made a quick repair.Then one team member performed a decidedly low-tech test, pouring a bottle of soapy water over the patch. Although popping bubbles indicated methane was still seeping, one more turn of the wrench made the bubbles disappear.\u201cIn the war against methane emissions,\u201d Eric Davis, a member of the Southwestern team said, smiling, \u201cwe won this battle.\u201dBut the war is far from won, and the reputation of natural gas \u2014 not to mention a big part of the global effort against climate change \u2014 may hang in the balance.Methane has many sources, including flatulent cows and decomposing landfills. But the oil and gas industry may be the nation\u2019s biggest emitter of leaked methane, gas that might otherwise stay underground for eons.While coal still predominates in many parts of the world, especially in emerging economies, natural gas has already replaced coal as the United States\u2019 leading fuel for power plants. But the American energy industry lets enough natural gas escape each year to meet the heating and cooking needs of about seven million homes annually.That runaway gas also creates about the same short-term climate impact as 240 coal-fired power plants, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.So federal regulators have begun cracking down, especially since the climate conference in Paris last December, when the United States and most other nations committed to controlling global warming.In May, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the first federal regulations aimed at curbing the escape of methane from new wells and equipment by requiring emissions-control devices and regular monitoring.The Bureau of Land Management plans to write rules this year to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas wells on federal and tribal lands.Even more sweeping could be an E.P.A. data collection program underway on the country\u2019s tens of thousands of oil and gas operations, an effort that could lead to far broader regulations on the industry in the next few years.The November election may determine the eventual potency of any new regulations. Hillary Clinton backs efforts to curb climate change, while Donald J. Trump disputes evidence of global warming.Without explicitly endorsing new rules, Southwestern Energy \u2014 the No. 3 natural gas producer in the United States after Exxon Mobil and Chesapeake Energy \u2014 is among several prominent companies that agree that more methane controls are necessary.\u201cNatural gas is a natural bridge to a low-carbon future, but if it\u2019s a rickety bridge that leaks methane, why would you take that bridge?\u201d said Mark K. Boling, executive vice president of Southwestern, which is based in Houston. \u201cThe Paris climate accord tells us we have got to do something about this.\u2019\u2019Here in the giant Fayetteville shale field that spans northern Arkansas, Southwestern has upgraded pumps and compressors, and has deployed new tanks to capture surges of gas that belch out of wells after they are hydraulically fractured. It has even replaced leaky gas-powered control equipment with gear powered by solar panels and fuel cells.Southwestern says the more than $14 million it has spent on equipment, studies and other efforts to stem gas leaks has nearly paid for itself with the methane captured and sold.But some others in the industry are pushing back. They say new, more efficient extraction methods make additional oversight unnecessary \u2014 and too expensive, given the collapse of natural gas prices in recent years that has bankrupted scores of producers and saddled hundreds of others with debt.Smaller companies say they simply do not have an extra $100,000 to spend on an infrared camera, or the personnel to do extra inspections and paperwork. They predict that operators will close thousands of wells rather than pay the extra costs. Each well that is closed means 12 fewer industry jobs, they say.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely onerous, and it\u2019s going to put a lot of people out of business,\u201d said Patrick M. Montalban, chief executive of Mountainview Energy, which operates wells in Montana and North Dakota.Environmentalists counter that many solutions are not expensive.Replacing a control device on a gas storage tank that vents methane can cost as little as $3,000, for instance. And in cases where companies vent their gas wells, another big source of escaping methane, drillers can use the cheap and time-honored method of flaring \u2014 burning it off. That produces carbon dioxide, but it is less environmentally damaging than raw methane.Meanwhile, service companies are cropping up around the country to do the inspection and repair work more cheaply than small drillers can do it themselves.\u201cIf the industry doesn\u2019t take this seriously, you are going to continue to have tighter and tighter regulations,\u201d said Richard Hyde, managing director for federal and government affairs at one of the One Future members, AGL Resources.Southwestern is participating in projects with the Environmental Defense Fund, General Electric, IBM and a Silicon Valley start-up called Acutect to test continuous methane detection systems around wells and equipment using lasers, sensors and even drones.\u201cWe need to move more rapidly,\u201d said Mr. Boling of Southwestern. \u201cWe better do everything we can to ensure that when a decision is made to close a coal-fired plant and replace it with a natural gas plant, we are actually getting the climate benefit we are saying you will get.\u201dSouthwestern\u2019s leak-hunting crews say they can attest to the company\u2019s efforts.In February, an inspection of the Yogi 1 compressor station revealed half a dozen leaks. The more recent visit, finding only one leak that was fixed to soap-bottle standards, was a sign of progress.\u201cWe\u2019re going down paths others haven\u2019t,\u201d said Douglas Jordan, Southwestern\u2019s corporate environmental program director, as he watched the technicians work. \u201cWe\u2019re always chasing methane molecules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Scan the Murky Waters of Britain\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byRunning Britain right now is not unlike steering a battered corporation.Yet a country cannot just leave a large free-trade area that absorbs over 40 percent of its exports \u2014 and plays a large role in attracting foreign investment \u2014 without suffering significant economic pain.The pervasive uncertainty is most likely causing people and companies to pull back on their spending. As a result, some economists are now expecting a recession to hit Britain. Also, the pound has slumped against the dollar and the euro. Though a weaker currency may help British exports, by making British goods cheaper in terms of other currencies, it could also damage the country\u2019s economy by making imports more expensive and pushing up the overall inflation rate.There are signs that investors are not expecting the worst.The FTSE 100 index, a benchmark that measures the stock price of large British companies, is up 6.7 percent since the day before the Brexit vote on June 23. The FTSE 250, which analysts say contains more companies that would be hurt by Brexit, plunged after the referendum, but after something of a recovery, it is now only 2 percent below its level on the day before the vote. Of course, the weakened pound makes the performance of these benchmarks worse in dollar terms.British government bonds have rallied in recent days, allowing the government to borrow at a lower cost. This could make it easier for the government to spend money to offset some of the negative impacts of leaving the European Union.But many things could smash whatever optimism exists in the markets.The biggest challenge to Britain is what happens with its trade with the European Union. Ideally, the country would continue to access the European single market on current advantageous terms. But Europe\u2019s leaders have said that, to have those terms, Britain must accept the free movement of European Union citizens into Britain. Since concern about immigration led many voters to vote for Brexit, the British government is unlikely to accept that condition. As a result, Britain will be left trying to negotiate a new trade deal with Europe, which is most unlikely to grant the country the same terms as it grants its members.But it is hard to assess the damage that could be caused. Companies do not invest in countries solely on the basis of whether they get access to certain markets. They may, for instance, prefer Britain because they perceive the country to have looser labor laws than other European countries, or a more reliable legal system.Still, it would be hard for European countries to take a punitive stance on trade against Britain. International trade agreements limit many tariffs.And, crucially, it may not be possible to shut British financial firms out of European business. Take the financial regulations that are to be introduced in 2018. Under these, non-European Union banks that operate under regulations that are considered equivalent to those of the European Union can do business in the bloc. Lawyers caution that this arrangement does not grant the same automatic access as Europe\u2019s so-called banking passports, and they add that future disagreements between Britain and the European Union might lead the bloc to deny Britain equivalence.Still, they say that it is possible that London-based banks will end up providing more or less the same services as they do today. \u201cThat is the Utopian position, and if you asked me if we\u2019ll be there in five years, I think we will be,\u201d said Jake Green, a partner at Ashurst, a law firm. \u201cBut there will be so much uncertainty.\u201dBut weeks may be too long for the markets to wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Nederlander, Theater Owner Known as Broadway\u2019s Last Patriarch, Dies at 94", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byJames M. Nederlander, who, with mercenary guile and an admittedly plebeian aesthetic, presided for nearly half a century over a theater empire that encompassed as many as 10 houses on Broadway and stretched across the country to California and across the Atlantic to London, died on Monday in Southampton, N.Y. He was 94.His death was confirmed by Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization.Mr. Nederlander (pronounced NEE-der-lan-der), chairman of the organization, an entertainment company that presented arena concerts as well as theatrical shows, began with the purchase of a single New York theater, the Palace on Broadway, in 1964, and rose to become a legitimate rival to the powerful Shuberts.The dimensions of the company\u2019s holdings have shifted over the years, but the Nederlander Organization currently owns or operates nine Broadway theaters \u2014 in addition to the Palace, they are the Brooks Atkinson, Gershwin, Lunt-Fontanne, Marquis, Minskoff, Nederlander, Neil Simon and Richard Rodgers \u2014 two in Detroit, one in Los Angeles, four in Chicago and three in London, as well as others in San Diego, San Jose, Calif., Tucson, Durham, N.C., Charleston, S.C., and a concert hall in Anaheim, Calif.One of five brothers who entered the family business started by their father (he also had a sister), Mr. Nederlander was often referred to as Broadway\u2019s last patriarch. Theater people called him Jimmy when they were talking to him and Senior when they were talking about him, to distinguish him from his son, James L. Nederlander, who is the longtime president of the Nederlander Organization.Unlike many in the theater, Mr. Nederlander never disguised his profit motive with a glorification of art. No one ever accused him of pretentiousness, as they sometimes did his chief rivals, Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld, the longtime leaders of the Shubert Organization. Nor would anyone ever think to nominate him to lead the National Endowment for the Arts, as Rocco Landesman, who formerly headed Broadway\u2019s other significant multitheater owner, Jujamcyn Theaters, was asked to do by President Obama in 2009.Not that Mr. Nederlander was averse to classical or original theater. Frequently a producer of shows as well as the theater owner, he presented troupes including the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Bolshoi Ballet; Ibsen\u2019s \u201cGhosts\u201d and Pinter\u2019s \u201cBetrayal,\u201d and \u201cThe Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,\u201d David Edgar\u2019s adaptation, a two-part, eight-hour marathon, of Dickens\u2019s novel.He once said that \u201cCopenhagen,\u201d Michael Frayn\u2019s dramatic disquisition on quantum physics (whose 2001 national tour was produced by Mr. Nederlander and others) was one of his favorite dramas. Stephen Sondheim\u2019s darkly boisterous musical \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d made its Broadway debut in a Nederlander house.\u201cWe were walking up the aisle, and I said, \u2018Wow, Jimmy, great play, eh?\u2019\u201d Mr. Breglio said in a 2009 interview. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Yeah, but Jesus, it\u2019s talky.\u2019\u201dHis stated preference was for broad-based popular entertainment, especially musicals, often with familiar titles and recognizable stars. \u201cSweet Charity\u201d (1966) with Gwen Verdon; \u201cAnnie\u201d (1977); \u201cThe Will Rogers Follies\u201d (1991) with Keith Carradine; Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d (1994) with Glenn Close; \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d (1999); \u201cMovin\u2019 Out\u201d (2002), the Billy Joel-Twyla Tharp dance musical; \u201cWicked\u201d a twist on \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d based on a novel by Gregory Maguire, which opened in 2003 at the Gershwin and is still there; \u201cHairspray\u201d (2002), and \u201cIn the Heights\u201d (2008), Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s first Tony-winning show: All appeared in Nederlander houses on Broadway.Mr. Miranda\u2019s megahit \u201cHamilton\u201d is in one now, the Rodgers on West 46th Street, where it is likely to remain for a long time.The myriad revivals that appeared in Nederlander houses included \u201cThe King and I\u201d in 1977 with Yul Brynner; \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d in 1978 with Carol Channing; \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d (1992) with Raul Julia; \u201cCamelot\u201d (1993) with Robert Goulet; \u201cHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\u201d (1995) with Matthew Broderick; \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d (1999) with Bernadette Peters (and later Reba McEntire), and \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d (2004) with Alfred Molina (and later Harvey Fierstein).Mr. Nederlander frequently filled dark nights in his Broadway theaters with concert performances or short-run solo shows by the likes of Patti LaBelle, Shirley Bassey, Smokey Robinson, Kenny Rogers, Barry Manilow, Joan Jett and Rodney Dangerfield.The Nederlander Organization\u2019s Broadway houses are not exactly the theaters of legend. They are mostly big and barnlike \u2014 the Gershwin, the Minskoff, the Marquis \u2014 or else they are oddly shaped, like the shoebox Lunt-Fontanne, or out of the way, like the Nederlander on West 41st Street, and the company was not always known to give them the spit-and-polish care that the Shuberts lavished on the showcase theaters on and around West 45th Street.The theaters were sometimes victims of spotty upkeep, a kind of seediness that finally worked in the company\u2019s favor when \u201cRent,\u201d Jonathan Larson\u2019s musical set in a seedy downtown neighborhood, opened in 1996 in the long-neglected Nederlander (formerly the Billy Rose and, briefly, the Trafalgar), a match of setting and venue that helped a much-ballyhooed show run for a dozen years.In 1989, during an especially lackluster period on Broadway, Mr. Nederlander leased perhaps his most elegant property, the Mark Hellinger Theater on 51st Street and Broadway, home to the original \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d to the Times Square Church, saying that when the lease was up he would return it to theatrical use. But he sold the theater to the church in 1991, a move still bitterly lamented by some producers today.\u201cI wish he hadn\u2019t sold that great theater,\u201d said James B. Freydberg, a veteran producer. \u201cThat\u2019s not the theater business. That\u2019s the real estate business.\u201dAll of this contributed to the Nederlander Organization\u2019s reputation as, unkindly expressed, a Broadway used-car lot or, less unkindly, an economy shop. It wasn\u2019t a reputation Mr. Nederlander necessarily cared to combat. He had a handful of favorite tenets that he would sprinkle about liberally in interviews:There are no bad theaters, he would say, only bad shows.We\u2019re in the moving business, he would say; we move \u2019em in and we move \u2019em out.He disdained anyone who claimed the ability to predict which shows would be hits and which would be flops; he kept the posters of his own flop shows \u2014 \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public,\u201d \u201cLegs Diamond,\u201d \u201cNick and Nora,\u201d \u201cShogun: The Musical\u201d \u2014 on the wall of his office bathroom.\u201cThey had to be not just failures, but failures of note,\u201d Mr. Scandalios said in an interview on Tuesday.And yet Mr. Nederlander maintained good relations with most producers; theater people respected him and liked him. He was given a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2004.\u201cHe was honest and decent,\u201d Mr. Breglio said. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like something he\u2019d tell you. There was no duplicity there, and only one agenda: putting moneymaking shows in theaters.\u201dJames Morton Nederlander was born in Detroit on March 31, 1922, the third of six children of David T. Nederlander (known as D.T.),who started the family business in 1912 by acquiring the lease on the old Detroit Opera House.A diminutive man \u2014 he was 5-foot-5 \u2014 with a shrewd business sense, the elder Mr. Nederlander was known for a tough-minded resistance to the demands of actors, producers and unions, and for an acerbic wit. Once, when the actress Constance Bennett was performing in one of his theaters in Detroit, she complained about noise in the alley outside her dressing room.\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll move the alley for you,\u201d he said.Young James attended the Detroit Institute of Technology \u2014 he intended to be a lawyer \u2014 but he was broke and began a theater apprenticeship, going to work in the box office of the Shubert Theater in Detroit, owned by his father, for $25 a week.He served stateside in the Army Air Forces in World War II, during which he made his first stop on Broadway, working on \u201cWinged Victory,\u201d the patriotic show written by Moss Hart that was commissioned and produced by the Army Air Forces. After the war \u2014 and especially after the government loosened the stranglehold of the Shubert Organization on the business of live theater, forcing the Shuberts to relinquish control of theaters in several cities, including Detroit \u2014 he helped expand the Nederlander empire, opening theaters in Toledo, Minneapolis and Chicago.\u201cWhen you\u2019re blue, they buy you lunch; when you\u2019re broke, they lend you money,\u201d the producer Alexander H. Cohen told The New York Times in 1970 about the Nederlander way of doing business. \u201cBut they\u2019re not pushovers. They expect loyalty and demand respect.

{"Headline": "A Sequel to the Paris Climate Accord Takes Shape in Vienna", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When negotiators from nearly 200 countries gathered outside Paris in December for the United Nations summit meeting on climate change, they reached the first agreement to take action on curbing their planet-warming pollution.This weekend in Vienna, with far less attention, negotiators from those same countries neared a deal that many environmentalists have called the most significant action this year to reduce global warming.While the Paris agreement aims to reduce the use of coal and oil, which produce the carbon dioxide emissions that are the chief cause of global warming, negotiators in Vienna pushed ahead on a deal to ban the use of hydrofluorocarbons, chemicals used in air-conditioners and refrigerators. Although they contribute only a small percentage of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, these chemicals, known as HFCs, can trap heat in the atmosphere at levels a thousand times higher than carbon dioxide can, according to published scientific studies.Negotiations to ban HFCs have dragged on for seven years. But the draft language emerging from the Vienna talks could lead to a final deal ready to be signed during an October conference in Kigali, Rwanda.In response, chemical companies developed HFCs, which do not harm the ozone. But the substitute had the wholly unexpected side effect of increasing heat trapped in the atmosphere, which worsened climate change.Scientists estimate that an increase in average global temperatures of three degrees Fahrenheit could tip the planet into a dangerous future of rising sea levels, devastating droughts, extreme storms and shortages of food and water. Studies show that banning HFCs worldwide could prevent an increase of nearly one degree over the next century.\u201cAmending the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs is one of the single most important unitary steps that we could possibly take at this moment to stave off the worst impacts of climate change and to protect the future for people in every single corner of the globe,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in a speech to negotiators in Vienna on Friday.An amendment to the Montreal Protocol would have the force of law in almost every country, which could give it more potency than the Paris Agreement, a legal hybrid that lacks the binding force of a treaty. While some portions of the Paris Agreement are legally binding, the specific actions taken by countries to reduce their emissions are voluntary. And there are already questions about whether some countries will follow through on their Paris pledges.In Brazil, the impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff have thrown the fate of her Paris promise into question. Rodrigo Duterte, the new president of the Philippines, said this month that he would not honor the Paris agreement. And in the United States, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris accord.Most countries support some form of a deal to phase out HFCs, but some with developing economies, led by India, are pushing for a slow timeline. While the United States wants a deal that would phase out production of the chemicals in five years, Indian diplomats are pushing for 15. They say the costs of new substitute coolants will disproportionately affect the residents of developing countries in warm climates, where the use of air conditioning is expected to soar in coming decades.\u201cAn earlier date would impose economywide costs on India,\u201d said Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in New Delhi. \u201cThe cost of alternative refrigerants are eight to 10 times what is available.\u201dPresident Obama, who has sought to make climate change prevention a cornerstone of his legacy, has spoken at length with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India about reaching a deal, and Mr. Kerry flew to Vienna on Friday to personally engage in the negotiations. In his speech on Friday, he pledged that a final deal would include assistance from rich countries to help poorer ones deal with the cost of transitioning to the new chemicals, although he did not specify a dollar amount.Final details of timing and financial aid are expected to be established at the October meeting in Kigali.Many large American chemical companies are pushing hard for the amendment. Final passage of the deal could create a new market for their coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioners around the world.\u201cOur member companies pushed for this amendment for years,\u201d said Francis Dietz, a vice president of the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a lobbying group. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of unusual for industry to spend a lot of time trying to get regulated. But we knew regulations of HFCs were coming down the pike, and we\u2019re ready.\u201dHoneywell, the New Jersey-based multinational company that produces everything from aerospace systems to home thermostats, has already invested $900 million in developing and patenting an HFC substitute, now being made in two recently built plants in Baton Rouge, La. A third plant in Louisiana is planned for next year, in anticipation of a booming demand for the products after passage of the Montreal Protocol amendment.\u201cWe began developing replacements for HFCs years ago,\u201d said Ken Gayer, a vice president with Honeywell. Mr. Gayer said the company was already planning to make the new cooling products in India and China.The deal\u2019s support from major businesses has blunted much of the criticism that many Republicans in the United States typically bring to debates about efforts to control global warming. Obama administration officials have pointed out that the Montreal Protocol itself, which was largely negotiated by President Ronald Reagan, has long enjoyed bipartisan support. Those circumstances, and the relatively low profile of the Vienna talks, appear to have kept the HFC amendment out of the political fray that often surrounds climate change policy.Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who has led the United States delegation in Vienna, noted the change.\u201cIt\u2019s very different from the Paris climate meetings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been the same political dynamics as in that world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated proposals by the United States and India for limiting hydrofluorocarbons. The United States wants a deal that would phase out production in five years, not \u201cwithin 10 years,\u201d and India is pushing for a timeline of 15 years, not 15 to 20 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Honda Ridgeline, a Stylish Pickup for the Suburbs", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byDrivenPICKUPS are all about machismo. Sold with baritone voice-overs, country-rock music and images of heroic capability, trucks are testosterone in four-wheel form. Unless it\u2019s the second generation Honda Ridgeline.Honda has never played that virile game. The first generation of Ridgelines, built from 2005 through 2014, with its fuselage-style body and flying buttresses, looked like a \u201cBack to the Future\u201d prop that had gone soft in the sun.The Ridgeline is only now reappearing, redesigned, for the 2017 model year. The look is more traditional, but still lacks visual testosterone. This is more a pickup for suburbia than the rodeo.The typical use of such a vehicle is dump runs, hauling plywood sheets, or maybe towing a couple of dirt bikes. Ridgeline, with a payload capacity of 1,584 pounds and a max towing ability of 5,000 pounds, can do all of that. The bonus? It\u2019s also quiet and comfortable when commuting to your desk job.Ridgeline\u2019s size gets it lumped in with the Nissan Frontier, Toyota Tacoma and the General Motors twins: GMC Canyon and Chevy Colorado. But those trucks use body-on-frame chassis and solid rear axels, which make them more capable for heavy towing or off-road use.Ridgeline is unibody with an independent rear suspension, typically considered more \u201ccarlike.\u2019\u2019 It shares a basic architecture with the Honda Pilot crossover, adding strengthened control arms, hubs and struts. It also means that two-wheel-drive Ridgelines are front-drive, the only modern pickup to go that route.Starting at $30,375, the Ridgeline has no work-grade stripped version. At $42,270, the fancy-pants RTL-E model I\u2019m running errands in has all-wheel drive that provides real torque vectoring that can send up to 70 percent of the power to the rear wheels and 100 percent of that to the left or right tires. That helps the already lithe Ridgeline handle more crisply \u2014 even better than the well-regarded G.M. trucks.The Honda gallops from zero to 60 miles per hour in just under 7 seconds. The 280-horsepower 3.5-liter V6 with 262 pound-feet of torque sounds like a smooth Honda engine \u2014 not the growling exhaust notes that would befit a Sam Elliot voice-over.Ridgeline roams the range with a 6-speed automatic gearbox that lacks a manual mode for selecting specific ratios. But like a car, it can be shifted into low gear. There is also a way to lock it into fourth. While it has modes for driving on snow, mud and sand, the Toyota Tacoma is much more sure-footed on severe terrain.The E.P.A. rates the all-wheel-drive Ridgeline at 18 city and 25 highway, so its average fuel economy is best-in-class by one m.p.g. over comparable G.M. and Toyota trucks, and four better than the thirsty Nissan.Ridgeline\u2019s unibody structure gives up a ton of maximum towing ability to Colorado and Canyon, but the Honda\u2019s cabin is roomier (looking pretty much like the Pilot\u2019s). Suburban cowboys and cowgirls can surround themselves with luxuries like a heated steering wheel and a sound system that does justice to Blake Shelton\u2019s production values. Safety tech includes blind-spot warning, adaptive cruise control and auto-braking that detects pedestrians. (I\u2019m not sure about livestock.)The rear seat is raised for visibility and fine for the average hired hand. Cushions swing upward to create a space large enough to lock up a saddle or big-screen TV.Also lockable is Ridgeline\u2019s trunk, an unusual amenity for a pickup. This is a storage space under the 5-foot-4-inch bed\u2019s load floor that is the size of a very large cooler (and with a drain plug, it can be used as one).A 115-volt outlet in the sidewall powered the electric chain saw I used to cut up an old garage door that I hauled to the landfill. And while outside the cabin, I listened to a Sirius/XM country channel using the in-bed audio system that, instead of speakers, uses exciters to vibrate the walls of the bed. It\u2019s not audiophile-grade sound but it\u2019s decent.Unlike most tailgates that drop softly, Ridgeline\u2019s falls with a thud. Honda offers an advantage, though; it also opens to the side like a door.As a cowhand of average height, I find the load floor a bit high. The lack of boot-step slots in the bumper side makes getting into the bed awkward.Only about 250,000 first-generation Ridgelines were sold in the decade before they were discontinued. Ford can produce that many F-150s in four months.The armchair marketing guy in me believes Honda\u2019s truck would fly off the lot with some rugged cladding and macho trim inside. Hey, it worked for Subaru\u2019s Outback.But Ridgeline is the thinking person\u2019s truck, the rig that comfortably gets the job done for most users. It just looks like a city slicker.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Redfin Shies Away From the Typical Start-Up\u2019s Gig Economy", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 When Glenn Kelman became the chief executive of his online real estate start-up, he defied the tech industry\u2019s conventional wisdom about how to grow.Instead of hiring independent contractors, he brought in full-time employees and put them on the payroll \u2014 with benefits. That decision over a decade ago made Mr. Kelman and his company, Redfin, iconoclasts in the technology world.Many tech start-ups lean on the idea of the \u201cgig economy.\u201d They staff up rapidly with freelancers, who are both cheaper to hire (none of the insurance, 401(k) and other expenses) and more flexible (they can work as much or as little as needed). It\u2019s the model Uber has used to upend the taxi business.In a fairy-tale version of the Redfin story, the company\u2019s bet on employees would have resulted in industry-rattling success. The truth is more complicated.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done with employees has pressured the business,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.In Redfin\u2019s early days, prospective venture fund investors walked away, saying that betting on full-time employees was a deal killer for them. Its hiring strategy has slowed the company\u2019s growth and contributed to what Mr. Kelman calls a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d after the 2008 economic crisis. Problems like these illustrate why tech companies prefer to use contractors if they can.\u201cI think Silicon Valley is still a pioneer of work force models \u2014 but the model we pioneered is the 1099 model,\u201d Mr. Kelman said, referring to the tax form that independent contractors file. \u201cThis huge work force of laborers doesn\u2019t get to participate in the wealth that was created.\u201dMr. Kelman argues that full-time employees allow him to offer better customer service. Redfin gives its agents salaries, health benefits, 401(k) contributions and, for the most productive ones, Redfin stock, none of which is standard for contractors. Redfin currently employs more than 1,000 agents.Now with his company on a stronger footing, Mr. Kelman says he believes his approach has been vindicated. He has even become an informal counselor to other tech entrepreneurs exploring a shift to employees from contractors.But they are still the exception. The idea of building a large work force of full-time employees, outside of core disciplines like engineering, is not part of the ethos of most companies in today\u2019s tech industry, observers who have studied the industry say.\u201cThey don\u2019t see job security and workplace benefits as something that\u2019s valuable,\u201d said Louis Hyman, an associate professor of labor relations, law and history at the ILR School of Cornell University and author of a forthcoming book on temporary labor in the United States. \u201cWhat\u2019s valuable is doing cool stuff and scaling up and making a better tomorrow.\u201dRedfin sees itself in equal parts a technology and a real estate company. Its headquarters in a Seattle high-rise overlooking Elliott Bay are packed with engineers working on algorithms intended to match customers automatically with the best homes for them. Before joining Redfin, Mr. Kelman worked in Silicon Valley, where he was a co-founder of a company, Plumtree Software, that was sold for $200 million 11 years ago.It would have been a cinch for Redfin to hire its agents as contractors. After all, that\u2019s how most real estate brokerage firms work.Brokerage firms typically collect a flat \u201cdesk fee\u201d from agents who work in their offices, or take a cut of home sale commissions up to a specified amount. Most agents are on their own when it comes to finding health insurance, saving for retirement, and buying computer equipment and cellphones.For Redfin, a salary and benefits are catalysts for changing how agents like Karlyn Goetz usually operate.On a recent weekday afternoon, Ms. Goetz, a Redfin agent in Seattle, showed off a home in the city\u2019s Mount Baker neighborhood that just sold for $1.53 million. Ms. Goetz represented the buyers of the home, who were just hours from taking possession.Facing a bank of windows with expansive views of Lake Washington, Ms. Goetz praised the medical and dental benefits of her job, but said the real attraction was the company\u2019s business model. Because she gets a salary, she said she didn\u2019t feel the same pressure to close deals the way typical agents, who work entirely on commission, do.\u201cI never feel like I have to make a sale,\u201d said Ms. Goetz, who was previously a personal stylist at J. Crew. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about where the food on my plate is going to come from.\u201dRedfin agents receive bonuses for completed transactions that typically account for more than half of their annual compensation. But a big factor in calculating the bonuses is the agent ratings provided by Redfin customers after they buy or sell a home. Top performers get stock options.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie \u2014 we\u2019re motivated to sell homes,\u201d Ms. Goetz said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always in the context of the client and wanting them to have a good experience.\u201dRedfin does employ more than 900 contractors, whom it calls associate agents, to support its employee agents, using them to conduct house tours, coordinate inspections and perform other tasks. The company is fighting several lawsuits brought by former associate agents who said they should have been classified as employees. Redfin declined to comment on the pending litigation.Average annual compensation for Redfin agents is over $80,000, with agents in exceptionally expensive markets like the San Francisco Bay Area earning more, the company said.Instead of constantly hustling to find clients, Redfin\u2019s agents have leads funneled to them through the company\u2019s website. Redfin has sophisticated algorithms that figure out the kinds of homes visitors to its site will be interested in.Hiring and training Redfin agents has been expensive and slow compared with recruiting agent-contractors. Traditional brokerage firms don\u2019t have to worry about the big fixed costs of having agents on the payroll during slow fall and winter months.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the margins of some other companies in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Scott Nagel, president of real estate operations at Redfin.And when larger macroeconomic forces put the brakes on home sales, many traditional agents struggle or drift away from the profession. After the real estate recession of 2008 hit, Redfin laid off 20 percent of its work force.While Redfin has expanded more quickly in the last few years, now serving over 80 metropolitan areas, it has been a small fry in the real estate business since starting its online brokerage service a decade ago. In the Seattle area, its oldest market, the company has a little over 3 percent of the market, according to data from the Northwest Multiple Listing Service, and more than 100 agents on the ground.Windermere Real Estate, a leader in the region, which uses contractor agents, has almost 25 percent of the market and about eight times the agents Redfin has in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very hard model to scale,\u201d O. B. Jacobi, the president of Windermere, said of Redfin\u2019s approach. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to every major city and hire the amount of people you need to do really well as a company. That\u2019s one reason why Redfin has not had the impact on the real estate industry that they would have if they had independent contractors.\u201dStill, Redfin is growing. The company projects about $200 million in revenue this year, up about 50 percent from last year, and Mr. Kelman said it currently runs at a slight loss.Fund-raising for Redfin was brutal in 2008 during the recession, one of the \u201cnear-death experiences\u201d that still trouble Mr. Kelman. Several investors Mr. Kelman visited during that time were aghast at his decision to hire agents as employees. One from Los Angeles, whom Mr. Kelman declined to identify, told him Redfin\u2019s value was zero \u2014 less than its cash on hand \u2014 because the investor believed the company was going out of business.Still, Mr. Kelman found investors willing to be patient with Redfin.\u201cTo go down this path was contrarian,\u201d said James Slavet, a partner at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley that invested in Redfin. \u201cThe classic technology play is to be very scalable and have a small number of people whose products are used by millions of people.\u201dRedfin has raised about $166 million from venture capitalists and institutional investors, and Mr. Kelman hints that the next round of fund-raising for Redfin could be an initial public offering.Honor\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, Seth Sternberg, even spent time with Mr. Kelman at Honor\u2019s offices in the Bay Area to quiz him about moving to an employee model. Mr. Kelman\u2019s advice was to do everything you can to create a sense of one cohesive work force at Honor, rather than two, consisting of engineers \u2014 the rock stars at tech companies \u2014 and health care professionals.That schism was a problem in Redfin\u2019s early days. As engineers strutted around headquarters working on the company\u2019s website, agents felt as if they were doing the real work in the field. \u201cSome of the tensions that exist in society around whether tech is a coddled elite that really earns its pay existed here,\u201d Mr. Kelman said.The tensions were defused at one of Redfin\u2019s all-employee meetings about seven years ago, when a group of engineers donned T-shirts that said, \u201cI love agents,\u201d according to Bridget Frey, Redfin\u2019s chief technology officer.Chelsea Goyer, then a Redfin real estate agent, said the tactic worked. \u201cIt was basically a message that we are at your beck and call,\u201d said Ms. Goyer, now a director for partner programs and expansion at Redfin. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make you a better agent.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d Ms. Frey said. \u201cThat\u2019s held through the years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May\u2019s Vision of a Radical British Conservatism", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorBritain\u2019s new prime minister, Theresa May, is the leader of the Conservative Party there. Yet when it comes to the corporate world, she can sound more like Bernie Sanders than Margaret Thatcher.Her comments may not have received a great deal of attention in the United States, but her vision could inspire a new way of thinking about the role of the corporation in Britain and elsewhere.Speaking in Birmingham in central England on July 11, Ms. May struck a theme similar to many stump statements on campaign trails in countries around the world. She spoke of a vision of a country that \u201cworks not for a privileged few but for every one of us.\u201d The common worker has not seen the gains that executives have, she said.In Britain, wages have grown since the 2008 financial crisis, but only slowly, while low interest rates have helped \u201cthose on the property ladder at the expense of those who can\u2019t afford to own their own home,\u201d Ms. May said.And the changes she proposed in response could have come from the mouths of leaders of the opposition Labour Party, or indeed Mr. Sanders.Asserting that she was not \u201canti-business,\u201d Ms. May said that nonetheless more regulation of corporations was needed.\u201cBetter governance will help these companies to take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and that of the economy over all,\u201d she said.To wit, she criticized companies that are run by directors drawn from too \u201cnarrow\u201d social classes. Graduates of Eton, Harrow, Oxford and Cambridge should not dominate corporate boards.Instead, she called on corporations to cater more to their stakeholders. This means not just adding consumers to the board but employees, too, as is done in Continental Europe.This is indeed radical. In the United States, directors run boards for the benefit of shareholders. Ms. May, however, is calling for companies to be run by their communities.As part of this view, she was very critical of previous government decisions that had allowed foreign takeovers.As an alternative, she argued that communities, workers and other constituents should be taken into account. This would mean protecting important industries from foreign buyers, particularly pharmaceuticals.Britain has led the way in requiring shareholder votes, a stance that has been adopted by American securities regulators. But such votes, in Britain as in the United States, have been nonbinding. Ms. May\u2019s proposal would make them binding, leaving the decision on executive pay in the hands of shareholders.It may be tempting to dismiss Ms. May\u2019s words as simply populist political talk. It was a campaign speech after all, as she was seeking the leadership of the Conservative Party. And whether she will press for such an overhaul now that she is prime minister remains to be seen.Still, the changes she outlined, in tying corporations more closely to the state, represent a significant shift from the generally laissez-faire positions the Conservatives have held since the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s.Ms. May\u2019s proposal has the potential to be equally revolutionary: a call to rethink not just the supervision of the corporation but the state\u2019s relationship to the corporation.In Britain, as well as in the United States, the company has historically been viewed as a for-profit entity that is responsible to shareholders. This does not mean companies ignore communities and other constituencies, but that the primary goal of a company under established law is profit.This means boards are elected and appointed by shareholders who have a right to that profit. It also means that in the name of a free market, protectionism is reduced, rather than enhanced, to produce greater returns for shareholders.This is different from the approach taken elsewhere in Europe. There, employee representatives sit on boards, and governments have moved to protect national champions. The government of France designated the yogurt maker Danone as a \u201cnational champion\u201d and thus safe from foreign takeovers.Yet Ms. May is calling for companies to be more integrated with their stakeholders and the state itself.This is more akin to the socialism of Europe and Mr. Sanders than to the privatizing of British state enterprises under Mrs. Thatcher.In her speech, Ms. May acknowledged that her program marked \u201ca break with the past.\u201d She argued, however, that it was consistent with Conservative principles because conservatism was about \u201ccommunities\u201d and \u201csociety.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear if Ms. May\u2019s measures would work. For example, would a mandatory shareholder say on executive pay actually curb increases in compensation or make companies run better? In any case, that particular measure would very likely tie companies more closely to their shareholders and force more engagement, something we have already seen in the United States.There is a certain paradox in all of this. Just as Britons have voted to separate from Europe, her plan looks very European. It seeks greater engagement with workers and communities, as well as with shareholders \u2014 something that would not look out of place in, say, Germany.Given that the same issues are percolating, if not on the boil, in the United States, it may not be long before Ms. May\u2019s ideas are picked up here. The only question is whether Democrats or Republicans will do so.Advertisement"}

Still, you can hear hints of the melodic sweetness that marks Mr. Menken\u2019s music throughout this early show. And while Ashman, who wrote the book and lyrics, channels the giddy lunacy of Vonnegut throughout, his lyrics have a boisterous wit that would resurface in \u201cLittle Shop\u201d and, tempered and tamed, even in those blockbuster movies. (Dennis Green is credited for additional lyrics.)Mr. Fontana plays the central character, the softhearted Eliot Rosewater, around whom swirls the decidedly unwieldy plot. He\u2019s the head of the family\u2019s charitable foundation, whose many causes are described in the Gilbert and Sullivanesque choral number at the top of the show: \u201cWe\u2019ve just handed Norman Mailer 50 thou to vent his spleen,\u201d sings one of the executives of the foundation.But Eliot feels unfulfilled: \u201cThe thought persists my efforts come to little or to naught,\u201d he laments. After suffering a breakdown of sorts at a performance of \u201cAida\u201d \u2014 he runs onstage at the climax, exhorting the characters to stop singing so they won\u2019t use up all that oxygen in the tomb \u2014 Eliot heads off on a road trip to find himself.He leaves behind a baffled wife, Sylvia (Brynn O\u2019Malley); a huffing senator father (Clark Johnson); and, most dangerously, a young lawyer, Norman Mushari (Skylar Astin), who discovers a clause in some legal papers that indicates that if Eliot is proved to be insane, his millions can be handed over to another branch of the family. Sniffing a hefty fee, Mushari sets about to scour the Rosewater family tree for alternatives.Eliot himself eventually heads home to the seat of the family, Rosewater, Ind., where he discovers poverty, depression and the ills that spring from it. In a lovely plaint for the forgotten men and women, Eliot sings:Rosewater is \u201ca town where the economy\u2019s depressing and the people are completely obsolete,\u201d where \u201cthe factories are automated, too.\u201d In its depiction of the beaten-down citizens of Rosewater, and Eliot\u2019s determination to help save them, the musical intersects oddly with the current political moment, as the cause of income inequality in America animates movements on both sides of the political divide.That\u2019s not to say that the penniless of Rosewater are depicted with a great degree of compassionate seriousness; Vonnegut\u2019s critique of man\u2019s follies and iniquities ranges up and down the social scale. In a goofily entertaining song for Sylvia, who has unwillingly joined her husband, she laments that the lovely spread she has set out for their guests is being ignored. All they want to eat is Cheese Nips, while stuffing the silver in their handbags. Ms. O\u2019Malley is a delight as Sylvia grows increasingly unhinged, crawling on the carpet to scrape up crumbs, and ultimately having her own psychic collapse. Sylvia is discovered to be suffering from \u201chysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself.\u201dVonnegut\u2019s black brand of satire is not, in truth, a comfortable fit for the stage. As things grow loopier and more leaden \u2014 there\u2019s a subplot about Eliot\u2019s obsession with volunteer firefighters (long back story) and another about his fascination with a science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout \u2014 you may begin to pine for the coherence, emotional nuance and less blunt-edged humor of, um, I don\u2019t know, maybe a Disney movie?The director, Michael Mayer, at least keeps the careering story line moving along at a brisk pace. And both performers and orchestra, under the music director and conductor, Chris Fenwick, deliver the eclectic score with the polish and zest we have come to expect from the Encores! series.As the scheming lawyer, Norman, who eventually digs up a couple of stray Rosewaters, Mr. Astin exudes smarm in his solo waltz of exultation: \u201cOh God, I adore me! You smart little Normie! I won\u2019t even charge me a fee!\u201d Kevin Del Aguila and Kate Wetherhead are amusing as the couple Norman puts forth as an alternative to Eliot, an average, middle-class pair depicted as crankily married but more than willing to swindle their way into millions. James Earl Jones brings his plush bass baritone to the narration, described in the text as a \u201cvoice not-unlike God,\u201d and makes an appearance in the finale as the elusive writer Trout.Mr. Fontana shoulders the heaviest chores with admirable grace. Whether Eliot is addressing his wife as Ophelia (he develops a bit of a Hamlet complex), delivering pizza to ingratiate himself with a volunteer fire brigade (I told you about that, right?) or singing that unexpectedly affecting song about the luckless underclasses, Mr. Fontana imbues Eliot with a forthright earnestness that scrubs away the archness and heaviness in the writing.The underlying moral of Vonnegut\u2019s convoluted tale may be familiar: In a world gone mad, only the mad are truly sane. (Yawn.) But in providing this supposed madman with a palpable humanity, Mr. Fontana somehow makes it seems fresh.Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s God Bless You, Mr. RosewaterBooks and lyrics by Howard Ashman; music by Alan Menken; directed by Michael Mayer; additional lyrics by Dennis Green; sets by Donyale Werle; costumes by Clint Ramos; lighting by Mark Barton; sound by Leon Rothenberg; choreography by Lorin Latarro; orchestrations by Danny Troob; music coordinator, Seymour Red Press; music director, Chris Fenwick; production stage manager, Adam John Hunter.

{"Headline": "Turkish President Returns to Istanbul in Sign Military Coup Is Faltering", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported by14 PhotosISTANBUL \u2014 A military coup attempt plunged Turkey into a long night of violence and intrigue on Friday, threatening its embattled president, leaving nearly 200 dead and injecting new instability into a crucial NATO member and American ally in the chaotic Middle East.\u201cA minority within the armed forces has unfortunately been unable to stomach Turkey\u2019s unity,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said after the private television channel NTV showed him greeting supporters. Blaming political enemies, Mr. Erdogan said: \u201cWhat is being perpetrated is a rebellion and a treason. They will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey.\u201dMr. Erdogan suggested that the plotters had tried to assassinate him, referring to a bombing in the Turkish Mediterranean resort town of Marmaris after he left on Friday. \u201cIt would appear that they thought I was there,\u201d he said.Supporters of Mr. Erdogan responded to his call to take to the streets in Istanbul, and by Saturday morning, the coup appeared to be unraveling.The state-run Anadolu Agency reported that about 200 unarmed soldiers had surrendered to the police in Ankara. CNN Turk showed video of soldiers abandoning tanks in Istanbul, and by morning, civilians were climbing onto the tanks and waving flags, according to images posted on social media. Anadolu said more than 1,500 members of the armed forces linked to the plot had been detained across Turkey, including a brigadier general in the country\u2019s northeast.Turkey\u2019s acting chief of general staff, Gen. Umit Dundar, said on Saturday that 194 people had been killed, and he called 104 of them \u201ccoup plotters.\u201d Of the 90 others killed, 47 were civilians, the general said at a news conference in Ankara, the capital.Seventeen police officers were killed in a military helicopter attack by coup plotters on a police special forces headquarters outside Ankara, Anadolu Agency had reported earlier. CNN Turk reported that 12 civilians had died in an explosion at the Parliament building.Martial law was declared after the coup attempt in the country, which has been convulsed by military takeovers at least three times in the past half-century.Before he made his televised remarks from the airport, Mr. Erdogan was forced to use his iPhone\u2019s FaceTime app from a secret location to broadcast messages beseeching the public to resist the coup attempt.\u201cThere is no power higher than the power of the people,\u201d he said amid contradictory accounts of who was in control. \u201cLet them do what they will at public squares and airports.\u201dAfter Mr. Erdogan spoke, many followers obeyed his orders to go into the streets, and mosque loudspeakers urged his supporters to protest the coup attempt.The events began unfolding around 10 p.m. Friday as the military moved to stop traffic over two of Istanbul\u2019s bridges, which cross the Bosporus and connect the European and Asian sides of the city.There were reports of gunfire in Taksim Square, in central Istanbul, where pro-Erdogan supporters had gathered, but there were no reports of injuries, and it appeared that security forces were acting with restraint. On the Bosporus Bridge, closed earlier in the evening by the military, there were reports of gunfire as protesters approached, and according to NTV, three people were hurt.Some military officials spoke out against a coup, including the commander of the First Army, Gen. Umit Guler, who issued a statement, carried by a pro-government news channel, saying, \u201cThe armed forces do not support this movement comprised of a small group within our ranks.\u201dLeaders of opposition political parties, who have otherwise worked against Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government, also spoke out against a seizure of the government by the military.\u201cThis country has suffered a lot from coups,\u201d Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main secular opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, known by its Turkish initials, C.H.P., said in a statement quoted by The Hurriyet Daily News. \u201cIt should be known that the C.H.P. fully depends on the free will of the people as indispensable of our parliamentary democracy.\u201dBy 2 a.m., a large group of protesters had gathered at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, and the military had begun withdrawing, according to CNN Turk.In the back streets of Istanbul\u2019s European districts, bars and restaurants were showing footage on television of scenes at the bridge, while partygoers were glued to their mobile phones trying to learn what was happening.\u201cSome people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in comments broadcast on NTV. \u201cThe government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so.\u201dAfter Mr. Yildirim spoke, factions of the Turkish military issued a statement, according to the news agency DHA, claiming they had taken control of the country.\u201cTurkish armed forces seized the rule of the country completely with the aim of reinstalling the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, to make rule of law pervade again, to re-establish the ruined public order,\u201d the statement quoted by DHA said. \u201cAll the international agreements and promises are valid. We hope our good relations with all global countries goes on.\u201dSenior Pentagon officials in Washington said they were still trying to determine what was happening in Turkey. They said the United States had not adjusted its military posture in the region.The Defense Department has roughly 2,200 uniformed military personnel and civilians in Turkey. About 1,500 of them are based at Incirlik, an air base in southern Turkey near Syria. The United States has used the base to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State. Since March, Incirlik has been on an \u201celevated force protection level\u201d amid concerns that militants were targeting it. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter in May ordered all family members of military personnel based at Incirlik to leave the country.Mr. Erdogan and his allies then purged the judiciary and the police of those linked to Mr. Gulen, going so far as to call him the leader of a terrorist organization and seeking, unsuccessfully, to have him extradited from the United States.Mr. Gulen denied any role in the attempted coup, saying he condemned it \u201cin the strongest terms.\u201d\u201cAs someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cI categorically deny such accusations.\u201dSince the founding of modern Turkey in 1923, the military has staged coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, and has intervened in 1997. The military had long seen itself as the guardian of the secular system, established by the country\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But in recent years, a series of sensational trials had pushed the military back to its barracks, which analysts said had secured civilian leadership over the military.Across Istanbul on Friday night, rumors swirled and evening plans were upended. In the Arnavutkoy neighborhood, people flooded out of bars and restaurants, hailing taxis and urging loved ones to get home to safety. \u201cThere\u2019s a coup,\u201d one man shouted in the street. \u201cThere\u2019s a coup, and blood will be shed.\u201dMr. Erdogan attracted a wide-ranging constituency in the early years of his tenure, including many liberals who supported his plans to overhaul the economy and remove the military from politics. But in recent years, he has alienated many Turks with his increasingly autocratic ways, cracking down on freedom of expression, imposing a significant role for religion in public life and renewing war with Kurdish militants in the southeast.\u201cThe people tried to stand up against President Erdogan, but they couldn\u2019t, they were crushed, so the military had no choice but to take over,\u201d said Cem Yildiz, a taxi driver.\u201cHe has destroyed this country, and no one will stand up to him but the military,\u201d Mr. Yildiz said. \u201cThere was no choice but this.\u201dSeyda Yilmaz, a teacher who was out in Istanbul on Friday when the news broke, said: \u201cThe country is in chaos, and Erdogan needs to be put in his place, but I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m very afraid because in the past a lot of innocent blood was shed in these coups. I\u2019m anxious. I don\u2019t know what to say at this point. We are all in shock.\u201dReporting was contributed by Safak Timur from Istanbul, Sabrina Tavernise and Michael S. Schmidt from Washington, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Sultan", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byTurkey is a long way from Cleveland, where the Republicans are holding their presidential convention. But I\u2019d urge you to study the recent failed military coup against Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. America is not Turkey \u2014 but in terms of personality and political strategy, Erdogan and Donald Trump were separated at birth.And the drama playing out in Turkey today is the story of just how off track a once successful country can get when a leader who demonizes all his rivals and dabbles in crazy conspiracy theories comes to believe that he alone is The Man \u2014 the only one who can make his country great again \u2014 and ensconces himself in power.Let\u2019s start with Erdogan, who was prime minister from 2003 to 2014, but then maneuvered himself into the previously symbolic role of president and got all key powers shifted to that position. I confess that when I first heard the news of the July 15 coup attempt, my first instinct was to consult that great foreign policy expert Miss Manners, The Washington Post\u2019s etiquette columnist, because I was asking myself, \u201cWhat is the right response when bad things happen to bad people?\u201d\u201cDear Miss Manners: I instinctively oppose military coups against democratically elected governments, like the one in Turkey. But am I a bad person if part of me felt that Turkey\u2019s president had it coming?\u201dAnyone who has been following Turkey closely knows that Erdogan has been mounting a silent, drip-by-drip coup of his own against Turkish democracy for years \u2014 jailing reporters, hounding rivals with giant tax bills, reviving an internal war against Turkish Kurds to stoke nationalist passions to propel his efforts to grab more powers \u2014 and by generally making himself into a modern-day sultan for life.I\u2019m glad the coup failed, especially the way it did \u2014 with many secular Turks who actually opposed Erdogan\u2019s autocratic rule, and had been abused by it, nevertheless coming out against the plotters on the principle that Turkish democracy must be upheld. That was a truly impressive act of collective wisdom and a display of democratic sensibilities.The maturity of the Turkish people resulted in Erdogan\u2019s getting what golfers call a mulligan, or a do-over, to demonstrate that he is committed to the universal precepts of democracy. Will he? Or will Erdogan go right back to his preferred means of staying in power: dividing Turks into his supporters and enemies of the state, weaving conspiracy theories and using the failed coup as a license for a witch hunt, not only for plotters but for anyone who has dared to cross his path?The early signs are bad. A day after the failed coup, Erdogan dismissed 2,745 judges and prosecutors. How did he know exactly who to fire in one day? Did he already have an enemies list? To date, he has now reportedly purged 1,500 university deans, revoked the licenses of 21,000 teachers and either purged or detained nearly 35,000 members of the military, security forces and judiciary as part of his \u201ccleansing\u201d of coup supporters.Here\u2019s the real tragedy: Erdogan was an outstanding leader his first five years and truly lifted the country\u2019s economy and middle class. But since then it\u2019s all gone to his head, and he has gotten away with increasingly bad behavior by creating an us-versus-them divide between his loyal, more religious followers, and the more secular communities in Turkey.Because his followers see their dignity wrapped up in his remaining in power, he can say and do anything and never pay a political price. His base will always rally to his us-versus-them dog whistles. But Turkey in the long run suffers.Sound familiar?Trump relies on the same tactics: He fabricates facts and figures on an industrial scale. He regularly puts out conspiracy theories \u2014 his latest is that President Obama\u2019s \u201cbody language\u201d suggests that \u201cthere\u2019s something going on\u201d with the president \u2014 hinting that Obama is not comfortable condemning the killing of cops by African-American gunmen and has sympathy for radical Islamists.Trump also relies on the us-versus-them bond with his followers to avoid punishment for any of his misbehavior. He, too, is obsessed with his own prowess, and he uses Twitter to get around traditional media gatekeepers \u2014 and fact-checkers \u2014 to inject anything he wants into the nation\u2019s media bloodstream. (Erdogan just uses his own friendly media.) And most of the people Trump has surrounded himself with are either family or second-raters looking for a star turn, including his vice-presidential choice and the person who wrote his wife\u2019s convention speech and clearly plagiarized part of it from Michelle Obama. The whole thing reeks of flimflam.If Trump is elected, I don\u2019t think there will be a military coup, but I guarantee you that Jeb Bush\u2019s prediction will be proved true, that he\u2019ll be \u201ca chaos president\u201d just as he\u2019s been a \u201cchaos candidate.\u201d Americans will regularly be in the streets, because they are not going to follow \u2014 on any big issue \u2014 a man who lies as he breathes, who has not done an ounce of homework to prepare for the job and who generates support by conspiracy theories and making people afraid of the future and one another.If you like what\u2019s going on in Turkey today, you\u2019ll love Trump\u2019s America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "England\u2019s Reflexive Pronoun Epidemic", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byThere is a reflexive pronoun epidemic in England that, while it may not be high on the list of the world\u2019s problems, is suggestive of some serious social weirdness. It\u2019s a straining for exaggerated politeness or elevated speech that reflects a society still riven by class.\u201cDoes that work for yourself?\u201d \u201cCould we perhaps have a quote from yourself?\u201d \u201cIs the water temperature right for yourself?\u201d \u201cWe will have that fixed for yourself as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cI have booked the flight for yourself.\u201dYes, that is all fine for myself!!! (I would not dream of ending that last sentence with a period as it may appear unenthusiastic when I want to exude delight at being addressed with such deference.) In fact, thanks to yourself, it\u2019s been a great day for myself!!!What on earth is wrong with little old \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cme?\u201d They are words too short and too plain for the hospitality and service industries that now make up a big chunk of the British economy. People used to manufacture machines. Now they manufacture obsequious multisyllabic reflexive pronouns with a letter quotient designed to aggrandize yourselves, and so render yourself pliant to opening your wallet.It\u2019s all part of the \u201cbespoke\u201d experience!! Don\u2019t get me started on that.Of course, I have to curb the overwhelming urge to tell people that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cme\u201d are just fine for ME (as they should be for YOU), as that would reveal my own snobbery in reaction to their inverted, or misplaced, or attempted snobbery; so sharpening corrosive social divisions.That would not be good for a country, or what is left of it, that recently saw two old Etonians, David Cameron and Boris Johnson, duel over Britain\u2019s European future and produce a disaster for myself, yourself, herself, himself and just about any self.There is no doubt, at least for myself, that this reflexive pronoun business has now outstripped apostrophe abuse as the supreme grammatical annoyance. Its such an irritant in it\u2019s way \u2014 perhaps also to yourselve\u2019s?!?!There is also the uncontrolled use of the word \u201cpop\u201d to consider \u2014 \u201cpop a signature on there,\u201d \u201cpop your seat upright,\u201d \u201cpop me an e-mail\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s a short word that falls within the ambit of that maddeningly meaningless phrase: It is what it is.Now if any British corporation \u201creached out\u201d to its employees on the issue of the misuse of reflexive pronouns, it would probably have to \u201ctake the issue offline\u201d because of its sensitivity, \u201cunpack\u201d all the nuances, make discussion of it \u201ca regular thing going forward,\u201d \u201cdrill down\u201d as far as possible, \u201cget its ducks in a row\u201d before deciding to \u201caction\u201d any change, and generally have a \u201cthought shower\u201d (\u201cbrainstorm\u201d is now, it seems, considered offensive to epileptics) about how its clients \u201cthemselves\u201d might react.Not bothering with all this is clearly a no-brainer!!!I know that there is no escaping the little irritants in life, like asking for ice in your Coke in France and getting a single ice cube; or the beeps and pings that now issue from every electronic contraption; or seeing a bottle of good wine emptied by some overzealous sommelier into four glasses filled almost to the brim; or losing out to the fine print; or being defeated in the quest to speak to a human being by some devilish labyrinth of automated responses; or having to listen to an explanation of why anyone would want a driverless car; or password hell; or just finding yourself in an airport alongside all the other suckers who know for a fact that whatever happened to Osama bin Laden was grossly insufficient punishment.So it goes. You just have to breathe deeply and be grateful for the gift of breath. YOLO! Don\u2019t get me started on that, either.The English reflexive pronoun thing has not crossed the Atlantic, yet, but \u201cno worries\u201d has (having previously made the longer crossing from Australia). I\u2019m just not in a space right now where I can deal with that. (\u201cOh, really, where are you then?\u201d)It may just be time to \u201coffboard\u201d as I\u2019m not sure I have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to be \u201clooped\u201d into a discussion of how anyone can say \u201cno worries\u201d at this particular moment in history, whatever side of the Atlantic himself or herself happens to be situated on. I mean that\u2019s just beyond. What would be even the thematic tent poles of the debate? I can\u2019t even!!Let\u2019s face it: \u201cDoes that work for yourself?\u201d is never going to work in New York City, which would rather tell you to \u201cdrop dead\u201d than adopt that affectation. So there are limits to the global homogenization of bad English after all. Neither deference nor pomposity is a New York thing. America is not classless; it\u2019s just not class obsessed.That in plain English will about do it for myself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the E.U. Had It Coming", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byOpinionI was not surprised and even less was I outraged. Had I had the right to vote, which I have lost after 30 years living in Italy, I would have voted to remain in the European Union. But I do not think it a scandal that others think differently. If it was a scandal that people voted to leave, then surely it was a scandal to have held a referendum at all. And if it is a scandal to hold a referendum on an issue central to the destiny of a nation and about which its people feel deeply, then I have misunderstood the meaning of freedom and democracy in the West.So why the extraordinary incredulity and indignation? Why the sense of betrayal? Why do so many people find this result unacceptable? It seems that over the last 30 or 40 years the idea has taken hold that there can be no peaceful or productive future for Europe without the European Union. As a result, anyone who voted to be outside it must be discredited as pernicious or ignorant, perpetrator or victim of some sinister populism. In the United States, this unhelpful reaction has taken the form of likening the leaders of the Leave campaign to Donald J. Trump. But Britain is not America and this was not a presidential election. Immigration played a role, but no one in the Leave campaign was suggesting Muslims be banned from Britain. On the contrary, some Muslims supported the Brexit vote. To see the debates of other countries in terms of one\u2019s own internal politics is always a failure of imagination.All this shock, horror and kneejerk denigration might be understandable if the European Union were notching up important successes and resolving its member states\u2019 many problems, or if, at the very least, it had a figurehead with whom European citizens could identify, someone of whom one might say, \u201cHowever badly things are going, I have faith in so and so, I believe he or she really does have the interests of my nation at heart, really is concerned about unemployment in my town,\u201d be it Newcastle or Naples.Can we honestly say this of Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union? Or of Angela Merkel? However much the Union is theoretically a community of nations, we know very well that the most powerful person in it is the German chancellor. And only the Germans vote for the German chancellor. Her first duty is to them. None of us voted for the austere Mr. Juncker, who is nominated by the European Council and approved by the European Parliament. At present our so-called Parliament elections follow a logic that is entirely local and national, with laughably low turnouts and very little sense of what that body actually does. In 2014 just 18 percent of Czechs, 13 percent of Slovaks and 24 percent of Poles bothered to vote.This is a major failing. After 17 years of the euro, to have the economies of France, Spain, Italy and Greece (which adopted the currency in 2001) in long-term stagnation is a devastating failure. Youth unemployment in Spain is running around 45 percent, in Italy around 37 percent. About Greece the less said the better.But the Union\u2019s greatest failing is that after decades of regulations of every possible kind it has not brought the nations of the Continent closer together. Day by day Italians are told whether their government\u2019s economic policy has been accepted or rejected by Berlin, but about the Germans they know little or nothing. In each country, we follow our own national news media and are locked into the agendas of our own political systems. We are separate nations but not sovereign nations. We obey the dictates of Brussels and read Jonathan Franzen and \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d We watch American films and follow the American elections far more closely than those of any other country in the European Union. Is this a community?The middle classes, the cultured elite, love the idea that they are taking part in a historic project that will bring peace and prosperity to the Continent, put an end to war, take steps to defend the environment, protect Europeans from superpower ambitions and multinational depredations, etc., etc. I love this idea, too. Like so many others, I take comfort in this noble enterprise.But when the project does not bring prosperity, when it does not do enough to protect the environment, when its protectionist trading policies systematically damage the economies of the third world, I, like everyone else, don\u2019t want to think about it; we prefer to close our eyes. This is not the narrative we like to believe we live in.As late as the 1990s, under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Jacques Delors, there was a genuine project for eventual political unity in Europe. Idealism was in the air. The introduction of the euro was to be a key moment in the process of sharing sovereignty. But the difficulties of running separate and very different economies with the same currency while the world economy is in crisis have actually increased tension between member nations, such that there is now very little prospect of the kind of unity that might have made the single currency more viable, nor any idea of how to retreat from it. Quite simply Europe is unable to complete the transition it set itself; rather than fording the stream, it is sinking in the mud. In the meantime, the enchantment of the \u201cgood community\u201d functions as an obstacle to reform. Why should Brussels reform itself if no country would ever be mad enough to leave?With Brexit this decades-old spell is set to break. And how does the liberal elite on both sides of the Atlantic react to this deafening alarm? They scream foul and blame the dumb British working classes for spoiling the party. It might be wiser to examine our own attachment to a narrative that is going nowhere.Tim Parks, an associate professor of literature and translation at IULM University in Milan, is the author, most recently, of \u201cWhere I\u2019m Reading From: The Changing World of Books.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Quest by Elites Is Driving \u2018Brexit\u2019 and Trump", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewWhat lesson should a card-carrying member of the economic elite take from the success of Donald J. Trump, and British voters\u2019 decision to leave the European Union?Voters in large numbers have been rejecting much of the underlying logic behind a dynamic globalized economy that on paper seems to make the world much richer. For the bankers, trade negotiators, international businesspeople and others who make up the economic elite (including journalists like me who are peripheral members of it), this is cause for introspection, at least among those who aren\u2019t too narcissistic to care what their countrymen think.Here is an overarching theory of what we might have missed in the march toward a hyper-efficient global economy: Economic efficiency isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.Efficiency sounds great in theory. What kind of monster doesn\u2019t want to optimize possibilities, minimize waste and make the most of finite resources? But the economic and policy elite may like efficiency a lot more than normal humans do.Maybe the people who run the world, in other words, have spent decades pursuing goals that don\u2019t scratch the itches of large swaths of humanity. Perhaps the pursuit of ever higher gross domestic product misses a fundamental understanding of what makes most people tick. Against that backdrop, support for Mr. Trump and for the British withdrawal known as Brexit are just imperfect vehicles through which someone can yell, \u201cStop.\u201dBut what if those gaps between the economic elite and the general public are created not by differences in expertise but in priorities?Among the general American public, about half of those who played the game favored equality over efficiency.But the researchers also did the experiment at Yale Law School, an elite bastion filled with people who become Supreme Court clerks, White House aides and richly compensated lawyers. Among the Yale students who played the game, 80 percent preferred efficiency to equality. They were more worried about the size of the pie, apparently, than making sure everyone got a slice.\u201cThe people who are destined to fill these elite positions tend to have a strong efficiency orientation,\u201d said Raymond Fisman, a Boston University economist and lead author of the study. \u201cOne underlying explanation may be that, if the system has been kind to you, and you find yourself at Yale Law School, you know you\u2019re going to make out O.K. in the end, and so you don\u2019t worry about widening the distribution of outcomes.\u201dIt\u2019s easy for an economist to chalk up support for rent control as idiocy that depresses the home construction that might reduce housing prices for everyone. I have thought of it that way.But maybe it is really important for people who live in a place to be able to stay there indefinitely. Maybe the idea that things should stay the way they are, without new people moving in and new buildings going up, is not as inherently irrational as Economics 101 would suggest. Yes, rent control is a bad idea if you\u2019re worried about the long-term prospects for economic efficiency. But maybe the people who advocate these policies know exactly what they\u2019re rooting for, and that\u2019s not it.The rent control debate can be viewed as a microcosm of the debate about globalization and international trade.It projects that the deal will add $131 billion a year to Americans\u2019 incomes by 2030, or 0.5 percent of G.D.P. It will neither create nor destroy jobs, but is projected to add to churn \u2014 job changes \u2014 in the economy as work moves into higher-paying, more export-centric industries. The authors predict that the trade deal will mean an extra 53,700 job changes a year, but they note that 55.5 million people a year in the United States change jobs for all sorts of reasons, and that this extra churn will barely change those overall numbers.To economists, 53,700 jobs churned each year is a small cost to be paid for a richer overall economy. To people who are among those 53,700, the pain may be enough to drive someone\u2019s niece to vote for an antitrade candidate 30 years later.So what\u2019s a policy elite to do? Of course the only way a society can become richer over time is to increase national income. And if rigorous analysis shows that Policy X is the way to do it, the fact that Policy X is going to disadvantage a few thousand people often isn\u2019t a reason to abandon the idea.But there\u2019s an obligation to think about individual lives. Life isn\u2019t just about money, and jobs aren\u2019t just about income. A sense of stability, of purpose, of social standing \u2014 all these things matter in ways that economic models don\u2019t do a very good job of taking into account.If there is one crucial lesson from the success of Mr. Trump and Brexit, it is that dynamism and efficiency sound a lot better to people who are confident they\u2019ll always end up being winners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leader\u2019s Poems Grip Brazilians, but Not in a \u2018Fiery Flames\u2019 Way", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byMemo From BrazilBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 Before becoming Brazil\u2019s interim president, Michel Temer had a bit more free time on his hands. As a lawmaker shuttling between Bras\u00edlia and S\u00e3o Paulo a few years ago, he found himself jotting his musings on cocktail napkins in airport lounges.He brooded about the demise of letter-writing in the text-messaging era. He described a rookie lawyer\u2019s pride in winning a case. Then there was his septuagenarian\u2019s lustful ardor \u2014 after all, he had courted a new bride 42 years his junior.In \u201cRed,\u201d he wrote:With Mr. Temer now in the spotlight, his poetry is drawing renewed attention as Brazilians try to decipher the man at the helm after a bare-knuckle power struggle that ousted President Dilma Rousseff in May. Parodies of his oeuvre are flourishing, a sign that Brazilian satire is keeping pace with the country\u2019s political upheaval.\u201cThis small diversion makes things kind of bearable,\u201d said Mr. Ramos, who also publishes an independent poetry magazine.Catering to more than 32,000 followers, Mr. Ramos updates the feed, called Poet Temer, with his own poems as often as three times a day. He riffs on everything from Mr. Temer\u2019s stilted, formal writing style to the graft scandals plaguing the interim president\u2019s two-month-old administration.Some scholars want to know why Mr. Temer decided to make a late-in-life foray into poetry.There is a precedent of Brazilian political leaders who aspired to polish their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with some literary production. For instance, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a literary society in Rio de Janeiro inspired by the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, counts numerous Brazilian political figures among its long list of so-called immortal inductees.Supporters of Mr. Temer, who has also written books on constitutional law, nevertheless sing the praises of his poetry.At the launch of his poetry collection, Mr. Temer revealed that he was inspired largely by Brazilian Romantic writers of the 19th century. He cited \u00c1lvares de Azevedo, a poet whose popularity has recently grown among Brazil\u2019s goth subculture.In \u201cAnonymous Intimacy,\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s choice to occasionally err on the side of concision led Sensacionalista, a website that satirizes Brazil\u2019s political class, to question whether the author of some of the verses might actually be his 7-year-old son, Michelzinho.No. Never again!In a statement, Mr. Temer\u2019s office said he was open to such reviews. \u201cIn a democratic country, such criticism is received naturally,\u201d it said.But on previous occasions, Mr. Temer showed himself to be sensitive to such scrutiny.After the anthropologist and political commentator Roberto DaMatta questioned Mr. Temer\u2019s forays into verse in a newspaper column, Mr. Temer responded by sending Mr. DaMatta a copy of his book and a letter taking issue with the criticism.\u201cI doubt that you\u2019re one of those people who discourage the tenderfoots from daring to experience sentimental writing,\u201d Mr. Temer wrote.The exchange moved Mr. DaMatta to consider whether Brazil needed more politicians like Mr. Temer writing verse, with the hope that such writing might enlighten a political establishment soaked in scandal.\u201cI beg now that his poetry can illuminate, with the agony and uncertainty of every poem, this Brazil of ours, where the political stage produces such vulgar dramas without any embarrassment,\u201d Mr. DaMatta wrote in a subsequent column.Of course, Mr. Temer faces an array of other challenges that have little to do with how his poetry is pilloried. His government has already faced one scandal after another, prompting the resignations of top aides including his planning minister, his anticorruption minister and his tourism minister.Mr. Temer\u2019s own credibility also remains in question.More political instability may also be on the horizon. Ms. Rousseff, the suspended president, is preparing for her impeachment trial in the Senate over claims of budgetary manipulation. If Ms. Rousseff succeeds in changing the votes of fewer than 10 senators, she could reclaim the presidency.All the drama is pushing Mr. Temer \u2014 and his poetry \u2014 further out of the shadows.\u201cIt\u2019s all just too ridiculous: the poetry, the way he became president, the much younger wife,\u201d said Gabriel Gianordoli, 34, an information design consultant.\u201cIf Temer can proclaim he\u2019s a poet,\u201d Mr. Gianordoli said, \u201cthen he can deal with the reactions his work has spawned.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Finding a New London for the Financial World to Call Home", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseThe race is on to be the new London.Unless Britain finds a way to undo its decision to leave the European Union, London\u2019s days as the pre-eminent global financial capital, ranked even ahead of New York, may be numbered.I spoke this week to several high-ranking executives at major financial institutions that collectively employ tens of thousands in London. While none of them have any immediate plans to move their European headquarters from Britain\u2019s capital, all agreed they would eventually shift a significant number of highly paid employees to cities that remain in the European Union.One executive in charge of relocation (who like the others, spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue) said the percentage of employees in his firm who might be required to move ranged from 10 percent to 40 percent. \u201cMultiply that throughout the industry and it\u2019s tens of thousands of people and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd bear in mind that most of these people are millionaires.\u201dOthers said it would take five to 10 years, but a new London would almost certainly emerge in one of the other prominent cities of the European Union. \u201cWhen I moved to London years ago, it wasn\u2019t exactly cosmopolitan,\u201d said another executive. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a place for great restaurants. The infrastructure has improved dramatically. It will take time, but eventually one big hub will develop.\u201dWho might win this high-stakes financial sweepstakes?Here are the criteria most frequently mentioned: English-language facility, which is essential for attracting a global work force; a favorable regulatory environment, especially regarding employment; excellent transportation and communications infrastructure; availability of prime office space and luxury housing; good schools; good restaurants and cultural offerings; and finally, an intangible quality that includes a certain energy level and openness to an influx of highly paid, competitive City of London-Wall Street types.I scored numerous cities in the European Union on a 60-point scale: five points for office space and housing, five points for restaurants and cultural offerings \u2014 because it\u2019s easier for any city to build new offices and housing, and import talented chefs and entertainers \u2014 and 10 points for each of the others.To evaluate schools, I consulted Harriet Plyler, editor of \u201cThe Good Schools Guide International,\u201d and the Pearson Learning Curve Index. For restaurants, culture and quality of life, I used Mercer Consulting\u2019s Quality of Living Survey and a ranking of cities based on the number of Michelin-starred restaurants; for cost and availability of offices and luxury housing I used the Global Property Guide.Here, in ascending order, are the top nine, including the winner:Barcelona, Spain (23 points) Several executives spoke wistfully of moving to sunny Barcelona, with its excellent restaurants, cafe scene, night life and proximity to Mediterranean beaches. But other than a relatively good airport, Barcelona fails nearly every other test, starting with English-language facility: Just 22 percent of Spaniards have a conversational knowledge of English. \u201cBarcelona is great for a holiday,\u201d Mr. Yeandle said, \u201cbut not as a place to do business.\u201dMilan (24 points) Much the same could be said of Milan. Italians are a little more fluent in English \u2014 34 percent \u2014 and Milan has excellent restaurants and arguably the best shopping in the world. It\u2019s already Italy\u2019s financial center. But it lags in every other category, including business climate, where Italy is ranked 45th by the World Bank. Its two main airports are badly in need of refurbishing.Warsaw (24 points)Poland\u2019s appeal is primarily its flexible labor laws, favorable business climate, a hard-working, well-educated populace and a low cost of living. Warsaw would welcome an influx of financial professionals with open arms, in contrast to many more affluent European cities. But it ranks very low on Mercer\u2019s quality of life index, and luxury housing is limited. Still, one major banker told me his firm would move a contingent there from London and expand its technology operations, though its top investment banking professionals would balk at the idea of relocating there.Residents of Luxembourg are the most affluent and multilingual in Europe (56 percent speak English, and 84 percent speak at least two foreign languages). Known in part as a tax haven, it is already a sophisticated financial services center, and is home to the European Investment Bank and the European Court of Justice.Mercer ranks it relatively high on quality of life (19th in the world) and it has a surprising number of Michelin-starred restaurants, a reflection of its proximity to France.But the World Bank rates its business climate last among these finalists. Its international airport ranks a dismal 99th. And the entire country had a population of just 576,000 at the beginning of this year. London has more than 360,000 employees in its financial services sector alone. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Luxembourg could absorb even a small percentage of them.Paris (43 points)Already a major financial services center and easily the most culturally appealing city in the European Union, Paris seems an obvious choice. Its regional population of 12 million is the only one that rivals London.But Paris\u2019s score is dragged down by almost every other category. Only 39 percent of the French are fluent in English, and despite big improvements in recent years, they maintain a reputation of being inhospitable to people who don\u2019t speak French well.Its airports have low rankings and its rigid school system is inhospitable to foreigners (although it has excellent English-language private schools). France has strict limits on the ability to fire people, and it ranks just 27th on the World Bank\u2019s list. Paris is among the most expensive cities in Europe after London, and is a distant 37th on Mercer\u2019s quality of life index.Every financial services executive I interviewed mentioned an intangible factor: French hostility to the wealthy. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande tried to impose a 75 percent \u201cwealth tax,\u201d which prompted an exodus of rich French citizens before Mr. Hollande dropped the proposal.\u201cAll the noise coming out of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace the last few years has been that France wants to tax or regulate financial service companies out of business,\u201d Mr. Yeandle said. \u201cFinancial services people are furious.\u201dDublin (50 points)Several banking executives told me they would definitely be moving some operations to Dublin.Dublin\u2019s main drawback is its relatively small size (1.8 million people in the metropolitan area) and lack of infrastructure. Dublin is more distant from the European Union\u2019s other countries and it lacks London\u2019s direct rail link to the Continent. Its relatively small airport ranked 80th.Vienna (51 points)Vienna emerged as a surprisingly viable contender. Seventy three percent of Austria\u2019s population is fluent in English; its rank in ease of doing business is just behind Ireland\u2019s; Vienna has an excellent airport with high on-time performance, and it is Mercer\u2019s top-ranked city in the world for quality of life. Its restaurants and wines have attracted international acclaim. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic place to live,\u201d Mr. Yeandle said.Like Paris, Vienna has the air of a world capital, which it was until Austria lost its empire after the First World War. And that, bankers told me, is part of the problem: Vienna feels like it has been asleep for much of the last century. It\u2019s not a major financial capital now, and no one I spoke to has any immediate plans to start or expand operations there. Still, they told me they might have to reconsider.Frankfurt (54 points)In many ways Frankfurt is the obvious choice, because it is already home to the European Central Bank. It\u2019s the financial capital of Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy and dominant political force. It ranks high on the ease of doing business index, although German labor laws can be as rigid as the French\u2019s. After Heathrow outside London, it has the second-ranked European airport, next to a modern rail terminal connecting it to every major city in Europe. Its population of 2.5 million could absorb a large influx of financial professionals.But some of those same factors work against it. Even as most people I spoke with said Frankfurt would most likely emerge as the next London, they didn\u2019t seem very enthusiastic about it. Some already think there\u2019s too much power in Germany \u2014 and that London has acted as a financial counterbalance.And some said Frankfurt was simply too boring. It ranks low on the Michelin-star rankings (and far behind other German cities like Berlin and Munich) and isn\u2019t known for its night life or culture.Language and schooling are potential drawbacks as well.And the winner is:Amsterdam (55 points)Not only do 90 percent of the Dutch speak English, many speak it better than the English themselves. Its schools are ranked the best in Europe, and there are plenty of English-language options. The city has beautiful architecture and housing options, picturesque canals, excellent restaurants, music and theater, lively night life, and a cosmopolitan and tolerant attitude cultivated over centuries as a major global trading center.It has one of Europe\u2019s best airports, ranked just behind Frankfurt and Vienna, and an excellent rail network connecting major European capitals, including London. It\u2019s a short train ride to Brussels, the capital of the European Union.Amsterdam is already a center of international commerce and the financial and political capital of the Netherlands. It did lose a few points for its business and regulatory climate: The World Bank ranks the Netherlands 28th, just behind Switzerland and France.The problem? Badly hurt by the financial crisis, the Dutch have capped bankers\u2019 bonuses at just 20 percent of their annual salaries \u2014 a far more drastic curb than was imposed by the European Union. Several bankers told me that unless the Dutch repealed the cap, they wouldn\u2019t consider moving to Amsterdam. \u201cI\u2019d love to relocate to Amsterdam,\u201d one top executive told me. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re wanted there.\u201dOut of curiosity, I examined the same criteria and scored London itself. The result?London earns a near-perfect 58 points. The only black mark was its quality of life, primarily because of its high cost. Mercer ranks London just 39th (New York ranks 44th).\u201cLondon has so many advantages,\u201d Mr. Yeandle said. \u201cI think that will remain true even if it\u2019s outside the E.U. But if the vote costs London its pre-eminence, that will be a self-inflicted tragedy.\u201dAn earlier version of this column rendered incorrectly the name of an organization charged with luring business to Ireland. It is the Industrial Development Agency Ireland, not the Irish Development Agency.The Common Sense column on Friday, about which European city might take London\u2019s place as a global financial center, referred imprecisely to Amsterdam\u2019s official status in the Netherlands. While Amsterdam is designated the political capital in the Dutch constitution, The Hague, not Amsterdam, is considered the seat of government.Advertisement"}

On the other hand, living in the coastal zone is extremely important for us. So we need to find a way to live in the coastal zone, but we cannot assume that sea level is stable.\u201d\u201cNobody has solved the issue,\u201d Ms. Frewen said.The method supplies a concrete mixture through a robotic gantry guided by a computer. Instead of a hand laying a line of bricks, the machine\u2019s nozzle pours a shaped tube of concrete, following the entire outline of the house in one lap. The next go-round adds another layer, building until it is time for the roof to be added by a crane, then perhaps another story on top. For apartment buildings, Mr. Khoshnevis has plans for a machine that will climb the building as it builds it.He aims to build a full house in one day without a human hand, a goal he says will happen within the next year or two. Though Mr. Khoshnevis started the 3-D printing construction movement in 1996, the Chinese company Winsun has already printed homes and apartments using a similar method, though creating the pieces off-site and assembling them at the location of the structure. Mr. Khoshnevis says American building codes have created a longer timeline for 3-D-printed houses to ensure their safety.For cities in the far future, Mr. Khoshnevis and NASA are working together to build structures using Contour Crafting on the moon from materials available there. If your great-great-great-grandchildren end up living on Mars, it might be one of these machines that builds their houses.Mr. Khoshnevis has some high-powered fellow believers. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, recently listed 3-D-printed construction on a list of the \u201cnext really interesting moon shots,\u201d referring to ideas that will radically shape the future. \u201cWe can build them with 100 percent recyclable materials,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cSo it\u2019s another good reason from an environmental perspective.\u201dThese innovations will create much more originality in housing, Mr. Mamou-Mani said, because the selection of files will be so vast and the design can be changed between buildings with little effort, so the economies of mass production will no longer benefit repetition of design.\u201cIt will empower people to participate in the designs they want instead of being relatively passive in the way they inhabit, choose a home or buy a product,\u201d he said.The kinds of files people will have access to will open up areas usually not thought of as part of home building. For example, while some people have talked about how drones could pick up and move houses in the future, Mr. Mamou-Mani said, \u201cThe house will be the drone. Why separate the thing that carries you from the house? Just make it the house.\u201cOur generation is increasingly nomad, raised with low-cost airlines and often working from home with laptops, therefore flying our homes will seem normal in the future, and as for any migrating bird, borders between countries will seem like an absurd relic of the past.\u201dKasita, a company in Austin, Tex., is moving toward a model that would allow people to move a home between cities without wheels or propellers.Imagine owning a micro-movable apartment that you parked in a building in Austin, where it slides in like a drawer. When you needed to move to Los Angeles, a crane would come, put your house on a truck that would drive it to your new location, where a forklift could slide it into an opening in your new building.This is the idea behind a design created by Jeff Wilson, chief executive of Kasita, who became known as Professor Dumpster after living in a 33-square-foot Dumpster for a year as a way to test the limits of minimalism. Thinking of a way to help musicians, artists, young people and service workers being priced out of booming Austin, he came up with a 320-square-foot smart home that can stand alone or be inserted into a rack up to 10 stories tall. In the rack units, the houses will plug in to water, power and sewer lines. The company is hoping to produce its first 40 units this year.\u201cShort term, we\u2019re thinking about our mission of providing an affordable urban solution. Long term, we\u2019re just going to have to become more nimble in how we continue to live in our cities,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cIf the sea levels rise, it\u2019s certainly going to be a lot easier to move a Kasita than it will be to move a Hilton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There is hope of that happening this year.The Republicans, on the verge of nominating a man with the temperament of a sociopath, someone who praises a murderous dictator while damning the American troops who fought him, should crack up and break apart.For years, this party stood for something \u2014 lower taxes, a lighter government hand, personal responsibility, global engagement. After Cleveland, they will stand for nothing but the bombastic tyrant who lets the smallest thing get under his very thin, very orange skin. From Trump, you hear more praise of Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin than for Lincoln or Reagan. The Republican base created this monster; by the power of hubris, he should destroy their party.Where are the exhaustive inquiries into why so many Americans are falling behind? Where are the subpoenas of the people who rigged the financial system to a point where it crashed the global economy? What is the legislative response to ideas favored by huge majorities of the people \u2014 simple gun measures to keep terrorists from getting assault rifles, or a boost of the minimum wage? And how are the people\u2019s representatives dealing with an epidemic of murder of our fellow citizens by police officers?Well, you know the answers. Attacking the opponent\u2019s party is the only game in town. The leaders of this Congress do not legislate. They stage show hearings to keep them in office.The Democrats, though more representative of issues that people care about, need to call out the fringe of their party on campus, in town halls and elsewhere who are enemies of free speech. When Bernie Sanders had his microphone forcefully taken away from him by a Black Lives Matter protester, it was, in fact, a shameful thing \u2014 no matter how important the cause. Instead, too many Dems let it pass.So wish for a crackup in Cleveland, where Trump and maybe Newt Gingrich \u2014 with six wives between them \u2014 will represent the party of family values. And hope for a course correction in Philly, where Democrats might listen to working-class voters who feel betrayed by the corporate elites in power suites. Wish and hope \u2014 weak words, admittedly.

{"Headline": "The Apotheosis of Donald J. Trump", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byBut Trump, according to Tulis, is \u201cunique in that no other previous major party presidential candidate has felt so unconstrained by these constitutional norms.\u201dConstraints that would have prevented the nomination of a candidate like Trump have been removed \u2014 by party and ideological polarization; by the weakening of the political parties as organizations; and by the fact that primary voters, rather than party bosses or even more ideologically oriented party activists, now have the power to choose the Republican nominee. In the past, party organizations were strong enough to filter out contenders as aberrant as Trump. Evidently, no longer.\u201dPerhaps most important is the acquiescence of the Republican Party and of a large segment of the voting public to Trump\u2019s flagrant disregard for democratic procedure in politics and governing.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.is not his determination to close the doors to immigration (that has all too many precedents in the American past), or his criticism of open world-trade agreements (that, too, is closer to the historical norm of U.S. policy than is commonly imagined), or the barely disguised racism (which was his entry, via the Birther movement, into national politics).What is most distinctive is the strongman, authoritarian style of politics that he radiates so strongly both in the bigger-than-life-or-politics persona he projects and the trust-me, I\u2019ll fix everything and make us great again, program he promises.Economic issues are arguably foremost. For the majority of men and women dependent on wages to stay afloat, the past 16 years have been marked by setbacks and uncertainty of historic proportion.After 2000, the economy would experience two recessions, a technology-bubble collapse followed by a housing boom, then the largest financial crisis in 75 years and a prolonged period of weak growth.The solutions Trump has offered to such problems are far removed from realistic government policy. Instead, Trump puts forward name-calling, taunts, mockery, threats, insults, hostility to Mexicans and Muslims, and barely constrained contempt for women.the burnout of modern conservatism. Trump, or Trumpism, is the residue of that burnout \u2014 thick with the nativism, racism, and authoritarianism that were always there.One of the \u201cmost egregious misreadings of Trump is that he is part of the populist tradition of Andrew Jackson,\u201d Wilentz pointed out, noting that Jackson battled the Second Bank of the United States \u201cto remove the hands of unelected private bankers from the levers of the federal treasury\u201d; that he \u201ctook on the most powerful reactionary slaveholders of his day\"; and that he helped build \u201cthe first mass democratic political party in the history of the world.\u201dIn this light, according to Wilentz,to link Jackson to a narcissistic reality show mogul who cashed in on fast and loose dealings in real estate and gambling casinos, who has opposed no reactionaries of any kind, and whose idea of an intellectual appears to be Don King and Mike Ditka \u2014 well, all of that is worse than travesty.Trump, Wilentz concludes, is just \u201cthe sort of gouger and business sharper that the Populists organized to stop.\u201dHeather Cox Richardson, a professor of history at Boston College, argues that Trump \u201crepresents the final collapse of the Movement Conservatism that took over the Republican Party in the 1980s.\u201dThe conservative movement, Richardson writes, had a built-in conflict that it failed to resolve. In order to win white working class support for deregulation and smaller government, Republican leaders had to make the casethat an activist government redistributed wealth from hardworking white men to lazy African-Americans, women and organized workers.The Trump phenomenon, Richardson suggests, isa snapshot of the moment voters realize that they have been duped. He plays virulently on the racism and sexism of Movement Conservatism, using the language and the resentments rank-and-file Republican voters have internalized for a generation. But he also echoes their anger that they have been destroyed economically by the policies of the past 35 years.The platform renounces the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage; supports \u201ctherapy\u201d for gay minors; rejects \u201credefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories\u201d; and declares that \u201cour laws and our government\u2019s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\u201dThe conservative thrust of the platform goes far beyond social issues, calling for a wall to \u201ccover the entirety of the southern border\u201d that is \u201csufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic\u201d; an increase in coal production \u2014 labeling coal \u201can abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource\u201d; an expansion of energy exploration on public lands; opposition to \u201cill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle\u201d; enactment of \u201cfirearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding Americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all 50 states\u201d; and a \u201chuman life amendment to the Constitution\u201d to ban abortion, without exemption for rape, incest or saving the life of the mother.Trump is a sick sociopath. He has no conscience. No feelings of guilt, remorse, empathy or embarrassment.Advertisement"}

But she is more direct and disciplined.Representative Peter King, a New York Republican who knows both Clintons, says he sees another difference: \u201cHillary listens.\u201d In contrast with Mr. Obama, she is much more interested in the mechanics of governance and politics. She lacks his ability to inspire and embrace bolder agendas.The questions over the 15 weeks until Election Day will focus on her philosophy, experience, judgment and, if Donald J.

She will stress proposals such as public-private partnerships. More important, she\u2019ll be willing to cut deals. As a senator, she forged relations with Republican colleagues like the maverick John McCain and the conservative Trent Lott.\u201cShe has a real appreciation of how to work across the aisle,\u201d says Tom Daschle, the former Senate Democratic leader.On foreign policy she is more hawkish than Mr. Obama.

{"Headline": "More on the Short-Run Macroeconomics of Brexit", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "I\u2019ve received several thoughtful responses from economists I respect, all making a particular argument about the effects of Brexit-induced uncertainty. It goes like this: right now, firms don\u2019t know how closely Britain will be tied to Europe, so it makes sense for them to postpone investments until the situation clarifies.This is an interesting and defensible argument \u2014 basically, that the unclear shape of Brexit creates an option value to waiting. But I have three questions about it.First, is this really the argument underlying all of these dire post-Brexit forecasts? My guess is that very few people reading news reports, or even briefing papers, about Brexit are hearing this; what they\u2019re getting is much closer to the notion that uncertainty = increased probability of bad things. That is, this argument is a lot more nuanced and subtle than anything I previously heard in this discussion.Third, doesn\u2019t this argument suggest essentially the same effects from any policy negotiation whose end result isn\u2019t known? Why don\u2019t we say that the possibilities of TPP or TTIP are contractionary, because firms have an incentive to postpone investment decisions until they know whether these agreements actually happen? Somehow, though I\u2019ve never heard anyone argue for the depressing effects of pending trade liberalization.Again, I\u2019m not trying to defend Brexit. But I worry that the urge to condemn it has led to a lowering of intellectual standards.And let me also say that the narrative of disaster is coloring some (not all) financial reporting. On the whole, the market reaction looks pretty muted to me. It\u2019s not just stocks: European bond spreads are about where they were a month ago. True, globally, rates are considerably lower; but we aren\u2019t seeing the kind of financial disruption so widely predicted. Yet headlines about turmoil are everywhere.Could I be wrong about all of this? Of course! But everyone really should ask where the consensus about Brexit macro is coming from.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Chinese Students Excel in Critical Thinking. Until College.", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese primary and secondary schools are often derided as grueling, test-driven institutions that churn out students who can recite basic facts but have little capacity for deep reasoning.A new study, though, suggests that China is producing students with some of the strongest critical thinking skills in the world.The unexpected finding could recast the debate over whether Chinese schools are doing a better job than American ones, complementing previous studies showing Chinese students outperforming their global peers in reading, math and science.The study, to be published next year, found that Chinese freshmen in computer science and engineering programs began college with critical thinking skills about two to three years ahead of their peers in the United States and Russia. Those skills included the ability to identify assumptions, test hypotheses and draw relationships between variables.Yet Chinese students showed virtually no improvement in critical thinking after two years of college, even as their American and Russian counterparts made significant strides, according to the study.\u201cIt\u2019s astounding that China produces students that much further ahead at the start of college,\u201d said Prashant Loyalka, an author of the study. \u201cBut they\u2019re exhausted by the time they reach college, and they\u2019re not incentivized to work hard.\u201dThe findings are preliminary, but the weakness in China\u2019s higher education system is especially striking because Chinese leaders are pressing universities to train a new generation of highly skilled workers and produce innovations in science and technology to serve as an antidote to slowing economic growth.The government has built hundreds of universities in recent years to meet soaring demand for higher education, which many families consider a pathway into the growing middle class. Enrollment last year reached 26.2 million students, up from 3.4 million in 1998, with much of the increase in three-year polytechnic programs.But many universities, mired in bureaucracy and lax academic standards, have struggled. Students say the energetic and demanding teaching they are accustomed to in primary and secondary schools all but disappears when they reach college.\u201cTeachers don\u2019t know how to attract the attention of students,\u201d said Wang Chunwei, 22, an electrical engineering student at Tianjin Chengjian University, not far from Beijing. \u201cListening to their classes is like listening to someone reading out of a book.\u201dOthers blame a lack of motivation among students. Chinese children spend years preparing for the gaokao, the all-powerful national exam that determines admission to universities in China. For many students, a few points on the test can mean the difference between a good and a bad university, and a life of wealth or poverty.When students reach college, the pressure vanishes.\u201cYou get a degree whether you study or not, so why bother studying?\u201d said Wang Qi, 24, a graduate student in environmental engineering in Beijing.The Stanford study, based in part on exams given to 2,700 students at 11 mainland universities, has its own limitations. It does not account for people who are not enrolled in universities, a large swath of Chinese youth. It looks exclusively at students in computer science and engineering programs. And while it measures critical thinking, it does not offer insight into creativity, a topic often hotly debated in discussing the Chinese education system.Still, the researchers found stark differences when they compared Chinese students with their overseas counterparts.In addition to examining critical thinking skills, the study looked at how Chinese students compared in math and physics. While testing for the United States is not yet available, the researchers found that Chinese students arrived at college with skills far superior to their Russian counterparts.After two years of college, though, the Chinese students showed virtually no improvement while the Russians made substantial progress, though not enough to catch up.The Stanford researchers suspect the poor quality of teaching at many Chinese universities is one of the most important factors in the results. Chinese universities tend to reward professors for achievements in research, not their teaching abilities. In addition, almost all students graduate within four years, according to official statistics, reducing the incentive to work hard.\u201cThey don\u2019t really flunk anyone,\u201d said Scott Rozelle, an economist who has studied Chinese education for three decades and a co-author of the study. \u201cThe contract is, if you got in here, you get out.\u201dThe problems plaguing the higher education system have taken on new urgency as China\u2019s ruling Communist Party tries to navigate a difficult transition from an economy fueled by manufacturing and assembly-line work to one led by growth in fields such as information technology and clean energy.Eric X. Li, a venture capitalist in Shanghai who helped finance the Stanford study, said the success of Chinese secondary schools in teaching critical thinking could mean more innovation among younger Chinese that would help the economy.\u201cThe common narrative that we hear is that Chinese educational system kills creativity and kills innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut China is probably one of the most entrepreneurial societies in the world.\u201dThe slowing economy has made it difficult for university graduates to find work, with about one-fifth remaining unemployed immediately after graduation and many settling into low-paying jobs.Lu Jiawei, 22, who studies engineering management at Beijing Information Science and Technology University, said the gloomy job market was to blame for a lack of motivation among students.\u201cSome students just give up, because no matter how hard they work, they still will never get their dream jobs,\u201d she said.The shortcomings of the higher education system have left students struggling to find programs that match their aspirations.Niu Fuzhi, an aspiring computer scientist at Harbin University of Commerce, had high hopes when she enrolled in 2014. But she was quickly disappointed. Professors focused on teaching high-level theories, she said, and classrooms were chaotic.\u201cI feel like the past two years were a waste,\u201d said Ms. Niu, 20, who ranks near the top of her class.But Ms. Niu is hoping to make up for the skills she failed to learn in college \u2014 by enrolling in graduate school.Zhang Tiantian and Karoline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: With GT S, Mercedes Builds a Performance Classic", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byDrivenThe Mercedes-AMG GT S is not the car many expect from the tri-star folks. Far from the opulent S-Class and tot-toting GLS S.U.V., the two-passenger GT S clearly says \u201clet\u2019s race.\u201d It\u2019s speaking directly, and confidently, to the Audi R8 and Porsche 911.\u201cSomething wicked this way comes \u2014 in yellow,\u201d said an observer, gazing at the Mercedes simmering along the roadside. Indeed, this machine \u2014 replacing the longer gullwing SLS \u2014 cuts a seductive and menacing figure. The AMG Solarbeam paint on the test model I drove does look suitably wicked. I salute those extroverted souls who choose it over white or silver.This is not an automobile for the masses, given prices that begin at $132,125. But that\u2019s a bargain of sorts considering it is about 70 grand less than the asking price on the less-sophisticated SLS it replaces. My tester, equipped with fade-free carbon ceramic brakes ($8,950), carbon fiber exterior trim ($5,300) and that Solarbeam paint ($9,900!) has a sticker price of $171,900. I\u2019ll point out that 97-month auto loans are now available.Aluminum body panels seem to be poured over the aluminum space-frame chassis. Replacing the SLS\u2019s 6.2-liter V8 is a 4-liter V8 with turbochargers nestled between the cylinder banks. (That\u2019s a \u201chot inside V\u201d setup for jargon lovers).A plaque on the carbon-fiber engine shroud states that my particular motor was hand-assembled by Martin. He would proudly explain that dry sump lubrication ensures that the cylinders, lined with the proprietary friction-reducing material Nanoslide, always gets proper oil supply, even during extreme cornering forces. The elimination of a traditional oil pan allowed engineers to drop the engine 2 inches for a lower center of gravity.Yes, there are drive settings to tailor suspension and performance, from \u201ccomfort\u201d through a manual mode properly tagged \u201crace\u201d. The optional computer-controlled engine and transaxle reduce vibration. Buy them. They\u2019re only $2,600.Mercedes claims the turbo V8\u2019s 503 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque launches the 3,627-pound GT S from rest to 60 miles-an-hour in 3.7 seconds (which is conservative, methinks). Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted 7-speed automatic dual-clutch transmission and carbon-fiber drive shaft.But this car can\u2019t be understood with statistics. The hammer of the throbbing V8 (which never sounds strained) and force of the lateral Gs during cornering simply must be experienced to comprehend.I did not explore the 193 m.p.h. top speed, nor will I admit that I found cruising at twice the average speed limit to be effortless \u2014 officer. Let\u2019s just say the car is crazy capable and should keep fine company with the R8 and 911. Exploring the differences can and should be done only on a track.A winged higher performance GT R model (yes, higher performance) is expected in 2017.Gripes? The transmission selector is an awkward reach backward. Personally, I\u2019d pay $1,260 for the panoramic glass roof to brighten things inside. That beautiful cockpit, which looks for all the world to be from Darth Vader\u2019s TIE fighter, is a might snug for a car this size.And assuming that Lord Vader is a Virgo, he\u2019d spot that the yellow interior stitching is a few Pantone shades off the Solarbeam exterior paint. None of this should shake off perspective buyers, though. Nor should the average E.P.A. fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon with premium gasoline.Compared with the competition, the GT S is fairly practical with its liftgate cargo area, easily hauling two full-size suitcases in back and a third carry-on bag. Not that owners will crave long-distance travel in this coupe. Even in comfort setting, its very firm ride and decibel rating is hardly up to S-Class standards.But my goodness, what a shape to behold \u2014 the love child of a Porsche 911 and Jaguar E-Type. If its silhouette is all you desire, a less expensive GT model (without the S) is due this fall with a $20,000 lower price, and it will hardly be poky.Considering its looks and performance, the Mercedes-AMG GT S should fast become a classic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Convention: Day 3", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementPHILADELPHIA \u2014 A country off the rails or one that makes steady if imperfect progress?A land of disenchantment or of stubborn, spectacular promise?The intensifying battle between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is turning into a contest of those visions. That became clearer than ever on the third night of the Democratic National Convention here, as President Obama answered Trump\u2019s message of fear with a proclamation of hope as rousing and robust as any I\u2019ve heard.\u201cAmerica is already great,\u201d Obama said \u2014 thundered, really. \u201cAmerica is already strong. And I promise you our strength \u2014 our greatness \u2014 does not depend on Donald Trump. In fact it doesn\u2019t depend on any one person.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in this campaign about what America has lost,\u201d he added, then flashed back to his Kansas grandparents \u2014 whom he\u2019d mentioned in the 2004 convention speech that introduced him to most Americans \u2014 and to the virtues of \u201ckindness, courtesy, humility, responsibility\u201d that they preached.\u201cAmerica has changed over the years, but these values that my grandparents taught \u2014 they haven\u2019t gone anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith. They live on in each of us.\u201dAnd with Trump very much in mind, he made clear: \u201cWe don\u2019t fear the future. We shape it. We embrace it.\u201dIt\u2019s hard, frankly, to stop quoting from his remarks because they amounted to one of the most moving, inspiring valentines to this country that I\u2019ve ever heard, brimming with regard for it and gratitude to it.We\u2019re going to miss this man, America. Whatever his flaws, he\u2019s been more than our president. Time and again, he\u2019s been our national poet.His speech reflected a fascinating role reversal this election cycle, with the Republicans \u2014 or, at least, the Republican presidential nominee \u2014 speaking in stormy terms about America\u2019s failures while the Democrats stress how much sunshine there really is.At least since Ronald Reagan\u2019s declaration of \u201cmorning again in America,\u201d the G.O.P. has tended toward optimism and uplift, but Trump has little interest in cheerleading. So Democrats have grabbed the pom-poms.Obama even went so far as to claim Reagan\u2019s perspective as the current Democratic one \u2014 and to use it to shame Trump.\u201cRonald Reagan called America a shining city on a hill,\u201d the president said. \u201cDonald Trump calls it a divided crime scene that only he can fix.\u201dEarlier in the night, Vice President Joe Biden concluded his rawly, infectiously emotional speech by shouting: \u201cWe are America, second to none, and we own the finish line! Don\u2019t forget it! Come on! We\u2019re America!\u201dBut they paid tribute to the might of the United States military, which Trump has repeatedly questioned, in a rah-rah manner typically associated with Republicans.And Obama and Biden both answered Trump\u2019s lament about America\u2019s supposedly lost greatness with assertions of its continued potency.\u201cWe have the finest fighting force in the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world. We have the most productive workers in the world.\u201dObama focused on our armed forces, too, saying: \u201cDonald Trump calls our military a disaster. Apparently he doesn\u2019t know the men and women who make up the strongest fighting force the world has ever known.\u201dThat was striking, and so were some of the characterizations of Trump.They portrayed him as danger incarnate \u2014 not just unprincipled and uninformed but possibly unhinged. Over the past decades, I\u2019ve never heard a major political party\u2019s nominee discussed so cataclysmically.\u201cRisky, reckless and radical\u201d is what Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, labeled him.\u201cLet\u2019s elect a sane, competent person,\u201d Bloomberg said, implying that Trump was insane.For Obama, defeating Trump is personal.A Trump victory would not only unravel some of his proudest accomplishments but also contradict the story that he\u2019s been telling about America, one of widening hearts and expanding social justice.One of the longstanding complaints about Obama is that he has not summoned the energy and selflessness to improve the fortunes of the Democratic Party beyond him. Since his 2008 election, the party has lost ground in the House, in the Senate and in statehouses across the country. The Democratic advantage in presidential elections is not matched by Democratic dominance beyond the White House.There\u2019d be a heaping measure of forgiveness for that if Democrats won the presidency for a third straight term. And it wouldn\u2019t be just any third term. The nation\u2019s first black president would be handing over the reins to the nation\u2019s first woman president, a sequence of milestones in perfect keeping with the Democratic Party\u2019s celebration of a more diverse, inclusive America.But the case he was really making was for America.Recalling that first convention speech of his in 2004, he said, \u201cI was filled with faith: faith in America, the generous, big-hearted, hopeful country that made my story \u2014 that made all of our stories \u2014 possible.\u201d\u201cThe America I know,\u201d he said, \u201cis full of courage and optimism and ingenuity. The America I know is decent and generous.\u201dThat tack is in some ways inevitable and necessary: It complements the Democrats\u2019 argument that Obama has moved the country forward, improving Americans\u2019 lives, and that keeping the White House under Democratic control, with his handpicked successor, is crucial.But the way he delivered it, it didn\u2019t seem to be a cold-eyed strategy or a self-serving bid for validation. It came across as a cry from the heart \u2014 and an earnest, gorgeous one at that.Frank Bruni is an Op-Ed columnist for The Times.PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Michael Bloomberg clearly believes that Donald Trump is giving New York billionaires a bad name. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s running his business. God help us!\u201d he snarled at the Democratic convention.Nothing crueler than a self-made mogul lacing into an \u2026 heir.\u201cI built a business,\u201d said the man who ranks No. 8 on the Forbes list of the richest people on the planet. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t start it with a million dollar check from my father.\u201d Ouch.Bloomberg began by cautioning Democrats that he was not a part of their group and that he was there only \u201cto explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.\u201dWhich was really not much of a pill for the party to swallow. (What? No shout-out for the platform?)New York City\u2019s former mayor tends to follow his own star, which is sort of an inherent right when you\u2019re worth around $48 billion. In his speech, he divided his time between savaging Trump and pointing out that he was a registered Independent \u201cbecause I don\u2019t believe that either party has a monopoly on good ideas or strong leadership.\u201dAll that was music to the ears of independent voter-hungry Democrats. Although if you live in New York City, where almost all elections are effectively decided in Democrats-only primaries, it is also a demand for disenfranchisement.There was no such problem this time. The convention scrutinizers were presumably able to live with Bloomberg\u2019s suggestion that Democrats might be too tough on the private sector in return for having one of the wealthiest guys in the world announce that \u201cthe richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy.\u201d\nHow did President Obama do in his speech? I am on the floor of the Democratic convention to get instant reaction.\nYou\u2019d be wrong. Mr. Trump was on strikingly good behavior during his A.M.A., offering only token references to \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d lest Redditors doubt it was really him.To a libertarian debating whether to vote for a third-party candidate or Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee (Reddit username: the-realDonaldTrump) replied: \u201cAmericans in every party are tired of our rigged system and corrupt politicians, and want to reform our government so it no longer benefits the powerful at the expense of everyone else. They know I will fix it so it works for them and their families.\u201dTo a user who asked what role NASA should have \u201cin helping to Make America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cHonestly I think NASA is wonderful! America has always led the world in space exploration.\u201dThis is about as contentious as he got, in response to a question about why Mrs. Clinton doesn\u2019t do more news conferences: \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton will not do press conferences because she cannot explain her illegally deleted 33,000 emails, or her disaster in Libya, or her role pushing TPP (which she would 100 percent approve if she got the chance), or her support for a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees, etc.\u201dOf course, Mr. Trump speaks without a filter on national television, so maybe he felt no need to let loose on Reddit. Maybe his staff did the whole A.M.A. for him. Or maybe, after a long day of telling the Russians to hack American servers, the-realDonaldTrump was just a little tired.Trump has often talked about Russia in his wacky way, saying he would be able to tame the Russian bear because he\u2019s an expert at the art of the deal. Leon Aron, a Russia expert with the American Enterprise Institute, has a more realistic assessment. \u201cPutin will run circles around Trump,\u201d he said today.But the Trump-Putin story has become truly bizarre since WikiLeaks published thousands of emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee. They certainly appear to have been hacked by Russian code jockeys working for Putin.At a news conference today at one of Trump\u2019s golf courses in Florida (why does the self-avowed friend of the ordinary American keep having events at exclusive golf clubs?), the Republican nominee dug the Russia hole deeper.Trump told reporters that he didn\u2019t know who hacked the D.N.C. emails. But, referring to messages that were deleted from Clinton\u2019s private email server, he said: \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201dAs incredible as it was to hear a presidential candidate seemingly urging an unfriendly foreign power to break into the emails of a former secretary of state, Trump didn\u2019t stop there.\u201cI never met Putin, I don\u2019t know who Putin is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said one nice thing about me. He said I\u2019m a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.\u201dTrump also told reporters today that he had \u201czero\u201d financial connections to Russia. \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia.\u201dAras Agalarov, one of the oligarchs who made billions with the help of Putin\u2019s corrupt and autocratic government, said he had signed a deal to build a Trump Tower in Russia. So much for Trump\u2019s lack of connection to Russia.And that doesn\u2019t even account for the longstanding and lucrative business connections of his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, with Russian oligarchs and the Ukrainian autocrat Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin puppet before he was deposed.\u201cI thought he was saying we want the emails back,\u201d Carlson said.Julie Roginsky, a co-host of the program, tried to inject reality into the conversation. \u201cThat is not how anybody outside this table understands it,\u201d she said.David Gregory, a CNN political analyst, called Trump \u201ca child playing with matches.\u201d That was well put.Gregory also said he had \u201crun out of words to express my shock and how completely beyond the pale that Donald Trump is as a potential leader of the free world.\u201dMaybe Gregory has, but Trump had many more words to offer today to show how shockingly unfit he is to be president.At one point in the news conference, he said that if elected, he would consider recognizing as legitimate Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. The last time I checked, Crimea was part of a sovereign nation, Ukraine, before Putin seized it, and American presidents don\u2019t encourage Russian expansionism.How far we\u2019ve come from Ronald Reagan going to Berlin and demanding the Kremlin \u201ctear down this wall.\u201d\nThe comedian talked to The New York Times\u2019s Jim Rutenberg from inside the (mini) Oval Office.\nAlong with the thousands of delegates, protesters, journalists and onlookers that have descended on Philadelphia this week, a gaggle of celebrities have made appearances both inside and outside the convention hall. The Democrats, on the other hand, have already featured a slew of actresses, including America Ferrera, Meryl Streep in an American flag patterned dress, Elizabeth Banks, Eva Longoria and Lena Dunham. One small hiccup in the celebrity parade: having the actor Tony Goldwyn \u2014 who plays a president who cheats on his wife in the Oval Office \u2014 speak in the run-up to Bill Clinton\u2019s speech. Susan Sarandon may have been having literally the worst time, but everyone else is trying not to. PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Republican convention last week included a number of gestures toward diversity.The lineup featured some speakers and performers of color, including Pastor Mark Burns and the 6-year-old singer Heavenly Joy Jerkins. In his invocation on the last night of the convention, the Rev. Steve Bailey called for an end to racial discrimination. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s not right that racism continues to wound and destroy the lives of many in this land,\u201d he said.Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona introduced his state as \u201cthe home state of Cesar Chavez, home state of many native tribes, home state of electing some of the first women leaders in this country.\u201dJim Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case that led to marriage equality for same-sex couples, spoke on behalf of Ohio: \u201cThis Ohio boy helped love win last summer. And this Ohio boy and my fellow Ohioans know this: Love trumps hate.\u201dStill, the Democratic convention so far has shown a commitment to real representation for female, minority and L.G.B.T. Americans \u2014 something the Republicans, with their talk of building a wall, banning Muslims and rolling back marriage equality, couldn\u2019t match.I don\u2019t expect him to acknowledge how the demands of party loyalty have erased any Catholic distinctiveness in his politics, any evidence that faith should trump partisanship when the two actively conflict.The erosion of Catholic distinctiveness is a long-running story in American politics. The church\u2019s social doctrine stresses both economic solidarity and social conservatism, calling Catholic politicians to either a pro-life, pro-family liberalism or to a one-nation conservatism, neither racist nor Ayn Randian.Tim Kaine was one of those candidates. Running for governor of Virginia in 2005, he offered a version of Mario Cuomo\u2019s \u201cpersonally opposed, but \u2026\u201d maneuver on abortion. But he also played up his support for a partial-birth abortion ban, parental notification laws and \u201cinformed consent\u201d provisions designed to persuade women to carry pregnancies to term.And then came Donald Trump, inviting Republicans to embrace a more authoritarian form of solidarity, unmoored from any real social conservatism and united by white-identity politics rather than a vision of the common good. Which to their credit, both Ryan and Rubio resisted \u2026 but only up to a point, because in the end partisanship trumped Catholic principle. (Mormon principle, it\u2019s worth noting, seems to be made of sterner stuff.)So this is the \u201cCatholic\u201d politics we have in the America of 2016: Catholic liberals who endorse unlimited abortion, and Catholic conservatives who endorse an authoritarian buffoon.Jesus wept.Ever since Americans elected their first African-American president, the not-so-hidden racism on the right has steadily slithered its way into the open \u2014 enabled most recently by Donald Trump\u2019s undisguised bigotry.O\u2019Reilly, who presents himself as a historian, pretended to be praising and expanding on the first lady\u2019s observation. \u201cThe history behind her remarks is fascinating,\u201d he said on his Fox News program.\u201cSlaves that worked there were well fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government, which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor.\u201dAnd so, O\u2019Reilly continued, \u201cMichelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House, but there were others working, as well.\u201dShe was not \u201cessentially\u201d right. She was completely right. I\u2019m sure the fact that non-slaves also worked on the White House would come as a great relief to the descendants of those unfortunate humans whose tormenters forced them to help build the official residence of the president of the United States.Let\u2019s be clear, the federal government never \u201chired\u201d slaves. It paid their enslaver for their work. And the fact that it did not forbid contractors from using slaves was a direct endorsement of slavery.Worst of all, O\u2019Reilly was mouthing classic racist propaganda when he waxed rhapsodic about the slaves having three hots and a cot.Pat Buchanan, another bigot, who once ran for president , wrote:And the list goes on. In his film \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America,\u201d the right winger Dinesh D\u2019Souza actually argues that while Frederick Douglass exposed the indescribable evil of slavery, he did, after all, stay in America.That\u2019s a particularly twisted version of the \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it\u201d argument of times past.It is especially sickening to see this kind of filth on an American news network, even one as slanted as Fox News \u2014 whose on-air ideologues claim to champion individual liberties \u2014 on the eve of President Obama\u2019s speech at the Philadelphia convention.The network, which recently ousted its creater, Roger Ailes, because of sexual harassment allegations, owes the country an apology.Slavery was a hideous crime committed against our fellow Americans. Black Americans were hunted, tortured, beaten and murdered by white Americans with impunity well into the second half of the 20th century.There is no excusing or explaining away slavery, just as there is no excusing O\u2019Reilly\u2019s remarks. At the very least, he personally owes us all an apology.PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Stephen Starr owned and operated a bunch of this city\u2019s most popular restaurants when the Republicans had their convention here in 2000. He owns and operates an even bigger bunch of those restaurants now.And over the years, plenty of prominent Republicans and Democrats have visited his upscale dining rooms, giving him a window into partisan grazing habits and a belief that they differ slightly, but only slightly, and in a way that\u2019s not exactly going to shock you.\u201cRepublicans don\u2019t eat much sushi,\u201d he told me. \u201cDefinitely, Democrats consume more sushi.\u201dIt was dinnertime on Tuesday, and the convention was nearing its midpoint. Starr seemed disappointed. Although he\u2019s both a Democrat and an admirer of Hillary Clinton\u2019s, he wasn\u2019t sensing as much excitement in the city as he did back in 2000, when the Republicans were nominating George W. Bush.But the difference, he said, wasn\u2019t about the candidates or even, really, the political parties. It was about the national mood.Before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and then the economic downturn of 2008, he said, there was a much bigger appetite for splashy events in stylish restaurants like his Asian-fusion fun house, Buddakan, and his Japanese fantasia, Morimoto.Now the events are more restrained. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for splashy to come back,\u201d Starr told me.It\u2019s Talula\u2019s Garden, his less showy, farm-to-table restaurant. In other words, the eat-your-peas political party is having dinner parties with vegetable-heavy menus.There\u2019s a missing spark, Starr said. At a party for the Funny or Die humor website and production company in his restaurant Buddakan on Monday night, there were two prominent Schumers on the guest list, he said: Chuck, the senator, and Amy, the TV and movie star.To the best of his knowledge, only Chuck made an appearance, Starr told me with something of a sigh.He perked up just minutes later, though, when he received word that at his restaurant Parc, a French brasserie next door to Barclay Prime, Elizabeth Warren and a few companions had just sat down. Their shared order included a green salad, clams on the half shell, escargots and halibut, I learned.Later the same night, Bernie Sanders dined in a party of 10 at Butcher and Singer, another of Starr\u2019s restaurants. He ate roast chicken, Starr informed me, and the side dishes on the table included creamed spinach, French fries and asparagus.Reflecting on the conventions that have come through Philadelphia, Starr said that the dining differences between political parties and between professional groups are relatively subtle, though he has noticed a lawyers-doctors divide.\u201cLawyers drink more and order more expensive items \u2014 for sure,\u201d he said.Back then, he said, a person or group would dine at the same place multiple times. He recalled that the former senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, ate dinner at the restaurant Vetri on three nights in four days. No one\u2019s doing that this time around, Benjamin said.He said that to get ready for this week, he reached out to Cleveland restaurateurs, who reported that many Republican delegates were leaving the convention hall during dinner hours to slip into restaurants for meals.Democratic delegates haven\u2019t been doing likewise, he said. They\u2019re staying put, keeping the arena\u2019s seats full.He didn\u2019t have any major sightings to report, but said he\u2019s been privately hoping to get sudden notice that President Obama was dropping by. He remains prepared. Although he has a limited daily supply of one of his signature entrees \u2014 lamb shoulder roasted with pomegranate juice \u2014 he has been keeping a half shoulder for four in reserve every night, just in case.\u201cWe have an Obama lamb,\u201d he told me. \u201cBarack Obama or Jesus Christ: We have lamb for those two.\u201d\nShare your thoughts as we draw a map of your opinions across America.\nThe children \u2014 Nicco, 12; Andreas, 9; and Simone, 6 \u2014 are raising money to buy school supplies for children in a homeless shelter where Ms. Carleton used to work, and to honor the memory of their friend, Nafice Hill.Ms. Carleton is an English teacher. Two decades ago, she worked as a tutor at The Drueding Center, a shelter for homeless families in North Philadelphia. That\u2019s where she met the Hill family. Nafice was about 7 years old then, living in the shelter with two siblings and his grandmother, Lorraine. In time, Ms. Hill found a home, earned a degree, and now works as an addiction counselor.\u201cIt felt like losing one of my own children,\u201d Ms. Carleton said. \u201cHe was one where I thought, \u2018he\u2019s going to do so well.\u2019\u201dBut as the Carleton kids pulled their jug of lemonade down Broad Street, displaying their poster and trying to tell their story, impatient delegates and shouting demonstrators kept passing them by.\u201cEveryone talks about the middle class. Few discuss the poor, the people struggling day to day.\u201dHe will obviously focus on the future and, in particular, on why a Hillary Clinton presidency would be good for the country. But he has no choice but to talk about the past as well. Clinton has cast herself as Obama\u2019s heir, and Obama will need to make a case that his presidency has been a success.Historically, Americans blame \u2014 or credit \u2014 the incumbent president for the state of the country. But something seems to have changed in recent years. With much of the Republican Party deeply and publicly committed to Obama\u2019s failure, many voters have come to understand that he isn\u2019t omnipotent.But it also needs to be a story that acknowledges the country\u2019s enduring problems. Perhaps above all, it should be a story about why Clinton can plausibly claim she will succeed where he did not.The most effective speech that Obama could give would not simply try to transfer his popularity to her. The most effective version would try to distinguish Clinton from Obama and lift her above him in some ways. No one has a better chance to do so than he does.David Leonhardt, who will begin an Op-Ed column later this year, is writing a daily opinion post during the conventions.Clearly, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have access to this information, so why do they reject it? But this denial of settled science doesn\u2019t just concern the climate. Consider vaccines. Remember the measles outbreak last year at Disneyland? This outbreak and others were completely preventable because measles vaccines are safe, inexpensive and effective. Now imagine that a new president encourages Americans not to get vaccinated, because he thinks the science is unsettled and maybe vaccines actually do cause autism. Millions of Americans decide not to get their children vaccinated \u2014 or at least delay doing so. The result would be a public health crisis. The rejection of science starts with ideology. It ends with people dying. \nColumnists Charles M. Blow and Andrew Rosenthal discuss Bill Clinton\u2019s speech last night and what\u2019s to come.\n\nColumnist Gail Collins and editorial board writer Elizabeth Williamson discussed Hillary and feminism.\nAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Conflicted Cuba Policy", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byEditorialOne year after the United States and Cuba formally re-established diplomatic relations, the two governments have made considerable, if halting, progress toward rebuilding what has been the most poisonous relationship in the hemisphere.Washington and Havana have agreed to cooperate on health care challenges, maritime issues, agriculture, climate change and environmental initiatives. Commercial flights between the two countries are expected to start this fall. American telecommunications and hotel companies have signed a handful of deals to do business in Cuba, marking the first commercial forays into a market that has been off limits for decades.Dissident groups, meanwhile, report that their ranks have grown steadily, as more Cubans are sold on their vision of representative democracy with strong safeguards for civil liberties. Opposition groups are preparing to field candidates next year for the lowest rung of Cuba\u2019s election system \u2014 the only one the Communist Party does not fully control \u2014 hoping to transform the system gradually from the bottom up.Economic changes are moving very slowly, but this could change if the embargo were lifted. Popular pressure for more sweeping reforms would grow, and the government would find it harder to justify its crackdowns on dissidents by claiming they are agents of a foreign conspiracy.Cuba\u2019s worsening economy, brought about in part by political and economic turmoil in Venezuela, long Cuba\u2019s benefactor, could also be a catalyst for reform. Earlier this month, President Ra\u00fal Castro warned in strikingly blunt terms that Cubans should brace for a period of austerity.Some congressional proponents of continuing the embargo might see Cuba\u2019s difficulties as an opportunity to squeeze the octogenarian Castro brothers during their last years in power. That would be a mistake. Cuba\u2019s shoddy infrastructure would continue to deteriorate, foreign investors would recoil, already marginal communities would become even poorer and the exodus of desperate Cubans to the United States would accelerate. It seems highly unlikely that this scenario would usher in an era of greater freedoms. But it certainly would sow misery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Britain Is No Home to Me\u2019: Five Artists Respond to \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byBritain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has led to intense soul-searching in that country\u2019s cultural establishment. The New York Times asked five writers and theater professionals for their thoughts. In a sometimes heated email exchange last week, they debated whether it is too soon for artists to make art about \u201cBrexit,\u201d whether fiction has failed to capture social changes in Britain during the past 20 years, and what kind of art this historic moment might inspire. These are excerpts from the conversation.Does the Brexit vote change the relationship you have with Britain?The vote genuinely surprised me. Much like it did when Boris Johnson was elected as London mayor. It was a moment when a result I assumed was impossible, that I couldn\u2019t really conceive of, became a reality. As an artist I try to imagine I have some sense of where the collective consciousness of the country is \u2014 that I have an idea, however vague, of what the general mood is. Both these results disproved that. They showed me how deluded I was to believe that. I didn\u2019t know at all.I moved to London from Istanbul years ago. London, with its cosmopolitan energy, urban memory, cultural openness, literary traditions, gender equality and freedom of expression, was everything I could not find in Istanbul. I travel quite a bit across Britain and Europe and I had been observing the discontent with E.U. and Brussels, as well as the dissatisfaction with the process of globalization. Many people today seem to think that sameness will bring safety. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see how easily cosmopolitanism can be abandoned.I\u2019ve always felt an outsider in Britain and spent most of my working life in places all over the world. The Brexit vote only consolidates what I have long known \u2014 that Britain is no home to me.If Brexit does change the relationship of writers to Britain, British literature might benefit. I\u2019m reminded of that fabulous, albeit historically fundamentally garbled, ad-lib of Orson Welles in [the film] \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d comparing the Borgias and Medicis and warring states of Renaissance Italy, with all its magnificent works of art, on the one hand, with, on the other, the 500 years of peaceful Switzerland and its contribution: the cuckoo clock.British literature has been stagnant for at least two decades; British writers far too close to the establishment and more concerned with getting an invite onto a radio show or to the right dinner party than providing a critique of society. Orwell and Graham Greene would wince. And most of the decent literature comes into English through translation, aside from the postcolonial literature manifestly written for the white elites of London and curated by a buffer class of native informants designated by that same elite. The Brexit vote might well challenge the ruling complacency. Does art seem like a suitable and/or sufficient tool to address this historic moment?There are some kinds of art that can deal with this \u2014 with the whole steaming complexity of it \u2014 but I do think it needs time. Immediate reactions are important, but you can\u2019t write a novel about it before this evening, for instance. Maybe not for a decade.For people for whom the Brexit result is a shock, time will indeed have to pass in order to digest the result and reflect, before art can be made. But for those who regard it as a natural outcome of what came before, no such passage of time will be necessary. Tennis players know where the incoming ball will land long before it hits the ground.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m absolutely not saying that art shouldn\u2019t or can\u2019t engage with current affairs. But \u2014 and I can only speak for myself as an artist \u2014 I will need to consider the situation, learn and listen for a while before reflecting it or attempting to change it through my work. That might just be a few days or it could be years.It is different for a director. A director doesn\u2019t have to wait to respond to the social milieu in the same way a writer does. A writer has to be able to achieve a certain objectivity in order to craft his or her material. So I can see why some of the writers in this group want to wait. But, personally, I\u2019m seeing Brexit in everything I\u2019m currently planning to direct, in every play I read that I might direct. I\u2019m interested in teasing out the contemporary issues in what I\u2019m working on, however old the piece might be, whenever I\u2019m working on it. That might mean that the piece might not directly have lines that specifically tackle Brexit. But I can somehow show the contemporary resonance in the way it is delivered to the audience.I feel that art, somehow, has to be at the heart of what\u2019s happening now. We need to relay stories. Ever more needed in moments when there is an atmosphere of extreme right politics gaining ground and people are looking for scapegoats. Are any of you imagining creative responses to what\u2019s happened? To demand a response of that kind but with the speed of a tennis player hitting a ball is, to say the least, optimistic. Anyone else have a response to Mr. Rahman\u2019s assertion that British literature has been stagnant for at least two decades?  Have any of you witnessed or experienced any anecdotal moments of human drama recently that you think capture this historic turning point?This week, my cousin and her 3-year-old faced a verbal racial assault in London outside the child\u2019s playschool by a man in a van as he was driving away from them. The BBC has reported that incidents of hate crime have gone up by 500 percent since the vote. The victims of such abuse will largely be those who can least fight back. What about more practical effects of Brexit on art? The public funding we are used to expecting in this country can allow true creativity. If you are working in a publicly subsidized building then you have a responsibility to deliver truly interesting, risky, innovative, even provocative work. Work that speaks to your audience in many resonant ways. The priority is less about the financial rewards. The less subsidy we have, the more the \u201cproducers\u201d take over and the \u201cbottom line\u201d becomes the raison d\u2019\u00eatre. That\u2019s quite an unappealing landscape for artists. Some artists have said they felt shame at the vote. What were your responses when you learned the result?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rob Portman\u2019s Alternate Universe Convention", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byInstead, Mr. Portman has been staging his own \u201cmini-convention\u201d around Cleveland this week, kicking off a Habitat for Humanity project, kayaking with wounded veterans and speaking to a crowd of young campaign volunteers.\u201cI told them I was doing my own thing,\u201d he told reporters on Monday.Spending time at these Portman events is like entering a parallel universe of a kindler, gentler Republican National Convention. Unlike the doomsday screeds against Hillary Clinton emanating from the Quicken Loans Arena, the Rob Portman convention was spent celebrating charitable causes, making G-rated jokes, and leaving electoral politics at the door for the most part.Mr. Portman has spoken at every Republican convention since 1996. This year, when the convention is in his home state for the first time in 80 years, he\u2019s not going to make an onstage appearance.He has made it clear that he does not want to be associated too closely with his party\u2019s nominee. However, unlike Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, John Kasich, Mr. Portman has endorsed Donald J. Trump as the lesser of two evils.\u201cI am supporting Donald Trump. I think he\u2019s better for the country given the alternative, which is Hillary Clinton,\u201d he told reporters after the kayaking event on Tuesday. \u201cFour more years of disappointment with our economy and American leadership being eroded around the world.\u201dHe stressed that he had planned these events \u2014 with Habitat for Humanity, with campaign volunteers and with a wounded veterans program \u2014 \u201cwell over a year ago, before we had any clue that it would be Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.\u201d\u201cI did fight hard to get the convention here because it is a great economic boost to the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wanted to do something here that was a more lasting contribution outside of the downtown area.\u201dMr. Portman\u2019s wife, Jane Portman, joined her husband at the wounded veterans\u2019 event Tuesday morning, as he did his best to ignore what was going on elsewhere in Cleveland. \u201cThis is just how he rolls,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a positive, optimistic person. These are activities that he\u2019s been involved with and engaged with for years and years. They are positive and they are hopeful, and they lift people up and they pull people together.\u201dNo matter how wholesome the events have been, Democrats have capitalized on Mr. Portman\u2019s self-exile from convention festivities.After the Habitat event on Monday, Mr. Portman joined with Newt Gingrich and Iowa Senator Joni Ernst to speak to a large group of mostly high school and college-age campaign volunteers at Cuyahoga Community College.

Garland, President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. Another one held up a big blown up portrait of Mr. Portman\u2019s head sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign in many ways is Rob Portman\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. \u201cIf you really are troubled by him on all these issues, then to me, you own up to it like John Kasich does and simply say, \u2018I can\u2019t support him.\u2019 That\u2019s what leadership looks like.\u201dBoth Ted Strickland and Rob Portman\u2019s campaigns are trying to paint their opponents as friendly to China. Mr. Strickland\u2019s campaign passed out fortune cookies reading \u201cRob Portman: the best senator China\u2019s ever had.\u201d And at the Cuyahoga Community College event, counter-protesters from the Ohio G.O.P. held up a sign saying \u201cTed lost 350,000 jobs\u201d and one, wearing a tire outfit, held up a sign saying \u201cRetread Ted: Made in China.\u201dDemocrats are relishing the idea of taking back control of the Senate by kicking people like Mr. Portman out of office. It\u2019s an unfair political fact that the people who will likely suffer the most for Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive candidacy are the people who have tried to make the Republican Party more inclusive.Mr. Portman spent his Tuesday afternoon on the Cuyahoga River with Team River Runner, a group founded in 2004 at Walter Reed Medical Center to give wounded veterans the adaptive gear they need to kayak. Just as the veteran kayakers were about to race, a yacht named GOOD TIMES III came down the river. The boat slowly turned around and made its way back the way it came, and the race went forward.Ryan Major, 31, was one of the veterans kayaking on the river. He\u2019d lost both of his legs and part of his right hand to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2006.\u201cTeam River Runner\u2019s opened doors for me, helped build up my confidence and be more social,\u201d he said.It was a genuinely heartwarming campaign event in what has otherwise been a relentlessly dour few days of politics.As he lined up his kayak with Mr. Major, the only race Mr. Portman wanted to worry about was on the river. He lost, but he looked happy about it.Advertisement"}

(Don\u2019t Hold Your Breath.)", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesAttacking big banks is as American as apple pie. But it\u2019s a new entry on this year\u2019s Republican menu.In a convention surprise, the Republicans inserted a plank in the party platform calling for the restoration of a Depression-era law, the Glass-Steagall Act, that separated commercial and investment banking.The law was repealed in 1999 during the Clinton administration, with bipartisan support, at the behest of the big banks, which said they needed to combine their investment and commercial functions in order to compete on the global stage.It didn\u2019t turn out so well, of course.The world endured a severe financial crisis and global recession, and big multiservice banks like Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase received government funds. Subsequently, investment banks like Goldman Sachs, which also received a bailout, took on commercial banking, adding to the entanglement of investment and commercial functions.For both parties, it is a page straight out of the populist playbook.The speech is still remembered, but it didn\u2019t all work out as Bryan might have hoped: He ran for president repeatedly but never won.The Democratic platform draft, somewhat more expansive, embraces variety of measures \u201cto downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability.\u201d One of those measures, it says, is \u201can updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall and breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.\u201dAnd in any case, party platforms are often irrelevant. Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee in 1996, declared that he didn\u2019t even read the platform of that year\u2019s convention.Moreover, even if the parties nominally agree about Glass-Steagall, they are still miles apart on many other financial reform measures. And it\u2019s not clear that separating commercial and investment banking could more effectively reduce the size and the risk-taking of major banks than the main legislative response to the financial crisis: the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.That law and the so-called Volcker Rule, named after Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, aimed to prevent banks from ever again becoming \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dIt is difficult to imagine that either party\u2019s platform will alter public perceptions markedly with its position on Glass-Steagall or that the law will actually be re-enacted. The banks were extraordinarily active in seeking its repeal in 1999, and any serious effort to restore it might start that train rolling again.And if they are seeking to stir up the populists, both parties may want to be careful about attacking big banks right now. Who, after all, was the father of national banking in the United States?An article last Wednesday about efforts to revive the Glass-Steagall Act misstated the circumstances of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of a federal loan program during the financial crisis, and a correction in this space on Friday rendered part of the name of the program incorrectly. It was the Troubled Asset Relief Program, not the Trouble Asset Relief Program, and the bank took $25 billion from TARP at the government\u2019s request; it did not seek the assistance.An earlier version of a correction for this article rendered incorrectly part of the name of the federal loan program JPMorgan Chase used.

{"Headline": "Amid Political Uncertainty, Australia Faces Ratings Downgrade", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Even as global economic worries move investors to pour their money into seemingly stable Australia, political deadlock is jeopardizing the country\u2019s long-held image as a financial haven.On Thursday, Standard & Poor\u2019s, one of the leading credit-rating firms, warned that it could strip the country of its top-grade investment rating in the next two years. Among other reasons, S.&P. cited the inconclusive results of Australia\u2019s election on Saturday, which left no clear winner to grapple with the country\u2019s budget issues.The move did not appear to immediately unsettle investors, who drove Australian share prices up on Thursday and drove the value of Australia\u2019s currency down only modestly before it bounced back. But the warning from S.&P. suggests that one of the few remaining financial sanctuaries is no longer a sure bet.\u201cThere is still a degree of tolerance for Australia among foreign investors,\u201d said Shane Oliver, an economist at AMP Capital. \u201cBut this will cause some investors to question where we\u2019re heading.\u201dThat has led S.&P. and its rivals, Moody\u2019s Investor Service and Fitch Ratings, to give Australia the highest ratings they can bestow. Top ratings attract investors looking for safe bets. In return, top-rated countries enjoy low borrowing costs.China\u2019s slowing economic growth and gradual shift away from heavy industry has dented its appetite for Australia\u2019s minerals and energy. Its government spending and overall borrowing have continued to rise.The election on Saturday further clouded Australia\u2019s prospects.Analysts believe the conservative Liberal National coalition will limp back into office, securing a wafer-thin majority of 76 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has lost his significant majority in the lower house and will struggle with a Senate likely to be dominated by minor parties, weakening the ability of major parties to push through changes.\u201cWe believe fiscal consolidation may be further postponed,\u201d S.&P. said in a statement, adding that \u201cthere is a one in three chance that we could lower the rating within the next two years\u201d if Australia did not narrow its budget deficit.Both of Australia\u2019s major parties have run up large deficits. After the Liberal coalition was voted into office in 2013, then-Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered a 2014 budget aimed at reducing the debt he said had been incurred by the previous incumbents, the Labor Party. But many of Mr. Hockey\u2019s measures failed to gain support.Since then, the government\u2019s current projection of a return to a balanced budget has stretched to 2021, Standard & Poor\u2019s said.Both major parties have tried to navigate the economy away from a reliance on mining income and toward services, like education. Mr. Turnbull campaigned on a platform of tax cuts for businesses, which he said would bolster economic growth and create jobs, though his pledge did not appeal to many voters.The Labor Party\u2019s pledges to spend on health and education would have deepened the deficit by $12.3 billion over the next four years. It said the budget would return to surplus over the long term, in line with the government\u2019s projections.The BT Financial Group\u2019s chief economist, Chris Caton, said that the loss of the triple-A rating was not inevitable, given Australia\u2019s growth rates and low jobless rate. Still, he said, about 60 percent of Australia\u2019s bonds are held by overseas investors, exposing it to potentially higher borrowing costs.For the moment, investors worried by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, China\u2019s slowdown and other uncertainties have been more than willing to give Australia their money. The value of Australia\u2019s dollar has strengthened against the American dollar, rising to about 75 cents from about 69 cents early this year.The yield on Australian government bonds, which falls as demand for them increases, has also dropped to record lows. The annual yield on benchmark 10-year Australian government debt had fallen to less than 1.9 percent as of Thursday from about 2.8 percent at the start of the year.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

In many of those countries, the American way of choosing a president seems ideal, however imperfect. The electoral machine resembles a classic, Detroit-model limousine: large, showy and expensive, yet robust and broadly predictable.This year\u2019s race, at the outset, looked set to follow in that vein as a contest between the scions of two storied political dynasties, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Then the upstart billionaire and reality TV star Donald J. Trump thrust himself into the fray, shredding the script, dismissing Mr. Bush and upending most notions of what is possible, or acceptable, in an American political contest.The series will be called Abroad in America. This feverish political season has transfixed the world outside America, too. The election\u2019s first act \u2014 the primary contests, when the two main parties select their ultimate candidates \u2014 attracts an unusual degree of international scrutiny. Violence at rallies, incendiary speeches, race baiting, attacks on journalists and judges, proposals to bar Muslims or Mexicans \u2014 the primaries signaled a sudden sea change that left non-Americans watching with fascination, puzzlement and a profound sense of trepidation. For some countries, the changes resonate strongly at home.Mr. Trump\u2019s success chimes with nationalist surges across Europe and the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote. Disillusionment with traditional elites, hostility toward immigrants and anger among the losers from globalization \u2014 all resonate elsewhere. Yet it is odd and disturbing to hear terms like fascism and demagogy, most frequently associated with the European fringe or rickety third-world governments, being used in the context of an American campaign.My reporting will focus more at ground level. Some of my efforts will be explanatory \u2014 unraveling the intricacies and curiosities like the Electoral College, a source of befuddlement to many foreigners (and some Americans).

Alavi, managing partner at the Akrivis law group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s very consistent with past efforts by Congress to undermine the nuclear deal.\u201dBoeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, speaking this month at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain, an important annual industry event, may have added to the skepticism. He said that if his company could not sell planes to Iran Air, the state-run airline, under a memorandum of agreement reached in June, then \u201cnobody should.\u201dMr. Muilenburg was alluding to the Airbus deal, which was publicized to great fanfare when President Hassan Rouhani of Iran visited France, where Airbus has its headquarters, in January.The Iranians are also finding it difficult to find financing from foreign banks still skittish about doing business with the country. The depressed price of oil, Iran\u2019s main export, is not helping matters.Iran is also warily contemplating the possibility that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States, whose disdain for the nuclear accord is well known, could win in November. Whether he would try to withdraw from the accord is unclear.The delayed aircraft deals have sent ripples of uncertainty through the aviation industry, potentially affecting anticipated work by financial institutions, suppliers, service providers, insurers, reinsurers and others, according to lawyers knowledgeable about how large aircraft purchase contracts are handled.Iranian aviation officials, impatient to begin rejuvenating the country\u2019s aging fleet of 250 aircraft \u2014 of which more than a third are said to be grounded \u2014 have hinted they may go elsewhere to buy planes.The Iranians have expressed interest in a midsize jet under development by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi conglomerate, Reuters reported recently. In another possible sign of reduced expectations, there is speculation that the Iranians may cancel orders for 12 Airbus A380 jumbo jets, part of the 118-plane deal with Airbus that Mr. Rouhani announced seven months ago.Doubts also have emerged about whether Iran can lease new planes as an alternative, or a supplement, to buying them.Industry analysts say leasing companies could have difficulties repossessing the planes in the event Iran is found to have violated the nuclear accord or to be using the planes for purposes other than civilian transportation.Iran has not signed the Cape Town Convention, an agreement on international procedures for recovering \u201cmobile assets\u201d like aircraft.\u201cA lot of people who lease planes will look at that and say, \u2018No, thank you,\u2019\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, an aerospace consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.Mr. Aboulafia also expressed skepticism about the possibility of Iran\u2019s becoming an important customer to either Boeing or Airbus. Most of the international routes to Iran have been claimed by airlines in neighboring Persian Gulf states, with service and reliability that Iran will have trouble matching.\u201cIran\u2019s jetliner requirements could be real, but only if Tehran also agreed to reform its miserable state-owned economy, create private-sector airlines and adhere to international finance norms,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia wrote in an opinion piece published July 7 in Aviation Week, an industry magazine. \u201cThere are no plans to do anything like this.\u201dEven under a newly relaxed sanctions regime stipulated by the nuclear accord, both Boeing and Airbus need licenses from the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control to sell aircraft to Iran. Airbus planes use American parts that are subject to United States government approval.Both Boeing and Airbus have repeatedly said they are awaiting the licenses and cannot proceed without them. Treasury officials have declined to comment on when the licenses might be issued.Boeing has rejected accusations by some congressional critics that its desire to sell airplanes to a country hostile to the United States is wrongheaded.\u201cBasically what we\u2019ve told them is, \u2018Look: The U.S. government and five other governments negotiated this agreement. Airplanes were a part of it,\u201d Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said in a telephone interview.He also suggested that Boeing was not prepared to relinquish any competitive opportunity to Airbus concerning the Iranian market. Iranian aviation officials have said they will need 500 planes in coming years.\u201cIf Airbus were able to go into that market and we weren\u2019t able to be in there, too, and if Iran stays on the straight and narrow path and the moderates prevail politically and the market really grows in years ahead,\u201d Mr. Neale said, \u201cthey would have that market to themselves.\u201dNicola Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Of the wounded, four had grave injuries.In a span of six days in July, four high-profile attacks occurred in Germany, putting the nation on edge. Ten people were killed and more than 40 wounded in W\u00fcrzburg, Munich, Reutlingen and Ansbach.The attacks have profoundly disturbed a country that has taken pride in its ability to integrate migrants \u2014 enabled in part by its robust economy \u2014 and by its commitment to tolerance and openness.The video threatened \u201crevenge for the killing of Muslims,\u201d Mr. Herrmann said at a news conference in Nuremberg.While Germany has provided logistics, equipment and reconnaissance support to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, it is not involved in combat missions in Iraq or Syria, and unlike France and Belgium, it has not been seen in recent years as fertile ground for jihadist radicalization.The fact that three of the four attacks took place in Bavaria, the state at the front lines of the flow of migrants into Germany, resonated deeply.The bomber stayed in Bulgaria from late 2013 until the middle of 2014, Georgi Kostov, an official at the Bulgarian Interior Ministry, told journalists in Sofia.In December 2013, he was granted a status that allowed him to travel freely within the European Union, if he had the necessary documents.German officials offered a different account. Carda Seidel, the mayor of Ansbach, said the bomber had received two deportation orders, most recently on July 13, and Tobias Plate, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said the bomber had been notified of his impending deportation to Bulgaria. But he added, \u201cI can\u2019t at this point tell you why the deportation has not been carried out.\u201dRalf Millsaps, 59, who is originally from Mooresville, N.C., and has lived in Ansbach since April, after he retired from the Army, said he was sitting on the terrace outside the wine bar on Sunday night when the attacker sat down nearby.\u201cThe guy comes in, he\u2019s got long hair and earbuds,\u201d Mr. Millsaps said. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a giant rucksack, not a day pack, a rucksack that was thick. He sits down at a table and doesn\u2019t take off the rucksack.\u201d The backpack smelled of fertilizer or diesel, he said. The man left, but returned 15 to 20 minutes later \u2014 and then the backpack exploded.Mr. Millsaps \u2014 who said he had been treated for a shoulder injury and had given the clothes he was wearing to the police for testing \u2014 said he believed that the detonator went off, but not the full array of explosives in the backpack. \u201cThe size of his rucksack, it should have taken the side off the building,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here talking to you if the bomb had gone off.\u201d He added: \u201cI know what I\u2019m talking about. This ain\u2019t my first rodeo.\u201dMr. Mahmood said he had spoken several times with Mr. Daleel and had never had any problems with him. \u201cI am shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I heard it was him, I was thinking: How could he do this?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a street near the site of the attack in Ansbach.

I shook Kanittanon\u2019s hand, noticed my crumpled jacket sleeve and immediately regretted not wearing a nicer suit. But Kanittanon was indeed glad to spread word of his country\u2019s cuisine and economy, and he and Sombatpiboon courteously remarked on Thailand\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s largest net food exporters, on the healthfulness and appeal of Thai dishes, on an initiative by the Ministry of Industry to train Thai chefs to better promote the cuisine abroad. The visit was informative and very diplomatic. I should have worn a nicer suit.Afterward, we planned a visit with Jaisamarn Kanittanon, the consul general\u2019s wife, who goes by Koi and who would teach me to make her pla goong. When I pulled up to their handsome house in eastern Queens, I said a little secular prayer: Please, let me know how to act in a diplomat\u2019s home. Koi and Sombatpiboon welcomed me in. I started dipping my head to bow, as I\u2019ve seen Thai people do, but realizing that it might be more appropriate to shake hands, I panicked, then made a bizarre show of wiping my feet on the doormat. My hosts smiled.They led me toward a table surrounded by gorgeous Thai teak chairs, intricately carved with a motif of peacocks. Next to it was a set of Western furniture. I asked about the meaning of the arrangement: Is it ceremonial to use one set or the other? It\u2019s where everything fit when it came out of storage, Koi told me. Perhaps we should get to cooking, Sombatpiboon said.Relieved for the chance to stop talking, I looked forward to filling my maw with food instead: a nutty panang curry, sweetened ruby-red water chestnuts in coconut milk and, of course, Koi\u2019s pla goong, shrimp dressed with lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and roasted chile paste, then shotgunned with hot chiles, lemongrass, mint, cilantro and kaffir lime leaves.The pla goong was wild, each bite pinging from tart to floral to briny to cool and grassy with half a dozen stops in between, while a mellowing pile of rice kept the chile-armed riot under control. \u201cThere is never just one taste in Thai food,\u201d Sombatpiboon said. \u201cFor the pla, the lead is a sour taste \u2014 other dishes are led by sweet or salty \u2014 but always there are many tastes together.\u201d She added: \u201cThe cumin in the panang curry; that is very Indian. Anything stir-fried, we got that from the Chinese. It is always a combination that becomes uniquely Thai.\u201dAs we ate, Koi told me about living in Jakarta, her husband\u2019s first posting, where there were few Thais but plenty of familiar ingredients, and their last before New York, in Seoul, where the local markets left her hungry for Thai flavors. In New York, though, she can find nearly any ingredient she needs. She and Sombatpiboon said that as studious children, they weren\u2019t taught or expected to cook but still learned through osmosis. \u201cAs a diplomat, you\u2019re taught to try everything,\u201d Sombatpiboon said. \u201cYou taste food and understand a people.\u201dThe diplomat\u2019s life is an unusual one, though, moving often around the world, and while both Koi and Sombatpiboon were gracious and proud, I wondered about the things that give grounding to such a life, when your own culture and family may feel so far away. As Koi was telling me that pla goong is especially good with beer or whiskey, she paused, suddenly distracted. \u201cOh, I just remembered that my father liked this,\u201d she said quietly. She smiled, and then continued for a moment to be in her own thoughts. \u201cAh, I just remembered that my father liked this,\u201d she said again. \u201cHe passed away 30 years ago.\u201dI thought about what Sombatpiboon said about how food can let you understand other people.

Political scientists, by tracking factors like economic trends, political freedoms and public health, have identified several predictive patterns.Jay Ulfelder, who works in the area of political forecasting, has developed a mathematical model that synthesizes this data to predict a country\u2019s level of risk.Mr. Ulfelder has also found that a country is less likely to face a coup when there is armed conflict in nearby states, perhaps because of a rally-around-the-flag effect.While Turkey has a history of coups, the country has changed considerably since its last, in 1997, and Mr. Ulfelder stressed that what mattered more was its nearly 20 years without one.Another crucial factor is what experts call elite fragmentation. If divisions open up among powerful elites \u2014 elected officials, business leaders, generals, judges and so on \u2014 their competition for resources and control can culminate in a coup.Research suggests that carrying out a successful coup is a bit like baking a cake: There is a recipe, and if you skip steps or leave out ingredients, you\u2019ll almost certainly fail.Here is a visual timeline of the country\u2019s violent and chaotic insurrection.Turkey\u2019s plotters didn\u2019t follow the recipe.Successful coups tend to be waged as \u201ccoordination games,\u201d Naunihal Singh, a professor at the Air War College, wrote in the book \u201cSeizing Power,\u201d which examines why coups succeed or fail.Coups work, according to this theory, when leaders convince other officers and soldiers that their success is already assured. That makes joining an act of perceived self-interest.Plotters usually accomplish this with a predictable set of steps. A huge show of force demonstrates that the weight of the military is behind the coup. A public statement by one or more high-level public officials shows that there is elite support. And the plotters usually establish tight control over the media and the flow of public information, quashing any broadcasts that would undermine the sense of inevitable and unchallenged success.Successful coups in countries like Turkey, which have strong military and political institutions, typically follow an \u201cinstitutional coup\u201d model, according to Brian Klaas, a fellow at the London School of Economics.In an institutional coup, the military is unified behind the takeover and uses its full power to force top-down control over the government \u2014 as senior Turkish military leaders did in 1980. In that scenario, the coordination game is fairly simple. All of the coordination by the military elite happens before the coup even begins \u2014 and then other elites have little choice but to fall in line.When the uprising represents only a faction of officers, Mr. Klaas said, the confidence game can also require quickly seizing top leaders and persuading or forcing a senior officer to publicly declare the coup\u2019s victory, creating an appearance of success before anyone figures out what happened.This time, Turkey\u2019s dissident officers tried to take only some of these steps, and succeeded in none of them.Rebels deployed tanks and air power in a show of force in Istanbul and Ankara, but this was not enough to intimidate the rest of the military, which eventually overcame them. Most notably, there was no public face of the coup to demonstrate elite support or issue a clear plan.The insurrectionists also tried but failed to control communication with the public. President Erdogan was able to use the FaceTime smartphone app to call a TV station, a bizarre scenario that risked the appearance of weakness but also sapped plotters\u2019 momentum and allowed him to call for the public to flood the streets in opposition.Turkish internet and cellphone service remained in operation. This allowed the government to communicate on social media and helped news of pro-government protests spread, undermining the coup\u2019s sense of inevitability.Those protests \u2014 and the absence of visible pro-coup crowds \u2014 may have also been key to thwarting the plot. Successful coups will often exploit or even coordinate with pre-existing movements, using this show of popular support to rally elites.This weekend\u2019s coup leaders appeared to lack any allies. No civil society groups or political parties issued statements in support of the insurrection, and no elites appeared to take action on its behalf.That hindsight makes the coup seem so doomed only underscores some questions. It is still unclear what prompted the attempt, who led it, and why they believed they had enough chance at success to risk their lives.If history is any guide, the most straightforward explanation is simply poor planning and ineptitude.Advertisement"}

He noted that Britain\u2019s banks were much better capitalized than they were during the financial crisis and the bank had 250 billion pounds, or about $335 billion, available as a backstop to keep the market functioning.He also shrugged off a suggestion by a reporter that he might be forced to resign after a new prime minister was chosen.Some members of the campaign that backed a British exit from the European Union have accused Mr. Carney of politicizing the central bank before the referendum. The bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said that the risks associated with the referendum were \u201cthe most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability.\u201d\u201cWhat we said in terms of the risk to the economic outlook, in terms of the risk to financial stability, does anyone in this room not think those risks have begun to manifest?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes anyone in the country think those risks have not begun to manifest?

{"Headline": "Stretch of Market Volatility Makes It Stormy at the Top", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byThe stock market at midyear hovered around a record high. But after several disturbing weeks in which prices soared, then plunged, then soared again, the view from the summit, or near it, may not be so pleasant.Stock fund owners escaped the second quarter with modest gains, but the extreme volatility leaves them to contemplate fresh uncertainties in the final half of 2016.Share prices were advancing steadily until British voters decided in a referendum on June 23 to leave the European Union. Although polls showed a close race throughout the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign, the result came as a shock \u2014 one that evidently wore off quickly, as stocks fell precipitously but then recovered nearly all of the Brexit losses in the final days of the month.The British vote overshadowed a far less surprising decision earlier in June by the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates. Explaining the Fed\u2019s thinking to a Senate committee, Janet L. Yellen, the central bank\u2019s chairwoman, highlighted \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about the economy.Whatever uncertainties investors faced, in whatever corner of the world, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended June at 2,098.86, up 1.9 percent for the quarter.The post-Brexit bounce \u2014 after the post-Brexit swoon \u2014 helped to produce a 2.5 percent return for domestic stock funds in the quarter, according to Morningstar. The average international stock fund rose 1.4 percent, but portfolios in Europe lost 3.4 percent.Even if the British referendum had gone the other way, American stocks might have been vulnerable to a decline, albeit not necessarily all at once, and after their rebound, they may be vulnerable to one again. The S.&P. 500 ended the quarter trading at 19 times the earnings that component companies reported in the previous four quarters, compared with a historical average of about 15.Not only are valuations high, but earnings growth is low and expectations are falling. Analysts estimated earnings of $118.79 for the 2016 S.&P. 500 at the end of June, according to FactSet Research, a figure that has declined in each of the last six quarters.The conundrum that investors face heading into the second half is that alternative destinations for their money aren\u2019t cheap, either. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for instance, declined in the second quarter to 1.4 percent from 1.78 percent. That helped the average long-term government bond fund gain 6.5 percent, and bond funds in general rose 2.6 percent.Some niches within the markets \u2014 stocks of companies in one industry or region, bonds from certain types of issuers \u2014 may offer adequate return prospects at acceptable risk, investment advisers say. But they warn that gains are likely to be meager at best in broad asset classes. Few options are good; some may be good enough.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find real pockets of value in the financial markets today,\u201d said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. \u201cI don\u2019t see much where you can say, \u2018Aha! This is a great opportunity.\u2019\u201dNeither does Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates. He blames the Fed and its peers for much of the situation.\u201cThe mainstream markets that most people rely on are generally pretty expensive, with anemic yields,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks deserve most of the credit for that, basically blowing bubbles all over the world.\u201dBut not everywhere.\u201cIf you look outside the mainstream markets, you see some bargains,\u201d Mr. Arnott said. \u201cThe lowest-hanging fruit is emerging-market stocks. They\u2019ve been in a brutal five-year bear market.\u201dIn contrast to American stocks, indexes of emerging markets are trading at less than 10 times earnings. Emerging-market bonds are similarly cheap, in his view, with yields at a greater premium to those on Treasury debt than at any time since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis and Russian debt default.\u201cWhen you see spreads this wide, it makes sense to put a large toe in the water,\u201d he said.Traders displayed no such circumspection when it came to British and Continental European stocks and currencies after the Brexit referendum. They took stock indexes down nearly 10 percent in just a few hours and sold the euro and especially the pound, which fell more than 10 percent, to its lowest level since 1985, and failed to recover with stocks.Comments from global banks after the referendum were mixed. Deutsche Bank called the result \u201ca sign of Europe\u2019s increasing fragility\u201d and warned that \u201cthis outcome points to greater risks.\u201d The S.&P. 500 could fall to 1,950, Deutsche said, and banks and companies with high European sales are particularly vulnerable.UBS Wealth Management advised staying the course, treacherous though it may be.\u201cGiven considerable uncertainties, we would encourage investors not to sell down risk assets in a time of heightened market volatility and lower-than-average liquidity,\u201d the bank said in a note to clients. \u201cWe are confident in the prospects for positive returns for U.S. equities.\u201dFocusing on the outlook for emerging markets, HSBC said there probably would not be much direct impact on business. The bank cautioned, however, that \u201cthe U.K.\u2019s referendum decision to leave the E.U. means we are entering an uncertain world and there will likely be pressure on emerging-market financial assets based on immediate risk aversion.\u201dJeremy Richardson, a manager of stock portfolios for RBC Global Asset Management, said that the world was plenty uncertain before June 23 rolled round.\u201cA big question that hangs over all of us is, How do we move on from this world of low, even negative, interest rates that we find ourselves in?\u201d he said. \u201cCentral banks are running out of policy tools; that creates a level of uncertainty. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why equity markets have not been more robust.\u201dMr. Richardson recommends avoiding long-term bonds or the stocks of companies that investors may view as proxies for them for their stable trading patterns. Their popularity has made them expensive, just like bonds, he warned.He prefers stocks of \u201cbusinesses that do things a little differently,\u201d including discount clothing retailers and the carmaker Tesla. He also likes companies involved in cloud computing and so-called big data, as well as immunotherapy, or the development of cancer treatments that enhance immune system responses to tumors.\u201cPeople spend so much time on what Janet Yellen is going to say next or the price of copper and tin\u201d instead of focusing on individual companies, Mr. Richardson said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just talking about the market, you\u2019re missing a big part of the story.\u201dBut central banks remain a big part of the story, too. However the Fed and its peers might go about extricating themselves from nearly a decade of extraordinary monetary policy, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, wishes they would just get on with it.\u201cWe have uninterrupted growth with full employment,\u201d he said. It\u2019s no longer appropriate, he said, \u201cto employ crisislike policies when the crisis is long past in the U.S.\u201dThough he considers the economic backdrop benign, Mr. Paulsen acknowledges that valuations are quite high, so he envisions \u201cmidsingle-digit buy-and-hold returns\u201d and expects the S.&P. 500 to trade between 1,800 and 2,200 in the second half.He favors sectors like financial services, industrials and materials and would avoid consumer sectors, where prices have been bid up. Foreign markets may do better than the United States, in his view, because they are less further along in the upward slope of their economic cycles.Other niches that Mr. Paulsen would consider include market-neutral and other alternative funds, which try to achieve modest returns with minimal risk, and real estate and commodity funds, in case the Fed loses control and inflation begins to stir.Ms. Patterson at Bessemer cautioned that all manner of developments, from terrorism to slowing growth in China, could cause turmoil in the markets this year, and she reminded investors that the Brexit referendum wasn\u2019t the only vote that must be factored into asset prices. She expects some companies to hold off on hiring and investment decisions as the presidential election draws closer.\u201cEven with a benign outcome\u201d to the various sources of uncertainty, she said, \u201cgiven valuations and the outlook for profits, being neutral in equities makes sense.\u201dAmong the few assets she prefers in the present climate are high-quality corporate bonds and shares of global companies that tend to trade with less volatility than the overall market, as long as they are also reasonably priced.If such slim pickings and the prospect of slim returns leave investors feeling disappointed, Mr. Paulsen has a simple piece of advice: Get over it.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at the world you live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much available anywhere.\u201d Trying to make the best of a mediocre situation, he added: \u201cThe best of this bull market is long past, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Sue Puerto Rico\u2019s Governor, Claiming Money Grab", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byA group of hedge funds sued the governor of Puerto Rico on Wednesday, saying he had started violating the island\u2019s hard-won new debt-restructuring law before the ink from President Obama\u2019s pen was even dry.The law, which the president signed on June 30, puts Puerto Rico under the watch of a federal oversight board to police its spending and promote fiscal reform. But the law has a built-in lag of at least two months before the federal board will be in place.In the meantime, the hedge funds said Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla was exploiting the lag by grabbing hundreds of millions of public dollars and spending them on \u201cpurposes that apparently enjoy political favor.\u201dThey said the outlays would have been challenged if the oversight board had already been in place, and that holders of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds had first rights to the money. They asked the court to declare the payments invalid and freeze the money until the oversight board was operational and able to confirm the payments\u2019 propriety.The hedge funds filing the lawsuit included Monarch Alternative Capital, Stone Lion Capital Partners, Aurelius Capital Management, Autonomy Capital (Jersey), Covalent Capital Partners and Fundamental Credit Opportunities, among others.The complaint was filed in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, in San Juan. It also named as defendants Juan Zaragoza G\u00f3mez, Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of the Treasury, and Luis Cruz Batista, the director of its Office of Management and Budget.The lawsuit is likely to harden public opinion on the island, where some people already see the federal oversight board, known as the junta, as an unacceptable display of Yankee imperialism. The word \u201cjunta\u201d means \u201cboard\u201d in Spanish, without dictatorial connotations, but with federal oversight now on the horizon, it has been appearing on anti-junta banners and graffiti.One of the biggest government outlays cited in the lawsuit was $800 million that was transferred to Puerto Rico\u2019s pension system for public employees. An additional $250 million was apparently used to prop up the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, which was declared insolvent last year. In normal times, the bank is a major player in the island\u2019s economy, managing the government\u2019s cash, structuring its debts and making loans to selected private businesses, among other duties.The lawsuit also claimed that $2.5 million had been improperly used to cover a year\u2019s worth of spending by the Office of the First Lady, and an additional $1.2 million went for \u201cdevelopment of high-performance Puerto Rican athletes.\u201d And some $800 million was headed for the University of Puerto Rico, the lawsuit said, \u201cto maintain artificially low tuition rates, well below what comparable state universities in fiscally balanced states charge.\u201dThe complaint did not list all the expenditures it wished to challenge, but it said that many others were being made \u201cfor purposes that cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as \u2018essential.\u2019\u201dThe governor\u2019s chief of staff, Grace Santana, said more lawsuits were expected in the coming days, and the administration would fight them aggressively.\u201cTo be clear, creditors suing the commonwealth will not receive special treatment or secure additional leverage,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSuch litigation is pointless and counterproductive. It poses an obstacle to the orderly restructuring of government debts, and only serves to strain resources that might otherwise be devoted to a voluntary resolution.\u201dMs. Santana did not address the hedge funds\u2019 complaints about recent expenditures.For more than a year, Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla has been warning that Puerto Rico does not have enough money both to pay its debts and to provide essential public services, like policing and public education. He said that when the cash ran out and he had to make a choice, he would choose essential services.The lawsuit said that existing laws in Puerto Rico ranked governmental expenditures in terms of priority, and projects like developing high-performance athletes were nowhere near the top.Neither are pensions, for that matter. By law they are a safe, secured credit only to the extent that they have been funded, and the billions that are supposed to be sitting safely in the pension fund appear to have been spent on other things. If so, Puerto Rico\u2019s law seems to leave retirees in the vulnerable position of being unsecured creditors.The hedge funds that filed the complaint, by contrast, are all holders of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bonds, a type of debt that the island\u2019s Constitution puts at the top of the hierarchy, saying in effect that holders of this type of debt have first claim on \u201call available resources of the commonwealth.\u201dOn July 1, Puerto Rico was scheduled to make debt payments of about $2 billion, of which some $816 million was due to holders of general-obligation bonds.But late in the day on June 30, shortly after President Obama signed the new restructuring law, Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla invoked a Puerto Rican law giving him the power to call a debt moratorium. The creditors did not get their money.The hedge funds say the governor had no legal standing to declare the moratorium, because the new federal law overrides the Puerto Rican law. Their lawsuit does not seek to make Puerto Rico come through with the $816 million now, however. That would be a steep uphill fight, because the new federal restructuring law also bars creditors from suing to enforce their claims.The purpose is to give Puerto Rico some breathing room, much the way the bankruptcy code gives struggling companies shelter from their creditors. Lawmakers and the Obama administration raced to enact the restructuring law before July 1, saying that otherwise Puerto Rico could be hit by a hail of creditor lawsuits that could take years to sort out.Potential creditor lawsuits were stayed as of July 1, but because the oversight board will not be impaneled until September, Congress also included a provision barring \u201cthe transfer of any funds or assets outside the ordinary course of business, or that are inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the territory\u201d in the meantime.The lawsuit asked the court to declare Puerto Rico in violation of this provision.Puerto Rico needed a special restructuring law because all branches of its government are specifically prohibited from seeking relief through bankruptcy.Lawyers for the island had argued all the way to the United States Supreme Court that this exclusion was wrong and unfair, but their arguments did not prevail. So rather than amend the existing bankruptcy laws to admit Puerto Rico, Congress enacted a separate law, similar to bankruptcy, under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution. Other territories will be able to use the law in the future, if they ever find themselves struggling with debts they cannot pay.The new law, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, is known by the acronym Promesa \u2014 \u201cpromise\u201d in Spanish. It gives Puerto Rico the power to unilaterally abrogate debt, something normally available only in bankruptcy. In exchange for such extraordinary powers, Promesa requires the island to submit to federal oversight by a seven-member board. A majority of the board\u2019s members are expected to be Republicans, reflecting that party\u2019s control of both houses of Congress.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Wrinkle in the Gig Economy: Workers Get Most of the Money", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe most distinguishing feature, however, may be the structure of the site\u2019s owner, Stocksy United: It is a cooperative, owned and governed by the photographers who contribute their work. Every Stocksy photographer owns a share of the company, with voting rights. And most of the money from sales of their work goes into their pockets rather than toward the billion-dollar valuations pursued by many venture-backed start-ups.Stocksy was founded in 2013 by Bruce Livingstone and Brianna Wettlaufer, the core team behind iStockphoto, which in 2000 pioneered the idea of selling stock photos online in exchange for small fees. (Mr. Livingstone was the founder and Ms. Wettlaufer, the vice president of development and employee No. 4). IStock \u2014 which billed itself as \u201cby creatives, for creatives\u201d \u2014 caught the attention of Getty Images, which acquired it in 2006 for $50 million.Mr. Livingstone and Ms. Wettlaufer grew dismayed as the community spirit they had cultivated and the royalties photographers received began to erode under the new ownership. Like many artists in the digital age, their photographer friends grumbled that they were being underpaid and exploited by online sites.\u201cEveryone had the same story,\u201d Ms. Wettlaufer said. \u201cThey were feeling disenfranchised. They weren\u2019t creatively inspired anymore. The magic was gone.\u201dSo using money from the sale of iStock to Getty, she and Mr. Livingstone set out to create Stocksy, paying photographers 50 to 75 percent of sales. That is well above the going rate of 15 to 45 percent that is typical in the stock photography field. The company also distributes 90 percent of its profit at the end of each year among its photographers.\u201cWe realized we could do it differently this time,\u201d said Ms. Wettlaufer, who took over the chief executive role in 2014. \u201cWe could enter the market with a model that ensured artists were treated fairly and ethically.\u201dStocksy is part of a new wave of start-ups that are borrowing the tools of Silicon Valley to create a more genuine \u201csharing\u201d economy that rewards the individuals generating the value.In just a few years, Stocksy has grown to 900 photographer-members, carefully selected from more than 10,000 applications. It has 20 full-time employees at its headquarters in Victoria, British Columbia, and another five contractors who work remotely.\u201cThe stock photography industry has become much more competitive, and many photographers are definitely struggling due to the current price war for images,\u201d he said.He said he found the Stocky site easy to upload photos, create a portfolio page and track his sales. And he likes the fact that any member of the cooperative can submit an idea for discussion or to be put to a vote.When Ms. Wettlaufer and Mr. Livingstone set out to create Stocksy, they considered making it a nonprofit organization, but decided to form a digital cooperative (\u201cThink more artist respect and support, less patchouli,\u201d reads the website).Stocksy is what\u2019s known as a multi-stakeholder cooperative, with three classes of shares: one for executives, one for staff and a third class for photographers. There is no fee to join or annual dues; members pay just $1 for their share of stock. That collaborative approach has helped the upstart thrive in a crowded and competitive market.Stocksy\u2019s customers include major media names, such as the magazines Glamour and Elle, as well as start-ups and small businesses.Vanessa Bruce said she was mesmerized when she came across an ad for Stocksy while flipping through a magazine. The images were \u201cclean but quirky,\u201d said Ms. Bruce, who was then a brand manager for ReferralMob, a job referral site. She licensed several Stocksy photos, including one of a dog and a dinosaur that inspired language for a ReferralMob ad: \u201cMatch your friends with unique opportunities,\u201d the ad read.That Stocksy was owned by photographers was even more satisfying. \u201cThat made us love them even more,\u201d said Ms. Bruce, who is now a co-founder of a marketing and branding agency called Six Things.Stocksy\u2019s revenue doubled last year to $7.9 million. More than half, $4.3 million, was paid out in royalties. After that and other operational costs, Stocksy last year generated its first \u201csurplus revenue,\u201d or what is akin to profit at co-ops. This allowed it to pay a dividend to members for the first time, totaling $200,000.Stocksy\u2019s success may be a model for other digital cooperatives taking on behemoths in other industries. In San Francisco, Loconomics has started an online cooperative for professional services, from massage to graphic design, comparable to TaskRabbit.Others are developing profit-sharing platforms for filmmakers, domestic workers, taxi drivers and musicians.Some business models are involving workers more but forgoing the co-op route. Juno, a new on-demand car service app being tested in New York, plans to take a smaller cut of the fares and will set aside half of its founding shares for its drivers.These smaller upstarts, however, face an uphill battle against heavily funded and entrenched competitors that have benefited from a self-enforcing \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d A large user base gives companies like Uber more prominence, and thus more visibility. The cooperatives also don\u2019t have the billions in venture capital backing them.\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can ever outspend those giant companies,\u201d Ms. Wettlaufer acknowledged.But some consumers, workers and regulators are starting to push back against what they see as abuses in the sharing economy. Various lawsuits and proposed laws are aimed at protecting workers, and the descriptions of users\u2019 negative experiences that have become widely publicized have hurt the image of the once-vaunted technology unicorns.Even iStock\u2019s new owner, Getty Images, has struggled under $2.6 billion in debt that it was saddled with after it was acquired in 2012 by the private equity firm Carlyle Group.There is room for cooperatives to flourish alongside big competitors, some in the industry say. Craig Shapiro, founder and managing partner at Collaborative Fund, a venture firm based in New York, has backed highflying on-demand platforms including TaskRabbit and Lyft. But he said he saw the selling point of co-ops.\u201cAs a shareholder in some of these businesses, I am hopeful that they\u2019ll all be successful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut models that reward the members who are generating value will ultimately win.\u201dAgainst this backdrop, Stocksy\u2019s leaders see opportunity to grow. The company plans to add another 100 photographers by the end of the year and expand into video. It hopes that having quality photographers who are part owners will help it stand apart from the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s loving what we do,\u201d Ms. Wettlaufer said.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a Stocksy United co-founder. He is Bruce Livingstone, not Brian. The article also referred imprecisely to the relationship between Mr. Livingstone and Brianna Wettlaufer, the other co-founder.

{"Headline": "An Exodus in Our Own Backyard", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe United States often faces global crises that force it to balance incompatible interests. But there is one test, close to home, whose answers are straightforward.It involves people who have fled the threat of death in Central America and arrived, traumatized and defenseless, at the American border.The administration gives reasons for cracking down: to make a point about the finality of a deportation order, to deter others from attempting the dangerous trip. But these justifications pale against the scale of the emergency in the Northern Triangle.Mercy is in short supply as the presidential race stokes fear of foreigners and terrorists. The administration\u2019s inaction is not for lack of knowing what to do. Senate Democrats introduced a wide-ranging bill last week to attack the Northern Triangle problem at its roots and to help ensure justice and safety for migrants. It would press Central American governments to restore the rule of law, strengthen institutions and build the economy. It would crack down on smuggling networks, expand refugee resettlement in Mexico and elsewhere, add immigration judges and help provide security, health and education for refugee children in the United States.In a Congress where Democratic initiatives struggle to get heard, the bill\u2019s odds are slim. That leaves it up to Mr. Obama and Mr. Johnson, who will need to do more. On World Refugee Day, June 20, in a naturalization ceremony in Central Park, Mr. Johnson gave the citizenship oath to 19 new Americans who had fled Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. He shook their hands and smiled for photos. He did not mention the Northern Triangle.Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation through executive action was rebuffed last month by the Supreme Court. He will thus end his presidency with a dismally lopsided legacy on immigration: one program protecting 730,000 young people that has been left stranded by the failure of immigration reform, balanced against a record 2.4 million deportations. It\u2019s too late to change this equation, but in the time left to him, he can try to restore credibility to the claim that the United States is still a beacon of hope by not sending homeless outcasts back into war and violence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In D.N.C. Hack, Echoes of Russia\u2019s New Approach to Power", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThe Arab Spring, according to General Gerasimov, had shown that \u201cnonmilitary means\u201d had overtaken the \"force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d Deception and disinformation, not tanks and planes, were the new tools of power. And they would be used not in formally declared conflicts but within a vast gray between peace and war.Those ideas would appear, the next year, in Russia\u2019s formal military doctrine. It was the culmination of a yearslong strategic reorientation that has remade Russian power, in response to threats both real and imagined, into the sort of enterprise that could be plausibly accused of using cyberattacks to meddle in an American presidential election.Like so many military rethinks, what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine began as an effort to solve a seemingly urgent problem.Throughout the 2000s, popular uprisings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia overturned their pro-Kremlin leaders, replacing them with democratically elected governments more inclined to the West.In Moscow, these \u201ccolor revolutions,\u201d as well as the subsequent Arab Spring, were seen as a wave of hostile American operations, engineered to topple Russia\u2019s allies and weaken Russia itself.The Kremlin felt encircled and threatened by what it took to be a vast American conspiracy whose ultimate goal, it concluded, was the subjugation or outright destruction of the Russian state.\u201cOnce they\u2019ve taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cThe issue is that we are protecting our sovereignty and our right to exist.\u201dRussian military planners, apparently obsessed with such fears, concluded that their best defense would be to go on the offense. Believing that the Americans were already conducting a clandestine war through intelligence operations, media disinformation, and deniable proxy forces, they set out to do the same.The phrase \u201chybrid war\u201d \u2014 a common label in the West for Russia\u2019s actions \u2014 was first used by Russian analysts to describe the supposed American tactics they believed they were countering. They called their own strategy something different: \u201cnew generation war.\u201dEven before this doctrine became formalized, Russia had developed tools of coercion and subterfuge, providing a model for wider usage.As Russian power has resurged under Mr. Putin, the country has often used asymmetrical methods to assert its interests, particularly in the former Soviet republics it still considers its \u201cnear abroad\u201d and rightful zone of influence.At no point, in the 2007 episode, did Russia commit an act of military aggression against its neighbor. Yet Estonian leaders say these actions were meant as a message: Even if their country had joined NATO and the European Union, Moscow was still the boss.These sorts of tools allowed Russia to project power beyond its strength and, just as importantly, to assert its interests abroad despite Western military and political dominance.To paraphrase Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia\u2019s military, this is a country whose economy is smaller than Canada\u2019s or South Korea\u2019s, yet is seeking a great power role akin to China or the United States. Traditional methods won\u2019t cut it.Russia deployed its \"new generation war\u201d to startling effect in early 2014, when, amid Ukraine\u2019s political crisis, it seized and subsequently annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea.While that action is most remembered for the \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2014 unmarked Russian special forces who seized key locations in a clandestine invasion \u2014 there were subtler components as well.This information war, he wrote, \u201ccomprises both technological and psychological components designed to manipulate the adversary\u2019s picture of reality, misinform it and eventually interfere with the decision-making process of individuals, organizations, governments and societies.\u201dWhile this was especially visible in Crimea, Mr. Adamsky warned that it was also deployed in peacetime and against any target where Moscow seeks influence. It may be intended to pursue a \u201cstrategic goal,\u201d such as the weakening of pro-American political parties in Europe, or to simply foment a degree of instability that weakens adversaries.Mr. Adamsky described this as a form of \u201csubversion\u201d that \u201caims to deceive the victim, discredit the leadership, and disorient and demoralize the population and the armed forces.\u201dThat sheds light on why Russia might want to release Democratic National Committee emails, whose greatest effect is creating a kerfuffle within Democratic politics. It\u2019s not as if the resignation of the party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was some strategic Russian ambition.While some observers say Moscow sees a potential friend in Donald J. Trump, it would also be well within Russian strategy to stir up trouble just to stir up trouble. This is what Mr. Adamsky calls \u201cmanaged stability-instability\u201d \u2014 low-level confusion and disunity that Russia could perhaps one day exploit.In this view, Kremlin leaders could see releasing internal Democratic emails as a tit-for-tat retaliation in the information struggle. Such a thing would make little sense in the Western conception of geopolitics. But as Mr. Adamsky wrote in his 2015 study, Americans have long tried to conceptualize Russian strategy within Western ways of thinking, when it is anything but.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viking Ship Sailing the Great Lakes Is Getting Conquered by U.S. Regulations", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byWhen a Viking ship, meticulously recreated in Norway, crossed the Atlantic last month, the feat captivated history buffs in the United States. They could hardly wait to get a look at the vessel, which was scheduled to visit a series of ship festivals along the Great Lakes this summer.After making stops at Canadian ports, the Draken\u2019s crew was told by Coast Guard officials last week that if it wanted to sail through the Great Lakes, it had to hire a certified pilot, paid at an hourly rate that would amount to about $400,000 by the trip\u2019s end. If unable to pay, the vessel would be forced to turn back.\u201cThe crew has been devastated,\u201d Woody Wiest, a watch leader on the Draken, said at the time. Many of the team are volunteers, he added. \u201cThey changed their lives to be on the ship.\u201d\u201cThe struggle is not yet over,\u201d a statement from the ship said.Lorne Thomas, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said the agency was bound by a 1960 law requiring that all foreign vessels, except for recreational ones, have a pilot while on the Great Lakes. It couldn\u2019t grant a waiver even it wanted to, he said.\u201cUnfortunately the law is what it is,\u201d Mr. Thomas added. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there couldn\u2019t be a discussion about maybe it could be changed. But that needs to happen at the congressional level.\u201dRepresentatives of the Draken have portrayed their troubles as a result of an impenetrable maze of regulations on the Great Lakes, which straddle the border between the United States and Canada, while also sharply criticizing the cost that vessels of its kind \u2014 small and nonprofit \u2014 must bear to ply its waters.Representatives of the Draken \u201care just making a lot of things up,\u201d Mr. Lemire added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing and how to deliver the message. So it was quite a surprise.\u201dThe binational management of the lakes can be confusing for foreign visitors. Asked to explain whose rules apply where, John Swartout, the president of the Western Great Lakes Pilot Association, talked about shared boundaries, \u201cgray areas\u201d and rules that vary by district.Finally, he said: \u201cI wish I knew how to cut and dry it for you perfectly, but it is complicated.\u201cI fully appreciate how hard it can be to understand whether U.S. law or Canadian law applies,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd frankly I think the authorities struggle with that same issue because the law is not perfectly clear on that subject.\u201dThe Draken\u2019s ordeal has also drawn attention to questions about the costs of pilotage, an ancient profession that exists around the world to ensure safe steering in unfamiliar waters.Maritime officials, however, say the fees are commensurate with the skill and scarcity of qualified pilots. Mr. Lemire, the Canadian official, noted that the pilots were among the most highly trained mariners in the world. Until this year, the targeted annual pay for Great Lakes pilots was about $235,000, far below what they could earn elsewhere, Mr. Lemire said.\u201cIt was impossible to recruit people,\u201d he said.Still, officials acknowledge that the costs can be onerous for smaller, historical ships like the Draken that don\u2019t possess the resources of the big freighter companies plying the Great Lakes, where the maritime industry is estimated to pump more $30 billion yearly into the American and Canadian economies.And unlike in Canada, the American regulations offer no exemption based on tonnage or size, said Mr. Thomas, the Coast Guard spokesman.\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful to everybody that reaches out to us,\u201d Ms. Blank said on Wednesday as the Draken was making its way toward Chicago. \u201cWe knew the people were interested and engaged in our project, but not to this extent.\u201dMs. Blank said the Draken was not against the pilots. But, she added, \u201cA project of our nature is not able to pay these sorts of costs. The fees are so huge. We really want to sail, and we really want to meet the people of the Great Lakes, and unfortunately we are not able to.\u201dIn April, just before leaving for North America, the crew held a ceremony during which a carving of a dragon\u2019s head meant protect the ship from dangers like sea monsters and unforeseen raids was mounted on the Draken. Luckily, the vessel encountered no sea monsters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michel Rocard, Former Prime Minister of France, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Michel Rocard, a former French prime minister who embodied a pragmatic, market-friendly element in the Socialist Party, but whose reformist zeal encountered powerful countercurrents on the left, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 85.His death, after a long illness, was announced by the French government, which did not provide the cause.Mr. Rocard served only three years as prime minister, from 1988 to 1991, but his lasting influence on the Socialists outstripped his brief tenure and relatively modest accomplishments in office.The two men identified as the leading reformers in the current Socialist government, Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, both locked in struggle with the party\u2019s left, count themselves as Mr. Rocard\u2019s disciples. Mr. Valls worked for Mr. Rocard when he was prime minister.But Mr. Mitterrand was in some ways forced to appoint Mr. Rocard as prime minister in the spring of 1988: The younger man was among the most popular political figures in France. His signature accomplishment in office was the creation of a guaranteed minimum income for France\u2019s poorest, known as the R.M.I., a measure widely credited with keeping inequality in the country at a relatively low level.Short, trenchant, raspy-voiced, constantly puffing on harsh Gauloises cigarettes, Mr. Rocard was considered a rare intellectual in French politics, a voracious reader at home with ideas, but with a keen sense of the practical.That desire brought Mr. Rocard up against powerful countercurrents in the French Socialist Party. Until his death, he made statements that went against Socialist orthodoxy, condemning a party that had failed to reform itself.\u201cOur social system kills the goose that lays the golden eggs,\u201d Mr. Rocard told the newsmagazine Le Point in an extensive interview two weeks ago. \u201cAs many start-ups are born every year in France as in Germany, except that they die in the first five years because of taxes and the excessive weight of bureaucracy.\u201d\u201cOther countries got rid of Marxism,\u201d Mr. Rocard continued. \u201cNot France. While everywhere else reformist social democracy emerged, converted to a market economy that was regulated to limit unemployment and inequality, the French Left stands alone.\u201dHe attended the Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration, the elite school that trains most of France\u2019s top politicians. He entered the bureaucracy as a high-level economic functionary, was active in the small socialist groups that preceded the modern Socialist Party and opposed the Algerian war. The enmity between him and Mr. Mitterrand was born in this period, he was later to say, when he called Mr. Mitterrand, then the justice minister, a murderer for his harsh role in dealing with the Algerian war of independence.Mr. Rocard ran for president in 1969 but received few votes, joined Mr. Mitterrand\u2019s newly formed Socialists in 1974 and was shunted off to the Agriculture Ministry in the new Socialist president\u2019s government in 1983.His tenure as prime minister was typically stormy, buffeted by strikes, demonstrations and never-ending demands for government funds by France\u2019s various groups \u2014 the police, postal and transport workers, nurses, and others.Mr. Mitterrand could not wait to get rid of him, and in 1991 he named a loyal aide, \u00c9dith Cresson, to replace him, effectively ending Mr. Rocard\u2019s political career.Mr. Rocard later said of Mr. Mitterrand, \u201cThe profound contempt I have for his lack of ethics corresponds to my total admiration for his tactical skill.\u201dMr. Rocard\u2019s death left a \u201cfrustration,\u201d Le Monde wrote Monday: \u201cthe frustration of realizing that the qualities recognized in Michel Rocard \u2014 a demand for morality in politics, an unshakable engagement for his ideas, an inexhaustible openness \u2014 seem so lacking today.\u201dA national tribute will be held on Thursday at Les Invalides, an honor reserved for the country\u2019s top statesmen.He is survived by his third wife, Sylvie P\u00e9lissier, and four children, Sylvie, Francis, Olivier and Lo\u00efc.An obituary on Tuesday about Michel Rocard, a former prime minister of France, misstated the year he joined Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s newly formed Socialist Party.

{"Headline": "Ignoring Donald Trump, Republican Senators Orbit Their Own Worlds", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Senator Rob Portman of Ohio plans a very busy convention week as Republicans pour into his home state beginning Monday.One place he will not speak, having addressed the past six Republican conventions, is inside Quicken Loans Arena, where Donald J. Trump will accept the nomination of the most divided national party of modern times.Mr. Portman once looked forward to a convention in Cleveland that would turbocharge his re-election campaign. Now he joins other swing-state Republican senators who are shying away from the party gathering. They will be busily campaigning at home, running local races as if for sheriff, offering a split-screen view of a party that fears its Senate majority will be the collateral damage of a polarizing nominee.The convention avoiders include four of seven senators on the ballot in states President Obama won twice. (Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa has said he plans a \u201cfast in, fast out\u201d visit. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, after saying for weeks he would stay home, reversed course on Sunday and said he would make a one-day convention visit to speak about Islamic terrorism.)Their strategy is to focus on home-state issues that in voters\u2019 minds place them as far as possible from Mr. Trump.\u201cLocalize, localize, localize,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, offering the mantra of endangered Senate incumbents on the ballot with Mr. Trump.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, also skipping the convention, is visiting 13 counties in his state, where he has attacked Philadelphia\u2019s liberal mayor for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.During the convention, Mr. Rubio will campaign in Florida, in Fort Myers, Orlando, Tampa and elsewhere.Democrats have no intention of letting Republicans escape from the penumbra of Mr. Trump. Mr. Toomey\u2019s opponent, Katie McGinty, bashed the \u201cTrump-Toomey ticket\u201d on Saturday. Mr. Portman\u2019s Ohio opponent, Ted Strickland, is sending eight supporters dressed as Supreme Court justices to heckle Mr. Portman\u2019s event on Monday.\u201cThey will highlight how Portman will help Trump reshape the court for generations,\u201d said David Bergstein, a spokesman for Mr. Strickland.\u201cTrump is a total nightmare for Rob Portman,\u201d said Rebecca Pearcey, Mr. Strickland\u2019s campaign manager.In fact, most down-ballot Republicans cannot afford to completely distance themselves from Mr. Trump. They will need his supporters in the fall, while also attracting independents and Republicans who say they will abstain from voting for either major party\u2019s presidential nominee.Some senators have tried to split hairs, like Ms. Ayotte, who says she \u201csupports\u201d Mr. Trump as the party\u2019s nominee but does not \u201cendorse\u201d him.Only Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republican senators this year, running in a heavily Democratic state, has disavowed Mr. Trump, calling him \u201ctoo bigoted and racist\u201d to be president.Mr. Portman, long a favorite of the Republican establishment, said in an interview that he would vote for Mr. Trump, but was not sure that he would find time to campaign with him in Ohio.Mr. Trump\u2019s divisiveness could bring back ticket splitting, Republican strategists said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see hints of the largest amounts of split-ticket voting since the 1980s,\u201d Mr. Ayres said.Recent polls in swing states show Republican senators with more favorable margins against their Democratic challengers than those separating Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. The early polling suggests some voters who do not support the Republican presidential nominee back the party\u2019s senators.\u201cThere was a two-week stint in March where the differences between the two were very well litigated,\u201d said Alex Conant, an adviser to Mr. Rubio. \u201cVoters know he\u2019s not Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Portman has visited a dozen drug treatment centers in the past month. \u201cPeople are seeing, O.K., this is a little different kind of Republican,\u201d he said in his campaign R.V. recently as it rumbled between Dayton and Toledo.He was one of four Senate authors of a bipartisan opioid treatment bill, one of Congress\u2019s few accomplishments this year, which last week moved to President Obama\u2019s desk.Mr. Portman, a mild-mannered Washington insider who defied his party by embracing same-sex marriage in 2013 after learning that one of his sons was gay, sighed when asked if Mr. Trump had the right temperament to be president. \u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean my temperament is right for the presidency, or his is wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat the Trump campaign is going to do is shine a spotlight on Portman\u2019s trade record that\u2019s not going to work with Ohio voters,\u201d said Ms. Pearcey, the campaign manager for Mr. Strickland.Mr. Portman said he agreed with Mr. Trump about cracking down on China for dumping steel. But he strongly defended the economic benefit of free-trade deals to Ohio\u2019s economy. \u201cWe have 25 percent of our factory workers\u201d making goods for export, he said. If tariffs are erected in a trade war, as many experts believe Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would spur, \u201cfarmers would see their prices totally crater,\u201d Mr. Portman said.\u201cI think he\u2019s just wrong,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obamacare\u2019s Kindest Critic", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialSix years ago, 16 percent of Americans did not have health insurance; that number is now down to 9.1 percent. People forced to pay out of their own pocket were often bankrupted. Some went without care, and others resorted to charity care at emergency rooms. The law has helped many of these people by expanding Medicaid, which insures the poor. For millions of others, it created health care exchanges where people could buy coverage with the help of government subsidies.Mr. Obama proposes several fixes. He recommends that the government offer its own health insurance, a so-called public option, on the exchanges in some parts of the country. That could help make health care more affordable in rural areas and smaller cities where only two or three insurers sell coverage. Republicans and some moderate Democrats fear that this could be the first step to a single-payer health care system. But there might be more support for a policy that is intended strictly for people in places with few choices.Mrs. Clinton supports the public option and has even suggested that people between the ages of 55 and 64 be allowed to buy into Medicare, though she has not yet provided details of how that would work. Mr. Trump has said he wants universal health coverage, and has proposed tax deductions and allowing insurers to sell policies across state borders. Tax deductions would help some people but wouldn\u2019t be enough, experts say. And insurers can already expand into other states as long as they follow the laws and regulations of the states in which they want to do business.In addition to the public option, lawmakers ought to consider bigger subsidies for insurance offered through the exchanges, an idea Mrs. Clinton supports. This can be done at a modest cost paid for by slightly higher taxes, according to several experts. In addition, both federal and state governments ought to do more to educate people about the subsidies available to help them buy insurance.The system could also be made more efficient. The Affordable Care Act has pushed insurers, doctors and hospitals to focus on preventive care, as Mr. Obama notes in his article, and lawmakers can build on that progress. Congress, he added, should allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, an idea that could help lower costs but faces stiff opposition from Republicans and even some Democrats.What Mr. Obama has done here is unusual \u2014 asking someone else to burnish a legacy of which he is personally proud. If the candidates (and Congress) pay attention, his request may also do a world of good for millions of Americans for whom decent health care remains out of reach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Fiat 124 Spider Is Made in Japan, Polished in Italy", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byDrivenFOR the last few decades, people with modest bank accounts could only dream of buying a new Italian roadster. Ferrari doesn\u2019t make anything in the $30,000 range, except perhaps seats. At over 65K, the Alfa Romeo 4C Spider is attainable only after raiding the children\u2019s college fund and selling the spouse\u2019s Camry.Ultimately, you\u2019d regret both.Save yourself the hassle of a divorce and check out the 2017 Fiat 124 Spider instead. With prices starting at $25,990, the Spider lets a couple enjoy the wind in their hair, the sun on their shoulders and the thrill of slicing though curves with a finely tuned Italian convertible. All made possible by Japan.Unless you\u2019ve been hiding under a wheel of Parmesan, you\u2019ve probably heard that the 2017 Spider is largely based on Mazda\u2019s MX-5 Miata. It\u2019s even built in the same Hiroshima plant.This is hardly a bad thing. Fiat takes Mazda\u2019s magical chassis and gives it unique springs, dampers and antiroll bars for a bit more compliance, yet less body roll. Base models cost about the same, but when you move up to fancier versions, the Fiat becomes a better value by around $1,000.The two share no sheet metal. And the Fiat gets a heart transplant. A 1.4-liter turbo 4-cylinder engine that is shipped from Italy provides the back wheels with 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque when tuned for the Classica and Lusso models. (The Abarth gets four more ponies.)The 6-speed manual comes from the previous-generation Miata, its ratios matching better with the turbo motor\u2019s torque. I\u2019m driving the 6-speed automatic.Full disclosure here: I\u2019m largely transmission agnostic, but as a Miata owner myself, I miss the brilliant snickety-snick action of the manual box. An automatic is a snore in a roadster. The 124 and MX-5 are two good reasons to learn how to dance with a stick.Although the wheelbases are the same, the Fiat is 5 inches longer than the Mazda, which explains the Spider\u2019s extra 100 pounds. Fuel economy is essentially identical between the 124 and MX-5 at an average of 30 miles per gallon on the preferred premium fuel, according the Environmental Protection Agency. The Fiat automatic drops to 29 m.p.g. (Another reason to go with the manual, huh?)Both cars dash from rest to 60 miles an hour in just under seven seconds, but the 124 feels more relaxed doing it. It remains tossable in the curves but more comfortable than the Miata, which performs as if it\u2019s on its third shot of espresso. With less growl from the tailpipe, a laminated acoustical windshield and more insulation in the soft top, the Fiat is noticeably quieter, too.There\u2019s also the issue of design. Modern safety regulations and the existing hard points in Mazda\u2019s structure mean the 124\u2019s overall look is chunkier than the version of old, last produced in 1985. The rear haunches and hood bulges are reminiscent of the old one \u2014 of which Fiat says there are 8,000 still registered in the United States. It caused dozens of double takes in the week I had it, and lots of thumbs up. For those who don\u2019t like the pinched look of the modern Miata, Fiat offers a nod toward heritage.But inside, other than the door panels, the steering wheel and some small material upgrades, the cabin is pure Mazda. The only change to the user interface is a Fiat logo. The manual mechanism for raising and lowering the top? Yep, you guessed it \u2014 it\u2019s the same (best to not mess with perfection).At $29,990 as tested, the Lusso model has heated leather seats.The Italians managed to eke out one-third of a cubic foot more room in the petite trunk, though giant Samsonites are still denied entry. While there\u2019s enough cargo room to get couples through a weekend getaway, the case of vino from the wine tour will need to be shipped home.Is there a better car between the two? Probably, but only the buyer can decide which it is. Whichever you might prefer, the best thing about the 124 Spider is that it gives the affordable roadster segment another choice.Bellissimo!videoAdvertisement"}

What Mr. Obama and the other leaders may find more elusive are the arguments to convey why alliances like this remain vital, at a time when the citizens of Europe\u2019s most important military power just voted to go it alone.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been another inflection point like this for the alliance since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in \u201989 to \u201991,\u201d Douglas E. Lute, the American ambassador to NATO, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cSo this is a bit of a historic point.\u201dThe White House has been circumspect in speaking publicly about the fallout from the British vote. Administration officials tend to confine their comments to hopes that the process will be handled in an orderly manner, so as not to harm the economy or disrupt financial markets. Such reticence suggests the White House, like many in Britain itself, is still in denial, in the view of some analysts.\u201cThe White House has yet to fully acknowledge the shift in Europe today and the challenges that it faces,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Administration officials said they expected Mr. Obama to meet one on one in Warsaw with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain to discuss what comes next after the referendum. Afterward, they acknowledged, the president would need to make an \u201caffirmative case\u201d for the value of the European Union, and more broadly, for an integrated world.Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said, \u201cAll leaders in Europe and the United States, including himself, have a responsibility in the face of all of these challenges to the trans-Atlantic order we built, to make the case.\u201d If they did not, Russia would seek to exploit the divisions in Europe. \u201cThat cannot simply be swept under the rug,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said.The alliance is expected to declare that the initial phase of its missile-defense system is finally operational. And the leaders are scheduled to discuss ways to deter members from cyberattacks, having elevated cyberwarfare to the same status as air, land and naval warfare.Over dinner on Friday night, the leaders will discuss how best to deal with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Obama will be able to deliver a briefing, having spoken with Mr. Putin the day before he left Washington. Officials suggested the conversation was starchy, with the president scolding Mr. Putin for a \u201csignificant uptick in fighting in Eastern Ukraine\u201d and urging him to press the Syrian government to abide by a partial cease-fire.Mr. Rhodes disputed a report from the Kremlin that the two countries were moving toward military cooperation in Syria. \u201cIf the trends of the last several weeks continue,\u201d he said, referring to recent Russian behavior regarding Syria, \u201cthey\u2019ve been moving in the wrong direction.\u201dAdministration officials said Mr. Obama would emphasize ways NATO could cooperate militarily with the European Union \u2014 modest but symbolically significant gestures to counter the rifts exposed by the British vote.

In Seville, he is scheduled to do some sightseeing and speak to the troops at the American naval station in Rota. The next day, in Madrid, he will have lunch with King Felipe VI and meet with Spain\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Mariano Rajoy.White House officials said Mr. Obama was traveling to Spain because it was the last big European Union country he had not visited as president. An equally plausible explanation is that he is friendly with the American ambassador, James Costos, a former HBO executive whose weekend house in Rancho Mirage, Calif., Mr. Obama often uses for golf getaways.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Government Pushes Divisive Labor Law Through Parliament", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThat provision allows lawmakers to protest by filing a no-confidence motion in the government within 24 hours. But neither the center-right Republicans, the main opposition party, nor the rebel Socialists and other leftists who opposed the bill, are expected to do so, and the measure is expected to officially pass on Thursday afternoon.Opponents of the labor law overhaul argue that it weakens hard-won worker protections and dispute the notion that it will help jump-start economic growth.Although the government watered down some of the measures \u2014 removing, for instance, a mechanism to cap payouts to dismissed workers \u2014 it never backed down to pressure from those who wanted the bill scrapped entirely.Prime Minister Manuel Valls, in a speech on Wednesday at the National Assembly before he invoked the constitutional provision, called the overhaul \u201cindispensable.\u201dHe said: \u201cThis bill is a bill of progress. This bill puts an end to rigidities in the labor market.\u201dLast month, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that more than 1,700 people had been arrested during the protests, and more than 550 police officers and gendarmes injured.They argued that unions at the individual company level were in a weaker position to negotiate with their employers. But the government and its allies, like the more moderate French Democratic Confederation of Labor, or C.F.D.T., a union that supported the bill, said that individual companies needed to have the flexibility to adapt to an increasingly competitive global market.Lawmakers who oppose the labor law overhaul can still challenge it at France\u2019s constitutional court before the law is officially promulgated. The last union protest against the legislation was on July 5 and none are scheduled for the summer, but the C.G.T. and its allies have called for more demonstrations in the fall.Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Its skyline is a bizarre mash-up of architectural styles, including sleek modern and Disneyland whimsical, crowding out the two-story, 19th-century buildings with ornate balconies that once defined this city of 120,000.Although some parts of historic Batumi have been preserved, dozens of old buildings have been swept away in the rush to welcome new investors, hotels and, especially, casinos. The Post Office, a city landmark, has been transformed, its Art Nouveau interior destroyed. Smaller houses have been torn down, despite protests from a group of citizens.\u201cWe are fighting house by house,\u201d said Shota Gujabidze, a film director and author of a book on old Batumi. \u201cBut it is very difficult to fight when the authorities have all the power. You can go out on the street and shout, but nothing happens.\u201dHis architectural ambitions were seemingly unlimited, especially in Batumi, just 12 miles from the Turkish border, which he hoped to turn into a vacation destination.Tourists are flocking to Batumi, but not so much for the beaches. Casinos here are sprouting like mushrooms, drawing an estimated 400,000 visitors last year, mainly from Turkey, where gambling is illegal.According to Mamuka Berdzenishvili, head of the regional tourism office, five more casinos are due to open this year, bringing the city\u2019s total to 13.By the end of 2017, the city is expected to have 19,000 hotel rooms, up from 15,000 at the start of this year.He pointed out that all this translates into jobs for local residents; for those dislocated by the new construction, there is cash compensation.These are the reasons so few residents object to a building program that critics call chaotic.\u201cThe city is not developing in a planned way,\u201d said Zurab Bakradze, a city planner who is based in Tbilisi. \u201cThey are building wherever it is most beneficial for investors.\u201dThe results of this development are evident all over town. A casino being built near the city\u2019s main theater is encroaching on a public square; a 35-story tower, once intended to house an American technological university, lies empty, and the eight-cabin Ferris wheel embedded into its facade is still.Mr. Bakradze doesn\u2019t fault Mr. Saakashvili, who is now the governor of the Black Sea city of Odessa in Ukraine, for wanting to bring bold architecture to Batumi and other Georgian cities, including Tbilisi, the capital.\u201cHe ordered up some special buildings, and some very famous architects came to Georgia,\u201d Mr. Bakradze said. \u201cHe wanted to use construction to support the economy. But he never gave any thought to how it would influence the surroundings, the public spaces. When they destroy the public spaces, they destroy the city.\u201dIn some cases, Georgia\u2019s new government has halted development begun by Mr. Saakashvili, but here in Batumi, building is proceeding apace.Mr. Gujabidze said Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s projects at least benefited from a kind of vision, however impulsive or grandiose, while those of his successors are all about the money.\u201cThose of us who love this city hoped for a different future,\u201d said Irma Zoidze, a local journalist and campaigner for preservation. \u201cWhat we have is a machine that is charging ahead towards a future which is not the one we want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Men for Trump", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byWhile white male college-educated voters are not commonly seen as part of the Trump-led nationalist movement that rejects globalism and multiculturalism, poll data shows that a substantial percentage of them do belong in this camp.Nearly half of college-educated Republicans, men and women, believe immigrants \u201cburden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care,\u201d a view shared by 62 percent of non-college Republicans. A plurality of those with college educations, 38 percent, say that they would be more likely to vote for a candidate \u201cwho wants to deport all immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\u201d Half of those without degrees agree. A striking 64 percent of college-educated white Republicans support building a \u201cfence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d as do 75 percent of non-college Republicans.I asked pollsters and political scientists why Trump appeals to educated white men.Howard Rosenthal, a political scientist at N.Y.U., sent a thoughtful reply to my inquiry:The past 50 years have witnessed a very substantial redistribution from white males to minorities and women. I supported and now believe in the public policies that accomplished this redistribution. But redistribution it is.The adoption of redistributive policies favoring women and minorities has, in Rosenthal\u2019s unvarnished view, fundamentally changed the character of the political parties.\u201cThe Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton are engaged in identity politics. And the redistribution is not win-win,\u201d Rosenthal wrote, adding thatidentity politics is a matter of social justice that has had limited economic benefits for white males throughout the income distribution.The meaning of a college degree, Rosenthal points out, has changed over the years:There has been a large expansion of the bottom tier, with relatively more students graduating from Cal State Hayward or Cal State Dominguez Hills than from Berkeley or UCLA. And those graduating from lower tier schools may not be doing all that well in the economy.Male college graduates who are struggling are more likely to join white working class men in the larger insurgency against globalization and free trade that is taking place here and all over Europe.A parallel reaction, often overlooked or disregarded by the media, academia and the left, can be found on other issues, especially immigration.one must first look at the globalists, and at how their changing values may drive many of their fellow citizens to support right-wing political leaders.Globalists, including elites in the Democratic Party,support high levels of immigration and reductions in national sovereignty; they tend to see transnational entities such as the European Union as being morally superior to nation-states; and they vilify the nationalists and their patriotism as \u201cracism pure and simple.\u201dThe global agenda presses a\u201cnormative threat\u201d button in the minds of those who are predisposed to authoritarianism, and these actions can drive status quo conservatives to join authoritarians in fighting back against the globalists and their universalistic projects.Haidt\u2019s use of the concept of \u201cnormative threat\u201d is helpful in exploring other challenges to traditional cultural norms, including male reaction to the nomination of a woman for president.There is a substantial body of research that suggests gender-based reasons why men \u2014 college-educated men included \u2014 lean toward Trump.These widely held group stereotypes incline voters \u201cto disqualify\u201d women seeking positions stereotypically held by men.Without referring to Clinton, Eagly and Koenig argue that the stereotype of women as belonging in the helping or communal professions has remained constant \u201cdespite massive change in women\u2019s roles in the 20th century.\u201d This is becausemost of the movement of women from homemaking to employment has put them in occupational roles that are perceived as not especially agentically demanding but highly communally demanding.The consequences, Eagly and Koenig write,are apparent in their employment in the expanding service, educational, and health care sectors of the economy. Specifically, the six most common occupations for women in the United States are secretary and administrative assistant; registered nurse; elementary and middle school teacher; cashier; nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides; and retail salespersons.women\u2019s identities as aspiring political leaders continue to be problematic, and require women to negotiate a double bind: if they are too feminine, they are deemed incompetent. If they are too masculine, they are considered not likeable.A number of pollsters pointed out to me that hostility to Clinton is more important than the appeal of Trump in the continuing support for Trump among white college men. \u201cHer negatives are awful,\u201d the Republican pollster Bill McInturff noted in an email.Bias against women in leadership roles often accompanies bias against racial and ethnic minorities and may contribute to the willingness of white men \u2014 both college and non-college \u2014 to accept flawed leadership from Trump rather than grant authority to women \u2014 or to African-Americans or Hispanics.People are often biased against others outside of their own social group, showing prejudice (emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and discrimination (behavioral bias). In the past, people used to be more explicit with their biases, but during the 20th century, when it became less socially acceptable to exhibit bias, such things like prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination became more subtle (automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent).While politically speaking college men are keeping a relatively low profile this year and not broadcasting their views, there are hard-right conservative activists more than willing to grab center stage.With Hillary, a kinder, gentler, let\u2019s-bring-everyone-to-the-fold schtick is dead on arrival, because it\u2019s so disingenuous, at least to us who don\u2019t subscribe to the gooey social justice warrior mentality.To Kimberly Ross and those who support her views, \u201cgooey social justice\u201d refers to the conjoined issues of race and gender. On these issues, Hillary Clinton and her progressive and liberal supporters have starkly different views from those of Donald Trump and his loyalists \u2014 to put it mildly.I\u2019m going to be talking to white people \u2014 I think we\u2019re the ones who have to have to start listening to the legitimate cries that are coming from our African-American fellow citizens.We do need to listen to those who say \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable.At some point, her campaign will have to grapple with why her support has cratered so badly among men. Did the campaign\u2019s initial plan to play up Clinton\u2019s soft, grandmotherly persona backfire at a time of mounting global turmoil? Is it a consequence of the campaign\u2019s unabashedly liberal turn on social issues, particularly on abortion rights, immigration, and gun control? Or is it simply a product of her overall low approval numbers, dampened by the ongoing developments about her handling of classified email at the State Department?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Women Who Will Negotiate Brexit", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe new British prime minister\u2019s visit with the German chancellor last Wednesday was heralded as a meeting of two of the world\u2019s most powerful women, and the participants did nothing to dispel that idea. \u201cWe have two women here who have got on and had a very constructive discussion,\u201d Theresa May declared, to which Angela Merkel jovially replied, \u201cExactly.\u201dBut however absorbing it was to focus on the striking similarities between the women who now lead two of Europe\u2019s major powers \u2014 both are daughters of church ministers, roughly the same age and regarded as tough and pragmatic \u2014 their first encounter was also the start of a fateful wrangle over the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, for which the British voted a month ago. And on that score, the most promising takeaway was that the two central actors seem prepared to play for time.Ms. Merkel other E.U. leaders insist that Britain must accept freedom of movement as the price for continued participation in the European free market. But Mrs. May can hardly say yes, at least right away; a major reason why Britain voted to leave was to regain control over its own borders. Britain is also a major market and manufacturing base for Germany and the rest of the Continent. At the end of the day, Ms. Merkel could well conclude that Britain\u2019s full participation in the European economy is worth more than open British borders.Mrs. May\u2019s signals have been ambiguous. She shocked European leaders when she named Boris Johnson as her foreign secretary. Mr. Johnson campaigned hard for Brexit and over the years has insulted a host of world leaders with his rude behavior. At the same time, she seems in no hurry to invoke Article 50 of the European treaty, which starts the formal withdrawal process, thus irritating not only \u201cleave\u201d activists in Britain but also European leaders like France\u2019s President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who wants to get the divorce going as soon as possible.For her part, Ms. Merkel seems happy to allow Britain \u201ca bit of time.\u201d That makes the best sense. The ill-conceived British referendum was to a large degree a vague protest vote with immigrants as the bogeyman, and the economic consequences are only beginning to be felt. Sentiments on Brexit may yet change in Britain, and even if they do not, avoiding a deadline will give Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel time to work out the least damaging deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The South China Sea: Explaining the Dispute", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThis week\u2019s ruling may have delivered a sweeping victory in court to the Philippines, which argued that its maritime territory was being illegally seized by China. But it has only escalated the larger dispute, which involves several Asian nations as well as the United States, and which is as much about China\u2019s rise into a major world power as it is about this one sea.What follows is an explanation of why this body of water is considered such a big deal, and why it may be a harbinger of global power politics in the decades ahead.At its most basic level, this a contest between China and several Southeast Asian nations over territorial control in the South China Sea, which includes some of the most strategically important maritime territory on earth.China\u2019s naval forces have also grown more aggressive in patrolling these claims and chasing off non-Chinese ships. That is part of why its neighbors see this as an effort by China to dominate the region.This is also about whether China will comply with international laws and norms, which Beijing sometimes views as a plot to constrain the country\u2019s rise.China has been blocking fishermen from a reef near the Philippines for four years, in another flash point in the dispute over the South China Sea.Maybe most important, the tribunal largely rejected the nine-dash line that China has used to indicate its South China Sea claims. This could open the way for other Asian states to challenge China\u2019s claims.So the letter of international law seems to say that China could be compelled to abandon many of its South China Sea claims.But while the ruling is considered binding, there is no enforcement mechanism. China boycotted the proceedings, saying that the tribunal had no jurisdiction and that it would ignore any decision \u2014 a position it reiterated after the ruling came out.Still, China is facing international pressure. Whether China chooses to defy or comply with that pressure, though, could help to shape its place in the international community.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions.This little line has shown up on official Chinese maps since the 1940s (it began with 11 dashes). It demarcates a vast but vague stretch of ocean from China\u2019s southern coast through most of the South China Sea.China has never clarified the line\u2019s exact coordinates. But it sweeps across waters \u2014 and some small islands \u2014 that are claimed by five other nations. It seems to go many miles beyond what is allowed under the United Nations treaty on maritime territorial issues, which China signed.These are the areas where China has been building islands, installing runways and running patrols.For China, the line represents long-lost historical claims that the country, after two centuries of weakness, is finally strong enough to recover. For the other nations, the line is a symbol of what they characterize as a naked power grab by China.This gets to a core contradiction in the South China Sea dispute: It is driven by territorial competition, yet all countries involved want open sea routes. Everyone benefits from the free flow of goods between Asia and the rest of the world, and everyone suffers if that is disrupted.This is part of why the United States stresses freedom of movement in international waters. While it is very unlikely that China would ever want to close off trade, the United States would still rather not allow Beijing even the ability to hold the global economy hostage.But, from China\u2019s perspective, the United States itself has that ability, because of American naval dominance; the Chinese also suspect that the global status quo is engineered to serve Western interests first. So it is hardly surprising that China is seeking greater control over waterways it relies on for economic survival.This is a dynamic that has permeated Sino-American relations throughout China\u2019s rise over the past two decades. In theory, both nations understand they are better off cooperating. But in practice, they often treat each other as competitors or potential threats \u2014 a cycle that is difficult to break.In some ways, yes.China sees itself as a growing power that has a right to further its interests in its own backyard, just as Western powers have done for centuries. Beijing considers the South China Sea an area of traditional Chinese influence, and sees its control as a way to assert greater power over the region.The United States has a treaty obligation to the Philippines, an ally. As the world\u2019s largest economy, it also has a real interest in maintaining open sea lanes \u2014 and, as the world\u2019s biggest naval power, it often assumes the role of policing them. Plus, as the world\u2019s only superpower, the United States often acts as a balancer in regional disputes.But this is also, for Washington, about shaping what sort of major power China becomes.The South China Sea, and particularly this week\u2019s ruling, are a test case for whether China becomes the kind of power that works within that system, or against it.Everyone agrees that the status quo in Asia and eventually the world will evolve to accommodate China\u2019s emergence as a major international power. The South China Sea is very important in its own right, but it is maybe most important in helping to determine what sort of role China plays in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Atlantic Trade Deal Talks, 14 Rounds In, Are Faltering. What\u2019s at Stake?", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The United States and the European Union have had 14 rounds of talks over three years on a trade and investment deal aimed at creating the world\u2019s largest trading zone, but they are making slow progress.Here is a primer on the deal: the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T.T.I.P.At its core, the deal seeks to provide economic stimulus by bolstering trade in the aftermath of the financial and European sovereign debt crises.But there is more at stake. A grander goal of the negotiations has been to enable Western countries to compete with rising economic powers like China and India by setting mutually agreed standards in areas like car safety, cosmetics and chemicals. A backlash against globalization on both sides of the Atlantic, however, makes the deal a test case for the West\u2019s commitment to trade liberalization.Relatively straightforward parts of the talks \u2014 like lowering tariffs \u2014 remain under discussion, and both sides face making delicate trade-offs.On the other side, the United States wants firm protections for investments by American companies in Europe, in case a member state fails to uphold the terms of the pact. They also want far greater access to European food and agricultural markets to sell more of their produce, including beef, which is banned in Europe if treated with growth-promoting hormones.Britain has long been among the most enthusiastic supporters of free trade in Europe, but its vote last month to leave the European Union will make the country less of a force in the negotiations.Although Britain is expected to remain a member of the European Union for at least two more years, it will most likely turn its attention to seeking new trade deals with other parts of the world. That could put pressure on the Europeans to make concessions to complete the deal, but it could also strengthen the influence of other big member states like France, which generally takes a more protectionist approach to trade than Britain.\u201cThe withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. market would affect the value of the E.U. market,\u201d L. Daniel Mullaney, the chief American negotiator, told a news conference on Friday in Brussels. He noted that a quarter of United States exports to the European Union go to Britain, and that the prospect of Britain\u2019s dropping out of the deal was like the United States\u2019 saying, \u201cmaybe T.T.I.P. will not apply to California.\u201dMore negotiations are expected after the summer, though no dates have been set. European trade ministers will hold meetings in September and October to determine whether there is sufficient political will to give the negotiations a final push.In the United States, the picture is also politically charged. Hillary Clinton, who is expected to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency, has blown hot and cold on trade over the course of her campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican challenger, has shown outright hostility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Plan for Banks Could Roil Europe", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byEven as Europe grapples with repercussions of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a dispute over tens of billions of dollars is also threatening to roil the region\u2019s $16 trillion economy.The Italian government, according to some estimates, needs to spend $45 billion to shore up its banks burdened with bad loans. Fears that European authorities will bar the government from providing that support are adding to the turbulence caused by \u201cBrexit.\u201dIt may seem difficult at first to understand how the lenders of a medium-size country, none of which are particularly large, or engage much in risky Wall Street activities, could be spreading fear through global financial markets.But they are, and their problems reveal what can happen when well-intentioned regulations bump into reality. And this is creating tension among the leaders of Europe. The situation may drag through the summer, keeping investors around the world on edge.So how bad could this get?The steep declines in shares of Italian banks suggest that a storm is ahead. The stock price of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, one of Italy\u2019s most troubled lenders, is down 80 percent in the last 12 months. Its shares also trade at under 10 percent of its book value \u2014 a measure of its net worth \u2014 a sign that investors really think that the bank needs new capital. Also, when bank stocks sink that much, banks find it almost impossible to raise new capital in the markets.The good news is that, over all, Italy\u2019s banks don\u2019t appear to need an overwhelmingly large sum to get them on a firmer footing. The problem centers on the banks\u2019 approximately 200 billion euros, or about $222 billion, of bad loans.The banks have already set aside significant reserves to absorb losses in these loans, effectively valuing them at 40 percent of their original value, according to some analyses. Investors appear to think that these loans are worth even less, however.The theory is that the banks would now have to bite the bullet and value the loans at an even lower level. But this could produce losses, and some banking experts say \u20ac40 billion of support is needed to help the banks take those hits.A simple response would be for the Italian government to hold its nose and plow that sum into the banks, roughly mimicking what the United States government did with its TARP spending in 2008.But such a bailout may be illegal under relatively new European rules that aim to protect taxpayers and instead force investors in the banks to provide financial support in times of trouble. Investors lend money to banks by buying their debt securities. Under the anti-bailout rules, those securities would be forcibly turned from debt into new equity, which could absorb any new losses taken on the bad loans. Under such a so-called bail-in, the equity would in theory be worth less than the debt securities, leading to losses for investors who held the debt.It sounds straightforward, but in Italy it is not.Retail investors hold many of those debt securities. According to Bruegel, a research organization that specializes in European economic issues, families own about a third of Italian banks\u2019 debt securities. Not only would bail-ins focus the pain on Italian households, the fear of losses might also prompt investors to stop lending to banks and lead depositors to withdraw their money. This would make a bad, but manageable, situation much worse.A compromise doesn\u2019t look impossible, though.Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing the specifics of Italy\u2019s problems and wary of the stresses caused by Brexit, may decide that it makes sense to give Italy a pass this one time.And the rules provide ways to do that. There are, for instance, exemptions in Europe\u2019s \u201cstate aid\u201d rules that aim to force bail-ins. One kicks in if a bail in could have \u201cdisproportionate results.\u201dDan Davies, senior research adviser at Frontline Analysts, says the Italian government could argue that forcing losses on retail investors would fall under that exception.So if Italy does bail out its banks, will they stop being a problem? Will they resurface as a destabilizing force two summers from now?To stop that happening, analysts say that government support must come with a plan to overhaul the industry. Mr. Davies said that mergers would help, if done at valuations that make sense.Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments, a hedge fund, says that moves must be taken to make the industry much more efficient than it is.\u201cThis injection would need to come with a restructuring of the system,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

As we drove our rental car up to the giant castle, my kids gasped and said, \u201cThey must be rich!\u201d\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t mention money,\u201d I warned them.An hour later, I found my 6-year-old walking in circles on the lawn, talking to himself. Up close, I realized that he was muttering \u201cmoney, money, money, money\u201d over and over.Can the French overcome their ambivalence about money to lure bankers from London? Should they?This ambivalence goes back centuries. Aristocrats were guillotined during the French Revolution, and new taxes were based on how wealthy people appeared \u2014 measured in part by the number of doors and windows in their homes. The well-off learned to be discreet.There are still plenty of rich people in Paris, of course. One draw for finance companies is that the city is teeming with high-end restaurants and grand apartments, and that it already has a large business district, La D\u00e9fense, just west of town. Whole neighborhoods of the capital empty out each summer, as residents retreat to their second homes.But there are still rules against showing it off. Parisiennes rarely walk around wearing the giant diamonds that are de rigueur in certain New York neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s more in a private dinner that you see the wealth,\u201d a French friend explained.It\u2019s fine to discuss money in France, as long as you\u2019re complaining that you don\u2019t have enough, or boasting about getting a bargain. No one here appreciates the American thrill I get from overspending, any more than they understand why we have a national holiday (Thanksgiving) during which you\u2019re practically obliged to overeat.The typical \u201cFrench dream\u201d (or at least the one people admit to) isn\u2019t of great wealth, it\u2019s of great security, including a steady income and pension. When you apply for a mortgage here, banks don\u2019t care what stocks you own, because stocks can go down; they want to see a monthly salary and a permanent work contract.I see this principle in daily life. When I told a Paris official that a group of parents was willing to buy a new security camera for our children\u2019s school (the city had been dragging its feet on our request), he was aghast, saying, \u201cWhat about the other schools where parents can\u2019t afford to buy new cameras?\u201dMr. Valls urged executives here to remind their British counterparts that the infamous 75 percent tax is gone: \u201cIf some among you can be patriotic and explain to the British media that it doesn\u2019t exist anymore, I\u2019d be thankful.\u201dBut the welcome is not without reservations. Jean-Louis Missika, Paris\u2019s deputy mayor for urban planning and economic development, told me in an interview this week that Brexit also offers a cautionary tale about what happens when the superrich dominate a city, pricing out practically everyone else. In London recently, I visited friends at the peak of middle-class careers who are living crammed with their children in a one-bedroom rental. There are people in northern England \u2014 many of them voted for Brexit \u2014 who can barely afford a coffee in the capital. Paris isn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s more affordable.Mr. Missika said that France still faced \u201ccomplicated and difficult, but urgent questions\u201d about how much it was willing to cut taxes to attract financial companies. \u201cI say yes to finance, but to an ethical one that respects fiscal rules\u201d and the environment, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said on Wednesday.\u201cI think we have to roll out the red carpet,\u201d said Mr. Missika, who worked in private equity himself. \u201cBut if rolling out the red carpet means aligning French taxes and finances with what was practiced in London or Jersey, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious. It\u2019s not possible. And I hope that neither Germany nor the Netherlands nor any of the other cities that are competing with Paris will make that big mistake.\u201d He predicted that sectors of the financial industry will cluster in different cities.Paris is meanwhile stepping up its efforts to attract technology companies, start-ups and so-called creative-economy jobs, which Mr. Missika said are more connected to the rest of the city and will help develop it over the long term. Paris will no doubt get some finance jobs, too, but I doubt it will ever become the next London. It doesn\u2019t really want to be that. And it\u2019s probably right.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Trump are deadlocked in the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, according to new polls showing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee gaining strength on his Democratic rival because of doubts about her honesty.When Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee, and Jill Stein, the Green Party\u2019s candidate, are included in the polls, Mr. Trump does even better, leading Mrs. Clinton by five points in Florida, six points in Pennsylvania and one point in Ohio. Mr. Johnson is expected to be on ballots in all 50 states.The polls, which have margins of error of plus or minus three percentage points, show improvement for Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania and Florida, where he is starting to do better with women and independent voters while gaining more support among men. In June, Mrs. Clinton held small leads over Mr. Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania and they were tied in Ohio.\u201cWhile there is no definite link between Clinton\u2019s drop in Florida and the U.S. Justice Department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails, she has lost ground to Trump on questions which measure moral standards and honesty,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.Voters in all three states are looking for \u201cradical change\u201d and are unhappy with the way trade deals have affected America\u2019s economy. While Mrs. Clinton is viewed as being more prepared to be president, Mr. Trump is seen as the more honest candidate and better suited to fight terrorism.Despite the progress, Mr. Trump continues to struggle in some areas. For instance, in Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, he is winning only 21 percent of nonwhite voters.But he is also making progress with other important voting blocs. Mr. Trump has struggled with female voters in many national polls, but in Pennsylvania he has narrowed the gender gap. He currently trails Mrs. Clinton by just four points, down from 16 points in June.Both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida ahead of the November election. No candidate has won the presidency without winning two of those three states since 1960, Quinnipiac notes.\u201cDonald Trump enters the Republican convention on a small roll in the three most important swing states in the country,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Separate polls released on Wednesday by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist also showed Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton statistically tied in Ohio and Iowa. In Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton holds a solid advantage, topping Mr. Trump by nine percentage points, 45 percent to 36 percent.As with the Quinnipiac polls, the surveys show Mr. Trump gaining ground in the last month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disappointing 2nd-Quarter Growth, Despite Strong Consumer Spending", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe economic recovery may be durable, but it is anything but dynamic.Weighed down by anemic business spending, overstocked factories and warehouses, and a surprisingly weak housing sector, the American economy barely improved this spring after its usual winter doldrums.Consumer spending advanced at a robust pace, helping to sustain a modest growth rate of 1.2 percent, but the gain was overshadowed by the poor showing in other sectors of the economy. The April-June quarter was the third consecutive period in which the economy advanced at less than a 2 percent annual rate, the weakest stretch in four years.The new economic data underscores the continuing frustration about the current growth cycle, which has now gone on for seven years \u2014 longer than most economic upswings \u2014 but which has repeatedly failed to break out into a higher orbit.And with the political conventions now over, and the brawl between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump for the White House in full swing, Friday\u2019s data at least partly undercuts the Democrats\u2019 argument that the nation\u2019s economic health is improving.\u201cThis definitely feeds into an existing Republican narrative that the economy is growing too slowly and dials it up a notch,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served in the Obama administration.The economic debate may intensify ahead of the election in November, particularly because the recovery\u2019s gains have been less robust in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. States firmly in the Democratic or Republican column \u2014 California and Texas, for example \u2014 are generally doing much better.On Friday, Republican leaders were quick to cite the new data on the nation\u2019s gross domestic product to reinforce their argument that President Obama\u2019s policies have failed to turn things around.\u201cAfter eight years of higher taxes, endless regulations and skyrocketing health care costs, the chickens are apparently coming home to roost,\u201d said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas.But there are other signs that the economy is on the mend, even for ordinary Americans who had, until recently, barely benefited from the rebound. The unemployment rate, which reached 10 percent after the recession, has fallen back to around 5 percent, while hiring and pay gains have been healthier lately. Those factors may ultimately contribute more to perceptions of vitality than abstract statistics on the nation\u2019s economic output.\u201cWhat really matters to people is jobs and income, and that\u2019s most recently been a positive story,\u201d added Mr. Bernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Based on more complete information about recent years, the government revised last year\u2019s growth rate up slightly to 2.6 percent \u2014 the best so far since the severe downturn ended in mid-2009. But that is still below the gains the American economy recorded in the mid-2000s, let alone in the booming late 1990s.Over all, the economy\u2019s 1.2 percent advance in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, was just slightly better than the 0.8 percent pace recorded in the first quarter.Besides the decrease in inventory accumulation and business investment, weaker government outlays also held back growth, reinforcing a trend that has hobbled the recovery in recent years.The abrupt falloff in homebuilding caught analysts off guard, but it came after a series of double-digit gains in late 2014 and 2015. And with mortgage rates very low and home prices still rising in many parts of the country, the residential real estate sector is expected to contribute to growth again in the coming quarters.Household spending was the economy\u2019s bright spot, rising at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent.\u201cThe consumer is doing all the heavy lifting,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. \u201cAside from technology and software, business spending was bad and housing was also surprisingly weak, which is payback for gains in recent quarters.\u201dOn the positive side, the overstock at stores and warehouses is starting to dissipate. That could help growth in the second half of the year, Mr. Behravesh said.After a long period in which trade has weighed on the economy, the balance between exports and imports may finally be improving. The net trade picture actually lifted growth by nearly a quarter of a percentage point last quarter, the first significant improvement from trade since mid-2014.In addition, Mr. Behravesh said, wages are finally beginning to inch higher for many workers after years of stagnation. Gas prices also remain low.While grappling with weaker demand from customers in Asia and Europe, many factories and mills in the nation\u2019s midsection have been hit by the drop in energy prices as new drilling for oil and natural gas has collapsed.Regional disparities have contributed to differing perceptions of the economy. Workers in the West are finding themselves priced out of neighborhoods in booming San Francisco and Seattle, while families in less prosperous parts of the country say they feel as if the recession never really ended.Domestically focused service industries like software, health care and financial services are doing well, lifting incomes among white-collar workers. A strong real estate market in many parts of the country and the run-up on Wall Street are also encouraging more affluent consumers to open their wallets.A top Fed official downplayed the latest report.John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said the second-quarter gross domestic product reading was weak largely because of inventories and government spending, noting that underlying data that discount for swings in stock building \u201clook good.\u201dSpeaking to reporters after a speech in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Williams, an influential centrist at the central bank, noted the two key employment and inflation reports before the next meeting in mid-September. \u201cIt makes sense, assuming the data continue to support that, to raise rates again this year,\u201d he said.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the disappointing gross domestic product report makes a move by the Fed in September a bit less likely, but it could still be on track if the government issues strong jobs reports for July and August. July\u2019s data will be released by the Labor Department next Friday.\u201cThe domestic side of the economy looks O.K. Not stellar, not fantastic, but enough to keep us on a modest growth path,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s all about personal consumption, then the labor market is your best forward-looking indicator.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Olympic Catastrophe", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 IT\u2019S official: The Olympic Games in Rio are an unnatural disaster.Measures like these are usually taken for an earthquake or a flood. But the Olympics are a man-made, foreseeable, preventable catastrophe.I went to Rio recently to see how preparations for the Games are going. Spoiler: not well. The city is a huge construction site. Bricks and pipes are piled everywhere; a few workers lazily push wheelbarrows as if the Games were scheduled for 2017. Nobody knows what the construction sites will become, not even the people working on them: \u201cIt\u2019s for the Olympics\u201d was the unanimous reply, followed by speculation about \u201ctents for the judging panels of volleyball or soccer, I guess.\u201dI asked the Rio 2016 press office for a tour, but it olympically ignored me. Almost all venues are still under construction. I managed to see part of the Barra Olympic Park, which will host many of the events, after buying a last-minute ticket to a Volleyball World League match. Although construction for the Games is progressing, it appears far from \u201c97 percent complete,\u201d as the organizers claimed recently.I also saw most of the Deodoro Olympic Park, which is apparently open to anyone who wants to see it. I walked straight in and found half-built grandstands abandoned in the middle of a Friday afternoon.Work on the beach volleyball arena at Copacabana stalled because the organizers failed to get the proper environmental licenses. Then the structure was damaged by waves. Workers erected a six-foot-high sand barrier to protect the site. It also protects thugs; tourists are being mugged behind it. A construction worker told me he\u2019d seen a man stabbed there, and warned me to stay away. The robbers were so comfortable that they had left their backpacks and a beach chair nearby on the sand.Safety is of great concern to athletes and tourists. They are right to worry. According to local news reports, drug traffickers are involved in territorial disputes in at least 20 Rio neighborhoods.Eight years ago, the government established the Pacifying Police Units, a heavily armed force that tries to reclaim favelas from the gangs. But these units seem to have worsened the drug war rather than ended it. This year, 43 police officers have been killed in the state, and at least 238 civilians have been killed by the police. The United Nations has said it\u2019s concerned about violence by the military police and the officers in the favelas, notably against children living on the streets. Everybody fears an increase in police violence during the Games. The country will deploy 85,000 soldiers and police officers, about twice the number used in the London 2012 Olympics.And the 500,000 people expected to visit for the Games should be worried about how easily they could wander into dangerous areas: There\u2019s a dearth of signs and tourist information on the streets and on public transportation. A native Brazilian, I spent half an hour at the central train station just trying to figure out where to catch a bus to the Olympic Park \u2014 and I\u2019d looked it up beforehand. The information booth inside the station was empty. Outside, few of the bus stops displayed information about which lines went where. I resorted to asking popcorn vendors and passers-by for directions. I\u2019m glad I speak Portuguese.The incumbent governor, who has lymphoma, is on sick leave. Just before Christmas, he declared a \u201chealth system emergency\u201d as hospitals closed units and money ran out for equipment, supplies and salaries. Months later, the state started delaying civil servants\u2019 salaries and pension checks. Teachers have gone on strike and students have occupied dozens of schools in protest. The state already owes $21 billion to Brazil\u2019s federal government and $10 billion to public banks and international lenders. A budget shortfall of $5.5 billion is projected for this year. An $860 million loan has already been granted to help cover the cost of security at the Games.The fiscal disaster could be attributed to many factors, including a national economic crisis \u2014 but the huge expansion of the government payroll and reckless spending for the Olympics are likely causes.However, the mayor of the capital, Eduardo Paes, claimed that City Hall is in good financial shape and that the fiscal situation would not affect Olympic preparations.So if it\u2019s not only money, maybe the problem is also politics. Brazil is, of course, having a major political crisis. The president, Dilma Rousseff, was forced to step aside on May 12 because of allegations that she manipulated the state budget. The political turmoil has paralyzed the country and frozen the economy. Decisions on important reforms and infrastructure projects are being delayed, and the uncertainty has discouraged investment. But Leonardo Picciani, who took over as sports minister after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s suspension, asserts that the Games will be \u201cfantastic.\u201d Almost everything was ready by the time he took up his post, he claims.Mr. Picciani has also tried to minimize concerns over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, declaring that all the proper preventive measures are in place. That hasn\u2019t stopped athletes like Jason Day, the world\u2019s No. 1 ranked golfer, from announcing that they\u2019re skipping the Olympics because of Zika. In an open letter last month, 150 prominent doctors, bioethicists and scientists from around the world asked for the Olympics to be moved or postponed because of the Zika epidemic.This is certainly not the first time a host country\u2019s handling of the Games has looked disastrous. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was plagued by reports of faulty plumbing in shoddily built hotels. Fears of swine flu stalked the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada. Greece barely finished construction before the opening ceremony in 2004.Perhaps, as sometimes happens in Brazil, everything will turn out fine and the Olympics will be a success. The Games will cap 10 years of mega-events in Rio, starting with the Pan-American Games in 2007, followed by the 2011 Military World Games, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2014 World Cup. Remarkably, they all went off without any notable catastrophes. (The same could be said about the Carnival and New Year\u2019s Eve, both of which attract about a million tourists every year.)All these projects had one thing in common: Regular citizens were excluded from the decision-making. The government has used the coming Games to speed up certain development projects \u2014 not all of them the public\u2019s priorities. The mayor joked about it in a 2012 TV interview: \u201cThe Olympics pretext is awesome; I need to use it as an excuse for everything,\u201d he said. \u201cNow all that I need to do, I will do for the Olympics. Some things could be really related to the Games, others have nothing to do with them.\u201dThe favela Provid\u00eancia is a good example of what\u2019s wrong with the mayor\u2019s approach. The residents there asked for water and basic sanitation. Instead, they got a $22 million gondola, primarily for tourists. Similarly, six stations were built on a subway line that connects wealthy beachside neighborhoods to Jardim Oce\u00e2nico, a station (sort of) near the Olympic Park. But most of Rio\u2019s residents would have preferred to see the construction of a different line that connects the city center to the less-ritzy municipalities of Niter\u00f3i and S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, where many working people live, a project that would have cost half the price.The Olympics are predicted to cost $12 billion. More than 40 percent of that will come from public funds, the rest from private lenders. But critics say that the official budget doesn\u2019t include tax exemptions for the companies involved in organizing and hosting the event, the cost of temporary grandstands and compensation for families evicted to make way for Olympic construction.Homeless people in Rio told me that police officers are forcing them off sidewalks and dragging them to filthy shelters to start \u201ccleaning up\u201d the streets before the influx of visitors. The evictions often take place at 3 a.m. with the help of police dogs and pepper spray, and sometimes horses. There are also reports that street children have been arbitrarily placed in juvenile detention centers.Somebody will profit from the Games, but it won\u2019t be the majority of Rio\u2019s population. Eighty percent of the investments were made in the wealthy Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, known as Rio\u2019s Miami. An Olympic golf course was built there, inside an Area of Environmental Protection. The city already has two big golf courses, and very few Brazilians play golf.The governor was right: It\u2019s a calamity.Vanessa Barbara is a columnist for the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, the editor of the literary website A Hortali\u00e7a and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Townspeople and Treasure Hunters in Hungary Search for a Sultan\u2019s Buried Heart", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported bySzigetvar JournalSZIGETVAR, Hungary \u2014 In the shade of a wiry cherry tree, 72-year-old Jozsef Kovacs was digging in the dry dirt with a large gardening shovel.\u201cWe haven\u2019t found a lot this morning,\u201d Mr. Kovacs said on a recent summer day, flashing a grin a few teeth short of a full smile. \u201cBut in October, we found a marble column.\u201dThe column was a part of a 16th-century encampment that was unearthed last fall in Szigetvar, a poor city in southern Hungary, by a team of researchers from the University of Pecs.The site is believed to be where Suleiman the Magnificent spent his last night before 50,000 of his Ottoman soldiers sacked a nearby fortress defended by 2,500 Christians led by Miklos Zrinyi, a local Croatian-Hungarian nobleman.His grand vizier kept the sultan\u2019s death a secret from his soldiers until after their victory, when his body was secreted back to Istanbul. Ottoman legends say Suleiman\u2019s heart and other internal organs were buried in a golden coffin beneath the place where his tent stood.The discovery last year of the camp site, and other Ottoman relics, has led researchers to cut dozens of trenches at the excavation site in Szigetvar, about 20 miles from the Croatian border, and attracted treasure hunters in search of the buried heart of Suleiman the Magnificent.\u201cWe wanted to cast some light on those legends and restore the fame of the city of Szigetvar,\u201d said Norbert Pap, the geographer and historian who has been leading the excavation.Mr. Pap and his team have employed a number of local laborers, like Mr. Kovacs, who are desperate for jobs and hope that the discovery of more Ottoman ruins could lead to a new wave of tourism.That site stood until 1692 when the Habsburgs, who reconquered the region, removed all precious items they could find and took them to Vienna. The rest of the artifacts were later reburied by local farmers.\u201cSomething was wrong with the two previous sites where Suleiman\u2019s tomb was supposed to be lying,\u201d said Mate Kitanics, a historian from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. \u201cWe found several mentions of the original site in local archives that described the mausoleum as an hour\u2019s walk from the castle of Szigetvar, on a hill with a view of the castle, in the middle of vineyards and fruit trees, east of the city.\u201dMr. Pap\u2019s team of about 20 researchers from the University of Pecs and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has been using high-tech tools such as an aerial-laser surveying plane and geographical modeling software to recreate the old city\u2019s landscape from the time of the battle. They have been able to confirm that the site of the October discovery was most likely the site of the old settlement. And they have unearthed other relics, including 16th- and 17th-century coins, ceramics and porcelain.\u201cThere are three hectares of land worth exploring,\u201d Mr. Pap said. \u201cIn fact, it might have been the first city the Ottomans ever built, since they usually contented themselves with occupying existing settlements. And facing the site, there must have been a Christian settlement.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen people with metal detectors next to our house,\u201d said Aranka Horvath, who lives with her husband on a small farm less than 40 yards from the ruins found in October.The couple had moved to Szigetvar about 14 years ago from an even poorer part of southern Hungary with hopes of farming a small plot of land, and now entertain the idea of playing host to rich Turks eager to visit the remains of one of their national heroes where he met his demise.\u201cAt first, the Turks were our enemies,\u201d Mrs. Horvath said, reaching back in history. \u201cBut that was so long ago that we don\u2019t have any problem with them anymore, especially if they bring some money here.\u201dSzigetvar\u2019s mayor, Peter Vass, shares her entrepreneurial ambitions.\u201cIt\u2019s only when I visited Turkey that I realized how important Suleiman the Magnificent is to the modern Turkish identity,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is everywhere, next to Ataturk,\u201d Mr. Vass said, referring to Turkey\u2019s first president, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. \u201cA lot of Turks will come to visit the tomb.\u201dAnticipating a much-needed boon to the local economy, Mr. Vass, a veterinarian, has been making plans for a rise in tourism. He has suggested building a five-star hotel on top of two lonely soccer fields near the city\u2019s recently renovated thermal spa.\u201cI\u2019m welcoming all investors, be they from Turkey or elsewhere,\u201d he said, though none have taken him up on his offer.Mr. Vass went so far as to invite President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to visit in September, along with Presidents Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic of Croatia, and Janos Ader of Hungary, to commemorate the 450th anniversary of the siege.\u201cThe Turks and the Croatians reacted promptly to the invitation,\u201d Mr. Vass said, adding that not all of the historical rivals were so eager to participate. \u201cI had to wait much longer for the Hungarian answer.\u201dAll three leaders eventually assented, he said, and they are scheduled to be on hand to commemorate the battle, though it remains to be seen if the legend of Suleiman\u2019s heart can really lure modern tourists.Janos Horvath, who runs a sporting goods shop on Szigetvar\u2019s main boulevard, said he cannot wait to see the Turkish tourism money rolling in, but has doubts about whether they will ever come.The city has no highway nearby and there is no direct train from Budapest, the capital.\u201cSzigetvar doesn\u2019t even have a proper coffee place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are simply no jobs here. My son just left for good to work in Stuttgart. After the V.I.P.s come in September, the city will go back to sleep.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blood on Your Hands, Too", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThere is no question that we should examine incidents of police violence for traces of bias, if for no other reason than to rule it out if it isn\u2019t present. Indeed, we should all search ourselves for manifestations of racial bias.But the current conversation is \u2014 and must be \u2014 larger than that.Interpersonal racism, when it exists, is only one part of the equation. Another part is systemic, structurally racist policies, and yet another is class conflict between the police and the poorest, most dangerous communities they patrol, and between those who are better off and those who are not. That strand is nearly absent from this conversation altogether.\u201cAs a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book. And then we tell the police, \u2018You\u2019re a social worker; you\u2019re the parent; you\u2019re the teacher; you\u2019re the drug counselor.\u2019 We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience; don\u2019t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind. And then we feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.\u201dThe comment underscores that this is not simply a conflict between police departments and minority communities that everyone else can watch from a comfortable distance, convinced that the battle doesn\u2019t belong to them.No, this issue is about everyone. We have areas of concentrated poverty in our cities in part because of a long legacy of discriminatory urban policies. We don\u2019t sufficiently address the effects of that legacy, in part because it is rooted in a myth of racial pathology and endemic poor choice. We choose to be blind to the policy choices our politicians have made \u2014 and that many have benefited from, while others suffered \u2014 while simultaneously holding firmly to the belief that all of our own successes and comforts are simply the result of our and our families\u2019 drive, ambition and resourcefulness. Other people lack physical comforts because they lack our character strength.It is from this bed of lies that our policing policies spring. When the president says, \u201cWe tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs,\u201d who is the \u201cwe\u201d?It\u2019s not the blue-collar civil servants in law enforcement or the working-class and poor communities, which are aggressively patrolled. No. The \u201cwe\u201d is the middle and moneyed classes.While the blue, black and brown groups on the lower end of the spectrum are forced into more interaction \u2014 on one hand to contain disruption within communities, and on the other to finance police departments and civic governance \u2014 everyone else goes about their business unaware and unbothered until something causes \u201cpolitical blowback or inconvenience\u201d and disturbs the more prosperous half\u2019s \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d\u201cThese officers risk their lives for $40,000 a year. Forty thousand dollars a year. And this is not sustainable, not to support these people. We\u2019re not perfect. There\u2019s cops that don\u2019t need to be cops. I have been the first to say, we need to separate employment with those types of cops \u2014 1 percent or 2 percent. The 98 percent or 99 percent of cops come to work, do this job, come to work for 40 grand. It\u2019s not sustainable.\u201dHonor\u00e9 continued:\u201cMatter of fact, their pay would go up if the federal minimum wage was passed, $15 an hour. They make less than $15 an hour. We ask a lot from these young police officers which means, Don, they\u2019ve got to get another job. They have to have a second job to support their families, most of them. We\u2019ve got to take that stress off of them, too. So we got to make sure they\u2019re properly trained and they don\u2019t have to work all this overtime so they can maintain their family. A stressful police officer who\u2019s working another 30 hours overtime a week is coming to work tired. And he\u2019s stressed out. We\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201dWe take this underpaid and highly stressed group of officers, with guns and any biases they may harbor, explicit or implicit, and flood disadvantaged communities with them, where uncivil behavior can often take root, and then \u201cwe feign surprise when periodically the tensions boil over.\u201dPolice departments can then use these already poor people as a kind of municipal cash machine, plugging budgetary shortfalls by performing an inordinate number of stops, writing an outrageous number of tickets and having the courts impose even more fines.Now where would this revenue come from if it were not being bled from poor people? That\u2019s right, the rest of the population. The tax dollar that your local government refused to exact from you is being exacted from dark flesh. That same city service that your town can\u2019t truly afford but refused to forgo is being paid for by gouging poor people who have almost nothing.You may think that you are not a part of this, but you are wrong. That\u2019s just a lie that your willful ignorance and purposeful blindness perpetuates, to protect your conscience. This is absolutely about you, many, many of you. There are more bloody hands than meet the eye.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are We on the Path to National Ruin?", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported bySan Antonio \u2014 I never really understood how fascism could have come to Europe, but I think I understand better now. You start with some fundamental historical transformation, like the Great Depression or the shift to an information economy. A certain number of people are dispossessed. They lose identity, self-respect and hope.They begin to base their sense of self-worth on their tribe, not their behavior. They become mired in their resentments, spiraling deeper into the addiction of their own victimology. They fall for politicians who lie about the source of their problems and about how they can surmount them. Facts lose their meaning. Entertainment replaces reality.Once facts are unmoored, everything else is unmoored, too. People who value humility and kindness in private life abandon those traits when they select leaders in the common sphere. Hardened by a corrosive cynicism, they fall for morally deranged little showmen.And then perhaps there\u2019s a catalyzing event. Societies in this condition are culturally tense and socially isolated. That means there are a lot of lonely, alienated young men seeking self-worth through violence. Some wear police badges; some sit in their rooms fantasizing of mass murder. When they act, the results can be convulsive.Normally, nations pull together after tragedy, but a society plagued by dislocation and slipped off the rails of reality can go the other way. Rallies become gripped by an exaltation of tribal fervor. Before you know it, political life has spun out of control, dragging the country itself into a place both bizarre and unrecognizable.This happened in Europe in the 1930s. We\u2019re not close to that kind of descent in America today, but we\u2019re closer than we\u2019ve been. Let\u2019s be honest: The crack of some abyss opened up for a moment by the end of last week.Blood was in the streets last week \u2014 victims of police violence in two cities and slain cops in another. America\u2019s leadership crisis looked dire. The F.B.I. director\u2019s statements reminded us that Hillary Clinton is willing to blatantly lie to preserve her career. Donald Trump, of course, lies continually and without compunction. It\u2019s very easy to see this country on a nightmare trajectory.How can America answer a set of generational challenges when the leadership class is dysfunctional, political conversation has entered a post-fact era and the political parties are divided on racial lines \u2014 set to blow at a moment\u2019s notice?On the other hand \u2026I never really understood how a nation could arise as one and completely turn itself around, but I think I\u2019m beginning to understand now. Back in the 1880s and 1890s, America faced crises as deep as the ones we face today. The economy was going through an epochal transition, then to industrialization. The political system was worse and more corrupt than ours is today.Culturally things were bad, too. Racism and anti-immigrant feelings were at plague-like levels. Urban poverty was indescribable.And yet America responded. A new leadership class emerged, separately at first, but finally congealing into a national movement. In 1889, Jane Addams created settlement houses to serve urban poor. In 1892, Francis Bellamy wrote the Pledge of Allegiance to give the diversifying country a sense of common loyalty. In 1902, Owen Wister published \u201cThe Virginian,\u201d a novel that created the cowboy mythology and galvanized the American imagination.New sorts of political leaders emerged. In city after city, progressive reformers cleaned up politics and professionalized the civil service. Theodore Roosevelt went into elective politics at a time when few Ivy League types thought it was decent to do so. He bound the country around a New Nationalism and helped pass legislation that ensured capitalism would remain open, fair and competitive.This was a clear example of a society facing a generational challenge and surmounting it. The Progressives were far from perfect, but they inherited rotting leadership institutions, reformed them and heralded in a new era of national greatness.So which path will we take? The future of the world hangs on that question.I\u2019m betting the local is more powerful, that the healthy growth on the forest floor is more important than the rot in the canopy. But last week was a confidence shaker. There\u2019s a cavity beneath what we thought was the floor of national life, and there are demons there.Advertisement"}

They bonded over cricket and silly university debates, like the one where Philip induced her to speak for the motion \u201cthat sex is good \u2026 but success is better.\u201dBoth became bankers, and Ms. May threw herself into the Conservative politics that had entranced her since the age of 12, when she liked to argue with her father and he asked her, in order to maintain neutrality in his parish, not to parade her Tory colors in public.Ms. May, who had been home secretary, is considered \u201ca safe pair of hands,\u201d not flashy and even dull, who seems to be a candidate of continuity. But the country\u2019s dire circumstances may demand more. And Ms. May, a traditional economic and social conservative in many respects, has signaled a desire to give her party a new focus on the need to build a fairer society.Her six-year tenure at the Home Office showed her to be a tough operator and put her in charge of a number of flash-point issues. She demanded police reforms to reduce racial profiling. She helped push through surveillance policies that had to balance fears of terrorism against civil liberties and confronted public pressure to reduce immigration, failing to meet government targets for doing so. If sometimes at odds with Mr. Cameron\u2019s inner circle \u2014 she was a quiet critic of the government\u2019s budget austerity \u2014 she nonetheless built a reputation as smart and competent.Damian Green, who worked for her as Home Office minister until 2014, said that \u201cTheresa doesn\u2019t do verbiage, doesn\u2019t do speeches for the sake of making speeches. One of her virtues is that when she says something today she means it tomorrow.\u201dBut she will have to bind a badly torn party in which she has won esteem but few close friends. She will also have to juggle competing priorities in negotiating the withdrawal from the European Union under the watchful eye of Brexit supporters who remain wary of her commitment to their cause.Even though she publicly if tepidly supported remaining in Europe out of loyalty to Mr. Cameron, saying it would be best for the nation\u2019s security, at heart \u201cshe is a Euroskeptic,\u201d said Catherine Meyer, a former treasurer of the Conservative Party and a friend of the Mays\u2019. \u201cWhen she says Brexit means out, she means it.\u201dWhile respected within the European Union as a tough and unpretentious negotiator, Ms. May will have to find the right balance between more controls on immigration that the voters demanded and at least partial access, if she can manage it, to the single market of the European Union.Friends say that her early religious upbringing \u2014 she is an Anglican but went to a Roman Catholic school \u2014 has given Ms. May a moral base, a steady personality and a feeling for the disadvantaged. \u201cHer background has shaped her into somebody who is not going to feel sorry for herself or blame others for her mistakes, and who finds solace in moving forward, not to sit but to fight,\u201d said Ms. Meyer, who worked with Ms. May on a charity for abducted children.A young woman who hunched her shoulders at school to seem less tall has grown into a proud master of her responsibilities. She lives for her work and her husband, a well-off investment banker, and their time together in their neat house in Sonning-on-Thames, in Berkshire, in the heart of her Maidenhead constituency, a village she shares with better-known types like the guitarist Jimmy Page and George and Amal Clooney. She likes to cook and owns more than 100 cookbooks, and will likely be glad that the Camerons took the heat for remodeling the ancient kitchen at 10 Downing Street.Mr. Cameron valued her workaholic talents, naming her Home Office secretary, one of the four senior cabinet posts, only the second woman to hold the job. Wary of her quiet ambition and wanting to protect his own favorite, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, he never promoted her further. But he did not demote her, either, even as she failed to deliver on one of the government\u2019s key pledges, to curb immigration. She was famous for fighting her corner, knowing her subject and keeping clear of the Cameron \u201cchumocracy.\u201dMs. May is polite but not chummy, works late and does not hang around Parliament\u2019s bars. Her lack of a \u201cset of friends\u201d was considered one of her great liabilities in the race to succeed Mr. Cameron, said Crispin Blunt, a Conservative member of Parliament who is one of her supporters. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an army of mates for her,\u201d he said, but it allows her now to make appointments to her government on the basis of her own priorities and assessments.\u201cIn government, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to be a woman surrounded by lots of men,\u201d said Ms. Meyer. \u201cLike Margaret Thatcher, she likes the company of men, but she\u2019s capable of putting her fist down.\u201dIn office, Ms. May has been rigorous, largely sticking to her brief, which she knew in depth, and not often consulting cabinet colleagues. One former minister, Kenneth Clarke, called her \u201ca bloody difficult woman,\u201d a description she embraced. She tends to work alone or with a small number of aides, like Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, and has a tendency to micromanage, a senior civil servant said, asking anonymity.Among her most controversial acts was helping to push through a so-called \u201csnooper\u2019s charter,\u201d giving the police and security services new powers in a world of digital communications and terrorism. After criticism that the measure impinged too much on civil liberties and individual rights, she agreed to some changes.Ms. May has been compared to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u2013 both daughters of Protestant clergymen, both with quiet, private husbands, both without children, both hardworking and rather distant. Ms. May clearly sees the similarities, including being underestimated by men.\u201cIf you look at somebody like Angela Merkel and think of what she\u2019s actually achieved, you know, there are still people who don\u2019t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,\u201d Ms. May said in a 2012 interview with the Daily Telegraph. \u201cWhat matters is, what has she actually done? And, when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation, and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her.\u201dWhen asked on Desert Island Discs what single novel she wanted as a castaway, she answered, \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d And her single luxury? \u201cA lifetime subscription to Vogue.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 14 about the no-nonsense working style of Theresa May, the new British prime minister, misstated the given name of one of her earlier challengers for the Conservative Party leadership.

{"Headline": "How Private Equity Found Power and Profit in State Capitols", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 3Private equity firms have used sophisticated but indirect political maneuvering with state and local entities to smooth the way for growth and revenue.Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 Inside a cramped committee room on the cactus-dotted campus of Arizona\u2019s Capitol, Kelsey Lundy stepped to the podium to detail new legislation and the higher costs it would impose on struggling borrowers.But Ms. Lundy is not a lawmaker, a government employee or even a statehouse intern.She is a lobbyist for one of the nation\u2019s largest lenders.That lender \u2014 controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, one of Wall Street\u2019s most powerful private equity firms \u2014 wrote the bill. Months later, in 2014, the state\u2019s legislators passed the law, making it easier to charge interest of 36 percent to borrowers living on the financial margins.The political access in Arizona was just one component of a broader effort to loosen consumer protection laws, according to emails obtained through public records requests. In nine other states, Ms. Lundy\u2019s client helped win legislative changes, persuading lawmakers that it needed to raise costs to stay in business and serve borrowers.Since the 2008 financial crisis, Fortress and other private equity firms have rapidly expanded their influence, assuming a pervasive, if under-the-radar, role in daily American life, an investigation by The New York Times has found. Sophisticated political maneuvering \u2014 including winning government contracts, shaping public policy and deploying former public officials to press their case \u2014 is central to this growth.Yet even as private equity wields such influence in the halls of state capitols and in Washington, it faces little public awareness of its government activities, The Times found.Private equity firms often don\u2019t directly engage with legislators and regulators \u2014 the companies they control do. As a result, the firms themselves have emerged as relatively anonymous conglomerates that exert power behind the scenes in their dealings with governments. And because private equity\u2019s interests are so diverse, the industry interacts with governments not only through lobbying, but also as contractors and partners on public projects.Fortress, which manages more than $70 billion of investor money, encapsulates this new power dynamic.While little known outside Wall Street, Fortress covers a cross section of American life through companies it owns or manages. It controls the nation\u2019s largest nonbank collector of mortgage payments. It is building one of the country\u2019s few private passenger railroads. It helps oversee a company that manages public golf courses in several states. And it controls Ms. Lundy\u2019s client, Springleaf Financial Services, a huge provider of subprime loans to borrowers with few other options aside from payday lenders often charging 300 percent.The Times\u2019s investigation \u2014 based on thousands of pages of government records, court papers and securities filings, as well as interviews with borrowers, regulators and executives \u2014 pieced together how these seemingly disparate companies fall under the umbrella of one powerful private equity firm. The investigation also shed new light on the tactics these companies have used to reshape laws that hindered their growth.In Texas, Springleaf helped persuade lawmakers to allow for higher administrative fees. Springleaf won permission elsewhere to charge the maximum allowable rates \u2014 36 percent in Arizona and Indiana, higher than some credit cards \u2014 to a greater number of loans than ever before. And it pushed legislation allowing it to sell various insurance policies, including life and accidental death and dismemberment, which it lumps into the balance of its loans.In Arizona, Springleaf forged such cozy ties with lawmakers that the two sides became all but inseparable in the bill-writing process. One legislative official emailed Ms. Lundy: \u201cIf there is a specific statute that you want to mirror, please tell me the statute number. Thank you so much!\u201d Another Springleaf lobbyist, when job-hunting, listed the sponsor of the Springleaf bill as an employment reference.In Florida, where Fortress is building the passenger railroad, the firm took advantage of revolving-door politics: political aides becoming lobbyists, and vice versa. When an adviser to the governor moved into the private sector, he advocated for the train project, then returned to the governor\u2019s office as chief of staff.Fortress\u2019s interaction with Los Angeles County was rockier, and it reflected the firm\u2019s complex web of financial interests. Los Angeles County officials believed that Fortress was buying the company responsible for upkeep of public golf courses. The county, swayed by Fortress\u2019s long track record in owning golf courses, approved the deal.There was one problem: Fortress was not the buyer.The Times investigation found that the buyer was the Newcastle Investment Corporation, a different company with no golf experience and a history of financial problems. County officials were surprised to learn the buyer\u2019s identity from The Times.Fortress said there was no need for county officials to worry. Newcastle pays Fortress to manage its business and investments.Wesley Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who co-founded Fortress and is now its co-chairman, also emphasized the positive effects of Fortress\u2019s companies across the American economy. Fortress has replaced poorly performing banks, he pointed out, and has funded projects that no government could afford.\u201cWe are proud of the impact that Fortress-related companies have provided to the individuals and communities that they serve,\u201d Mr. Edens, who is also an owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, said in a statement.In an interview, Mr. Edens said that Fortress did not create Springleaf\u2019s lobbying campaign, but supported it. Springleaf said it needed to raise costs to modify outdated laws and compete with less regulated lenders. And although Springleaf wants to raise costs on borrowers at a time of historically low interest rates, he said that the company was \u201cso much more humane\u201d than others offering high-interest loans.Some customers agree. Joseph King, a Springleaf customer in Glendale, Ariz., said, \u201cThey\u2019ve done right by me,\u201d offering him credit when few others would.Some public agencies also applaud Fortress for creating jobs \u2014 the firm estimates as many as 10,000 with the Florida railroad alone \u2014 and for investing in fields that others abandoned after the financial crisis.Private equity firms, onetime \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d that made their name taking over distressed companies, have pushed into activities previously dominated by banks and local governments. This shift has upended the definition of private equity as the industry expands into real estate, infrastructure and lending.Although that transformation granted private equity new influence over government, Mr. Edens disputed that political connections generated special favors for the firm.\u201cThere is nothing surprising about support these companies have received, given the benefits they deliver to a broad cross section of Americans,\u201d he said.Surrounded by his business partners and his daughters, Wes Edens stepped onto the balcony at the New York Stock Exchange, rang the opening bell and walked away a billionaire. It was Feb. 9, 2007, the day Fortress became the first Wall Street firm with a big private equity business to go public.It was a pivotal moment for Mr. Edens, a Montana native with a mop of blond hair. For private equity, a relative newcomer to modern capitalism, it showed that the industry had arrived.Everywhere includes the government. The amount the private equity industry spent on lobbying in 2015 was more than triple what it had spent a decade earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At the peak of the financial crisis, the figure was even higher. Political donations have increased nearly sixfold. Former House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s chief of staff is now president of the industry\u2019s lobbying group.That group, the American Investment Council, argues that the public has benefited from private equity. Pension funds have reaped 12 percent net returns from private equity over a recent 10-year period, the group said.\u201cPrivate equity funds have an aligned interest with their investors to produce strong returns,\u201d said Bronwyn Bailey of the American Investment Council.The group also noted that the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, subjected private equity fund managers to additional oversight from regulators. Yet the group is lobbying the House to pass legislation that would unwind some of those requirements, government records reviewed by The Times show, underscoring the industry\u2019s newfound influence.Fortress\u2019s 2010 takeover of Springleaf, the subprime lender, further illustrates private equity\u2019s evolution from niche industry into one of Wall Street\u2019s most influential players. It also shows how a firm\u2019s influence can flow from the companies it owns.Springleaf\u2019s businesses were previously in the hands of the American International Group and Citigroup, two Wall Street powerhouses that needed billions of dollars in government bailouts to survive. Since buying Springleaf, Fortress has turned its $124 million investment into a stake valued at $1.9 billion.The lender\u2019s lobbying underpins some of that growth. In state house after state house, Springleaf lobbyists secured legislative victories, allowing the company to raise costs on borrowers.Springleaf argued that its successes were not particularly sweeping, noting that it lost in at least two states. \u201cBecause many state legislators don\u2019t have sufficient legislative staffs or staff members with subject-matter expertise, if you want something done, you sometimes have to write the first draft yourself,\u201d said John Anderson, an executive vice president at Springleaf. \u201cIt is unusual for legislation we propose to be enacted verbatim.\u201dOne of Springleaf\u2019s arguments to lawmakers has been that, without legislative changes, it would need to close more branches \u2014 driving borrowers to payday lenders. In 2008, Springleaf said, it had 21 Arizona branches, and at the time of the 2014 legislation seven remained.In contrast with higher-cost payday lenders, Springleaf offers installment loans that typically are larger and last longer. After buying its largest competitor last year and rebranding as OneMain Financial, the company is now the nation\u2019s largest installment lender.Springleaf charges more than banks because its customers are riskier bets. According to Mr. Anderson, who says he reads every complaint that customers submit to regulators, Springleaf caps rates at 36 percent. The average Springleaf loan totals about $6,093 and costs 26 percent, plus fees.At a Springleaf branch in a Phoenix strip mall, Gary Hundley agreed to pay nearly 36 percent on much of his roughly $4,500 loan. He also took out unemployment and life insurance policies from Springleaf.Mr. Hundley repaid an earlier Springleaf loan, he said, and planned to chip away at the second, when medical problems forced him to miss work. About a month after taking out the second Springleaf loan, Mr. Hundley filed for bankruptcy, largely because of other debts unrelated to Springleaf.Springleaf then sued him, arguing that he had never intended to repay. As a result, Mr. Hundley is still liable for part of the debt, according to his lawyer, Anthony Clark, who said Springleaf \u201cis no stranger to bringing these kinds of suits.\u201d\u201cI was overwhelmed, but I planned to pay,\u201d said Mr. Hundley, who had no trouble obtaining Springleaf loans despite previously declaring bankruptcy.Springleaf noted that in other bankruptcy cases it has agreed to lower payments. And it is within the company\u2019s rights to sue.But Springleaf has occasionally straddled a legal line, records and interviews show.Consider the company\u2019s insurance business. Although Springleaf\u2019s life insurance and other policies are voluntary \u2014 and the company fully refunds premiums to borrowers who cancel their policies within 30 days \u2014 some policies are opened without customers\u2019 approving them at the time.For instance, if a borrower pledges a car as collateral for a loan, but the auto insurance appears to have lapsed or is insufficient, Springleaf can impose its own insurance. Although Springleaf warns borrowers beforehand, and routinely cancels its coverage once they obtain an adequate policy, Springleaf acknowledged in a public filing that \u201cbecause our customers do not affirmatively consent\u201d to the insurance when it is purchased, \u201cregulators may in the future prohibit\u201d it.Some borrowers have separately complained to regulators that Springleaf embellished the collateral underpinning their loans.Lisa Williams, a 50-year-old administrative assistant in Winston-Salem, N.C., noticed an irregularity after receiving a roughly $3,700 Springleaf loan: A lawn mower she posted as collateral was valued at $800.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that that old thing was worth $800,\u201d she said, giggling. A similar new mower retails for about $300.Loren Finnell, a mechanic in Tempe, Ariz., said he obtained a loan in 2014 after Springleaf listed a Dell computer and accessories worth $2,000. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a Dell. They were making it up.\u201dFor Sheila Fargnoli, of Tucson, getting a loan from Springleaf was like a game of Mad Libs. A Springleaf employee, she recalled, asked questions like, \u201cYou must have a computer, right?\u201d The employee also asked about musical instruments, but Ms. Fargnoli said she had previously sold her guitar for $1 at a yard sale.Nonetheless, Springleaf listed the guitar as collateral in the loan documents, Ms. Fargnoli noticed. She accused Springleaf in court papers of pressuring her to \u201cmisrepresent the value\u201d of collateral, which Springleaf did not dispute.Springleaf said that the problems were isolated and that it had curtailed the use of household items as collateral. It also now prohibits using anything of immaterial value \u2014 say, a $1 guitar \u2014 to secure loans.The complaints have emerged as Springleaf presses its statehouse lobbying campaign.\u201cJust in case you needed a little light reading, attached is the draft legislation that Springleaf would like to move forward,\u201d Ms. Lundy, the Arizona lobbyist, emailed a Republican aide.Springleaf asked Representative T. J. Shope, a Republican, to sponsor the bill. And when a consumer advocate, Cynthia Zwick, published an op-ed article opposing the bill, Ms. Lundy contacted Mr. Shope to say, \u201cYou should do a response.\u201d Later she added, \u201cLet\u2019s work on one tomorrow.\u201dMs. Lundy also testified at hearings alongside Mr. Shope. Unable to answer a question, Mr. Shope deferred to Ms. Lundy. The lobbyist, he added, was \u201chere to answer a lot of the technical questions.\u201dNot all of Ms. Lundy\u2019s statements were accurate. In a \u201cfact sheet\u201d to lawmakers, she claimed that \u201csimilar legislation has passed in numerous states\u201d with \u201conly one state having opposition from one consumer advocacy group, none from AARP.\u201d Yet consumer advocates opposed the legislation in Florida and Indiana, and AARP attacked it in North Carolina.Springleaf said it was unaware of the opposition at the time. Ms. Lundy and Mr. Shope declined to comment.Their bill\u2019s passage coincided with what Representative Debbie McCune Davis, an Arizona Democrat who opposed the bill, called \u201cwining and dining.\u201dSpringleaf\u2019s lobbyists treated Mr. Shope to \u201cfood or beverages\u201d soon after the bill passed, lobbying records show. And about a week after the Arizona bill passed, an email circulated in the House, alerting staff members that \u201cdinner is courtesy of\u201d Ms. Lundy.After similar legislation passed in North Carolina, Springleaf held a dinner for more than a dozen state lawmakers and their staff members. Still, some Democratic officials lamented the bill\u2019s impact on borrowers.\u201cIt\u2019s like needing a life preserver and getting an anvil,\u201d said Roy Cooper, the North Carolina attorney general.Around the country, local officials opened letters from the American Golf Corporation, which managed their public golf courses. Fortress was buying the company, the letters announced.That seemed to be good news.American Golf\u2019s letters, which Fortress helped draft, promoted Fortress\u2019s \u201cconsiderable experience with companies like ours.\u201d Some officials also received a document, stamped with Fortress\u2019s logo, citing the firm\u2019s ownership of other golf courses and its \u201cfirsthand experience\u201d owning companies that form partnerships with local governments. To seal the 2013 deal, the letters included Fortress\u2019s annual report showing its \u201csubstantial resources.\u201dThe pitch worked.Parks department officials in New York City, and in Ventura County and San Dimas, Calif., promptly signed off on the deal. Los Angeles County took longer to scrutinize Fortress\u2019s background before granting approval.But none of the officials had the full story. The buyer was not Fortress, but Newcastle Investment Corporation, The Times found in filings. The distinction \u2014 Newcastle is a different company with a close business relationship to Fortress \u2014 suggests that complex corporate structures can confuse governments and benefit private equity.All four parks departments said they were not told about Newcastle until contacted by The Times. Fortress and American Golf \u201cshould have fully disclosed accurate and complete information,\u201d Los Angeles County officials said in a statement.If they had examined Newcastle, officials might have seen red flags. Newcastle had suffered a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in internal controls two years earlier and received a \u201cfinancial health grade\u201d of D from the independent investment research firm Morningstar. In securities filings Newcastle acknowledged, \u201cWe have never owned or operated a golf business.\u201dUnder Newcastle, American Golf took over some courses from competitors that were failing to pay rent.And yet, during Newcastle\u2019s tenure, American Golf may not always benefit Los Angeles County. If Newcastle again runs into financial trouble, American Golf might have to be sold once more, a process that could eat up more government resources.American Golf, which must pay the county a cut of what it makes on carts and other golfing gear, also recently created a program that effectively minimizes some of those payments. Golfers who join the program do not pay for certain items that would be lucrative for the county. The program classifies the membership fee under driving ranges, which typically require a smaller payment to the county.Fortress, which argues that the program has attracted more golfers to the county, has benefited from the arrangement. Because Newcastle, and not Fortress, was the buyer, Fortress can enjoy the upside of American Golf without much risk. It works like this: Newcastle pays Fortress a fee to manage Newcastle\u2019s business. But Fortress does not own a majority stake in Newcastle. So, if American Golf proves unprofitable, Fortress still collects fees from Newcastle, while avoiding major losses.These deals are a source of revenue for Fortress, whose executives have created five other companies like Newcastle. Last year, Fortress received more than $200 million in revenue from these companies, about a 50 percent jump from the year before.The golf course deal could serve as a cautionary tale for both private equity firms and the growing number of governments doing business with them. Unlike a typical private equity deal, transactions with public agencies call for greater transparency.Fortress, which has not been accused of wrongdoing by the governments, argues that it was transparent in the golf deal. The firm said it was speaking on behalf of Newcastle, which relies on it for day-to-day management. Although Newcastle has its own shareholders and board, Fortress is responsible for the company\u2019s management, investments and other business decisions.In a statement, Fortress said that \u201cthere is no mystery about who owns American Golf\u201d because it \u201cis very clear\u201d in Newcastle\u2019s securities filings.But these filings were published after the local governments approved the deal.Fortress also pointed to a document labeled \u201cdraft,\u201d which it said American Golf emailed to one Los Angeles County official, making reference to \u201cNewcastle Investment Corp. and other funds.\u201dThat official said he had no record of receiving the email. American Golf acknowledged that it had not sent the document to other towns.\u201cIt\u2019s like being told you were getting a big red fire truck and then it turns out you get a little red wagon,\u201d said Eric Preven, a TV producer who ran for public office in Los Angeles. With the help of his brother Joshua, a teacher, he first raised suspicions about the American Golf deal more than two years ago.Still, the quality of golf courses has not suffered since Newcastle bought American Golf, Los Angeles County said. Officials often vote an American Golf course best in the county.Newcastle and American Golf don\u2019t own the courses. Instead, as part of an outsourcing plan, American Golf manages operations, making money every time a golfer tees off.Even before Newcastle bought American Golf from Goldman Sachs, it retained a well-connected local lobbyist: Matt Knabe, whose father is Don Knabe, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. American Golf hosts the Knabe Cup, an annual youth tournament named in honor of the senior Mr. Knabe.His son\u2019s lobbying firm, when questioned by local media about the relationship, has previously said there is no conflict because \u201cMatt does not lobby\u201d his father. There is no indication the Knabes directed American Golf to play down Newcastle\u2019s role.In 2013, Don Knabe and the county board approved the sale of American Golf. At the time, the board appeared impressed with Fortress\u2019s track record in working closely with local governments \u2014 citing in particular a letter from a Florida official praising Fortress.In that letter, the official from Florida\u2019s Department of Transportation said he \u201chad the pleasure\u201d of working alongside Fortress in building a passenger railway known as All Aboard Florida.12 PhotosAlong a 200-mile stretch of Florida\u2019s eastern coast, Fortress is embarking on its boldest project yet: the nation\u2019s only purely private intercity passenger railroad.The project, All Aboard Florida, is expected to take five years and nearly $3 billion to build. At speeds reaching 100 miles an hour, it plans to eventually carry passengers from Miami to Orlando, with stops in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.And if trains start rolling next year, as planned, and prove successful, the project may provide a template for private investment in public infrastructure for years to come.Yet this ambitious private project hinged on the blessing of government officials.The administration of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida conditionally agreed to lease out state property to All Aboard Florida, which plans to share the track with an existing freight train company. Federal regulators, after some initial concerns, concluded that the railroad\u2019s safety plans met their standards. And a state-authorized nonprofit approved tax-free bonds that can help finance All Aboard Florida\u2019s business.Fortress, which owns both the passenger train and the freight rail, secured these victories through a mix of negotiations, public support, political power and a revolving door between the government and the private sector.Documents obtained through public records requests pull back a curtain on the lobbying that shaped the project. The documents, many previously unreported, spotlight the role played by Governor Scott\u2019s aides.The governor\u2019s former campaign manager teamed up with one of his former policy advisers to coordinate All Aboard Florida\u2019s media strategy and meetings with the governor\u2019s administration. They found a receptive audience, including an aide to Governor Scott who texted a Fortress employee, \u201cLet me know if I can be helpful.\u201dFortress stands to benefit from the project in several ways.The firm owns All Aboard Florida\u2019s parent company, as well as the freight train operator sharing the track, which means it would profit from All Aboard Florida\u2019s success. Fortress also controls land around the track, where it is developing rental housing. And even if the passenger rail flops, Fortress might benefit from All Aboard Florida\u2019s track upgrades, which would enable its freight operator to carry more cargo at quicker speeds.(Fortress disputes this point, arguing that the upgrades are not needed to improve its freight operations.)Not everyone will benefit.Along Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast \u2014 oceanfront counties that include some of the state\u2019s richest and poorest areas \u2014 some residents worry that the train will disrupt their lives. In one county, the sheriff argued that the trains, 32 each day, \u201ccould have life-threatening implications\u201d if they stranded patrol cars on one side of the tracks as trains passed. A hospital executive warned about ambulances idling at crossings. Two counties sued to halt the tax-free bonds.Some residents also express a deeper concern: The train is literally passing them by. Towns without stops will get the headaches of rail traffic rumbling through, without the economic benefits.In Gifford, a low-income community pockmarked with abandoned homes, residents say they already live on the wrong side of the tracks. Fortress\u2019s freight trains park there to exchange crews, delaying traffic and prompting local outcry.Fortress sees it differently, arguing that the freight trains stop there because it is safe to do so. Mr. Edens, who said the passenger line was open to adding more stops, remarked that \u201cthe handful of opponents of the project are focused on their own narrow self-interests, not the greater good.\u201dWhile critics say All Aboard Florida is unnecessary \u2014 a small number of Amtrak trains already travel from Miami to Orlando \u2014 Mr. Edens said it had the potential to revitalize local economies because mass transit is \u201cone of the real cornerstones of economic growth.\u201d He called it a \u201creal guidepost for how we can actually bring passenger trains back to the United States.\u201dConcerns that the new trains could cause traffic delays are unfounded, he said, citing data estimating that All Aboard Florida trains would take 45 seconds to clear crossings. All Aboard Florida said that it would be the only railroad in the country to operate \u201cin full compliance with the latest and most stringent\u201d federal safety requirements, and that it would help reduce car travel in the state.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about seconds,\u201d Mr. Edens said, adding that it was \u201cnot a meaningful\u201d amount of time.William D. Snyder, the sheriff of Martin County, disagreed. \u201cIn my business, seconds absolutely matter,\u201d he said.The train\u2019s opponents dispute some of All Aboard Florida\u2019s data about how long the trains will block intersections, saying the company\u2019s assessment is based on best-case assumptions. Bob Solari, a commissioner in Indian River County, said that All Aboard Florida did not in \u201cany meaningful way protect the people and property of the Treasure Coast.\u201dThe safety concerns, however, did not ruin the railroad project, thanks in part to some political arm-twisting.All Aboard Florida took shape after Governor Scott rejected $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money for high-speed rail between Orlando and Tampa, saying it made Florida taxpayers liable for losses. That decision, in 2011, effectively helped clear a path for an alternative train, though All Aboard Florida was still in its infancy at the time.Adam Hollingsworth was one of the governor\u2019s aides involved in the decision to reject the stimulus money, emails show. At the time, he was a volunteer policy adviser. Months later, he went to work for one of All Aboard Florida\u2019s sister companies.To push for the Fortress railway, Mr. Hollingsworth initially coordinated with Susan Wiles, Governor Scott\u2019s former campaign manager. The railway also retained a lawyer who had previously worked for a government agency from which it needed a permit.This team\u2019s background was helpful to All Aboard Florida, records show.The day before Mr. Edens of Fortress was to meet with the governor\u2019s office, Mr. Hollingsworth texted a staff member. \u201cYou met Wes at the gov\u2019s Christmas party,\u201d he reminded her, referring to Mr. Edens.After the meeting, Mr. Hollingsworth wrote the aide: \u201cThank you! I am glad you and the gov were favorable inclined.\u201dMr. Hollingsworth followed up when All Aboard Florida was about to announce its plans publicly. The aide responded, \u201cGreat news!\u201dAbout four months later, Mr. Hollingsworth resumed working for the governor\u2019s office, as chief of staff. Ethics rules prevented him from having further involvement with the train.Mr. Hollingsworth did not respond to requests for comment. Ms. Wiles praised him, saying he had honored his recusal. All Aboard Florida said it \u201cdid not need nor use Adam\u201d beyond the scope of his duties, noting that it hired Ballard Partners, a prominent Florida lobbying firm.A spokeswoman for Governor Scott added that the state did not finance All Aboard Florida.Still, the company has benefited from government support. In addition to various regulatory approvals, All Aboard Florida has applied for funding from the federal railroad agency. And it accepted about $9 million in federal funds.In the future, it hopes to fund itself through bonds approved by the Florida Development Finance Corporation, a state-authorized nonprofit. The bonds are tax-exempt, but All Aboard Florida, not the government, is responsible for repaying them.Last year, the nonprofit\u2019s board approved the bonds, which All Aboard Florida has yet to issue. Here, too, lobbying was at work.Before the board held a crucial hearing on the bonds, an All Aboard Florida representative emailed one of the board\u2019s new members a reminder to submit the paperwork by close of business the next day \u201cin order to get confirmed by the Senate.\u201dThe email added, \u201cCan I help with this?\u201dBen Protess reported from Phoenix and Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Rachel Abrams reported from New York.

{"Headline": "We\u2019re Better Than That", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byMore than a century ago, in the first attempts to shape the face of a nation open to people from all nations, the United States banned convicts, prostitutes and Chinese laborers from landing on our shores. Later, \u201cidiots\u201d were added to the list of forbidden immigrants. Alas, it was too early keep Donald Trump at bay.But on this upcoming Independence Day, at a time when Trump\u2019s response to our better angels is to go small, mean and tribal, an American ideal is in peril. Not open borders, which is something the United States hasn\u2019t had since 1875, but open minds.In committing economic suicide, Britain is trying to close the door and hide from the world. It felt good, no doubt, to tell those overbearing bureaucrats in Brussels to bugger off. We\u2019ll stick with our bangers and mash without any interference from Europe! But the Brexit vote was also a drunken swing at those \u201cothers\u201d remaking the image of a lost England. To hear the haters tell it, \u201cPolish vermin\u201d and brown-skinned hordes have overwhelmed the little island nation.Trump wants us to follow the Brits into a corner of isolation \u2014 by race, religion and trade. His philosophy, the rant of a besotted boob making things up in public, is anti-American at its core. In rejecting our former colonial masters, we threw off monarchy, the class system and a state religion. We opened our doors to all nations, all religions, all opinions.The New World can certainly learn much from the Old World. But the sun never sets on a stupid idea. And this vote to stop the spinning globe and get off at 1952 is among the stupidest. Britain is cracking up now because it followed the crackpots. The United States could make the same mistake \u2014 rejecting free trade, and rejecting a welcome mat for free people.Today, about 13 percent of Britain is foreign-born. What\u2019s disruptive, especially in the timeless tableau of rural England, is that the number of immigrants has more than doubled since 1993. That\u2019s what caused some of the open hatred in the campaign to leave the European Union. Trump is playing with that same fire now.In place of Lady Liberty, Trump would build a wall, trigger a huge recession and apply a religious test to entry. He would do this, he says, because \u201cwe are losing everything in this country\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t know who these people are\u201d \u2014 that is, these people coming to our shores.But in fact, we do know a great deal about the 42 million immigrants here, legal and illegal. A majority of them came before 2000. Almost 30 percent of those over the age of 25 have college degrees \u2014 roughly equal to the population as a whole. India, China, Mexico, the Philippines and Canada are the top countries of origin.Among the new Americans are a deranged few who kill for religion. These Islamic fanatics should be rooted out, isolated and of course kept away from assault rifles. But Trump has tried to equate immigration in general, and free trade, with fear of both homegrown terror and the new global economy. He\u2019s counting on the same contagion of stupidity that infected Britain to carry him.Look at the Pittsburgh area, where Trump chose this week to stand in front of a wall of compacted garbage to make his case for a trade war that could cost Americans at least three million jobs. The city of Pittsburgh has lost more than half its population since 1950, and is the only major metro area with more deaths than births.No amount of Make America Great sloganeering will bring back the old industrial base. Pittsburgh is banking on immigrants, and a brain economy tied to global trade and education, to rebound. The city\u2019s official Welcoming Pittsburgh campaign specifically targets the very people Trump has demonized. And it seems to be working, a bright spot in landscape of decline. Of late, Hispanic migration to western Pennsylvania is double the national average.These new residents will wave flags on the Fourth of July, eat too much charred food, and hear something amid the bombs bursting in air of what makes America truly great. It\u2019s grounded in hope, instead of hate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Election, a Landslide for Abe, Could Allow a Bolder Military", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 The Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has governed Japan in one way or another for all but four of the past 61 years, a winning record that reflects the political inertia of a society that values stability and tradition.In China, Xinhua, the state news agency, warned in a commentary on Monday that the election results \u201ccould pose a danger to Japan and regional stability.\u201dExperts say that Mr. Abe\u2019s governing coalition will not be able to push through constitutional revisions immediately, given that some of the partners have differing opinions on what needs to be amended and how. For example, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 main ally, a small Buddhist party, has said that it opposes changes to the clause that renounces war. At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Abe said that he intended to press for debate on constitutional revision, though he acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not so easy\u201d and added, \u201cI expect the discussion will be deepened.\u201dMr. Abe\u2019s party, in a draft proposal of a revised Constitution, has also recommended amendments to the clause on freedom of speech and the press that could limit these rights in cases deemed dangerous to the public interest. Another proposal would expand emergency powers for the prime minister. Any revision would need to be approved by a majority in a public referendum.But the party\u2019s victory on Sunday appears to have less to do with its proposals and more to do with the disarray in the opposition Democratic Party.\u201cThe people\u2019s distrust towards the Democratic Party is very high,\u201d said Lully Miura, a lecturer on international politics at Tokyo University. \u201cIn 2009, the Democratic Party won the government, but they failed and failed and failed, and even once-supporters of the Democratic Party now distrust them.\u201d\u201cProbably the opposition parties pushed too much on the constitutional issue as a political agenda,\u201d said Koji Murata, a professor of international relations at Doshisha University in Kyoto who supports constitutional changes. \u201cBut people didn\u2019t care about the constitutional agenda in this upper-house election.\u201dToshio Ogawa, an opposition candidate from Tokyo who narrowly won a seat, said voters might have had a hard time understanding how his party\u2019s economic plans differed from those of the Liberal Democrats. But, he said, \u201cI knew that Abe\u2019s real goals were security and the Constitution. So I thought I had to point it out clearly.\u201dCritics said Mr. Abe\u2019s party deliberately played down its agenda on constitutional change. Some also accused the Japanese news media, particularly the public broadcaster, NHK, of conspiring to help the governing party and failing to air enough information about the issues at stake in the election.Voters seemed more interested in staying the course and giving Mr. Abe\u2019s economic policies more time to yield results than in the debate over rewriting Japan\u2019s pacifist policies.\u201cI want them to accelerate their economic policy to increase more jobs and improve social welfare,\u201d said Akemi Machida, 29, who voted for Liberal Democratic candidates at a polling station in Sagamihara, a suburban town southwest of Tokyo. As for the opposition, she said, \u201cThere were no particular alternatives besides the L.D.P., whose policies sounded more convincing.\u201dOpinion polls show a majority of respondents in Japan oppose Mr. Abe\u2019s security policies. But when the news media conducts these surveys, the questions are often vague.\u201cThe opinion polls ask whether there is a need to revise the Constitution at all,\u201d said Yasuo Hasebe, a constitutional scholar at Waseda University. \u201cThis is quite a strange question. People can\u2019t answer that question before knowing which clause and in what way this change will be made.\u201dThe very language used to describe constitutional revision may also confuse voters.\u201cIn Japanese, the word for revise, \u2018kaisei,\u2019 gives an impression that something is improved or made better,\u201d said Minako Saigo, 28, a mother of three children in Kyoto who founded Mothers Against War last July to protest legislation that gave the military some powers to fight in foreign conflicts for the first time since World War II.\u201cPeople stop thinking,\u201d Ms. Saigo added. \u201cThey don\u2019t question what will happen next.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese will fear that Abe will find a way to work the system to his advantage,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. At a regular news briefing on Monday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, said that China and other Asian countries were \u201cconcerned about political moves in Japan\u201d because of its past military action in the region.In South Korea, an editorial in Munhwa Ilbo, a right-leaning newspaper, said the election results \u201copened the door for a Japan that can go to war,\u201d though it added that a rearmed country \u201cwill also help deter North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and check the rising military power of China.\u201dWhile constitutional change may be a long way off, some analysts said they worried the consequences of Sunday\u2019s election were more fundamental.\u201cDemocracy needs a system of checks and balances,\u201d Gerald L. Curtis, a professor of political science at Columbia University, wrote in an email. \u201cBut if the opposition parties are impotent and the L.D.P. is firmly under Abe\u2019s control, that system will be weakened to an unprecedented degree.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jane Perlez from Beijing, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yogurt Plant\u2019s Closing Prompts Questions on Cuomo\u2019s Economic Growth Plans", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byBATAVIA, N.Y. \u2014 It was meant to be the Colosseum of yogurt plants: a sprawling $200 million testament to the popularity and economic potential of fermented milk, nearly the size of five football fields and no less patriotic, with an American flag and one of New York State.Those flags are now about the only thing moving at the M\u00fcller Quaker Dairy plant here, a gleaming and currently inert factory that opened with a splash in 2013, but was unceremoniously shut down less than three years later.\u201cThey promise you the world,\u201d said Patricia O\u2019Geen, a lifetime Batavian who said she considered herself fortunate to have a good job at a local pumping company. \u201cAnd they never come through.\u201dState and local officials are confident that the plant will reopen soon with a new owner and new hiring. Still, more than 100 people lost their jobs in December \u2014 just before Christmas \u2014 despite a generous raft of state and county tax credits given to the plant, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, had trumpeted as \u201canother strong boost to the region\u2019s growing dairy industry.\u201dThe comptroller\u2019s office concluded that the Empire State Development Corporation, the state\u2019s chief economic development agency that administers the Excelsior program, had lowered the job-creation threshold \u2014 to 127 from 186 \u2014 so the company could qualify for the tax breaks in 2013 and 2014.But the yogurt plant was hardly the only project to prompt questions from auditors, who cited several other instances in which the development agency adjusted job creation requirements for tax breaks, as hiring proved less robust than expected.\u201cThis administration\u2019s multiprong economic development strategy,\u201d namely Excelsior and Start-Up NY, will eventually produce 50,000 new jobs and more than $4 billion in private investment statewide, said Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State.He characterized the comptroller\u2019s Excelsior report as \u201cflawed and inaccurate.\u201d\u201cThe comptroller is entitled to his own opinions, which are all over the report, but not his own facts,\u201d Mr. Conwall said.The agency points out that it is within its legal rights to lower the job-creation goals under the program as approved by the State Legislature.But the comptroller\u2019s office argues that the manner in which the credits were applied \u2014 retroactively and internally \u2014 was not transparent, and that such lowering of job-creation goals defeats the central tenet of the program, a carrot-and-stick approach meant to reward companies only after they fulfill their job promises.The comptroller\u2019s report did little to shake development officials\u2019 confidence in the program: Last Tuesday, the governor announced another Excelsior deal, with the state offering tax breaks to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods to move more than 400 jobs to the state\u2019s economically troubled Southern Tier.Still, the back-to-back critiques of Start-Up New York and Excelsior have resurrected longstanding questions about whether government subsidies for businesses in general \u2014 and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s in particular \u2014 are a good way to spend taxpayer money.\u201cIt\u2019s Groundhog Day in terms of the recurring problems surfacing there,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks state tax-break programs.Indeed, many who recall the tax-incentive programs that came before Start-Up and Excelsior, including the Empire Zones program created in the late 1980s, said the latest generation of subsidies has replicated some of the old issues, including favoritism and a lack of accountability.No one is suggesting that Mr. Cuomo has not focused on the sluggish state of the upstate economy. And while Excelsior is in its sixth year, slightly predating Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration, some say that Start-Up New York may deserve more time to prove itself.\u201cOne of my criticisms is that short-term thinking in politics is the same pathological thinking as in business,\u201d said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. \u201cLong-term thinking is a good idea, and it\u2019s important to encourage it. Now, how much time is enough time, I don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. DiNapoli agrees that it may be too early to judge Start-Up New York, but said he was frustrated by the way his recommendations for the Excelsior program had been received by Empire State.\u201cWhen an agency response is like \u2018You\u2019re all wet, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 they are certainly not taking the suggestions in the instructive way in which they are intended,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said.In Batavia, signs of longstanding economic struggles are evident. In decades past, the city had been a commuter hub for major employers like Xerox and Kodak in Rochester, about 35 miles to the northeast; those companies are now much diminished. The city\u2019s main drag is still holding on to its small shops, restaurants and at least two employment agencies.But inside Batavia\u2019s main civic building, which includes its city hall, several businesses have closed their doors, leaving vacancies and hints of healthier times. \u201cThere is no problem,\u201d one sign at an empty shop says, \u201ca plate of warm cookies can\u2019t solve.\u201dAgriculture has always been the primary engine of the economy here, and milk production is a big part of that, said Jay A. Gsell, the Genesee County manager and budget officer, who added that he hoped the new owner of the plant \u2014 Dairy Farmers of America \u2014 will soon reopen it. The company, based in Kansas City, Mo., said in a statement that it is \u201cevaluating future uses\u201d for the plant and will share details \u201conce it\u2019s been determined.\u201dAnd while the sudden closing of the plant was an unpleasant surprise, Mr. Gsell said local leaders still believed in the underlying idea of capitalizing on local dairy farmers to build a yogurt industry here, in part because of an ample natural resource.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of land,\u201d he said.Mr. Conwall echoed this in justifying the use of tax credits. \u201cAt the end of the day, the state invested $560,000 to support the construction of a privately funded $210 million facility, which, while this company made the decision to no longer operate, will continue to employ New Yorkers under a new owner,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the state\u2019s support, this plant \u2014 and the jobs created to build and staff it \u2014 would not be here.\u201dAs for what happened to the high hopes and tax breaks that accompanied the opening of M\u00fcller Quaker, Mr. Gsell said its demise was still a mystery.\u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d he said, \u201cthey just decided it wasn\u2019t working.\u201dJesse McKinley reported from Batavia, and Vivian Yee from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Doesn\u2019t Understand About the Trade Deficit", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThis is an updated version of an article that first ran on March 27, 2016. One consistent theme from Donald J. Trump in his campaign for the presidency is this: The United States is losing at trade, and the trade deficit is the evidence.\u201cWe\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cSo we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s smart to me.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, eliminating the trade deficit would not, on its own, make America great again, as Mr. Trump promises. In fact, trying to eliminate the trade deficit could mean giving up some of the key levers of power that allow the United States to get its way in international politics.Getting rid of the trade deficit could very well make America less great. The reasons have to do with the global reserve currency, economic diplomacy and something called the Triffin dilemma.Imagine a world where there are only two countries, and only two products. One country makes cars; the other grows bananas.People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation.That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus.But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u201closing\u201d to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLandites got a lot of them in exchange for their money.Similarly, it\u2019s true that the United States has a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, for example. But it\u2019s not as if Americans were just flinging money across the Rio Grande out of charity. Americans get a lot of good stuff for that: avocados, for example, and Canc\u00fan vacations.If you want to think of it in terms of winners and losers, in fact, you could justifiably reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred framing: \u201cThose losers in Mexico gave us $58 billion more stuff than we gave them last year. Ha, ha, ha. We\u2019re winners.\u201dMaybe.It is true that a trade deficit subtracts from a country\u2019s gross domestic product. G.D.P. measures the value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, so when a country is selling less stuff abroad than it buys from abroad, the country is making less stuff, and as a result there are fewer jobs. This piece of the Trump theory of trade is true.But when a country runs a trade deficit, as the United States does, there is a countervailing force. Think back to our pretend countries. BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit with CarNation. But that means that car producers in CarNation are sitting on an extra $1 million a year in income.Something has to happen with that $1 million, and both of the two options have consequences.One option is to keep that money at home. But keeping that money inside CarNation will push the value of its currency upward. And as its currency goes up, cars will become more expensive in BananaLand \u2014 causing people there to buy fewer of them until eventually the trade deficit is eliminated.If CarNation doesn\u2019t want its currency to rise, it has to take that $1 million trade surplus and plow it back into BananaLand. There are different ways it could do that. People in CarNation could buy stocks or bonds in BananaLand, or companies in CarNation could invest in factories in BananaLand, or the government of CarNation could buy assets directly.The choice is stark: A country running a trade surplus must either let its currency rise or let money flow back to its trading partners.This isn\u2019t just an abstraction. It\u2019s what has happened between the United States and China for the last couple of decades. China has had consistent trade surpluses, but it did not want its currency to rise in a way that would undermine its exporters. So money has flowed from China into the United States \u2014 both from the Chinese government\u2019s purchases of United States Treasury bonds and more recently in the form of direct investment from Chinese companies into the United States.So does a trade deficit mean fewer jobs? It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.It depends on what the country does with the investment that comes in.In theory, that money could go toward long-lasting investments with positive economic returns: new factories and equipment; education for the work force; and new roads and bridges, or repairs and improvements to existing ones.Unfortunately, how countries use these capital inflows is not always so good. In the United States, the influx of foreign capital in the mid-2000s went in large part to fuel an unsustainable housing and mortgage bubble. Greece\u2019s capital inflows in the same time period went to fund bloated public spending.When the world is flinging money at you, it\u2019s important to use it for something productive. It\u2019s not that trade deficits (and the capital inflows that are their flip side) don\u2019t matter \u2014 but just knowing the numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much about whether they are good, bad or indifferent.It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s even an option, because the dollar isn\u2019t used just in trade between the United States and other countries.The dollar is a global reserve currency, meaning that it is used around the world in transactions that have nothing to do with the United States. When a Malaysian company does business with a German company, in many cases it will do business in dollars; when wealthy people in Dubai or Singapore\u2019s government investment fund want to sock away money, they do so in large part in dollar assets.That creates upward pressure on the dollar for reasons unrelated to trade flows between the United States and its partners. That, in turn, makes the dollar stronger, and American exporters less competitive, than they would be in a world where nobody used the dollar for anything except commerce involving the United States.The roughly $500 billion trade deficit that the United States runs each year isn\u2019t just about poorly negotiated trade deals and currency manipulation by this or that country. It\u2019s also, to some degree, a byproduct of the central role the United States plays in the global financial system.There\u2019s even a name for this: the Triffin dilemma. In the mid-20th century, the economist Robert Triffin warned that the provider of the global reserve currency would need to run perpetual trade deficits to keep the world financial system from freezing, with those trade deficits potentially fueling domestic booms and busts.The key idea is that if a President Trump or any other future leader really wants to reduce our trade deficits in a major way, that leader is going to have to rethink the very underpinnings of global finance.Be careful what you wish for.There\u2019s no doubt that maintaining the global reserve currency creates costs for the United States, namely a less competitive export industry.But it also creates a lot of advantages. Lower interest rates and higher stock prices are among them (though they have the downside of also feeding debt-driven booms and busts). Even more important is what the dollar\u2019s prominence in global finance does for America\u2019s place in the world.It helps ensure that the United States can afford to finance wars, and it gives the government greater ability to fight recessions and panics. A country experiencing a banking panic will see money sent out of the country, causing its currency to fall and its interest rates to rise. All that limits a government\u2019s options for fixing the problem. In 2008, when the United States experienced a near collapse of the banking system, the opposite happened.The centrality of the dollar to global finance gives the United States power on the global stage that no other country can match. It has enforced sanctions on Iran, Russia, North Korea and terrorist groups with the implicit threat of cutting off access to the dollar payments system for any bank in the world that does not cooperate with American foreign policy.Part of what makes the United States powerful is the great importance of the dollar to global finance. And part of the price the United States pays for that status is a stronger currency and higher trade deficits than would be the case otherwise.The debate over the trade deficit is about more than Mexico and China, cars and bananas, or winning and losing. It\u2019s about what makes America great, and which of the country\u2019s priorities should come first.Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article was first published in March and was updated to reflect Donald Trump\u2019s most recent comments on the trade deficit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Benjamin Netanyahu Is Crushing Israel\u2019s Free Press", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn its annual report released this spring, Freedom House, an American democracy advocacy organization, downgraded Israel\u2019s freedom of the press ranking from \u201cfree\u201d to \u201cpartly free.\u201d To anyone following Israeli news media over the past year and a half, this was hardly surprising. Freedom House focused primarily on the \u201cunchecked expansion\u201d of paid content in editorial pages, as well as on the outsize influence of Israel Hayom (\u201cIsrael Today\u201d), a free daily newspaper owned by the American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and widely believed to promote the views of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel Hayom\u2019s bias is well documented. A 2013 investigative report on Israeli television revealed drafts of several articles written by the paper\u2019s journalists that had been systematically changed by the editor in chief to remove criticism of the prime minister. For a newspaper to have a political agenda is, of course, nothing new. But Israel Hayom isn\u2019t conservative or right wing in the broad sense. Rather, the paper megaphones whatever is in the interest of the prime minister. Naftali Bennett, a far-right government minister, has said \u201cIsrael Hayom is Pravda \u2014 the mouthpiece of one man.\u201dIn many ways, the Freedom House report missed the real worrying shifts. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to control the country\u2019s pages and airwaves go much further than Israel Hayom. For the past 18 months, in addition to his prime ministerial duties, he has served as Israel\u2019s communications minister (as well as its foreign minister, economy minister and minister of regional cooperation). In this role, he and his aides have brazenly leveraged his power to seek favorable coverage from outlets that he once routinely described as \u201cradically biased.\u201dEfforts to stifle freedom of the press can be seen as part of a broader attack by Mr. Netanyahu and his ministers on Israel\u2019s democratic institutions, including the Supreme Court and nongovernmental organizations. Dissent from the official government line is consistently called into suspicion. In this climate, the news media has become a personal battleground for Mr. Netanyahu. Nahum Barnea, a pre-eminent Israeli columnist, said last year that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with the news media showed him to be \u201cgripped by fear and paranoia.\u201dOn the first day after he was carried into a fourth term in office, Mr. Netanyahu took a seemingly small but unusual step: He fired the Communications Ministry\u2019s director general and named in his stead a man best known for having once served as Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. Any objections that this move may have raised were pre-empted by Mr. Netanyahu, who had already required all members of his coalition to sign a \u201ccommunications clause,\u201d guaranteeing their automatic support for any decision made in the future by the communications minister \u2014 in other words, by him.Since the appointment of its new director general, the ministry has ruled on a series of decisions that have been highly advantageous to Bezeq, Israel\u2019s largest telecommunications group. Bezeq also operates Walla News, one of the most popular news sites in the country, and a close associate of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s, Shaul Elovitch, owns a controlling stake.It didn\u2019t take long before the site\u2019s coverage of the Netanyahu government turned decidedly positive. According to a recent report in the liberal newspaper Haaretz, the site\u2019s C.E.O. has issued directives to produce puff pieces about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, and her \u201cfashionable makeover\u201d; to tone down headlines of op-eds critical of the prime minister; and to keep unflattering statistics, such as a recent poverty report, off its home page.\u201cWhat can management do?\u201d a Walla News journalist lamented to me. \u201cWe\u2019re threatened here by a combination of the most powerful politician in the country and one of the most powerful commercial companies in the country.\u201dIn broadcast journalism, Mr. Netanyahu has installed associates in positions of authority where he can, and has cast doubt on the financial future of places he can\u2019t. All three of Israel\u2019s main television news channels \u2014 Channel 2, Channel 10 and the Israel Broadcasting Authority \u2014 are now in danger of being fragmented, shut down or overhauled, respectively. The government\u2019s official reason behind these moves is to open up the communications industry to more competition. But there seems to be a double standard: On other issues, like natural gas, the prime minister has been loath to take a stand against monopolies. As Ilana Dayan, a leading investigative journalist for Channel 2, told me: \u201cSometimes competition is the refuge of the antidemocrat.\u201dWhile journalists tend to rue these latest developments, many Israelis view Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s battle for control over the news media as a long-overdue corrective after years of a liberal or left-wing bias. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s supporters might be tired of him, but more than they are sick of him they despise the old leftist elites,\u201d Amit Segal, a political correspondent for Channel 2, told me. This antagonism was two decades in the making. In 1999, speaking about the news media and its reaction to the prospects of his winning another general election, Mr. Netanyahu famously coined the slogan \u201cThey\u2019re a-f-r-a-i-d.\u201d\u201cAt some point Netanyahu realized that his battle with the media makes him very popular among his base supporters,\u201d Ms. Dayan said. \u201cBy catering to this base, the result has been a phenomenal success for him.\u201dIf Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to control the news media are indeed aimed at correcting a liberal bias, his actions have proved awfully narrow. His and his associates\u2019 repeated interventions in editorial content haven\u2019t propped up the ideological right or given voice to marginalized, conservative sectors of society. For Mr. Netanyahu, the stakes are personal. \u201cEvery time you see an appointment by Bibi of someone in the media, it\u2019s meant either to help Sara or to help advance his own private affairs,\u201d Mr. Segal told me, using the prime minister\u2019s nickname.Although for years the most widely read daily, Yediot Ahronot, and its owner took a decidedly anti-Netanyahu line, claims of left-wing bias fall flat these days, when most Israelis are getting their news from Israel Hayom or Walla News, and when the only remaining liberal bastion \u2014 Haaretz \u2014 struggles to stay afloat. And yet Mr. Netanyahu continues to present himself as a victim of a vindictive press.The only heartening thing in all this is that news outlets are pushing back to maintain their independence. Investigative \u201c60 Minutes\u201d-type programs like \u201cUvda\u201d (\u201cFact\u201d) and \u201cHamakor\u201d (\u201cThe Source\u201d) continue to delve into government corruption and to air in prime-time slots. \u201cDespite the assault on the press, the Israeli media remains very critical, very aggressive, and has a lot of chutzpah. It\u2019s a kind of basic instinct that\u2019s part of our DNA,\u201d Ms. Dayan, who hosts Uvda, told me.Earlier this year, Walla News\u2019 diplomatic correspondent Amir Tibon wrote an article critical of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s response to the latest wave of Palestinian violence under the headline \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s Promises of Calm Replaced by Cheerleading.\u201d Soon after the piece was published, Mr. Tibon was told that the prime minister\u2019s office was pressuring editors to remove it from the website. Taking to Twitter, Mr. Tibon wrote of the prime minister\u2019s \u201cattempts to silence criticism.\u201d Apparently as a result, his article remained in place. One thing did change, however: The word \u201cNetanyahu\u201d was removed from its headline.Ruth Margalit is an Israeli writer living in New York.Advertisement"}

Segars, ARM\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. But he left the door open for another offer. \u201cNow that the offer is in the public domain, if anyone wants to make a counteroffer, they are more than welcome to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a possibility of someone counterbidding.\u201dBritish leaders, under pressure to address global worries about the country\u2019s future outside the European Union, portrayed the deal as an endorsement. \u201cSoftbank\u2019s decision confirms that Britain remains one of the most attractive destinations globally for investors to create jobs and wealth,\u201d Philip Hammond, the new chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a statement.Mr. Son said he was a \u201cstrong believer in the U.K.,\u201d and he added that he had spoken with Mr. Hammond and Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, about the deal on Sunday.SoftBank already has ties to ARM through Sprint, the American wireless carrier that it controls. Mr. Son said he first spoke with ARM\u2019s chairman about two weeks ago regarding a possible takeover, and added that the deal came together quickly. The two sides eventually agreed to a price \u2014 more than 70 times ARM\u2019s net earnings in 2015. The deal is expected to close in November.Mr. Son described the deal as a bet on the \u201cinternet of things,\u201d a new stage in the evolution of network technology, when cars, buildings and household items may be connected through embedded electronics. He framed the social and economic implications in grand terms.\u201cFirst there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cI\u2019m making this investment at the very beginning of this shift.\u201dARM Holdings may not be a household name, but it is most likely that one of the company\u2019s chip designs powers your smartphone, tablet or other mobile device. It devises chips and parts of chips that use less power so that they can be used in smaller gadgets. ARM had a market capitalization of about $22 billion as of Friday\u2019s close, and the proposed acquisition represents a 43 percent premium over the company\u2019s closing share price last week.Started in 1990 as a spinoff from Acorn Computers, a now-defunct British computer maker, ARM has gone from a small start-up of fewer than 20 people to a global leader whose technology is used in more than 90 percent of smartphones produced by Apple and Samsung, among others.ARM took an early lead on chips for mobile devices, while the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets has been more challenging to traditional chip makers like Intel.Unlike Intel, ARM forgoes the high margins \u2014 and equally high production costs \u2014 of directly manufacturing microchips. Instead, its engineers design chips, which are then licensed to larger technology companies like Qualcomm that pay ARM fees and royalties for manufacturing the chips.The company\u2019s revenue totaled a mere $1.5 billion last year, compared with $55.4 billion for Intel over the same period. But as ARM\u2019s chips have become increasingly powerful, the company\u2019s stable of customers have begun to create devices that directly compete with those powered by Intel. That can be seen in particular in the world of computer servers, which have become the lifeblood of the internet as people\u2019s online activities move into the cloud.As smartphone sales have slowed, ARM has invested millions of dollars in chip designs aimed at new customers, including automakers and household product companies, that are looking to add internet connectivity to their existing products.Mr. Son said he intended to double the number of employees at ARM in the next five years, and he said he would make that pledge a legally binding commitment enforceable by Britain\u2019s takeover panel.SoftBank had been signaling that it was preparing for a major move.Last month, Mr. Son reasserted control over SoftBank\u2019s overseas investment portfolio, easing out a former Google executive whom he had been grooming as his successor. In a statement announcing the departure of the executive, Nikesh Arora, Mr. Son said he had decided to stay on as SoftBank\u2019s chief for at least five or 10 more years.Until now, SoftBank has invested mostly in the services side of the technology business \u2014 internet companies like Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, and mobile phone carriers like Sprint and Vodafone, whose Japanese arm Mr. Son bought in 2006 and turned into one of Japan\u2019s dominant carriers.But abrupt changes in direction are part of SoftBank\u2019s DNA. Mr. Son founded the company in the 1980s as a distributor of computer software. When he broke into the mobile phone market with the Vodafone purchase in 2006, many predicted disaster \u2014 SoftBank lacked experience in the industry, and the $15 billion deal loaded it with debt. But the business, renamed SoftBank Mobile, soon became a cash cow.Raine Group, Robey Warshaw and Mizuho Securities advised SoftBank on the deal, while Lazard and Goldman Sachs advised ARM Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the terms of another large chip deal.

{"Headline": "Widespread Flooding in China Kills Over 160, Providing a Test for Leaders", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Torrential rains and floods across the southern half of China have besieged cities and towns for days. More than 160 people had died by Friday in drownings and landslides and as buildings collapsed, including 35 people buried by a landslide in the far west. Nearly two million people have been moved to safer ground while swollen rivers and lakes strain dikes and dams.For China\u2019s leaders, the floods are a test of their ability to deliver on their promises of safety for citizens.The country\u2019s flood defenses have faltered in the past, weakened by neglect and corruption, and Prime Minister Li Keqiang and other leaders have said that this year the government is better prepared than ever.Yet experts and residents in areas hit by the rains have claimed that local governments have neglected drainage and filled in lakes, leaving cities exposed to greater flooding.\u201cThere\u2019s a systemic problem: Lakes have been shrinking \u2014 natural drainage has been damaged,\u201d Mr. Ke said in a telephone interview. \u201cEveryone, including the government, has become aware that the entire water system has been hurt by overdevelopment.\u201dIn China, flooding is a perennial problem and has long stood as a test of the ability of rulers to overcome adversity. But the death toll from floods and severe rains each year has generally been going down, helped by more government spending on dikes and other flood protection, as well as efforts to evacuate areas when waters reach dangerous levels.Still, the damage from the latest floods has been heavy, and big cities like Wuhan and Nanjing have been disrupted by water pooling in densely populated areas.By Friday, 164 people had died and 26 were missing in the flooding across 11 provinces, according to the government. Also, 73,000 homes had collapsed, and nearly 1.7 million acres of crops had been wiped out. The government estimated economic losses at $10 billion.The state-run news media said that the death count this year would have been higher if the government and military forces had not acted so quickly to reinforce flood defenses and move vulnerable people. The government has also emphasized the role of the Three Gorges Dam, which can hold back surges of water that would otherwise threaten areas downstream along the Yangtze.While the dikes may be working, the lack of effective drainage in cities has become a sore point with the public.In Wuhan, residents have complained that officials did too little to improve drainage and have allowed lakes to be filled in for development.\u201cLakes are natural sinks,\u201d Mr. Ke, the environmental activist, said. \u201cWhen there are heavy rains, the water that once would have been expelled into lakes pools up in residential areas.\u201dBy Friday, the floods around Wuhan had eased a little. But forecasters warned that the destructive weather could continue near the coast. A typhoon barreling from Taiwan threatens to add to the damage when it hits the Chinese mainland, where, forecasters said, it was expected to land on Fujian Province on Saturday.Adam Wu and Karoline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Ambitious Climate Change Plan Avoids Carbon Tax", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Clinton, courting young voters and the broader Democratic base, has promised to one-up President Obama on climate change, vowing to produce a third of the nation\u2019s electricity from renewable sources by 2027, three years faster than Mr. Obama, while spending billions of dollars to transform the energy economy.A half-billion solar panels will be installed by 2020, she has promised, seven times the number today, and $60 billion will go to states and cities to develop more climate-friendly infrastructure, such as public transportation and energy-efficient buildings. She would put the United States on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050. And, she says, she could achieve all that without new legislation from Congress.But Mrs. Clinton has avoided mention of the one policy that economists widely see as the most effective way to tackle climate change \u2014 and one that would need Congress\u2019s assent: putting a price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, theoretically, to do all this without a price on carbon,\u201d said David Victor, the director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s hard to see how.\u201d\u201cThe problem is,\u201d he said, \u201cshe knows the politics of this are toxic.\u201dJohn Podesta, a former senior counselor to Mr. Obama who is now the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, is an architect of both the Obama and Clinton climate change plans. In crafting them, Mr. Podesta, an ardent environmentalist and a seasoned political operative, sought to take substantive action to reduce emissions without turning to Congress, where climate legislation would most likely again be doomed.\u201cSecretary Clinton believes that meeting the climate challenge is too important to wait for climate deniers in Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation,\u201d Mr. Podesta wrote in an emailed statement.While Mr. Podesta\u2019s climate plan for Mr. Obama centered on using the Clean Air Act to write new regulations to limit emissions from vehicles and power plants, a Clinton administration could return to the same law to issue rules on emissions from other slices of the economy, including the airline industry, oil refineries, gas production wells and cement manufacturers.In that way, Mrs. Clinton could walk a difficult line. Her ambitious climate change goals should appeal to young and progressive voters, particularly supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a carbon tax. But by avoiding mention of such a tax, she hopes to avoid Republican attacks on a proposal that would raise gasoline and electricity bills.\u201cIn an ideal world, the negative externalities would have a price on them,\u201d said Scott Hennessey, the vice president of policy at the solar power company SolarCity, using an economics term for pollution. \u201cBut we know it\u2019s not politically realistic. And we need to be realistic about what we can get.\u201dVeterans of the Obama administration are still smarting from the president\u2019s failed first-term effort to cap carbon emissions and to force carbon-emitting companies to purchase or trade for permits for every ton of carbon dioxide released. That \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d plan died in Congress in 2010, and contributed to Democrats\u2019 loss of the House majority that year.\u201cA lot of the people who cast those votes in the House ended up paying a big price in the 2010 election,\u201d said David Axelrod, the former senior political adviser on Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns and in the White House. \u201cIf I\u2019m in her campaign, I don\u2019t want to hand a cudgel to the other side.\u201dConservative campaign operatives agree that they would immediately pounce on any mention by Mrs. Clinton of a carbon price.\u201cHillary Clinton surely knows the political peril of directly telling American families that she wants to tax their gasoline,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch.Since the political fallout from 2010, Mr. Obama has sought to circumvent Congress on climate change. He used his executive authority to release Clean Air Act regulations on vehicles and power plants, the nation\u2019s two largest sources of carbon pollution.Under the Paris Agreement, an accord committing nearly 200 countries to lowering carbon emissions, Mr. Obama pledged to reduce the United States\u2019 emissions 25 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.Experts say that under a combination of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies and a handful of new policies that would not require Congressional action, it would be possible to reach the 2025 Paris target, but not the 2050 target. Mrs. Clinton has pledged that her policies would put the nation on a path to meeting that 2050 target.\u201cThe overwhelming view of the people who have looked at this is that there\u2019s no way to get to the 2050 goal, and probably the near-term goal, without a carbon price,\u201d said Jessica Tuchman Mathews, a former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cAt the very least, it would be like attempting to climb a very steep mountain with one leg tied behind your back.\u201dAbsent a carbon price, Mrs. Clinton plans to use a mix of new regulations, grant programs and spending on new infrastructure to achieve her targets. She would also spend $30 billion on a plan to help redevelop coal mining communities that are suffering economically in the wake of climate change policies.But experts say that such a piecemeal approach, while it would feasibly reduce emissions, would probably be less efficient and more expensive than the imposition of a single carbon price. It would also probably reach a point of diminishing returns because the Obama regulations have already affected the two most polluting industries.\u201cShe can continue to put out more rules,\u201d Mr. Victor said. \u201cBut the Obama administration showed us the high-water mark for what is possible on climate change with executive authority.\u201dAnd Mrs. Clinton would need at least some action by Congress to meet her goals \u2014 legislators would need to appropriate the $60 billion she intends to spend on clean infrastructure grants to states, and the $30 billion to help coal communities.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers say she is confident that Congress would appropriate the money because it would be funneled directly to states. Experts are skeptical.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how she gets this kind of money from a public budget,\u201d Mr. Victor said.Among environmental groups and the renewable energy industry, however, there is support for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals, however difficult they might be, compared with those of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, who denies the established science of human-caused climate change.Even economists are sounding like realists.\u201cThe clearest and most obvious way to reach the climate targets is with a nationwide carbon pricing method, whether a carbon tax or a cap and trade,\u201d said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. \u201cBut it\u2019s not surprising, given the politics, that Secretary Clinton would not want to explicitly talk about carbon pricing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Summer Camp Under Siege", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorGAZA CITY \u2014 Balloons emblazoned with an Olympic-style torch bobbed cheerfully in the sky above a swimming meet. For 12-year-old Adam Nairab and the other children on the beach, they provided inspiration. The balloons meant there was more to life than drones, explosions and the threat of sudden death.Sports and art classes at the United Nations-sponsored school offered these Gaza kids a semblance of normalcy and an outlet for expression. For two summers, Adam loved going to summer camp. It was a rare chance to play and learn in a carefree environment.But the balloons, swimming races and classes are yesterday\u2019s opportunities, just out-of-reach memories. Thanks to a funding crisis, many of the pleasures of summer camp have been canceled. Life for Gaza\u2019s kids is back to a dreary monotony of having too little to eat and too little to do, in a territory that\u2019s without electricity for 18 hours a day.Traumatized by wars, living under siege without basic amenities, the children had little to look forward to besides the \u201csummer fun weeks\u201d sponsored by Unicef and the relief agency. Camp was one of the few times in their lives they could simply be children.\u201cThis is extremely important in Gaza, where children live in a difficult environment, experiencing high levels of stress with detrimental impact on their studies,\u201d June Kunugi, a senior Unicef official, told me. \u201cThey are often unable to attend extracurricular activities due to overcrowding in the classroom, and schools operating in double shifts.\u201dSince the devastation inflicted by the 2014 conflict, the privations of Gaza\u2019s schoolchildren have grown worse. In winter, thousands of those left homeless by war freeze in temporary shelters; in summer, these same shelters become stiflingly hot. For a few weeks, summer camp gave some respite from all that.This year, the donor states cut their funding for the summer programs. There will be no drama, no swimming, no sand castle building, no volleyball, no football, no painting, no origami.The international donors\u2019 obligation to help Palestinians has not gone away. Is the future of these children, who make up about half the population of Gaza, not worth investing in? Not only do the camp sessions provide girls and boys equal opportunities to play, but they also seek to teach new skills in a stifled economy where good jobs are scarce, as well as instill coping mechanisms for Gaza\u2019s extremely stressful environment.\u201cThe streets are unsafe for play,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cWalking by the border is too risky, as flying bullets from the Egyptians could hit anyone walking by.\u201dRather than look forward to summer, he\u2019s now dreading it. His only option is to attend a program run by one of the many political factions in Gaza and be steeped in ideological thinking. The absence of international donor programs has left a vacuum. The Hamas movement just announced that it is opening registration for a summer camp of its own.The choice for most parents will be between whatever programs Hamas offers or sending their children off to play in one of the old refugee camps established here after Palestinians, including Adam\u2019s family, were driven from their land and villages when Israel was founded in 1948. Adam\u2019s mother, Safa\u2019a, is as frustrated as he is.At least the relief agencies\u2019 summer programs had provided prized summer jobs for recent university graduates, including college-educated women. Last year, there were about 34,000 applicants for 2,200 positions as teachers and mentors. The shrinking options for young women mean that more and more must choose marriage rather than a career. Above all, it is the siege of Gaza, now entering its 10th year, that makes thousands of our young people idle and restricts their choices.American and French peace initiatives have been blocked by the intransigence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government. Yet, even without the will to secure Palestinian freedom, there is still something the international community can do: provide hope.Fund the programs that allow these children to forget, for a few hours, that they are refugees in their own land. Show them that there is an alternative to factionalism and fighting.To donor states, summer activities may seem a trivial footnote. For the children of Gaza, though, they offer a lifeline to a different future.Advertisement"}

In rejecting recent trade deals, Mr. Trump also declared his independence from mainstream modern economic thinking, which holds that freer flows of capital and goods make the United States and the world richer by letting economic activity occur more efficiently.He would abandon the policy of seeking lower prices for American consumers by smoothing the path for less-expensive imports.Mr. Trump would reject the path taken by recent Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan, who put those ideas into practice through trade agreements, and from Republican lawmakers who voted for those agreements in large numbers.He would also reject the views of influential Republicans who view tariffs as likely to damage the economy, not protect jobs. They include Speaker Paul D. Ryan and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that support Republican candidates financially.Many disaffected Americans, facing diminished prospects because of foreign competition, automation and other economic trends, distrust those in power. They applaud Mr. Trump.Few Americans know Mr. Paulson or Mr. Singer. But like other Republican senators and governors who publicly refuse to back Mr. Trump, they send signals to college-educated, business-oriented voters and contributors who traditionally support the party\u2019s nominee but are wavering this year.He could compensate with unusually robust support from Democrats and independents, but that seems unlikely. In the Fox poll, he drew 6 percent and 39 percent from those groups.Mr. Trump aims to swell the blue-collar backing that powered his primary victories.

{"Headline": "Japan Vote Strengthens Shinzo Abe\u2019s Goal to Change Constitution", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Voters helped Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan move closer on Sunday to securing the lawmaker support he needs to revise a pacifist Constitution that has been in place since American occupiers created it in 1947.An official count on Monday morning showed the governing coalition and its allies had captured two-thirds of the seats in the upper house of Parliament, the amount required to proceed with the constitutional revision.Despite a weak economy and divided public opinion on the expanded role for Japan\u2019s military that Mr. Abe is seeking, his Liberal Democrats and their allies again won a commanding majority in the upper house.\u201cThis is the people\u2019s voice letting us firmly move forward,\u201d Mr. Abe said. When asked whether he would proceed with a revision of the Constitution, he said it had long been the Liberal Democrats\u2019 goal.Whether Mr. Abe will be able to pursue that ambition \u2014 to overturn the constitutional clause that calls for the complete renunciation of war \u2014 remains to be seen.While the partners in the governing coalition have indicated some support for amendments, different groups have divided opinions on which clauses they want to change. Still, the election outcome is sure to give Mr. Abe more leverage.The results in Japan were achieved without the fiery populist emotions that have fueled the United States presidential race or the recent British vote to leave the European Union. Instead, the Japanese election seemed to reflect resignation with the status quo rather than a broad mandate.Voters see few alternatives, with many still feeling stung by what they saw as the opposition Democratic Party\u2019s failure to deliver during its four-year term before Mr. Abe came to power in 2012.\u201cI think people are unhappy, but they don\u2019t really see that voting is going to make things different,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, the director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo. For Mr. Abe, he said, \u201cthe ace up his sleeve is the opposition.\u201dProfessor Kingston added: \u201cThere is not an alternative. This is as lukewarm a sense of support as you get.\u201dAs in previous elections, voter turnout was low. The Ministry of Internal Affairs put it at just under 55 percent, only slightly higher than results three years ago in the last upper house election.Mr. Abe focused mainly on economic policy \u2014 known as Abenomics \u2014 and other less contentious issues, like his promise to expand child care and nursing home slots. Although polls have shown that few Japanese believe the economy is thriving, Mr. Abe spoke with pride of growth in employment, without mentioning that the rise had been mostly in part-time or contract jobs.\u201cAbenomics is not failing,\u201d Mr. Abe told a crowd of more than 1,000 at his final campaign stop on Saturday evening in Tokyo. \u201cThe only choice is to go forward.\u201dLoyalty to the Liberal Democratic Party runs deep, a product of habit and history as much as support for its policies.Junko Kaneda, 84, who walked by herself through sweltering heat on Sunday to vote at a polling station in Nakano, a neighborhood in western Tokyo, recalled hiding in bomb shelters during World War II air raids. She said she was concerned about the Abe administration\u2019s moves to revise the Constitution and expand Japan\u2019s military powers.\u201cBut in the end,\u201d she said, \u201cI think all we can rely on is the L.D.P.\u201dThe public remains split over constitutional revision. According to exit polls by NHK, about a third of voters said they supported some amendments, while another third said they saw no need to revise the governing document. Previous news media surveys showed even less support for constitutional revision.Although the governing coalition achieved the two-thirds threshold in Parliament, it is not clear how quickly it could move to change the Constitution. The Liberal Democrats have also proposed amendments that could limit free speech deemed dangerous to the public interest and expand emergency powers for the prime minister.The Liberal Democrats will have to work with their coalition partners to gain consensus on which parts of the governing document to change. Any amendments must also be approved by a majority in a nationwide referendum.\u201cWe are talking about a tremendously complicated and contentious political process,\u201d said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a New York political risk consultancy. \u201cThe idea that Abe is just going to be able to get whatever he wants is just not the reality.\u201dAnalysts said the governing coalition was unlikely to start with its most controversial proposal, which would revise the constitutional clause renouncing all war.Some analysts said they were concerned that if the governing coalition obtained the two-thirds threshold, it could find a way to sway public opinion in a referendum.\u201cWe have all seen what happened with \u2018Brexit,\u2019\u201d said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, referring to the British vote to leave the European Union. \u201cThe results can be unpredictable.\u201dProfessor Nakano noted that Mr. Abe\u2019s administration had sought to quiet critical news media coverage and that, most recently, the party had invited students, parents and educators to file online reports of incidents in which they believed a teacher had violated \u201cpolitical neutrality.\u201d\u201cI cannot be as na\u00efve as to think that there will be free debate in a run-up to a national referendum,\u201d Professor Nakano said.Other voters were ambivalent. \u201cFor revision of the Constitution, I don\u2019t know what we should do,\u201d said Ryuichi Okabayashi, 47, who voted for candidates from opposition parties at an elementary school polling station in Sagamihara, a suburban town southwest of Tokyo. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t want to send children to war. But I worry: What if Japan is attacked by China or North Korea? Japan needs military power in such cases.\u201dSeveral analysts said Mr. Abe might start with more technical amendments, like one that would change the votes needed to amend the Constitution. \u201cBy changing any part of the Constitution, he wants to leave his name in history,\u201d said Ryosuke Nishida, an associate professor of public policy at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.Japanese voters who selected opposition candidates on Sunday did so less out of passion than of protest. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for positive reasons,\u201d said Miu Okada, 30, an office worker in Nakano who said she simply chose a candidate who was not a member of the Liberal Democratic Party or its allies.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk of Tesla Sticks to Mission Despite Setbacks", "Date": "2016-07-24", "News": "Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors, sat in a glass-walled conference room here last week in the company\u2019s auto factory. Around him, workers and robots were building the $70,000 luxury vehicles that have redefined how people think about electric cars.And then there is his plan for the world\u2019s largest battery factory. The so-called Gigafactory, in Nevada, is to be unveiled this week.\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be really crazy about the Gigafactory is not just that it\u2019s giant,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the world with tiny factories that move slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need big factories with high-velocity output.\u201dScale and speed are watchwords for Mr. Musk and his save-the-world view of business, which addresses some of the biggest pressure points in climate change. Mr. Musk wants to create an alternative to fossil fuels by popularizing solar power and by using batteries to store energy from the sun and wind to power homes, cars and businesses at any time of day and in any season.It was the first known fatality of someone operating Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system, a technology meant to prevent such disasters by controlling both steering and braking. Tesla acknowledges that neither the car nor Mr. Brown engaged the brakes, and it says that the Autopilot system failed to see the white trailer against a bright Florida sky.Critics say Tesla was premature in putting the collision-avoidance system on the market last October \u2014 technology that Mr. Musk hailed soon after as \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dAnd they say Tesla sent a dangerous message by calling it Autopilot, suggesting that the system could operate the car by itself, even though it requires drivers to stay completely engaged in case something goes wrong.\u201cTesla shouldn\u2019t make guinea pigs of its buyers,\u201d said Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.In essence, critics say, a company bent on speed needs to understand when to slow down. But Mr. Musk said a regret of his was not having introduced Autopilot even sooner.With a view of the Tesla factory floor, and searching an invisible horizon as he collected his thoughts, he said that Mr. Brown\u2019s death was \u201cvery sad.\u201d Still, the technology enhances safety, he insisted, and one death in what the company counts as 140 million miles driven using Autopilot does not undermine that idea.\u201cThe easy decision would be to, or easier, I suppose, from the standpoint of minimizing attacks and criticism, would be to delay it and try to wait for some point where it\u2019s theoretically better,\u201d Mr. Musk said of Autopilot. \u201cBut if you wait for any point past the point that it\u2019s better than the cars that exist, you\u2019re making a decision to kill people with statistics.\u201dOther automakers, some with their own versions of collision-avoidance technology, have been publicly silent about the Autopilot controversy, while privately muttering about Tesla.Some of it could be schadenfreude. Mr. Musk has made a point of ridiculing the mainstream auto industry as too slow to change. And there is no doubt that Tesla, by proving that electric cars can be cool, must-have consumer products that can travel 200 miles between charges, has put pressure on other automakers to step up their own electric-vehicle efforts.But many on Wall Street say it matters little whether Tesla changes the world if it also keeps losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Electric utility companies also view Mr. Musk warily, filing regulatory challenges to his bid to revolutionize the way energy is generated, transported, stored and paid for.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.Although many in the financial community dismiss the merger proposal as mainly a way for Mr. Musk to have Tesla shareholders protect his investment in SolarCity, environmentalists say the consolidation plan makes a lot of sense.Musk devotees say his great talent is taking green-energy ideas, which others have long discussed in theory, and turning them into realities.\u201cHe makes a reasonable bid to be the Henry Ford of this era,\u201d said Bill McKibben, the environmental activist and author. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to kick off the mass market for renewable energy.\u201dMr. Musk says there\u2019s no time to spare.\u201cIt\u2019s the most serious thing that humanity faces,\u201d he said of climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest problem in the world.\u201d\u201cThe faster we can transition to low carbon, maybe, ultimately, to a negative carbon economy, the better.\u201dIn high-desert heat outside Reno, Nev., last week, J. B. Straubel looked out at a vast dirt patch, a construction site that had just broken ground.\u201cThis will be building batteries in 12 months,\u201d said Mr. Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technology officer and a co-founder of the company with Mr. Musk.Behind Mr. Straubel was another part of the factory, already built and partly up and running. The buildings here will eventually make up the $5 billion Gigafactory, covering 10 million square feet and projected to put out what the company says will be more lithium-ion batteries each year than were produced globally in all of 2013.Tesla is planning a grand opening on Friday of the Gigafactory, intended to be Mr. Musk\u2019s 21st-century answer to Henry Ford\u2019s sprawling River Rouge plant, which transformed the concept of mass production in the 1920s.Mr. Straubel said speed was of the essence in getting the factory up to full production. \u201cThere\u2019s a sheer business need for it. Compressing the schedule tends to make things cheaper.\u201dIt is a view he clearly shares with Mr. Musk.\u201cIf affordability improves,\u201d Mr. Musk said during the interview in Fremont, \u201cthen more people can buy an electric car, more people can buy solar, more people can buy stationary storage.\u2019\u2019To help make his electric cars less expensive, Mr. Musk is intent on picking up the pace at Tesla\u2019s car factory. It produces 2,000 cars a week, only about a third as many as a conventional automaker\u2019s factory might crank out.Ramping up production is crucial to the next stage of the master plan: building a lower-cost version of the Tesla car. The new Model 3, to be priced at $35,000 \u2014 half as much as the Model S \u2014 is expected to come out in late 2017, and Tesla says it already has 373,000 preorders.For all his talk of speed, Mr. Musk, a physicist by training, is painstakingly deliberate, pausing between sentences.His wit can be so dry and understated as to go undetected, as when he joked to an audience at last fall\u2019s Paris climate talks that greenhouse gas is the natural world\u2019s \u201cturd in the punch bowl.\u201d The remark drew few laughs.The Paris climate accord epitomizes the slow international political and bureaucratic pace involved in building a consensus on the environmental crisis and trying to respond to what scientists increasingly view as the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced.Mr. Musk has positioned Tesla as an agile responder that can help consumers save the planet while the policy makers are still drafting position papers. Still, he has had his share of government help.Along with benefits like government subsidies to consumers of solar panels and electric cars, Tesla received $465 million in loans in 2010 from the Department of Energy to work on fuel-saving vehicle technology. Those loans were repaid in 2013.And it is with heavy financial assistance from New York State that SolarCity is building a 1.2-million-square-foot factory in Buffalo. (Tesla points out that oil and gas companies benefit from far greater subsidies).Even if Tesla meets its goals, of course, Mr. Musk alone cannot reverse climate change. If Tesla winds up with a half-million of its cars on the road in the next three years, for example, that would be a scant fraction of the country\u2019s more than 260 million motor vehicles.\u201cWill these cars make a meaningful difference themselves? No,\u201d David Keith, an assistant professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said of Tesla. The greater influence, Mr. Keith said, is cultural.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time, possibly ever,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a green product, with significant environmental credentials, has been the thing that everybody wanted.\u201dJeff Nesbit, former head of legislative and public affairs at the National Science Foundation under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, said Tesla\u2019s value could also be measured by the pressure it places on other carmakers to match it.\u201cHe\u2019s driving everybody else,\u201d Mr. Nesbit said. \u201cThat\u2019s the power Musk has.\u201dUtilities, whatever their resentments, are paying attention, too.\u201cElon is truly the archetype of the disruptive entrepreneur,\u201d said Andrew Beebe, a former electric industry executive who is now a venture capital investor. \u201cUtilities and utility executives, because of the success on the vehicle side, are absolutely taking note.\u201dOne nagging question about the Tesla quest involves the company\u2019s reliance on lithium-ion batteries. The chemistry can be volatile, and several early Teslas caught fire before the company built a titanium shield under the vehicle to guard against fire or damage.Another question: Can the batteries, even at the Gigafactory\u2019s massive scale, be made cheap enough to persuade most consumers to kick their fossil-fuel habit?After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cHe\u2019s got to get a little lucky,\u201d said John B. Goodenough, who turns 94 on Monday, the physicist who helped pioneer the rechargeable lithium-ion battery at Oxford University in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cI do give him credit just for audacity.\u201dMr. Musk, born in Pretoria in 1971 to a father who was a electromechanical engineer and a mother who was a model, emigrated at age 17 to Canada. He later moved to the United States and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics.He made his first millions through Zip2, an internet mapping and search business he founded with his younger brother, Kimbal, in 1995, and sold to Compaq four years later. Mr. Musk\u2019s next company, an electronic payment business, evolved into PayPal, for which he reportedly received $165 million when eBay bought it in 2002.Tesla was still in its infancy when Mr. Musk put his money behind it in 2004. By then he had founded SpaceX, with the aim of developing reusable rockets to eventually send people to Mars.So far, despite some spectacular and fiery failures of its test rockets, SpaceX has launched satellites for commercial use and is the first private company to dock with, and provide supplies to, the International Space Station. It sent a payload to the space station last week on a rocket that then returned and made a safe landing in Florida. Under a NASA contract, SpaceX is to begin sending astronauts to the station in the next few years.SolarCity, for its part, sprang from a 2004 road trip to Burning Man, during which Mr. Musk and his cousin Lyndon Rive mused about solar power\u2019s potential for countering climate change.Mr. Musk says his ventures should eventually be judged on \u201cthe degree to which they have accelerated the advent of sustainable energy.\u201d If he speeds up adoption by five to 10 years, he said, that would be a good outcome.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t really care about business all that much,\u201d said Mr. Musk, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be $12.5 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my first motivation.\u201dYet Tesla exists in a business world, where many competitors and critics may be rooting for his failure. The Autopilot story, and the death of Joshua Brown, gave them a narrative with more than money at stake.\u201cThings are like especially intense right now,\u201d Mr. Musk acknowledged.Tesla began installing cameras, sensors and other hardware for Autopilot in 2014, adding the software a year later to make the system functional.The basic version of Autopilot includes collision warning systems and emergency braking. A fuller option package allows for assisted steering and adaptive cruise control. Activating it requires the driver\u2019s acknowledgment that the technology is new and is still in \u201cpublic beta phase\u201d testing. Each time drivers turn it on, it warns them to keep their hands on the wheel and be prepared to take over.Consumer Reports has been warning since October, when full-dress Autopilot was rolled out, that the system has flaws. This month the magazine called on Tesla to disable the technology.\u201cAutopilot gives you the idea that it is more capable than it is, and once people view it as autonomous, they disengage and divert their eyes from the road,\u201d Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing, said in an interview.He and other safety experts also note that Autopilot continues operating even if drivers do not touch the steering wheel for several minutes.Mr. Fisher said that he had driven Teslas hands-free for more than three minutes, and that even when Autopilot warned him that he had gone too long without touching the steering wheel, the car continued driving for 30 seconds before the feature shut itself down.In a video in early April, Mr. Brown narrated as Autopilot swerved to miss a truck on a highway that had cut in front of him. After Mr. Musk publicized that video with a Twitter post on April 17, it spread quickly online.A little over three weeks later, Mr. Brown had the fatal collision that Autopilot failed to avoid.All of this has provided fuel for Tesla\u2019s critics. But Mr. Musk said the detractors were overreacting and ignoring Autopilot\u2019s lifesaving benefits.And so for Tesla, it is full throttle forward. Waiting to deploy Autopilot, he said, would have been worse than merely going slow.\u201cTo make that decision simply in order to avoid criticism,\u201d Mr. Musk said, \u201cthat\u2019s a terrible act of cowardice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of preorders Tesla has for the Model 3. It is 373,000, not 315,000.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit, Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich., and Diane Cardwell from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fuel Targets Threatened by Demand for Big Autos", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 Despite praising automakers for recent gains in fuel economy, two federal agencies said on Monday that surging consumer demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles made it unlikely that the industry could meet the government\u2019s ambitious projections a decade from now.If fuel prices remain low, and trucks continue to outsell cars, the industry will probably not meet the goal of 54.5 miles per gallon as a fleetwide average by 2025, but will probably come in at only about 50 miles a gallon, according to a report by the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency.The report issued on Monday was termed a draft by administration officials, and included input from the California Air Resources Board, as well as the two federal agencies.That lower fuel economy number would translate into higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which environmentalists say would make global climate change worse and undercut efforts to curtail greenhouse gases agreed to by the Obama administration in last year\u2019s Paris climate accord.The report\u2019s release kicks off a lengthy review period for the nation\u2019s Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, and sets up a battle between car companies and environmental groups to influence the final mileage rules. Automakers want lower requirements, while clean-air advocates are pushing for big reductions in vehicle emissions.\u201cThe 54.5 miles-per-gallon average is at risk,\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign in Washington. \u201cRather than weaken the projections, the regulators should be tightening the standards for larger vehicles.\u201dBut automakers say a fair analysis of market conditions is required to set realistic mileage projections for coming years.\u201cGetting the midterm review analysis right is crucial for everyone,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, an official with the Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.Federal officials said that the midterm review released on Monday was primarily a factual tool to help set final CAFE rules for 2022 to 2025. After a public comment period, the government is expected to complete those mileage standards by early 2018.The agencies said the automakers had exceeded the initial forecasts for fuel-economy improvements set when the latest CAFE rules were set four years ago.\u201cAutomakers are developing more technologies to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions than we thought possible a few years ago,\u201d said Janet McCabe, a senior E.P.A. official.When the CAFE rules were adopted in 2012, the government set 36.6 miles per gallon as the projection for 2017 model-year vehicles. The industry is on track to meet that number using a complex formula that sets specific mileage standards for vehicles of various sizes.Companies can also improve their CAFE score with credits for technology such as electric cars.But the government\u2019s projection of a 54.5 miles-per-gallon average in 2025 is in jeopardy because of a marked shift in demand toward heavier vehicles with lower mileage standards.When the forecast was made four years ago, regulators expected that cars would account for about two-thirds of overall vehicles sales in the United States in 2015.Low gas prices, however, have contributed to increasing demand for lower-mileage models such as pickups and S.U.V.s. In the first six months of this year, for example, trucks and S.U.V.s accounted for 58 percent of all vehicles sales in the United States.The industry successfully lobbied four years ago for the current midterm review period.Ms. Bergquist, of the auto alliance, said that auto companies would incur extra costs if the mileage rules were set too high. \u201cExcessive regulatory costs could impact both consumers and the employees who produce these vehicles,\u201d she said.Environmental groups vowed to push for the highest possible mileage standards during the public comment period leading up to the final rules.\u201cThe national fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards are a vital program to cut oil use and reduce the risk of climate change,\u201d said David Cooke of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Obama administration officials said the projections of 54.5 miles per gallon outlined in 2012 were based on different market conditions than those existing today.The officials also said, however, that technological innovations had consistently increased mileage in large and small vehicles. The broadest gains have been in gasoline-powered models, which have benefited from more efficient engines and transmissions, lighter materials and more aerodynamic designs.Advertisement"}

She dominated the first stage of the selection process, in which the field is narrowed to two candidates through voting by the 330 Conservative members of the House of Commons.Ms. May, 59, remains the favorite, but in the next round will be judged by a different constituency: registered party members, many of whom were vociferous supporters of leaving the European Union. Conservative Party headquarters has for days been unable or unwilling to disclose how many registered voters there are, but the House of Commons Library said that the latest published figure of 149,800 stems from December 2013. Voters will mail in their ballots, with the winner, to be announced on Sept. 9, becoming party leader and prime minister without having to call a general election.Ms. May holds one of the highest-profile posts in the British government and is considered the more experienced candidate \u2014 serious and competent but lacking charisma. Ms. Leadsom, who had a low profile and entered government as a junior minister only in 2014, has been accused of inflating her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As recently as three years ago, she supported continued British membership in the European Union.Ms. Leadsom put her 25 years of working in financial services before becoming a legislator in 2010 at the center of her leadership campaign, but those who worked with her have told reporters that she exaggerated her role at Barclays Bank and Invesco Perpetual, a fund manager. She told Sky News, \u201cMy CV is correct.\u201dIn Thursday\u2019s voting, Ms. May received 199 votes, Ms. Leadsom 84 and Mr. Gove 46.Ms. May and Ms. Leadsom are both ideological conservatives whose backgrounds are far different from those of the Eton-Oxford male circle that has dominated Conservative politics since Mr. Cameron became party leader in 2005. Both women went to state schools, where Ms. May won a place at Oxford. Ms. Leadsom went to the University of Warwick.In a speech on Thursday, Ms. Leadsom said she would focus on \u201cthe continued success of the U.K. economy,\u201d which has been hit hard by Brexit, raising fears of an increased budget deficit from lower growth and lower tax receipts. \u201cProsperity should be our goal, not austerity,\u201d she said.She also said that \u201ctrade must be our top priority: continued free trade with the E.U.\u201d She added that she favored \u201cfair but controlled immigration,\u201d without explaining how duty-free trade with the European Union could be maintained while scrapping European rules on freedom of movement and labor, which she also has said she intends to do.European Union leaders have repeatedly said that access to the single market of the European Union is not possible without accepting freedom of movement and labor.Ms. Leadsom had initially agreed to back Mr. Johnson in return for the promise of a high government post. He was supposed to call or text her confirming their arrangement by a certain time, but failed to do so, prompting Ms. Leadsom to announce her own surprise candidacy.Even more, Mr. Jenkins said, the Labour Party is in chaos and the Greens and the U.K. Independence Party have both lost their leaders. \u201cAn entire political class is on the way out.

{"Headline": "Alchemy Amok in \u2018Gold\u2019 and Its Offspring, \u2018The Magnetic Monster\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byOn DVDAmong the first popular films released in Germany following the Nazis\u2019 consolidation of power, \u201cGold\u201d (1934) is a movie of blithe contradictions: A high-tech criticism of industrial technology and a big-budget attack on human greed, it celebrates the genius of contemporary German alchemists while condemning their discovery as dangerous.Few movies are so confident in their confusion or so weirdly prophetic. \u201cGold,\u201d reissued on Blu-ray by Kino Classics, went into production at Germany\u2019s studio Ufa, in French- and German-language versions, around the time Hitler was appointed German chancellor. The movie opened in Berlin some 14 months later, as the Nazi regime inaugurated a major public works plan with which \u201cGold\u201d seems oddly in sync.The premise can be taken literally, as an adventure in pseudoscience, or metaphorically, expressing an inchoate desire for a new German order founded on modern innovation and medieval magical thinking. A brilliant German scientist discovers a means to transmute lead to gold, but before he can bring his experiments to fruition, his laboratory is destroyed and his recipe is stolen by an unscrupulous Scottish industrialist.Perhaps the first of the evil British capitalists who would become standard villains in Nazi cinema, the industrialist serves to demonstrate the science-fiction bromide that there are some things mankind was not meant to know. Barely surviving the explosion that killed his mentor, the German scientist\u2019s assistant (Hans Albers, a prominent leading man turned stalwart action star) travels to Scotland and terminates the industrialist\u2019s operation before it can wreck the world economy.Directed by Karl Hartl, whose earlier feature \u201cF.P.1 Doesn\u2019t Respond\u201d (1932) dramatized the fantastical attempt to construct an artificial mid-Atlantic island landing strip, \u201cGold\u201d has a leaden quality appropriate to its story. As in its obvious model, Fritz Lang\u2019s \u201cMetropolis\u201d (1927), the movie\u2019s real stars are its enormous sets and totemic machines \u2014 designed, like many of the ones in \u201cMetropolis,\u201d by Otto Hunte. The humans (who include Brigitte Helm, who played the saintly Maria and her evil robot double in \u201cMetropolis,\u201d as the industrialist\u2019s rebellious daughter) are often inert, while the laboratories, with their glowing tubes and humming condensers, are almost living things.\u201cGold,\u201d however, bests \u201cMetropolis\u201d with two set-destroying cataclysms instead of one, and another dramatized by the news media in the film. Scarcely less exciting than the movie\u2019s grand finale is the sequence following the creation of synthetic gold. The new Golden Age is heralded with a series of newspaper headlines and newsreel clips that condense six days of social chaos, as euphoric mass production gives way to inflation, panic and catastrophe. The moral, if there is one: Only a German scientist can neutralize the German alchemy that has the power to destroy civilization.\u201cThe Magnetic Monster\u201d \u2014 directed by the German-born Curt Siodmak (younger brother of the noir auteur Robert Siodmak), who before coming to America provided the source material for \u201cF.P.1 Doesn\u2019t Respond\u201d \u2014 also reflected topical concerns. Like \u201cGold,\u201d \u201cThe Magnetic Monster,\u201d which Curt Siodmak wrote in collaboration with the Hungarian-born producer Ivan Tors, is a Frankenstein story in which \u201cthe monster,\u201d in this case the newly discovered \u201cserranium,\u201d emerges from the periodic table of elements.Also like \u201cGold,\u201d \u201cThe Magnetic Monster\u201d begins with a warning and, despite frequent lapses into pseudoscientific gibberish, tries to explain the post-atomic condition. The heroes of this brave new world, one of whom is notably played by Richard Carlson, are government \u201cA-Men\u201d from the fictional Office of Scientific Investigation. (Mr. Carlson would become a staple of 1950s sci-fi, although \u201cThe Magnetic Monster\u201d did not initiate television series that the Tors-Siodmak team evidently hoped to create, even if the Office of Scientific Investigation did figure in two subsequent films produced by Mr. Tors.)Called upon to investigate a strange instance of rampant magnetism in a hardware store, the A-Men discover a case of radiation poisoning upstairs and, with help from the \u201celectronic brain\u201d M.A.N.I.A.C., conclude that an unseen, \u201cdangerously radioactive element\u201d is at large and growing.

As it starts to slow down its assembly lines, those razor-thin margins could evaporate quickly, analysts said.Although it is still popular with many travelers, most passengers have demonstrated an increasing preference for flying point-to-point on smaller planes rather than make time-consuming connections through huge hubs.Airbus once forecast sales of more than 1,200 of the planes over 20 years; it has so far only delivered 193 planes and has orders for just 126 more.No American carrier has ordered the A380. Only one airline, Emirates of Dubai, has placed a significant strategic bet on the superjumbo, ordering 142, including 75 already in service.\u201cThe market doesn\u2019t want a 500-plus seat jet. It doesn\u2019t want four engines.

The next step just may be a metaphorical helicopter, high above Tokyo. The Bank of Japan met Friday to decide on the next steps in its long battle against deflation, or falling prices, and analysts had thought it might pursue some coordinated effort with the Japanese government using an idea with a long historical lineage.It is an idea based on a metaphor used by the renowned economist Milton Friedman nearly five decades ago and given new life in this century by Ben Bernanke. It is also a policy that has echoes of some of the great catastrophes of economic history. And regardless of what, if anything, the Japanese central bank does this fall, if the global economy\u2019s deflationary doldrums continue, expect the discussion around these metaphorical helicopters to get louder. They say desperate times demand desperate measures. Helicopter money is what monetary policy desperation looks like.What is helicopter money?Normally when we say that a central bank like the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank creates money from thin air, it does so by buying up bonds or other assets from banks using money that is just an electronic accounting entry. Banks then spread money through the economy.But what if those mechanisms aren\u2019t effective for some reason (the banking system isn\u2019t working well, for example), and the central bank wants to get money circulating through the economy anyway?That was the thought experiment that Mr. Friedman dealt with in a 1969 paper titled \u201cThe Optimum Quantity of Money.\u201d He offered this intentionally absurd hypothetical: \u201cLet us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community.\u201dMore money floating around, used to chase the same amount of goods and services, would inevitably cause prices to rise \u2014 in other words, it would bring about higher inflation.Wait, why would anybody want higher inflation?Deflation, or falling prices, can be deeply damaging to an economy, and Mr. Friedman\u2019s influential analysis of how the Great Depression happened focused on it primarily as a monetary phenomenon. He argued that central banks failed to supply enough money and thus allowed devastating deflation to take hold.When prices are falling, it makes consumers and businesses reluctant to spend because anything they want to buy is cheaper tomorrow. It makes debt more onerous because you have to pay it back with money that will be more valuable the next day. These conditions can fuel a vicious spiral: Economic weakness creates falling prices, which create more economic weakness.Arguably, much of the advanced world \u2014 especially Japan and the eurozone \u2014 is experiencing a mild version of this right now, and the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have been deploying a series of increasingly aggressive tools to try to reverse it.The question now is whether some form of helicopter money is the next step in trying to achieve that goal.So would a central bank really drop money out of a helicopter?No! It\u2019s a metaphor.(Mr. Bernanke ignored a Fed press officer\u2019s recommendation that he not use the \u201chelicopter\u201d reference in the speech, according to his memoir, for fear it would seem too flippant. Sure enough, it earned him the nickname Helicopter Ben from his critics. This is a prime example of why central bankers so rarely use colorful language).But how is that different from what the central banks have been doing for years now with their quantitative easing policies?There\u2019s a crucial difference. The Q.E. policies have indeed consisted of central banks using money created from thin air to buy government bonds. That is, in effect, printing money to fund government deficits.But with Q.E., the central banks buy assets that the government has to pay back. The Fed, for example, has $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities on its balance sheet, but as they mature the government has to repay the money. Of course the Fed could then plow that money back into new bonds, but that will depend on its assessment of whether or not it is time to withdraw money from the economy.By contrast, the versions of helicopter money that analysts have discussed for Japan and other countries dealing with a deflation trap involve a different type of transaction. A key possibility: The government issues a \u201cperpetual\u201d bond with a 0 percent interest rate, which the central bank buys and promises to hold onto forever.That may sound technical. Think of it this way: Quantitative easing is akin to your rich uncle making you a loan under favorable terms, but making it clear you\u2019ll have to make interest payments and then pay the money back one day. Helicopter money is what happens if your rich uncle makes you a \u201cloan,\u201d but says that you don\u2019t have to pay any interest and never have to pay it back. For practical purposes it\u2019s more gift than loan, whatever the bookkeeping technically says.And just as you\u2019re more likely to spend the money your uncle gives you with abandon in the second situation than in the first, so a government will be more likely to spread money around.Indeed, if you want to be liberal with your definitions, you could argue that the United States experienced a form of helicopter money in 2009, when the Fed was doing quantitative easing and Congress enacted a fiscal stimulus package that, among other things, temporarily reduced payroll taxes. But that doesn\u2019t fit the classic definition. That\u2019s because, while the Q.E. program probably reduced interest rates and boosted stock prices in 2009, it was still acquiring bonds that the government would need to repay in one way or another.Why do you keep talking about what the government can do? I thought we were talking about the central bank itself.Modern democracies have a division of power. Central banks are walled off from day-to-day political concerns and granted authority over the money supply. They can buy and sell assets to try to maintain stable inflation and growth. But only democratic institutions like Congress and parliaments have the power to spend money outright.This was a common misunderstanding during the era of bank bailouts in 2008 and Q.E. The Fed wasn\u2019t spending money in the conventional sense, but rather buying assets that would earn some market-determined return and be sold (or allowed to mature) when the Fed judged it appropriate.But for some form of helicopter money to work, there would need to be some form of spending \u2014 such as public works, mass distribution of funds to citizens or tax cuts \u2014 that would amount to the government continuing its normal government spending without either raising taxes to pay for it or increasing public debt.But nothing is stopping elected representatives from coordinating with their central banker in a two-step process in which the central bank creates money and the democratic institutions spend it.So why hasn\u2019t anyone done this yet?It\u2019s potentially risky, and there are some technical complications to carrying it out.Printing money from thin air to fund government spending doesn\u2019t have a sterling history. It is what happened in Weimar Germany in the early 1920s, when hyperinflation ran rampant. It is what happened in Zimbabwe in the first part of this century. And it is happening in Venezuela right now.These examples show how easily things can spiral out of control when a government finances itself using its ability to create money. After all, when money-printing boosts inflation, it tends to also increase interest rates and hence borrowing costs. Then, the government may need yet more newly printed money to fund itself the next year, and so on.The advanced economies have spent decades writing laws and building traditions to keep things like that from happening. And one of those core principles is that central banks should remain independent from politics and not fund the government with money-printing.The discussion of helicopter money boils down to whether the deflationary cycle in advanced economies like Japan is sufficiently problematic that they should abandon some of those traditions to try to jolt economies into a higher-performing level.So is it going to happen?Never say never. A decade ago, no one could have imagined that major central banks would deploy large-scale quantitative easing or negative interest rates, but that is the world we are living in.In Japan, analysts think it is more likely there will be a combination of new fiscal stimulus from the government paired with yet more Q.E. from the central bank, perhaps explicitly coordinated in some way. That amounts to a soft form of the policy.Even with that, there is an open question of how much it really differs from policies that are already in place, like open-ended bond buying by the central bank combined with fiscal stimulus combined with pledges to keep going with both until inflation rises. Some of the \u201chelicopter money\u201d discussion, in a modern context, is as much about communication as the underlying economics.But whatever the Japanese central bank does, it is a safe bet that its counterparts in Europe and the United States will be watching very carefully, looking for signals of whether some form of helicopter money belongs in the arsenal for responding to the next downturn in the West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Central Conflict of 21st-Century Politics: Who Belongs?", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 The trend emerged into public consciousness last year with the rise of far-right politics in Europe. It spread with Donald J. Trump\u2019s successful campaign to become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the United States. And its consequences became unmistakable with Britain\u2019s vote last month to exit the European Union.What is driving this surge in anti-immigrant populism in Western politics?Michael Ignatieff has a theory, one rooted in his research as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and in his experience as former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party.According to his argument, what we\u2019re seeing is, in part, an ideological split between cosmopolitan elites who see immigration as a common good based in universal rights, and voters who see it as a gift conferred on certain outsiders deemed worthy of joining the community.This disagreement, he said in an interview, has animated much of the backlash against immigration that is described as \u201cuncontrolled\u201d and a threat to receiving communities. These disagreements over \u201cwho belongs,\u201d he said, will \u201cdefine the 21st century.\u201dHere are excerpts from our conversation, edited for clarity.Globalization and a borderless world have been terrific for the educated, the young, the mobile, the multilingual, the multicultural. But globalization has been really tough for people whose jobs are tied to a community, whose mobility is limited by limited education, and \u2014 more positively \u2014 whose first allegiance is to their community, their locality, their place of birth.Cosmopolitans are perpetually surprised that, A, they\u2019re only 1 percent of the population, and, B, most people don\u2019t think like them.That\u2019s the world they know. That\u2019s the world they care about. It\u2019s where their parents grew up or are buried. It\u2019s where their loyalties are.They feel the global, mobile, cosmopolitan world is simply out of reach. Not only out of reach, but malign, in the sense that the global cosmopolitan elite are the people who are shipping the jobs out. They\u2019re the people who are passing these incomprehensible rules in Brussels. They\u2019re the people who have shut down the coal mines and shut down the steel mills, and keep telling you that global free trade raises all boats.When they are given a referendum that offers them the illusion of taking back control, they seize it.This is a story not just about nationalism. It\u2019s also a story about inequality. The division between cosmopolitans and nationalists is going to define the 21st century. Brexit is not just a little hiccup on the path toward a bright cosmopolitan future. Nor is nationalism. Cosmopolitans continually condescend to nationalism, but my patriotic pride is your nationalism, right?In many ways, global migration is exacerbating the salience of the division between a citizen and a stranger. Citizens are saying everywhere, \u201cThe one thing that political community means to me, the one thing a nation means to me, is control of my borders and the right to define who comes in and who doesn\u2019t.\u201dBrexit was an amazing spectacle in which people who are recent immigrants, Indians, Pakistanis in origin, were saying, \u201cNo more Poles.\u201d These were citizens saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost control of our frontiers. Free movement of people is simply incompatible with democracy. It\u2019s incompatible with the self-determination of peoples.\u201dThat\u2019s what nationalism is: \u201cTake back control, control of our borders. Take back control of our economy.\u201dThe problem, in a globalized world, is that all control is relative.And that produces a nationalist reaction which is very, very strong, which a certain candidate is tapping into.It highlights the fact that if millions of Americans can feel that the United States is not a fully sovereign country, you can imagine how millions of Britons could feel the same, or millions of Hungarians, or millions of other people.For ordinary people, a citizen\u2019s relation to a stranger is a gift relationship, not a rights relationship. They think it\u2019s up to the citizen to decide who gets in. It\u2019s up to the citizen who decides what the boundaries of a political community are.That\u2019s what democracy means to them. That\u2019s what democracy promises them: control of borders and the handing out of discretionary gifts to those they decide belong in the community.There are a lot of Brexiters who think a decent country is generous to strangers, is compassionate to strangers. But that\u2019s the language of the gift. That\u2019s not a language of rights. This is an emerging theme that a lot of liberal cosmopolitan politicians \u2014 and I have been one! \u2014 didn\u2019t understand.This is a key element of this nationalist turn. We\u2019ve all been slow to see that happening, but that\u2019s a big trend going down, the distinction between rights and gifts. It helps to understand that.Isaiah Berlin called nationalism the bent twig. Globalization can bend the twig back, but at a certain point it will snap back with renewed force, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in Brexit. It\u2019s happening across Europe.Advertisement"}

More than 100,000 have registered in the past year, but only those who registered before Jan. 12, 2016, will be allowed to vote for leader in the upcoming ballot, according to a party statement.The discord in the party has been one of the many aftershocks of the June 23 referendum, in which Britons voted to leave the European Union.Mr. Corbyn supported British membership in the bloc of 28 nations, and, by his estimation, about three-quarters of Labour Party supporters voted to remain. (The decision to leave was approved by 52 percent, with 48 percent voting to remain.)\u201cThese are dark times for Labour, and they are dangerous times for our country,\u201d Ms. Eagle said. \u201cA referendum to settle an argument in the Conservative Party has resulted in the country being torn apart: our economy damaged, our society hurt.\u201dOn Twitter, she wrote she was glad the committee had reached a decision. \u201cI welcome the contest ahead. And I am determined to win it,\u201d Ms. Eagle said.Reflecting the heightened tensions in the Labour Party, Ms. Eagle\u2019s office said in a statement on Tuesday that a brick had been thrown through the window of her constituency office in Wallasey, near Liverpool, overnight or in the morning.An Eagle campaign meeting at a hotel in Luton, about 30 miles northwest of London, was relocated in response to death threats, and the police were informed, the statement said. Mr. Corbyn later condemned the attacks, calling on all Labour Party members to \u201ctreat each other with respect and dignity, even when there is disagreement.\u201dMr. Cameron intends to formally resign on Wednesday after a regular session of prime minister\u2019s questions, and Queen Elizabeth II is expected to formally ask Ms. May on Wednesday afternoon to form a government.A moving van arrived at No. 10 Downing Street on Tuesday as Mr. Cameron, in office since 2010, and his family prepared to move out, leaving behind a cat, Larry, which officials said belongs to the Civil Service.Though Mr. Corbyn has strong grass-roots support among members of the party, he has never had the full support of lawmakers in the party.Mr. Corbyn has refused to resign, saying that he was democratically elected by the party\u2019s members, and vowed to run again if a new leadership contest were called.Sewell Chan reported from London, and Russell Goldman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Internships Are Not a Privilege", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTALENT is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And while many Americans believe fervently and faithfully in expanding opportunity, America\u2019s internship-industrial complex does just the opposite.As the summer internship season gets into full swing, consider, for instance, how a plum internship may alter a young person\u2019s career trajectory. While some students take a summer job in food service to pay the bills, others can afford to accept unpaid jobs at high-profile organizations, setting them on a more lucrative path.I remember my own paid internships with fondness and gratitude, especially my formative experience working for the Texas Legislature. As a low-income kid from a small town who entered college without an extended network, my internships equipped me with the skills, confidence and relationships to channel my potential into a rewarding career.And whether it\u2019s an internship, college admission or any of the many other factors that determine a successful life, leaders who say they want to address inequality actually \u2014 and often unconsciously \u2014 reinforce the dynamics that create inequality in their own lives.Even when financial considerations are no object, networking \u2014 the role of parents and others in helping young people score internships \u2014 disadvantages students from places that are underrepresented in positions of leadership.The stakes of America\u2019s broken internship system are high. As report after report reminds us, this generation of students faces significantly worse job prospects than its predecessors. Without the short-term opportunities to help them learn, grow, connect with mentors and begin climbing the earnings curve, many promising young people with limited means are denied the chance to rise as high as their talent will take them.The result is not limited to the labor market. The broader implication is privilege multiplied by privilege, a compounding effect prejudiced against students who come from working-class or lower-income circumstances. By shutting out these students from entry-level experiences in certain fields, entire sectors engineer long-term deficits of much-needed talent and perspective. In other words, we\u2019re all paying the price for unpaid internships.Fortunately, there is another option. Many organizations are beginning to pay interns. This is important because employers should not only compensate students for their time and contributions, but also eliminate barriers that prevent low-income and underrepresented students from pursuing these opportunities.While some nonprofits may be unable to pay their interns \u2014 even though they depend on their contributions of energy and know-how \u2014 the government can help turn unpaid positions into paid opportunities for those at risk of getting left behind.A few years ago, researchers at the Economic Policy Institute and Demos proposed using existing student aid programs \u2014 including Federal Work-Study and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 to facilitate internship grants for low-income students. Their proposed Student Opportunity Program would provide funding equal to $3,500 for three-month grants and $7,000 for six-month grants to students who couldn\u2019t afford to work without compensation.At the same time, while compensating interns is necessary, it is not sufficient.At the Ford Foundation, we take seriously the responsibility to ensure our paid internships help dismantle privilege. In addition to screening for strong academic performance and an interest in social justice issues, our managers require that interns be recipients of needs-based financial aid. In this way, we offer sought-after positions to young people who otherwise might not have the chance to pursue them.The right internship can put a young person onto a trajectory for success. This is precisely why those of us who oversee internship programs ought to make sure they provide a hand up to all people of promise, not merely a handout that, best intentions aside, accelerates a cycle of privilege and reward.For countless Americans, me among them, internships have provided a foothold on the path to the American dream. Simply by making them more accessible to all, we can narrow the inequality gap while widening the circle of opportunity, long after the summer ends.Darren Walker is the president of the Ford Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Currency Intended to Unite Europe Wound Up Dividing It", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byIt was started in the name of forging a greater sense of union among the disparate nations of Europe. It was supposed to enhance commercial ties, erode borders and foster a spirit of collective interest, furthering the evolution of former wartime combatants into fellow nations of a united Europe.What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.It is difficult to overstate the economic trauma Europe has suffered in recent years \u2014 veritable depressions in Greece and Spain, alarming levels of unemployment across much of the continent. You place much of the blame on the euro. What happened?The euro was an attempt to advance the economic integration of Europe by having the countries of the eurozone share a common currency. They looked across the Atlantic and they said: \u201cThe United States, big economy, very successful, single currency. We should imitate.\u201dBut they didn\u2019t have the political integration. They didn\u2019t have the conditions that would make a single currency work. The creation of the euro is the single most important explanation for the extraordinarily poor performance of the eurozone economies since the crisis of 2008.Were there warnings when the euro was begun that maybe it wasn\u2019t such a wonderful idea?Yes, but it was mostly Americans, and that may have colored the reaction to it: \u201cOh, you don\u2019t understand the value of the European project.\u201d But the criticism was not that we don\u2019t agree with the European project, but that you were undertaking something that will undermine the European project, because it\u2019s not going to work. Their answer was, \u201cWe will create institutions as we go along.\u201d A lot of people pushing for this were not economists.You blame the euro for widening economic inequality. How has this played out?The idea was that for the euro to work, the countries had to converge, and they formulated these ideas called the convergence criteria. They put enormous pressure on the countries to keep their deficits and debts relative to G.D.P. down. That was viewed as the necessary and almost sufficient conditions for making the euro work.Several of the countries that went into crisis, Spain and Ireland among them, actually had a surplus before the crisis, and a very low debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. But they still had a crisis. That tells us an important lesson: What the people who were behind the creation of the euro thought was going to be a critical condition was not.The disappointing thing was that after the crisis, they didn\u2019t learn a lesson. What they did was double down on that same recipe \u2014 austerity. The structure of the euro was at fault, and the policies they enacted amplified the structural deficiencies. The result was that the countries diverged.In your telling, Germany has imposed austerity across Europe out of faith in a discredited economic idea, the notion that if policy makers concentrate solely on preventing budget deficits and inflation, the markets can be counted on to deliver prosperity. A lot of your book is devoted to demolishing this idea. Does the German elite still really believe in this philosophy, or is something else at play?I\u2019ve visited Germany often, and I\u2019m shocked about how strong the belief is in this view that has been totally discredited elsewhere.But the policies are mixed together with interests. When the Greek crisis broke out in 2010, what was really at risk were German and to some extent French banks. And there was an enormous bailout that was called a bailout of Greece but was really a bailout of German and French banks. Most of the money went to Greece and then right away went back to Germany and France.When you look at other aspects of the program, you see that it is also helping special interests within Europe.How so?Let me give you an example of one of the really absurd things they did. They demanded that Greece scrap a rule that fresh milk is no more than four days old. If milk was older than four days, it needed to be labeled.Of all the things that were going on, why would you have a debate about that?The German and the Dutch dairy industries wanted to ship their factory-farmed milk across Europe and sell it to Greek consumers. That would devastate the small Greek producers. Here was something that could only be seen as benefiting special interests in the eurozone and actually weakening the Greek economy.You argue that some European leaders secretly welcomed mass unemployment as a means of adjusting to the crisis because this was the only way they could see to spur investment \u2014 lowering wages. The strictures of the euro took other options off the table: Crisis countries could not let their currency fall or lower interest rates or expand government spending. Was unemployment really embraced as a fix?They wanted to break the back of workers. Their view was that workers needed to accept a wage cut and we are going to change the bargaining rules to make it more difficult for them to resist. And if we need to add on a little dose of unemployment, well, that\u2019s unfortunate.Doesn\u2019t that goal predate the crisis?It\u2019s very clear that the euro was a neo-liberal project in its construction. Employers like low wages. They have broken the back of the unions in many of the countries of Europe. They would view that as a great achievement.The whole point of the European project has been to get past the hostilities of World War II and build a sustainable community. Yet, in your telling, the euro and the policies delivered to preserve it left much of Europe nursing fresh grievances. How are these grievances coloring politics?The most important divergence is between creditor, Germany, and debtor, the rest. The criticisms that you hear in Greece of the Germans, they are reliving the horrors of World War II; the criticism in Germany of the Greeks, saying that they are lazy even though the number of hours that they work per week is higher than the Germans\u2019. The flinging of accusations, whether true or not, has been enormous and the divisiveness has been enormous.I wish that were happening. Unfortunately, what I\u2019ve seen is almost the reverse. It\u2019s doubling down on a failed experiment. It\u2019s a hard-line approach in which the European leaders in response to Brexit, people like Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the head of the European Commission, have said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very, very tough on the U.K. because we want to make sure that no other country leaves.\u201dTo me that was shocking. You hope that people want to stay in the E.U. because it\u2019s delivering benefits, because there\u2019s a belief in European solidarity, the belief that it\u2019s bringing prosperity. He\u2019s saying the only way we are going to keep the E.U. together is by the threat of what happens if you think about leaving.You conclude that the best-case scenario from here is to reform and save the euro. But absent that, you contend that it is better to just scrap it as a failed experiment. What needs to happen to make the euro viable?A banking union with deposit insurance. Something like a euro bond. An E.C.B. that doesn\u2019t just focus on inflation \u2014 you want it to focus on employment. A tax policy that deals with the inequalities. And you have to get rid of limits on government deficits.What\u2019s your sense of what will actually happen?It is hard to believe that the muddling-through can continue for another five years. Greece is still in depression, no better than it was a year ago. The likelihood is there that in one country or another there will be enough support for another referendum, and an exit will occur. That will begin the process of a real unraveling of the eurozone.Advertisement"}

She has publicly declared that \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d meaning that she does intend to go through with it. But she still needs to define what Brexit means in terms of concrete actions to retain British access to Europe\u2019s single market, satisfying the anti-globalization and anti-immigration mood of the 17 million Leave voters, managing the economic fallout of the referendum and coping with increased separatism in Scotland and Northern Ireland.On Wednesday, Ms. May named Mr. Johnson as foreign secretary. This was a surprising and, in some quarters, disturbing choice given the ease and frequency with which he insults foreign leaders; it is unclear whether it will complicate her task. In any case, she needs to move quickly. Uncertainty has already battered Britain\u2019s economy. Even as Ms. May accepts the mandate to negotiate Britain\u2019s formal exit from the European Union, she should make clear to the British that their country\u2019s economic future must be within the single market. And that will inevitably require puncturing any illusion that Britain can continue participating in that market without allowing free movement of people and making any contribution to the E.U. budget. More uncertainty can only do more damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slowdown in Merger Deals Attributed to Political Uncertainty", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byUncertainty is often a deal breaker.It can be largely blamed for a string of declines in acquisitions announced during the first half of the year in almost every sector, location and size compared with the same period in 2015. Many executives were hesitant to pull the trigger.About $1.6 trillion worth of deals were announced this year through Thursday, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That represented a 19 percent slump from the first half of the year in 2015 and a slight increase from the same period in 2014. The number of deals \u2014 21,086 \u2014 represented an almost 5 percent decline, indicating that the transactions are smaller.Then, of course, there is the multitude of unknowns surrounding Britain\u2019s unexpected vote to leave the European Union.\u201cBrexit is just the cherry on top,\u201d Kai Liekefett, a partner in the mergers and acquisitions group at Vinson & Elkins, said in a phone interview. \u201cA very bitter cherry.\u201dBritain\u2019s referendum caught many mergers and acquisitions professionals by surprise. A survey by Intralinks published on June 17 showed that 80 percent of deal makers did not believe Britain would leave the E.U. About two-thirds of those surveyed believed that Britain\u2019s departure would have a negative impact on merger activity throughout Europe.Since the vote on June 23, deal makers have been scrambling to determine what it means for clients. So far only a few deals, such as Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s acquisition of the London Stock Exchange, appear to be on thin ice after the vote.Some bankers in the United States have decided to work through the Fourth of July holiday weekend to figure it out.Others have extrapolated what Brexit might indicate about the election in the United States in November. Historically, elections have influenced executives\u2019 willingness to do larger deals because of the turnover expected among regulators who oversee corporate matters and those who handle antitrust concerns.\u201cThe Brexit vote has brought the notion of what is this global populist moment going to do to the global economy,\u201d said Paul Stefanick, head of Americas corporate and investment banking at Deutsche Bank. \u201cPeople are getting more risk-averse until they see the outcome of the election.\u201dThat is not to say deal making will be completely dormant. On Thursday, Lionsgate, the movie studio behind \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d agreed to buy Starz, the premium cable channel, for about $4.4 billion. Just a few weeks ago, Microsoft agreed to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. About six weeks earlier, Abbott signed a deal with St. Jude Medical for $25 billion to enhance its offerings for medical devices. Bankers and lawyers say other deals are in the works, but many do not expect them to reach the level of the activity seen in 2015.To be fair, 2015 was a record year in terms of global deal volume, with about $4.7 trillion worth of deals signed. Some of those have since fallen apart.After the Treasury Department introduced new tax rules, Pfizer abandoned its $152 billion merger with Allergan. Buyers\u2019 remorse led to the termination of Energy Transfer Equity and Williams Companies\u2019 $38 billion combination, after a judge ruled that Energy Transfer could get out. Antitrust concerns caused the breakup of Baker Hughes\u2019 $35 billion proposed combination with fellow oil-field services company Halliburton. Those concerns also thwarted the $6.3 billion Staples-Office Depot deal.Ron Sargent, the chief executive of Staples, said in May that he was stepping down, a signal to other executives that undergoing tricky deals could cost them their jobs.\u201cConfidence is shattered in the executive level,\u201d said Mario Ponce, co-head of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett\u2019s mergers and acquisitions practice. \u201cPeople are pausing and being very thoughtful and hunkering down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lael Brainard, Donning a Global Lens, Champions Low Rates at Fed", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lael Brainard is poised to win another round this week in her fight for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.Ms. Brainard, a Fed governor in Washington since 2014, has emerged over the last year as a leading advocate for patience, pressing the case that low rates are important for domestic economic growth and for global stability.The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it again will pass on an opportunity to increase its benchmark interest rate, although officials have said they are still considering rate increases later in the year.Ms. Brainard has become the leading voice among Fed officials for a concern widely shared among left-leaning economists: that the central bank will raise rates too quickly, potentially stifling economic growth. It is a role that has raised her profile in Democratic circles, and driven speculation that she is in line for a top job if Hillary Clinton wins the White House.Gene Sperling, a longtime Democratic policy maker who is now advising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, hired Ms. Brainard as his deputy at the Bill Clinton White House in the mid-1990s. He said he was tickled that lately, when he gives public speeches, he is often asked about her views.\u201cMy outside impression is that she has been as much a champion as anyone on the inside for the go-slow, full-employment perspective that many of us on the outside are advocating for,\u201d Mr. Sperling said.Ms. Brainard has fueled the talk about her future by donating $2,700 to the Clinton campaign \u2014 the maximum amount an individual can give \u2014 raising eyebrows at the Fed and among congressional Republicans. Mrs. Clinton has said she intends to fill half her cabinet with women, and Ms. Brainard is among the few widely regarded as having the relevant credentials to serve as United States trade representative \u2014 or, even better, Treasury secretary, a job no woman has ever held.Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Fed, said Ms. Brainard\u2019s donations \u201ccall into question the political independence\u201d of the central bank. Fed officials have said that Ms. Brainard did not violate any rules.Ms. Brainard declined to be interviewed for this article. The description of her views is based on her public remarks and the accounts of others.Ms. Brainard\u2019s case for caution combines the idea that the domestic economy is not ready for higher rates, with something new and controversial: that the Fed should care about other countries.The American economy, until recently, seemed impervious to all but the largest global shocks. But the integration of financial markets has increased the importance of events elsewhere. The rest of the world plays a growing role in determining American mortgage rates.\u201cThe world has just changed fundamentally,\u201d Ms. Brainard said at a New York conference in February. \u201cWhat China does matters to the U.S.\u201dIn placing greater weight on the global economy, Ms. Brainard has argued that the Fed needs to consider the impact of its decisions on other countries. She said at the February conference the Fed might achieve better results by coordinating with other central banks.Otherwise, she said, countries may simply steal growth from one another.This view has drawn criticism both inside and outside the Fed.Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who argued with Ms. Brainard at the February conference, said in a recent interview that Congress had instructed the Fed to focus on the United States.\u201cI tell other central banks, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry to tell you this, but the Fed doesn\u2019t care about you at all,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Meyer, who runs L. H. Meyer, a research firm. \u201cYou can say that\u2019s very nasty, very selfish. But do you think that other central banks care about us? Of course not. They don\u2019t want us to hurt them, but they don\u2019t care what their actions do to us.\u201dOthers, however, say a recalibration is overdue. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international economics at Cornell University, said financial integration had clearly amplified the Fed\u2019s role in the global economy, even if the contours were just beginning to be understood.\u201cMany people have taken an ostrich \u2018head in the sand\u2019 approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the financial channel is clearly a crucial one, and the fact that it is not well understood is not an excuse for ignoring it.\u201dMs. Brainard was raised to see America in the context of a broader world. As the daughter of a State Department diplomat, she spent parts of her childhood in communist Poland and in East Germany.\u201cShe is basically an internationalist,\u201d said Edwin M. Truman, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who worked with Ms. Brainard in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. \u201cThat\u2019s not particularly popular these days, but she lives and breathes the idea we\u2019re all in the same boat and we need to cooperate. And cooperating doesn\u2019t mean do what the U.S. says \u2014 or else.\u201dMs. Brainard, who holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, was hired in 1997 as Mr. Sperling\u2019s deputy on the National Economic Council. Mr. Sperling, then 38, said he was advised to find a more experienced deputy than Ms. Brainard, then 35. But she was already working at the White House, and each time he interviewed someone else, he came away convinced that Ms. Brainard was a superior choice. Ms. Brainard later served as President Clinton\u2019s \u201csherpa,\u201d or liaison, to the Group of 8 industrial nations.\u201cShe\u2019s supersmart, well prepared, even-tempered,\u201d said Mr. Sperling, who worked with Ms. Brainard in the Obama administration. \u201cAnything she touches will be done to the highest standards.\u201dAfter spending eight years at the Brookings Institution, waiting out George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, she joined the Obama administration as under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department. In that role, she spent long hours trying to cajole European leaders into addressing the continent\u2019s problems with greater vigor. She also played a leading role in selling an overhaul of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s ownership structure that gave greater control to emerging economies, principally China, at the expense of advanced economies, particularly in Europe.Ms. Brainard is \u201cnot a backslapper,\u201d said Mr. Sperling, but she has developed a reputation as a subtle but unbending advocate for the goals she is assigned to pursue.Mr. Prasad, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, said Ms. Brainard conveyed a sense of empathy and respect for the interests of other countries. \u201cShe did not come across as a very aggressive advocate, so she was a very effective advocate,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a lot of credibility with policy makers around the world as a consequence of that, especially in emerging markets.\u201dMs. Brainard joined the Fed in the summer of 2014, but she said almost nothing about monetary policy until October 2015, as the Fed prepared to raise rates for the first time since the financial crisis.The move was hotly criticized by left-leaning economists and by centrist Democrats like Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. And in that October speech, Ms. Brainard chimed in, breaking with the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, to argue that the Fed was overstating the risk of inflation and underestimating the threat of a global downturn.Ms. Brainard and Daniel Tarullo \u2014 a fellow governor and former colleague in the Clinton administration who raised similar concerns \u2014 ultimately acquiesced in the Fed\u2019s December increase, providing Ms. Yellen with unanimous support.While regional reserve presidents frequently dissent, no Fed governor has done so in the last decade.But since December, Ms. Brainard\u2019s public speeches have become more frequent and more forceful. And maybe she won\u2019t need to formally dissent. After all, the Fed, which entered the year predicting that it would raise rates four times, has yet to move again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Villagers Protest Plans for U.S. Missile Defense System", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea announced on Wednesday that a rural southern county would be the site of an advanced American missile defense battery, the planned deployment of which has angered China and North Korea \u2014 and, now, thousands of local residents, who demonstrated against the plan.Most South Koreans support the country\u2019s military alliance with the United States, citing the need to deter the North. But many also fear that any expansion of the American military presence could worsen tensions with the North and with China, and in some cases could damage local ways of life.South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that the Thaad battery would be installed at an existing South Korean Air Force radar and missile base on a mountain in Seongju. The South Korean unit will be moved elsewhere, it said.The deployment in Seongju will allow the Thaad system\u2019s interceptor missiles to protect from half to two-thirds of the country from North Korean missiles, the ministry said. It said the radar system would be positioned in such a way that its powerful signals would pose no threat to human health, an assurance that villagers in Seongju did not accept.On Monday, President Park Geun-hye said that the deployment \u201cneither targets third countries nor undermines their security interests.\u201d But critics of the government, including many opposition lawmakers, worry that China will engage in economic retaliation against South Korea and cooperate less on reining in the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\u201cIt will do more harm than good to our national interest,\u201d a prominent opposition leader, Moon Jae-in, said in a statement on Wednesday. He also called on the government to submit the deployment for parliamentary approval.Under its deal with Washington, South Korea will provide land and build the base for the Thaad battery, but the United States will pay for the missile system, to be built by Lockheed Martin, as well as its operational costs.Some critics in South Korea found fault with the government\u2019s choice of Seongju as the Thaad site, noting that Seoul, with its 10 million people, will lie outside the coverage of its intercept missiles, which have a range of just under 125 miles. The Defense Ministry said it would operate low-altitude Patriot missile defense systems together with Thaad to help defend the capital.Advertisement"}

Take Dennis Haines, 57, thrown out of work in January when the printing plant where he worked for 30 years closed. Mr. Haines, a member of the machinists union, said: \u201cIt\u2019s either you stick with the establishment or you go for change. People want change. A guy like Donald Trump, he\u2019s pushing for change.\u201dNot long ago, when the mines and mills were booming and unions were much stronger, organized labor\u2019s power helped keep the region solidly Democratic. But no longer. For one thing, union membership is down in Pennsylvania, declining by 100,000 since 2008, to 747,000.The blue-collar counties of western Pennsylvania have largely swung Republican as unions have grown weaker and evangelical churches stronger. Despite overwhelmingly endorsing Hillary Clinton, labor unions face a big challenge with frustrated workers like Mr. Haines.That many white male union members are embracing Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t necessarily mean overall union membership is moving right, however. In recent years, as unions have organized more government employees and low-wage workers, the percentage of union members who are black, Hispanic or female has risen \u2014 and those groups are solidly anti-Trump.Andy Brumfield, 49, a unionized corrections officer at the county jail here, said he was excited by Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to bring jobs back. \u201cHe can\u2019t do any worse than the politicians that we have,\u201d he said. He cheers Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade and his vow to build a wall along the Mexican border. \u201cPeople are coming across willy-nilly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who want to harm our country.\u201dAn army veteran who served in the first gulf war, Mr. Brumfield is upset with Mrs. Clinton for supporting tougher gun control. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody has the constitutional right to take away anything from anybody,\u201d he said.Michael Korns, chairman of the Republican committee here in Westmoreland County, is confident that Mr. Trump can win Pennsylvania, where Mr. Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012 by a margin of 310,000 votes, 52 percent to 46.6 percent.\u201cMany voters feel that the Democratic Party, which they had supported for generations, has largely abandoned blue-collar workers,\u201d Mr. Korns said. \u201cThere\u2019s also increasingly a feeling that the Republican Party has abandoned them as well, that neither party has much interest in the day-to-day economics of working people. And then when Trump came in, he spoke to them, he grabbed them.\u201dG. Terry Madonna, a professor of public affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, said Mr. Trump might do considerably better than Mr. Romney, who lost every Rust Belt state except Indiana.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the frustration that a lot of Americans feel \u2014 white, blue-collar workers who believe the economy is passing them by, that there\u2019s still a recession, that wages haven\u2019t kept pace,\u201d Mr. Madonna said. \u201cThere\u2019s all this frustration, and then a master showman shows up who says he\u2019ll stick it to the establishment.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s views on trade, immigrants and Muslims are attractive to many blue-collar workers, but they could alienate moderate voters in Columbus, Ohio, and the suburbs of Philadelphia and Northern Virginia. Unless Mr. Trump does well in those places, Mr. Madonna said, he will lose Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia.Labor leaders and Mrs. Clinton are intent on winning back union members. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, calling her \u201can unstoppable champion for working families\u201d while dismissing Mr. Trump as \u201can unstable charlatan who made his fortune scamming them.\u201dMrs. Clinton recently spoke at a Pittsburgh union hall, where she echoed Bernie Sanders in denouncing income inequality. \u201cWe need both a growth economy and a fairness economy where profits and paychecks rise together,\u201d she said.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spoke to applauding workers at a scrap-metal plant in Westmoreland County. He denounced \u201cfailed trade policies,\u201d saying he would renegotiate Nafta and scrap the proposed Trans-Pacific trade deal. He also borrowed Mr. Sanders\u2019s arguments to attack Mrs. Clinton from the left, saying she \u201cvoted for virtually every trade agreement.\u201d He added that she has betrayed American workers in favor of \u201cWall Street throughout her career.\u201dLate this summer, unions will mobilize a nationwide campaign to knock on doors, mail out pro-Clinton literature and speak to members at their workplaces.Tim Waters, the political director of the United Steelworkers, said his Pittsburgh-based union will warn its members that Mr. Trump isn\u2019t pro-worker: \u201cHe\u2019s a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201dUnions have compiled a long list of objections to Mr. Trump. In one debate, he said wages were too high. Many workers have sued his companies for cheating them on wages. His Las Vegas hotel is battling unionization.\u201cEvery opportunity he\u2019s had to help American workers or American jobs, he did the opposite,\u201d Mr. Waters said. \u201cHe has had Trump-brand suits, shirts and ties made in Bangladesh, China and Honduras, everywhere but the U.S. He has imported workers to work at his facilities in Florida.\u201dMike Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s political director, estimated that around one-third of union members back Mr. Trump.\u201cWhen we talked with union members and brought up the facts about Trump and how he would impact their lives, we got them to stop thinking about this as a spectacle and start thinking about how this would affect their paycheck, health care and kids\u2019 education,\u201d Mr. Podhorzer said. \u201cA lot of those voters who were thinking about Trump really backed away.\u201dTom Marino, a Republican congressman from northeast Pennsylvania who is the chairman of the Trump campaign in the state, is optimistic about his candidate\u2019s chances. \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is out speaking about bringing jobs back to the U.S., which is particularly important to Pennsylvania because of steel and coal. Trump is a breath of fresh air who has created jobs.\u201dBut some voters are reluctantly backing Mr. Trump simply out of frustration with the status quo. \u201cWe need someone who will say things are wrong and will push hard to fix them,\u201d said Paul Myers, a 50-year-old steelworker. \u201cTrump might be lying about bringing jobs back, but at least he\u2019ll try to.\u201dSteven Greenhouse, a former labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cThe Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Dropping the Trans-Pacific Partnership May Be a Bad Idea", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIt might seem pretty painless, at this juncture, to throw the Trans-Pacific Partnership under the bus.But that would barely scratch the surface of an economy that already generates $18 trillion a year and will probably be at least double that in 15 years. Wages would be a trivial 0.19 percent higher than otherwise. Unskilled labor would reap 25 percent of the modest gains, the commission estimated, against 41 percent going to skilled workers and 34 percent to business owners.This hardly adds up to a chest-thumping endorsement.With an angry insurgency of white, working-class voters propelling Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to wall off Mexicans, ban Muslims and batten down the hatches against products made in China and elsewhere, even the most articulate champions of the liberal trading order wonder whether Washington\u2019s globalization campaign may have finally overstepped.\u201cWe may have to pull back the rhetoric for open borders, open capital flows, open trade,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell. \u201cMaybe we should take a breather from that because the pushback against this agenda could put us in a worse place.\u201dStill, the prospect of killing the trade and business deal, which would lower tariffs in a dozen nations around the Pacific Rim and wrap them into a set of rules of the road, immediately raises a question: What happens next? Is the alternative of no deal \u2014 and the absence of the United States means there would be none at all \u2014 any better?Like the Clinton administration, and that of George H. W. Bush before him, the Obama administration\u2019s trade diplomacy is not just about gaining access to foreign markets and advancing the interests of American business abroad.The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to promote development and economic stability in Mexico. Allowing China into the World Trade Organization was part of a strategy to draw the most populous nation on earth into the rules-based fold of the market democracies.Neither strategy performed flawlessly, to say the least. The introduction of Nafta could not prevent a crippling economic crisis from blowing up in Mexico just a few months later. It certainly did not stop unauthorized immigration. China, contrary to Washington\u2019s rosy predictions, hasn\u2019t embraced democracy. And it has often found ways to bend the trade rules and manipulate its currency.And yet despite the merits of these critiques, what would have happened had these deals not come to pass? As social scientists like to say, what are the counterfactuals?America\u2019s embrace of an aggressive globalization agenda over the last half-century must be rethought. For starters, policy makers should act on the promise \u2014 empty so far \u2014 that some of the gains accruing to winners will be deployed to make the losers whole. That means investing in training, income support and the like.It\u2019s also time to rethink some of the basic tenets of trade deals, including the way international rules are used to constrain democratic decisions within nations. Whatever the economic merits of easing the access of American companies to world markets, a trade agenda devised to serve corporate interests is no longer politically tenable.As Dani Rodrik, an economics professor at Harvard, put it: \u201cOnce you accept the prevailing terms of the discussion \u2013 that trade negotiations are about exchanging market access, that financial globalization is a desirable end goal for everyone, that Congress can have limited input into trade agreements, etc., then you have necessarily tilted the playing field in favor of those particular interests.\u201dBut does this build an argument to nix the Trans-Pacific Partnership? That deal doubles down on some of these sins, particularly when it comes to protecting the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. But it is also true that by the standards of past trade agreements, the partnership does better in looking out for the interests of workers.\u201cWe want to make sure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared,\u201d said Michael Froman, the United States\u2019 top trade negotiator. \u201cNot all trade agreements in the past met the needs of the broad public.\u201d In Nafta, agreements on labor and the environment were afterthoughts. They are a central part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.In fact, critics of the terms under which China joined the W.T.O. should like the Pacific trade deal much better. \u201cThe T.P.P. is an antidote,\u201d said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt offers a higher standard with more protections\u201d for American companies and their workers.For strategic reasons alone, walking away may be a bad idea.China may not be in the Pacific trade deal, but the deal, to a large extent, is about China. If allowing it into the W.T.O. was about bringing it into the rules-based system, the Pacific trade deal establishes a ring of rules around it. It is a guarantee to China\u2019s nervous neighbors of Washington\u2019s commitment to the region and an effort to set standards for Asia\u2019s economic integration.Killing the deal would smack America\u2019s Asian allies \u2014 such as Japan and Vietnam \u2014 as betrayal. China would love it.\u201cIf the idea of retrenchment were to take hold and the T.P.P. were to stop, it would be a blow to U.S. influence and credibility more broadly,\u201d Mr. Prasad, the Cornell trade expert, said. \u201cIf the United States can\u2019t deliver, it\u2019s going to hurt legitimacy and credibility. That is going to be a pretty big stain.\u201dA picture caption on June 27 with the Economic Scene column, about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, misidentified the location of the photograph showing delegates to the Democratic National Convention protesting the agreement.

{"Headline": "One Thing Both Parties Want: To Break Up the Banks Again", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byDealBookCould the Glass-Steagall Act \u2014 the Depression-era legislation that forced the separation of investment banking from commercial banking, among other things \u2014 be coming back?Fast-forward to 2016: Somehow, it appears that Bernie Sanders, who is said to have pressed for the inclusion of the Glass-Steagall plank in the Democratic Party platform, and Donald J. Trump, who also pushed for the agenda item on the Republican side, do agree on something.The potential change hasn\u2019t yet become a major talking point for Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump \u2014 and there is a chance it will never be one \u2014 but the language that was inserted into both parties\u2019 formal platforms is raising eyebrows in Washington and the financial world.\u201cIn terms of political significance, the presence of the same plank in both party platforms means that the one thing we can bet on seeing in 2017 is a tougher attitude toward the financial industry,\u201d Elaine C. Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a Democratic superdelegate, wrote in an analysis.\u201cTo date,\u201d she continued, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been much interest in this in Congress. But if the establishment heard one thing loud and clear in the 2016 primaries, it was that millions of Americans think that they were the victims of Wall Street and that the next president had better pay attention.\u201dThat may be the case, but the idea of reinstating Glass-Steagall seems to sit directly behind potentially unmovable obstacles.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton \u2014 whose husband signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act into law \u2014 has publicly derided the reintroduction of Glass-Steagall, suggesting that efforts to bring it back are misguided.\u201cI\u2019m going to go after what I think are the real problems, not the problems of the past, the problems of today, because what I\u2019m interested in is stopping something like this from happening again,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on the stump last year in Iowa, talking about the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cI\u2019ve studied this real closely,\u201d she continued, \u201cand what I am proposing is we go after the risk, and if they are too big to manage, that is a risk and they should not continue. If they are so big that they are causing disruptions on the marketplace, that\u2019s a risk.\u201dThe problem with just reinstating Glass-Steagall, she said, is that \u201cyou don\u2019t go after all these other institutions in what is called the shadow banking system, hedge funds and other financial entities that have too much power in our economy.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s position has angered some Democrats on the left, like Mr. Sanders. They have made the case that she is too close to Wall Street banks.For another, Mr. Trump has declared that he plans to repeal much of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in 2010 as something of a modern-day version of Glass-Steagall. Dodd-Frank, a response to the Wall Street collapse of 2008-9, both bailed out the financial services industry and imposed new regulatory restrictions on it.The idea of wiping away Dodd-Frank while restoring Glass-Steagall seems like something of a contradiction. For those trying to square the circle, some Republicans have suggested that bringing back Glass-Steagall is more free-market than the various regulations embedded in Dodd-Frank.It\u2019s worth noting there is little love lost between the nation\u2019s biggest banks and Mr. Trump: Most of the country\u2019s biggest banks haven\u2019t lent money to him in years.This column has spilled a lot of ink on the topic of Glass-Steagall over the years, including an admission from Elizabeth Warren that reinstating the law would not have prevented a crisis in 2008. Whether reinstating the law is good idea or not, the short-term implications are decidedly negative: It would most likely mean a loss of jobs as part of a slowdown in lending from the biggest banks.There is a reasonable argument to make that it would also put the United States banking industry at a competitive disadvantage relative to international peers, some of which face fewer restrictions. Maybe that\u2019s all a fair trade-off for a sounder system, but the implications need to be understood on all sides. If the goal is to jump-start the United States economy and create more jobs, reinstating Glass-Steagall will most likely hinder, not help.So what\u2019s the chance that the law actually comes back?Very small. But it may have an impact that has so far been largely ignored: \u201cWhile lawmakers remain unlikely to re-enact the Glass-Steagall Act, we believe the big-bank bashing from both parties will eventually lead to targeted policies aimed at lessening the relative regulatory burden for regional and community banks,\u201d Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, wrote in a note to investors.In addition, he suggested, \u201cTrump\u2019s actions will likely force Clinton to compensate by reiterating and expanding her calls for increased scrutiny of the shadow banking system, which could pose additional headline risk for asset managers, global insurers and nonbank lenders.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Day 2", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementCLEVELAND \u2014 By saying almost nothing about Donald Trump on Tuesday night, Paul Ryan said it all.  Trump isn\u2019t the star of his own convention. Hillary Clinton is. What really animates the Republicans gathered here is their antipathy toward her, not their embrace of him. Speaker after speaker makes the case against her, not the one for him. And a weird impression is taking hold: They\u2019re filling the minutes and running out the clock with all the bad that they can dredge up about her because there\u2019s not enough good to plumb in him. He\u2019s not their shining hero. He\u2019s just their sole alternative. \u201cOnly with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance of a better way,\u201d Ryan said, and it\u2019s worth paying close attention to a few of those words. Only. Better. This was the vocabulary of resignation, not of exultation. Without hatred of Clinton, the delegates had \u2026 what? Not Trump, not on Tuesday night. He had gone back to New York City \u2014 he\u2019s always happiest in a tower with his name on it \u2014 though he beamed in via a Jumbotron to say a quick hello. He predicted victory in November. He vowed \u2014 wait for it! \u2014 \u201cto make America great again.\u201d He asked a question: \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d The response lacked energy. I took it as a no. About that promised greatness: If Trump can\u2019t ace four days in Cleveland, how\u2019s he going to ace four years in Washington? He keeps telling us what a paragon of competence and purveyor of wonder he is, but there\u2019s scant evidence of that here so far, and the mess surrounding Melania Trump\u2019s remarks is only the half of it. He promised the sun, the moon and Hollywood stars. He gave us Scott Baio. The speeches ran late on Monday. They started late on Tuesday. And so far, they\u2019ve failed utterly to do the one thing they must: sell Trump to those voters who are still skeptical about him. Chris Christie followed Ryan, and spent so much time detailing Clinton\u2019s sins that there was little left for Trump\u2019s virtues. Ben Carson followed Christie, and lavished most of his peculiar oratorical energy on Clinton, whom he linked to Saul Alinsky and, by extension, Lucifer. You had to hear it to believe it, and you had to assume that Carson\u2019s were yet another set of remarks not thoroughly vetted by the crackerjack Trump operation. Carson mustered no such grandiloquence for Trump, who had to make do with Carson\u2019s leftovers. What a rich twist. At his own coronation, someone who insists on adulation is being turned into an afterthought. It\u2019s not much of a testament to his management skills. It\u2019s not much of a testament, period. The Republican National Convention has echoed with all kinds of accusations against Democrats, but perhaps the oddest came when Dr. Ben Carson spoke to the arena Tuesday evening and suggested that Hillary Clinton may be \u2026 a devil-worshipper.  Whoah. Frankly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for an exorcism of demons\u2014and not from Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump is rising, and Roger Ailes is tumbling \u2014 and their trajectories are deeply interwoven. Indeed, Trump is the Republican nominee perhaps in part because Fox News and other prominent right-wing commentators weakened the control of Republican Party bosses. Fox News certainly didn\u2019t create Trump, and he had many disputes with it and especially with Megyn Kelly, but Fox created space that Trump filled. I disagree profoundly with much of Fox News\u2019 reporting, but it\u2019s impossible to deny its importance as a social and political force in America. Yet Ailes\u2019s apparent downfall also reflects a larger weakness as well: If he had vision, he also suffered from myopia. The ugly sexual harassment of which Ailes is accused was common a generation ago and too often was accepted as boys-will-be-boys behavior. But times have changed, and he apparently continued in the 2010s conduct that is no longer winked at and is now often (unfortunately, not often enough) taken very seriously. Ailes was stuck in the past, and now he apparently will end his career in disgrace as a result, if the reports are correct. The Republican Party suffers a similar myopia. It continues to behave as if America were in the 1970s, and its nostalgia leads it to antagonize blacks, Latinos and Muslims, as well as many whites uncomfortable with what feels to them like bigotry. In the 2000 Republican convention, George W. Bush was careful to put black faces on the podium almost nonstop, so that people joked that convention coverage looked like Black Entertainment Television, because Bush knew that he needed to come across to American centrists as tolerant and open-minded. In contrast, the 2016 convention is mostly whites all the time. Outside of the C\u2019est La Vie shindig, Omarosa Manigault \u2014 of \u201cApprentice\u201d and \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d fame \u2014 spoke to reporters. She is the very recently announced director of African-American outreach for the Trump campaign. After a testy exchange about the 0 percent poll, she admitted that Republicans do have a problem reaching black voters, but she thinks that is changing. \u201cThe movement has already started, where Donald Trump is bringing folks who have never been involved in this party here to this convention to be a part of the movement that is making America great again,\u201d she said. After Ms. Manigault departed, Ben Carson popped out to the lobby to address the reporters he loves to hate. He admitted Republicans need to do more to reach out to black voters, but argued that Democrats have done little to improve life for African-Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity right now for the Republican Party to reach out and talk about ways that you empower people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of always looking for something negative to say, they should be saying, \u2018Do you realize that Melania Trump and Michelle Obama have the same philosophy?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat means something wonderful for America, that Democrats and Republicans can grasp and elevate the same ideas. That means there\u2019s hope for us.\u201d Also on hand at this gathering of black Republicans? Herman Cain, the Godfather\u2019s Pizza magnate and 2012 candidate in the G.O.P. presidential primary. He emerged to tell reporters that he is happy for Mr. Trump\u2019s success. \u201cThe voice of the people is what caused him to get the nomination for the Republican Party, period,\u201d he said. Inside the event, an intimate group of black Republicans \u2014 including some who had not previously run for president or appeared on television shows produced by people running for president \u2014 milled about. I found Eugene Craig, a vice chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, whom I\u2019d first met last year at a campaign event for Senator Rand Paul at a historically black college in Maryland. \u201cAre you planning to vote for Donald Trump?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m bound to support the Republican nominee. As the vice chair of the Maryland Republican Party, I\u2019m bound to support the Republican nominee,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you sound very enthusiastic,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I will say this. There are some things I want to see out of Donald Trump, absolutely. I think he has to come out strongly in favor of criminal justice reform,\u201d he responded, adding that he was heartened by Ms. Manigault\u2019s addition to the Trump campaign. As Ben Carson would say, this is a wonderful opportunity for the Republican Party. CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump, whose fortune comes in large part from renting out his name, appears to be losing control of his brand to a horde of Cleveland souvenir hawkers. Mr. Trump earns money by putting his name on everything from hotels and casinos to steaks and wine. Street vendors in Cleveland earn money by putting Mr. Trump\u2019s name on T-shirts, coolers, key chains, bobbleheads, sundresses and beer koozies. The official G.O.P. convention shops inside and outside the Quicken Loans Arena \u2014 but within the security perimeter \u2014 primarily sell hats and T-shirts with the official Donald Trump campaign logo. The Republican Party has tried to ban entrepreneurs from selling official-looking Trump merchandise, because the profits from the party\u2019s own sales benefit its campaign fund. The Future Female Leaders booth next to the arena can\u2019t sell Trump merchandise, so it sells everything but. Its name began as a Twitter account, set up by Amanda Owens for conservative young women. The women in the booth, who wear red skirts printed with tiny elephants, do a brisk business in what might be called creative conservative apparel. The biggest sellers are tank tops with the slogans \u201cAin\u2019t No Party Like the Grand Ole Party\u201d and \u201cPARTY like it\u2019s 1776.\u201d Delshaun Jackson sells his bootleg Trump T-shirts from a pop-up tent on Superior Avenue. But they\u2019re not selling as well as his own design, a shirt that reads \u201cRNC-CLE: I was here,\u201d which he figures will be a big hit if riots break out. Mr. Jackson is no Trump supporter. He says the man is \u201cso hateful that he\u2019s running on sending everybody back across the border.\u201d Besides, Mr. Jackson said, he did a lot better with Cleveland Cavaliers merchandise after they won the N.B.A. championship last month than he is doing with the famous Trump brand. After a day of hearing everyone with a microphone handy talking about Melania Trump\u2019s lifting of a passage from a speech by Michelle Obama, I had a tune running though my head. Lobachevsky, it seems, said the secret to success at mathematics is to plagiarize. \u201cOnly be sure always to call it please \u2026 research.\u201d What really jumped out after hearing Melania Trump was the line in the song about the immortal Lobachevsky\u2019s first book. \u201cEvery chapter I stole from somewhere else,\u201d the lyric goes. \u201cIndex I copy from old Vladivostok telephone directory.\u201d That was 63 years ago. Seems like it was the final word. This kind of saber-rattling and phobic speech may have seemed familiar to the snark-virtuosos on Twitch, the gigantic platform for players of (mostly) video games, which is streaming the convention this week, the company\u2019s first foray into news and politics. Twitch considers the livestream a public service to \u201cthe millions of U.S. voters who call Twitch home,\u201d most of whom, according to Quantcast, are childless Caucasian men under 24 living in lower-income households. The site\u2019s chat section is known for insult comedy, bluster and bellicosity. \u201cLib mods,\u201d perhaps, was a reproof to moderators seen to be deleting pro-Trump posts. But maybe it meant something else. At the same time, other Twitch members were invited to stream the convention on their own channels, and there they could host more pointedly ideological chats. On a channel run by rthe_donald, a Twitch member called Str8UpGankster riffed on Mr. Trump\u2019s threat that his proposed wall be built higher each time the idea is criticized. \u201cNext stop: The White House! The Trump train just got 10,000 m.p.h. faster!\u201d \u201cCrooked Hillary\u2019s prison sentence just got 10 days longer!\u201d The pugnacious language of Twitch is enlightening. It syncs up naturally with the scattershot rage in the convention site, the Quicken Loans Arena. Unlike the network pundits, the Twitch chatters didn\u2019t try to force the off-kilter speeches to conform to reasoned analysis. Instead, they repaid the convention\u2019s tone in coin. For those who wonder where the fury and fear at the convention comes from or how it registers with young voters, Twitch chat may be more useful than cautious commentary by professionals who don\u2019t share it. The hamfistedness was unnecessary. The foray was always going to be defeated. The effort to dump Trump at the convention, while honorable, had exactly the same problems as the effort to stop him in the primaries. First, it lacked the necessary leadership. Like any coup plotters (just ask the Turks), the delegates who opposed Trump needed some support within the party apparatus for their effort to have any chance. There are plenty of notable anti-Trump Republicans \u2014 senators, governors, the party\u2019s last two presidents and its most recent presidential nominee. But except for Senator Mike Lee, who led the floor fight yesterday, they were all far away from the convention. Meanwhile the party leaders who could have cracked the door to a coup \u2014 Priebus and Paul Ryan, above all \u2014 had made their peace with nominating an authoritarian buffoon. So nominate him they will. Here it\u2019s fitting that the anti-Trump effort yesterday was entangled with an inside-baseball struggle over the design of the 2020 primaries. Even as Trump trashes the party, the establishment and the grass roots can\u2019t quit their penny-ante battles, and the establishment especially can\u2019t help itself from mobilizing against the Real Threat \u2014 which is always and forever Cruz. In other words, the coup scenario required leading Republican politicians to show sustained courage and creativity for the sake of their party and their country, and other leading politicians to respond to Trump\u2019s abnormal rise by abandoning party business as usual and leaping into the unknown. And a Republican Party that had such leaders would not have found itself in this position in the first place. Buchanan was right in a way. That cultural and religious war has come to define American politics, for the worse. His speech showed the depths to which the Republican Party had fallen in practicing the dark art of the politics of fear and division. But the Republicans, it turned out, had a lot farther to fall. For President Bush in 1992, fear and division were a sideshow. Now they are the main event. On the convention\u2019s opening night, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, gave a speech that was raw anger and hatred. Giuliani\u2019s tirade swamped whatever Trump hoped to accomplish by having his wife talk about what a wonderful guy he is. Waving his arms and shouting frequently, Giuliani declared: \u201cWe must not be afraid to define our enemy. It is Islamic extremist terrorism.\u201d It\u2019s absurd, of course, but the idea is to attack the \u201cother\u201d and still claim there is no bigotry in doing so. \u201cFailing to identify them properly maligns decent Muslims around the world,\u201d Giuliani said, without explaining how, exactly. \u201cIt also sets up a fear of being politically incorrect that can have serious consequences.\u201d Trump likes to make the same claim that people who object to his attacks on Mexicans, Muslims, women and others are being \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d That is not political correctness. It is calling out bigotry and racism for what they are. Giuliani attacked Hillary Clinton over the Obama administration\u2019s decision to help depose the Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. He said, rightly, that Libya is now in chaos. But he conveniently left out that President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to wage war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq was the gigantic blunder that set up most of the subsequent horrors in that part of the world. Giuliani\u2019s speech led nowhere in terms of actual policies or ideas, only to this rather chilling statement: \u201cIf they are at war against us \u2014 which they have declared \u2014 we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them.\u201d I can think of a couple of conditions: Basic human decency and traditional American democratic values. Giuliani\u2019s speech was effective. It whipped up the crowd in the convention hall and, no doubt, Trump supporters watching on television. It just would have been better delivered from a balcony, or at the head of a torch-bearing mob. Andrew Rosenthal is an op-ed columnist for The TimesThe main thing I\u2019ll be watching for tonight is whether Republican are in the early stages of grasping this situation. Tuesday\u2019s lineup of speakers \u2014 under the theme \u201cMake America Work Again\u201d \u2014 is certainly eclectic. It includes a soap-opera star, the president of Ultimate Fighting Championship and the general manager of Trump Winery. Sprinkled among the entertainment, however, will be many top Republicans like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy. They will each offer clues about whether Republicans understand the problem that Donald Trump has exposed. For those Republicans who have one eye on a post-Trump future, the question is which parts of Trumpism to keep. \u2013 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, speaking about Cleveland sports, at a United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce appearance in Cleveland. \nThe columnist speaks to Ralph Reed, chairman of Faith and Freedom Coalition.\nBut the unmistakable echo of Obama\u2019s words in Trump\u2019s is a bad turn for her husband and his campaign. Below are four explanations why, along with one reason that it falls well shy of a disaster. Trump is constantly telling us how incompetent everyone who\u2019s been steering the government is and how masterfully he\u2019ll take the wheel. He\u2019s incessantly crowing about what a brilliant business he manages. But his campaign keeps contradicting that. Aides come and go. He steps on his message and sullies what should be his best days. He badly bungles the rollout of his vice presidential pick, turning a potentially big media moment into the source of eye rolling and laughter. And now this. In a normal, thorough, disciplined political operation, someone is scouring all the major speakers\u2019 scripts for any potential landmines, and plagiarism is a biggie. In a normal, thorough, disciplined political operation, the person helping a speaker of Melania\u2019s stature prepare his or her remarks has a level of professionalism that greatly diminishes the possibility of what happened. Trump is once again cast as the disengaged captain of a ragtag, amateurish team. Trump\u2019s many detractors and the thousands of journalists chronicling this convention were on watch for proof that Trump\u2019s coronation had been cobbled together sloppily and at the last minute, and the hubbub over the speech\u2014which was the climax of the event\u2019s opening night\u2014confirmed such a narrative. That watch now becomes a high alert. There is no sign whatsoever that Clinton had a hand in the detection of strangely familiar lines in Melania\u2019s speech, and the assertion that Clinton feels threatened by Melania is somewhat less than persuasive. Melania has been less visible and vocal than presidential nominees\u2019 spouses typically are, a clear sign of some discomfort at the microphone. Besides which, there are three more nights of developments to overtake this one, and three and half months of cutthroat campaigning that\u2019ll turn it into a distant memory. CLEVELAND \u2013 It was odd enough that Slovenian-born Melania Trump\u2019s tribute to her husband and the value of her foreign upbringing was the crowning moment of an evening otherwise devoted to murders of children by immigrants and the ever-present threat of foreign-born terrorism. But Mrs. Trump\u2019s speech during the Republican National Convention\u2019s opening night seemed, pundits said immediately afterward, a bit remote. Mrs. Trump mentioned earlier in the day that she wrote it herself, but it was so devoid of personal detail that it could have been about anyone\u2019s family. Turns out, some of it was from Michelle Obama\u2019s family. He\u2019d been inspired by some of these same passages in Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 convention speech. So Mr. Hill looked up the speech and started tweeting. Mr. Hill\u2019s tweets went viral, retweeted more times than Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to his wife\u2019s speech. At about 2 a.m. The Trump campaign issued this statement: \u201cIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania\u2019s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success. -Jason Miller, Senior Communications Advisor.\u201d In cases like this, it\u2019s useful to compare the contexts in which the words appear. One difference jumps out: Mrs. Obama\u2019s words have been proven to be true, while the truth of Ms. Trump\u2019s remains to be seen. Eight years in office have shown that the Obamas\u2019 parents did teach them to treat people with dignity and respect even when they disagree with them. Ms. Trump\u2019s parents may have taught her the same thing, but she has never publicly objected to the low, nasty tone of the Trump campaign. For her part, Ms. Trump had to show that she, a rather reserved woman despite her modeling background, could speak without hesitation to a national audience. She had to be forceful, but not too forceful. She had to serve as an advocate for her husband but also, as first ladies are supposed to do, soften his harshness. Both women had to establish their very American, up-by-their-bootstraps credentials. In 2008, reporters cited the very lines that Ms. Trump seemed to have taken from Mrs. Obama as proof that her story was one of blue-collar origins, hard work and essential decency, not of Ivy League privilege. (Both Obamas had been mocked for their elite educations; Mrs. Obama graduated from Princeton.) For her part, Ms. Trump also had to show that she was a child of poverty, not privilege, however rich she may be now. Both women did what they had come to do, at least at first. And that, too, is notable, proving the power of those plagiarized words. \nThe columnists discuss the Republican National Convention.\nAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Brexit, Can Germany Lead Europe Alone?", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byContributing Opinion WriterBERLIN \u2014 Whether Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union turns out to be a disaster or just a bump in the road for Europe on its path to unification, one consequence is already abundantly, disturbingly clear: Brexit will cement Germany\u2019s role as the Continent\u2019s leader \u2014 a role that neither Germany nor anybody else is entirely comfortable with.It has rarely felt this lonely at the center of Europe. With Britain leaving, Germany is losing an important partner within the European Union, as well as on foreign policy beyond it.That is not to say that Britain was an easy partner in recent years. The mind reels at what Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, known for her cautious, step-by-step policies, must have thought of Prime Minister David Cameron tossing his country\u2019s membership onto the gambling table in a bid to blackmail the European Union. Ms. Merkel is a committed Europeanist; Mr. Cameron called the union \u201ctoo big, too bossy, too interfering.\u201dStill, given the nativist pressures rising in practically every country in Europe, Mr. Cameron counted as a pretty good partner. He was a strong supporter of the Berlin-led austerity politics during the financial crisis and the Greek crisis that followed.He defended the refugee deal that Ms. Merkel devised with Turkey. And when the leaders of Germany, France and Italy called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to tell him to stop backing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Cameron eagerly jumped on the line.And Mr. Cameron brought more than his personal support to the table. Britain has the largest military budget in Europe and a world-class diplomatic corps \u2014 not to mention an economy that, if not exactly firing on all cylinders, was on fire compared with much of the rest of the Continent.Britain\u2019s departure is a particularly hard blow to Germany since its other partners are weak or growing distant. The German-Polish relationship, once strong, has eroded since the nationalist Law and Justice Party came to power in Poland in 2015. Austria just missed electing the far-right Norbert Hofer as president.And France \u2014 well, it\u2019s complicated.But France is a difficult partner, too. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande enjoys the trust of neither his people (only 13 percent, according to polls conducted in June) nor his Socialist Party. He is under immense pressure from the far-right National Front, which expects to win about a third of the vote in next year\u2019s presidential election, and from France\u2019s powerful unions, which oppose Mr. Hollande\u2019s modest Anglo-German-style labor reforms. All of this \u2014 and a perpetually weak economy \u2014 leaves him unable to provide strong leadership within Europe, let alone abroad.True, Brexit doesn\u2019t require an end to British-German cooperation. But Britain faces a long period of turning inward, politically, as it deals with the implosion of its leading political parties, an empowered far right and the possibility of Scottish independence. For the foreseeable future, Germany stands alone \u2014 a role it not only did not seek, but also at times actively resisted.The problem is that a core reason for the European Union in the first place was to constrain German power by dispersing leadership roles across the membership. But what happens when the future of the union depends, arguably, on a new assertion of German power?Germany\u2019s immediate reaction to the Brexit referendum has been to call for a new burden-sharing arrangement with what\u2019s left of the old gang. On the Saturday after the vote, the foreign ministers of the European Union\u2019s founding members \u2014 Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 assembled at the Villa Borsig, the Brandenburg retreat of the German government. On Monday, Ms. Merkel summoned the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk; Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy; and Mr. Hollande of France to Berlin.The significance of the fact that she could summon her colleagues onto her own turf to discuss how they might share some of Britain\u2019s newly discarded burden was lost on no one. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\u2019s Law and Justice Party, called the idea of convening only the union\u2019s old guard \u201clittle thought through.\u201d And Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg complained at the European Union summit last week about the formation of \u201csmall clubs\u201d within the union.Thus the dilemma. Germany cannot go it alone, and doesn\u2019t want to. But without a strong partner to share the leadership, it has the unpalatable choice of letting power sit with a broad cast of unreliable partners, or creating a new inner circle. No one wants to give Law and Justice a seat at the table. But denying it will only strengthen national narcissisms in countries already troubled with euroskepticism, further splintering the Continent.Which means that Germany may have to take command, after all. It\u2019s a delicate task. But now that Germany finds itself on center stage, it might as well perform.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Williams Faces Uphill Battle in Fight With Energy Transfer", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorWhen a publicly traded company is acquired, the buyer and the target will enter into an agreement to accomplish this takeover. It is called a merger agreement because this is the structure used to acquire the company. A merger, for those who are wondering, is a legal way to combine two companies into one and eliminate all of the shareholders of the target company.The merger agreement specifies the transaction structure, but it also sets forth a road map. A merger of two public companies can almost never be completed right away. Shareholders and regulators must approve it. Financing may need to be obtained, and other consents may be warranted. Because of this, there is typically a lag of at least two to three months between the signing and announcement the merger agreement and the completion of the deal. The lag can be longer if there is a more searching antitrust inquiry.The \u201croad map\u201d dictates how the two companies will get from signing to closing. It specifies how the deal will be done and what the parties need to do to complete the transaction.This is where the conditions in a merger agreement come in. The parties are required to use some level of effort to complete the transaction. Neither party is required to close unless the specified conditions in the merger agreement are fulfilled. In other words, there are conditions to closing and each party must use \u201cefforts\u201d to fulfill them. For example, where shareholder approval is required, the merger agreement will specify that the parties have to hold a shareholder meeting and file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And there is the catchall of requiring that the parties use \u201cefforts\u201d to obtain this approval.This is the issue in the Williams case. The agreement with Energy Transfer was very favorable to Williams. It required Energy Transfer to specifically perform the agreement and complete the transaction. There was no right, as was more common in the days leading up to the financial crisis, for Energy Transfer to simply terminate the deal and pay a so-called reverse-termination fee.But if there is one lesson we learned from failed deals involving companies like Huntsman, Penn National Gaming, Clear Channel and BCE, if a deal looks like it should break, it will, no matter the legal issues.Energy Transfer\u2019s chance to escape this transaction arose out of an obscure condition in merger agreements where the consideration paid includes stock. In those situations, the stock payment is typically tax-free. The shareholders of the target company receive stock in the acquirer and do not need to pay taxes at the time of the merger because it is deemed to be a reorganization. Instead, taxes are deferred until they sell the stock they receive.To ensure the deal is indeed tax-free, there is a condition that the lawyers on both sides will give an opinion that the transaction is a tax-free reorganization. In this case, the condition required Energy Transfer\u2019s lawyers, Latham & Watkins, to give the opinion that the transaction \u201c\u2018should\u2019 be treated by the tax authorities as a tax-free exchange under Section 721(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d In the taxonomy of legal opinions, by the way, \u201cshould\u201d instead of \u201cwill\u201d is a lower standard that gives the law firm wiggle room to stick to its opinion.This is where things went awry and Williams sued. The trial court found that Latham & Watkins legitimately decided that it could no longer give this opinion. The reasons are buried in the minutiae of tax law and an unbelievably complex transaction. But the basic idea is that to be a tax-free deal in this circumstance, there had to be a certain ratio of cash to stock. This ratio is traditionally set at the time a deal is signed under I.R.S. rulings. After additional scrutiny of its client\u2019s deal at Energy Transfer\u2019s request, Latham found problems.It is suspicious of course that Latham would suddenly find this out months after the deal was signed, potentially saving its client billions of dollars. And indeed, Judge Glasscock said as much, though he justified his findings on the idea that just because things look suspicious does not mean that there is wrongdoing.The judge based his opinion on two findings. First, he read into the condition in the merger agreement a need for good faith on the part of Latham. He concluded that Latham fulfilled this requirement.Second, Latham was not a party to the merger agreement. It is really Energy Transfer\u2019s behavior that is in question here. Judge Glasscock still had to find that Energy Transfer had not breached its obligation to use \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d to close the transaction. He found that it did not, reasoning that once Latham said it could not give the opinion, Energy Transfer was off the hook.The beauty of this reasoning is that it spares the judge the headache of determining who is right on the tax point, probably an impossibility for a judge.With the tax opinion condition unfulfilled, the so-called drop-dead date occurred. This is the date that every merger agreement has, ensuring that the deal does not go on forever. But a party cannot be in breach of their agreement to invoke this right. Because the judge found that Energy Transfer was acting appropriately, it was able to terminate the deal on June 28, 2016, the agreement\u2019s drop-dead date.Williams has announced that it is appealing the Delaware court\u2019s ruling to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. It is likely to also reserve the right to argue before the higher court that Energy Transfer is still obligated to close the transaction instead of paying damages.In Delaware, the conventional wisdom is that appeals normally lose. The Delaware Supreme Court defers to the Chancery Court, particularly in a case like this in which the sides are arguing over facts.Williams\u2019 only real chance is to argue some legal error. From the briefs in the case, its most likely route is to argue that Energy Transfer could not just sit there once Latham gave its report. Instead, Energy Transfer was obligated to look for an alternative way to close the deal. And here, there is some odd inferential behavior, like the fact that Energy Transfer did not extensively consult with its transactional counsel, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, on the tax issues.Williams has nothing to lose by appealing. Even so, it all comes down to whether the Delaware Supreme Court wants to intervene and, if so, whether it agrees that reasonable efforts as a standard required more in this situation. These are valid questions, but it is going to be an uphill battle for Williams to show that this fine legal point matters given the fact-finding of the lower court judge and the penchant of the state\u2019s Supreme Court to defer to the lower court on these issues.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Seesaw Jobs Numbers Are Really Telling Us", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportThe job market is fine.The good news is that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The blockbuster 287,000 jobs the Labor Department reported employers added in June surely overstates the pace of improvement, just as surely as the miserable 11,000 jobs reported to have been added in May understated it. (The May number was originally reported as an almost-as-miserable 38,000.) A Verizon strike contributed to the seesaw, but most of it is probably driven by a mix of sampling error and the sometimes weird effects of seasonal adjustment.So as a starting point to gauge how the economy is actually doing, we can average the two months. The 149,000 jobs added per month is consistent with many other signs we see, such as steadily positive readings on surveys of businesses about their growth and hiring intentions. It is, however, a step down from the speedier job growth in the recent past. In 2015 the economy added an average of 229,000 jobs a month.Still, in some ways that slower pace of job creation is utterly foreseeable, and not even necessarily bad news. After the 2008 recession, employers could add jobs almost as rapidly as they wished, because so many unemployed people were waiting on the sidelines of the job market available to be hired.With the unemployment rate now below 5 percent, it was inevitable that the pace of job growth would slow to something in the ballpark of 100,000 jobs a month. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising, or cause for alarm, that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in 2016.But the payroll numbers that get the most attention are only a piece of the story. What do the other data buried in the 39-page report tell us about how the economy is doing as we push toward Election Day?There, the news is mixed. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent for a combination of good and bad reasons. The good news is that the labor force rose by 414,000 people, partly reversing a negative trend from the previous two months. If it continues, that would be a sign that higher wages and steady job growth are coaxing people to work. The bad news is that most of those people didn\u2019t find work; the number of people unemployed rose by 347,000.Translation: More Americans said they wanted work, but couldn\u2019t find it. But that is in many ways better than indications that they don\u2019t even want work. It suggests that over time they will find jobs and provide a lift to incomes and economic growth, even if they were still on the sidelines in June.Similarly mixed: Average hourly wages rose only 0.1 percent in June, below the 0.2 percent analysts had forecast. But those numbers are jumpy, and the 2.6 percent rise in hourly earnings over the last year does imply a rising standard of living in this time of very low inflation.So halfway through 2016, where are we? The economy continues to grow and the job market continues to improve \u2014 not at the blockbuster pace that the June payrolls number might imply, but at a steady rate that is likely to put Americans to work and deliver higher wages over time. The fear that the May numbers induced should subside for now.These numbers are for a period that predates Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, but that, too, is likely to have only indirect effects on America\u2019s economy (through global financial markets, for example).The job market is what we thought it was: not great. Not awful. Fine.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s not even obvious that Sarah Palin, for all of her challenges, was a big drag on John McCain in 2008. Mr. McCain lost by just seven percentage points \u2014 a pretty good outcome considering George W. Bush\u2019s approval ratings at the time and the state of the economy at the height of the financial crisis.Mr. Pence seems a lot less likely to shake up the race than Mrs. Palin. He carries relatively few risks and little upside for Mr. Trump.Typically, most of the effect of vice-presidential candidates can be found in their home states, where a selection can help a ticket by a couple of percentage points. There are a few examples of bigger boosts: The selection of Mrs. Palin, for instance, probably helped Mr. McCain by more than five percentage points in Alaska in 2008. But there are also instances where it\u2019s hard to identify an effect at all.Mr. Pence\u2019s home state, Indiana, is already thought to lean toward Mr. Trump. Mitt Romney carried the state by 10 points in 2012, and the Clinton campaign is not bothering to air advertisements in the state.Mr. Pence\u2019s record of supporting conservative cultural causes like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could easily define whatever modest effect his nomination ultimately has on voters. It could help Mr. Trump solidify the support of consistently conservative voters who may have reservations about his iconoclastic views. The trade-off, of course, is that it may help Hillary Clinton win socially moderate voters.But the opportunities for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton to make gains among these groups is fairly limited. A recent Pew Research survey found that white evangelical Christians supported Mr. Trump, 78-17, an even larger margin than Mr. Romney\u2019s lead at this time in 2012. Mrs. Clinton, though, is faring about as well among nonreligious voters as President Obama did four years earlier.And with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton at the top of the tickets, the opportunity for a vice-presidential nominee to move the needle might be even smaller than usual.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan Resists Strong Medicine for Stimulus", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s economy limped into the second half of the year, some analysts hoped that the central bank would take new, radical steps. It could move its benchmark interest rate further below zero. It could drop cash directly into the arms of Japanese consumers \u2014 so-called helicopter money.Instead, the Bank of Japan chose to keep things at a decidedly lower altitude, at least for now.The central bank said after its policy meeting on Friday that it would only slightly expand deflation-fighting stimulus, with changes that ranked at the cautious end of what analysts and investors had been expecting.But it also said it would carry out a \u201ccomprehensive assessment\u201d of its approach, a tacit admission that it had so far been unable to defeat the debilitating wage and price stagnation afflicting the Japanese economy.That review, which will be delivered at its next meeting, in September, is likely to stir speculation about whether the bank will try more drastic maneuvers to get the economy rolling.The central bank \u201cclearly disappointed the market today,\u201d said Michael Moen, a bond manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.\u201cReading between the lines, the bank appears to be acknowledging the limits of its policy tools, and the focus going forward will need to be on a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus,\u201d he said.There are few weapons in the normal central banking arsenal that the bank has not tried. Its benchmark interest rate is already set below zero, a move intended to try to force companies to invest money rather than hoard it. It is buying government bonds at a rate of 80 trillion yen, or $770 billion, a year to keep banks flush with cash to lend.Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power at the end of 2012 on a promise to rekindle economic growth, his government has often seemed to leave much of the work to the central bank. Japan has the heaviest public debt load in the world, and Mr. Abe\u2019s administration is officially committed to reducing the deficit, so letting the central bank spend instead of the government is less contentious.But as his country\u2019s economy has struggled to grow at a meaningful pace, Mr. Abe has become less restrained. In June he postponed an increase in the national sales tax, and his government is going to put in place spending measures that Mr. Abe said this week would probably be worth \u00a528 trillion. Details are expected to be announced next week.This more aggressive attitude, combined with a recent visit to Tokyo by Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, had convinced some analysts and investors that the Bank of Japan might start to simply print money to pay for the spending.Katsunori Kitakura, a strategist at Sumi Trust, a Japanese asset manager, said he believed the Bank of Japan was essentially buying time with its small move on Friday and would take more decisive action once it assessed the government\u2019s spending plans.\u201cOnly once the government has outlined its fiscal spending measures do we expect the central bank to make a move,\u201d Mr. Kitakura said.The yen briefly jumped almost 3 percent against the dollar after the central bank announced its policy on Friday and was up 1.6 percent late in the Asian trading day. A stronger yen is damaging to many Japanese companies, which would receive less in exchange for their exports. Traders had sold the currency in anticipation that more stimulus spending would weaken it.Yet on Friday, the bank left its policy rate unchanged at minus 0.1 percent and said it would continue buying the same amount of government debt. And the central bank came nowhere close to introducing helicopter money.Instead, it announced that it would increase the scale of a program to buy exchange-traded stock funds to \u00a56 trillion a year from \u00a53.3 trillion, and it doubled the size of a dollar-denominated lending program aimed at Japanese companies operating overseas to $12 billion.The bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said he thought there were still more conventional policy levers left to pull.\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re approaching the limits of negative interest rates or qualitative and quantitate easing,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said, referring in part to the bank\u2019s bond-buying program. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pursuing an aggressive monetary policy for three years, and it\u2019s a natural time for a review.\u201dMr. Kuroda added that the bank could push interest rates further into negative territory, noting that they are even further below zero in some countries in Europe.He said he was against directly financing government spending with newly created money, a practice that has led to out-of-control inflation in some countries. But he suggested he was open to more nuanced cooperation between the government and the central bank.\u201cThe right policy mix can produce synergies between fiscal and monetary policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what we\u2019re doing is totally different from simply monetizing government debt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mountain Resorts Moving Beyond Biking and Hiking", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byHeads UpMountain resorts generally build their reputations on snow sports. But for many mountain regions, summer is the busier season based on school vacations and the appeal of cool mountain weather when other places are sweltering.Supplementing hiking, gondola rides and mountain biking, Vail Resorts has opened two on-mountain summer activity campuses positioned to engage more fair-weather visitors in the outdoors and balance the seasonal economies of its mountain towns.\u201cOur winter business has a loyal, passionate, committed following, but it\u2019s a narrower following,\u201d said Robert Katz, chief executive of Vail Resorts. \u201cWe have an opportunity in summer to broaden that.\u201dTwo short hiking trails on relatively level ground emphasize learning through play via new \u201cstory stakes,\u201d interpretive signs that display fun facts about the strength of an eagle. According to one sign, for instance, eagles can carry food up to a third of their body weight, the equivalent of a human running up 10 flights of stairs carrying over 45 pounds of groceries.Other installations are intended to more actively engage visitors in understanding animal abilities. For example, a bighorn sheep exhibit includes a beam that visitors can walk on to experience the balance required of these mountainside dwellers.\u201cThese are structures that take the national park plaque to a new level,\u201d said Hans Vollrath, senior director of summer operations for Vail Resorts, who is in charge of the signed trails. The model for the signs, he said, is \u201can interactive museum or zoo or kids\u2019 museum where there are cool hands-on opportunities to learn about a subject.\u201dThe campus, on Adventure Peak, reached via the Heavenly Gondola, also includes a rock climbing wall, a children\u2019s ropes course and a zip line, which opened last summer.At both properties, all-access passes cost $89 daily, which includes most attractions, except four-wheel drive and canopy tours. Passes with a canopy tour cost $189.The summer investments are a result of the Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act, passed by Congress in 2011, which allowed the Forest Service to develop guidelines for ski areas to create year-round activities in national forests.According to the Department of Agriculture, 122 ski areas in the country operate on nearly 180,000 acres of Forest Service land. When the agency completed its guidelines in 2014, it estimated ski areas would draw 600,000 more visitors in summer, creating 600 jobs and $40 million in new spending in mountain communities as a result of expanded operations.Vail Resorts had its plans for Vail and Heavenly approved in 2014, and as the early adopter is being viewed as a test case by other ski resorts that may be considering summer programs on their mountains beyond hiking and mountain biking, which are standard summer activities.Nick Sargent, president of the nonprofit trade association SnowSports Industries America, predicted other resorts would follow the trend, noting that European mountain resorts have long offered year-round attractions.\u201cEveryone is trying to capitalize on the environment around the resort and use those assets 12 months of the year instead of three, four or five,\u201d Mr. Sargent said.Vail Resorts doesn\u2019t lack for summer visitors \u2014 \u201cJuly 4 is bigger than Christmas,\u201d said Mr. Katz, the chief executive \u2014 but the impetus is to get some of those summer visitors from base villages up onto the slopes without asking too much in terms of effort.Not everyone wants to climb a mountain, after all. The summer crowd is more about sightseeing.\u201cEpic Discovery is structured so there\u2019s some adventure but not too much that they wouldn\u2019t be interested in doing them,\u201d said Mr. Vollrath, who oversees Vail\u2019s new attractions. \u201cA zip line might be as adventurous as they\u2019d like to do, by and large.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Cases in Puerto Rico Are Skyrocketing", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 The Zika epidemic that has spread from Brazil to the rest of Latin America is now raging in Puerto Rico \u2014 and the island\u2019s response is in chaos.The war against the Aedes aegypti mosquito carrying the virus is sputtering out in failure. Infections are skyrocketing: Many residents fail to protect themselves against bites because they believe the threat is exaggerated.Federal and local health officials are feuding, and the governor\u2019s special adviser on Zika has quit in disgust.There are only about 5,500 confirmed infections on the island, including of 672 pregnant women. But experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they believe that is a radical undercount.Just four cases of infection were confirmed last week in Florida. But in Puerto Rico, officials believe thousands of residents \u2014 including up to 50 pregnant women \u2014 are infected each day.Most never get tested. Tests on donated blood, the most reliable barometer of the epidemic\u2019s spread, show that almost 2 percent of the donors were infected in the last 10 days.\u201cThat\u2019s a stunning number and reflects an explosion of cases,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., said in an interview.But a wave of microcephaly like Brazil\u2019s may yet be averted for two reasons. The pregnancy rate is falling so precipitously that this year, for the first time in history, Puerto Rico will have fewer births than deaths.Obstetricians, too, are quietly urging their infected pregnant patients to have regular ultrasounds and to consider abortion if brain damage turns up.And damage is turning up.In an office at the University of Puerto Rico Hospital, the gentle curves of the graph on Dr. Alberto De la Vega\u2019s computer screen trace a horror story. They are the head circumferences of dozens of fetuses whose mothers have been infected with the Zika virus for at least a month \u2014 and almost 75 percent are below the mean; normally, only half should be.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.Only one was clearly microcephalic, with the extreme shrinkage and brain damage that is the worst consequence of the infection, and that curve abruptly ends: The mother chose abortion.\u201cWhat worries me is not 100 kids with microcephaly,\u201d said Dr. De la Vega, chief of ultrasound diagnosis at the university. \u201cWhat worries me is a lot of kids affected in some way we cannot determine yet.\u201d\u201cWe may be facing a generation with learning and behavioral disabilities,\u201d he said.On the scan of a patient who had fled his office fighting back tears, he pointed out three large white spots \u2014 clumps of dead cells.\u201cHer fetus does not have microcephaly now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this is what leads to it.\u201dCases of Zika infection are expected to keep rising through October, and by year\u2019s end, a quarter of the island\u2019s population of 3.5 million will have been exposed, a \u201cvery dire\u201d situation, said Dr. Lyle R. Petersen, the C.D.C.\u2019s chief of vector-borne diseases and director of its fight against Zika.In a normal year, that would mean about 8,000 infected pregnancies, but the birthrate is dropping rapidly, said Jose A. Lopez, the health department\u2019s demographer. In past years, births normally outnumbered deaths by about 400 per month, but since January, that ratio has reversed itself, and there have been, on average, 135 more deaths than births.The drop is partly a result of rising divorce rates and couples emigrating as the economy deteriorates, but also of \u201cmothers delaying giving birth because of the campaign against Zika,\u201d Mr. Lopez said.Septic tanks and water meters would get screens, as would all schools attended by girls old enough to get pregnant. Teams would visit pregnant women\u2019s houses to spray larvicide and screen windows.Some of that was done, sometimes effectively. Humacao, a town on the southeast coast with pharmaceutical and electric plants that provide a steady tax base, moved faster than most municipalities, said Jos\u00e9 L. B\u00e1ez, its chief of emergency management.Workers collected 200,000 tires, packing them into two abandoned factories. At the local historic cemetery, teams filled empty urns with sand. Spray trucks worked steadily.But it was never enough. Discarded tires kept popping up on roadsides. Mosquitoes bred in garbage cans. Teams could not legally enter abandoned properties or even fill depressions in privately owned graves. The town\u2019s permethrin insecticides turned out to be ineffective, and daily rains washed away previous efforts.It was a gamble. Naled failed to stop a 1987 dengue outbreak here \u201cand there is no guarantee it will work this time,\u201d Dr. Petersen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only thing that will alter the course of this epidemic.\u201dModern spray nozzles and GPS-guided planes were more accurate, he argued, and superfine mists with small amounts of naled would drift into houses where mosquitoes hid in closets. Counties in Florida and Louisiana had recently knocked down populations of the yellow-fever mosquito by up to 99 percent with naled, he and others noted.Medical groups joined the opposition, including the largest, the Puerto Rican College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Cancel, a surgeon famous for performing the island\u2019s first heart transplant, denounced the plan, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in conspiracy theories, but I think this is an experiment with the C.D.C. using Puerto Rico as a laboratory.\u201dThat same week, Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n, a former health secretary advising Governor Padilla on the epidemic, gave up his post, saying the whole atmosphere had become too vicious. Since January, he had held town meetings explaining the mosquito control plans to skeptical audiences. \u201cI felt like a scratched record saying the same things over and over,\u201d he said. When he endorsed aerial spraying, he was falsely accused of plotting to make millions by basing planes at a remote airport he was accused of owning. (It is owned by someone with a similar name.)He ultimately decided the spraying would be a public relations disaster. \u201cAny microcephaly cases that occur now will be blamed on the spray, not the virus,\u201d he said.He resigned and left for a vacation in Spain. \u201cIn October,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll write something saying, \u2018I told you.\u2019 \u201dAlba Sanchez, 25, and nearing the end of her fourth pregnancy, attended a hospital Zika-prevention workshop wearing the skimpiest of maternity dresses.

And I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had Zika.\u201dAsked how she protected herself, she mimed slaps to her bare arms and legs. \u201cI smack every one I see.\u201dHer husband, Jandy Vasquez, 22, a mountainous man towering over her, rolled his eyes and smiled ruefully. \u201cI\u2019d spray a whole can on her every day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she does what she wants.\u201dIndeed, the fight against birth defects is taking place largely in face-to-face meetings between doctors and patients like Ms. Sanchez.Some religious women will say, \u201c\u2018But this is God\u2019s gift,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Zorrilla said. \u201cBut at the same time, they\u2019re afraid to have a baby they know will need assistance 24/7 for life.\u201dHow many women are terminating pregnancies is unknown. Although the health department tabulates legal abortions, current figures are unavailable, a department spokeswoman said.\u201cAnecdotally, they\u2019re on the increase,\u201d Dr. Rull\u00e1n said. \u201cOne doctor told me he did 15 in a period where he normally would have done one or two.\u201dMaking that choice is excruciating.

On sonograms, Danelle, 36, can see a face, even hair: To her, the outlines resemble a small, sleeping child, nestled against the placenta as if it were a pillow.Danger signs have appeared since Danelle was infected with the virus in late April. The fetus\u2019s growth abruptly slowed and is now well below normal. An enlarged brain artery indicates that too little nutrition is crossing the placenta.Because she herself is a doctor, Danelle knows what that means: Severe mental deficits are possible. Her husband, a train dispatcher who held her hand as she spoke, \u201cis the more positive one of us \u2014 and he\u2019s also in denial,\u201d she said.\u201cBut I\u2019m the G.I. one,\u201d she added, using a local term for hewing strictly to the book.She was having ultrasounds every 14 days and must decide very soon whether to abort.\u201cThe window is closing,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep at night. I don\u2019t want to do this, but I don\u2019t want her to come into this world and then suffer.\u201cAnd when I\u2019m not here, who\u2019s going to take care of her?\u201dOmaya Sosa Pascual contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Roar Back With Gain of 287,000 in June, Easing Worry", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byQuashing worries that job growth is flagging, the government on Friday reported that employers increased payrolls by 287,000 in June, an arresting surge that could reframe the economic debate just weeks before Republicans and Democrats gather for their conventions.The official unemployment rate did rise to 4.9 percent, from 4.7 percent, but that was largely because more Americans rejoined the work force. And average hourly earnings ticked up again, continuing a pattern of rising wages that brought the yearly gain to 2.6 percent.\u201cWow, this one takes my breath away,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago.But the latest Labor Department report, Ms. Swonk said, gives the Fed \u201ca cushion\u201d to consider a bump in rates later this year.Financial markets rallied on the announcement, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gaining 1.5 percent to end the day just short of the record close it recorded last year.At the moment, though, the Democrats are best poised to take advantage of the positive employment news.Concerns persist about the vitality of the economic recovery, which reached the seven-year point this month. And perhaps nothing highlights the reality that every monthly jobs report provides only a fleeting and incomplete picture more than the giddy swing between May\u2019s revised gain of 11,000 and June\u2019s 287,000. (A strike by more than 35,000 Verizon workers had artificially held down May\u2019s totals.)Still, Friday\u2019s report, showing the largest single monthly job expansion since October 2015, helped whisk away some of the cloudiest forecasts. The three-month average of monthly gains rose to 147,000, after taking into account the Labor Department\u2019s revised estimates that showed 6,000 fewer jobs were created in April and May than previously reported. June\u2019s figures will be subject to two more revisions.\u201cThis report should ease any fears that a persistent slowdown or recession is coming soon in the U.S.,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief economist at Point72 Asset Management. \u201cThe service sector is where the real strength is, with 256,000 hires. But the gains were widespread across sectors.\u201dHillary Clinton, the Democratic standard-bearer, has emphasized the steady economic improvements during President Obama\u2019s two terms and the steep decline in the jobless rate from the recession\u2019s peak of 10 percent.There are other weak spots. Republicans can point out that real median household income is lower than it was a decade ago. And a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers, as well as those who would prefer to work full time instead of part time, is still nearly twice the official jobless rate, despite ticking down to 9.6 percent in June.The proportion of people employed or actively looking for work has also been dragging along at low levels, suggesting that more people would return to the work force if desirable jobs were available.Tom Perez, the labor secretary, conceded there was \u201cstill a lot of work to do.\u201dUnemployment for African-Americans, for example, whose jobless rate is typically about twice that of white Americans, rose last month to 8.6 percent from 8.2 percent.But Mr. Perez said that the broad-based job growth across sectors showed that the economy was resilient.Though the jobless rate, which is based on a separate survey of households, rose in June, it \u201cwent up for a good reason,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Perez said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve got more people looking for work and re-entering the work force.\u201dThe tighter labor market is nudging up wages. David Lukes, chief executive of Equity One, a commercial real estate investment company, is one of several employers who said they had increased salaries and benefits to retain current staff members and attract new ones.\u201cI\u2019ve had the troubling experience of losing good employees,\u201d said Mr. Lukes, who has offered perks like flexible hours and stock incentives to keep the competition at bay. \u201cReward programs are much more important than they were three, four and five years ago.\u201dHe said that for the kind of workers he was looking for \u2014 administrators, sales representatives, accountants, paralegals, construction managers \u2014 the labor pool is not that deep.Given that the jobless rate has consistently been at 5 percent or lower since last fall, several economists argue it is time to adjust the benchmarks for what is labeled a strong or weak report.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that job growth is significantly slower today than it was one or two years ago,\u201d when the average monthly gain routinely topped 200,000, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research said. \u201cBut that is to be expected at this point in the economic cycle.\u201dSkilled workers in particular have more employment options.\u201cI travel all over the country and everywhere I go, I sit down with C.E.O.s and ask them what their No. 1 problem is,\u201d Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, which provides insurance and financial services for credit unions nationwide, said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Just finding qualified people, from a teller to a mortgage home officer.\u2019\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the economic recovery began.

{"Headline": "Speakers at Donald Trump\u2019s Convention: Tim Tebow, Peter Thiel, but No Sarah Palin?", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, has been promising a different kind of Republican National Convention, and plans obtained by The New York Times show that he is eager to put his showbiz stamp on the party\u2019s gathering, even as he struggles to attract A-list talent.The roster of speakers obtained by The Times, and confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of the convention planning, reveals a lineup lacking many of the party\u2019s rising stars. Instead, it features some of Mr. Trump\u2019s eclectic collection of friends, celebrities and relatives, from his Slovenian supermodel wife, Melania, to the professional golfer Natalie Gulbis.The parade of people seems to have been selected to broaden Mr. Trump\u2019s demographic reach.There are several notable women speaking. They include Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general, who tangled on television with the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper after the Orlando, Fla., nightclub massacre; Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a space shuttle mission; Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma; Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa; and Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania.There are a few African-Americans, like Jamiel Shaw Sr., who became an outspoken advocate for tougher immigration laws after his son was killed in 2008 by an undocumented immigrant; and Darryl Glenn, who is running for the Senate in Colorado.From sports there is Mr. Tebow, the former quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner who is known for his conservative views; Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts organization; and Ms. Gulbis.Peter Thiel, a billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur, will represent the business community, along with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., who helped start a pro-Trump \u201csuper PAC.\u201d In what could be an awkward juxtaposition, Mr. Thiel is openly gay and the convention is set to adopt a platform that opposed gay and transgender rights.The list of politicians scheduled to appear include people who have been out of office for some time, like Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and newcomers like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas.There are plans to emphasize different themes each night of the convention. Mr. Trump wants to touch on a few of his favorite hot-button issues, like the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, former President Clinton\u2019s infidelities and border security. All four of Mr. Trump\u2019s adult children are scheduled to speak.There also will be governors like Rick Scott of Florida and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and members of Congress like Representatives Sean P. Duffy of Wisconsin and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The National Rifle Association will be represented by Chris Cox, executive director of the group\u2019s political arm. Antonio Sabato Jr. is one Hollywood star who has been confirmed by the Trump campaign.Mr. Trump is still inviting people, his aides have said. And the people who spoke about his list of speakers cautioned that it could still grow.But what is striking, as much as who is on the list, is who is not. Several figures Mr. Trump had said he would invite to speak, like the boxing promoter Don King and Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, were not included. Neither was Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, a hugely popular figure in the key state of New Hampshire.The list, which is subject to change, as obtained by The New York Times:Even as they finalized the list this week, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign aides and party officials were also working behind the scenes to stave off any challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination on the convention floor next week.Mr. Priebus was blunt about the need for party leaders to support Mr. Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton \u2014 even if the reasoning he offered appeared to be less than a full-throated endorsement.\u201cIf we don\u2019t stick together as a party and stop her, then the only alternative is to get comfortable with the phrase President Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Priebus said in remarks to party leaders on Wednesday.An extended and confrontational debate could reopen doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and cast a shadow over what is supposed to be a triumphant moment of party unity.The prospect of multiple delegate votes with unknown outcomes and unforeseeable consequences is something Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Mr. Priebus are intent on preventing. What is ordinarily a carefully choreographed event \u2014 planned to conform neatly to the prime-time schedules of the television networks \u2014 could slip into chaos.Still, the chance that Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents could muster enough support to deny him the nomination is remote. The biggest hazard that Mr. Trump and the leaders of the Republican National Committee are trying to contain is how messy the process could become \u2014 and how much damage Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign could sustain.Starting on Thursday morning, delegates will begin to debate a series of proposals to change the party\u2019s rules. They could include a provision that would allow delegates to vote their consciences in selecting the Republican presidential nominee, instead of voting in accordance with the outcomes of the primaries and caucuses in their states, as most state party rules require.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Heroic Political Fantasies", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byEssayA few years ago, Peter Thiel gave a lecture series at Stanford that was later collected, lightly edited and published as a book titled \u201cZero to One: Notes on Start-ups, or How to Build the Future.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, an early beneficiary of Thiel\u2019s largess as a venture capitalist, contributed an endorsement. \u201cThis book,\u201d his blurb on the flap reads, \u201cdelivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world.\u201dThe volume does nothing of the sort, but as a self-help book, it\u2019s not bad. Think of it as the equivalent of Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s \u201cLean In\u201d but for the resentful young man. And, though largely superfluous and forgettable, it is in some ways the most honest book a Silicon Valley entrepreneur has yet produced. It contains about a thick pamphlet\u2019s worth of tough-love pointers about how the most successful people think long-range, form definite plans, pursue determinate goals. Its exhortations are no more fatuous, if perhaps less specific, than those of Dale Carnegie: \u201cA start-up is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.\u201dIn Thiel\u2019s account, \u201ctechnology\u201d is what we call an act of moving from zero to one, the creation of new value in a vacuum. \u201cGlobalization,\u201d on the other hand, is simply the monocultural proliferation of what we already have. Real entrepreneurs, he writes, refuse to build an \u201cundifferentiated commodity business\u201d \u2014 that is, they refuse to compete in a market where they will have to compete on price. The reasoning he offers is that you can\u2019t really make any profit that way, as margins will be competed down to zero and the only people who gain are the financiers who can consolidate and take advantage of economies of scale. But this is merely economic cover for his real point, which is that the businesses of clerks and shopkeepers just aren\u2019t important.Near the beginning of the book, he tells a weird story about lunch in 2001. It was the early days of PayPal, and he and his (almost exclusively foreign-born) colleagues would go out on Castro Street, the main drag of Silicon Valley\u2019s Mountain View:PayPal was at that time the only email-based payments company in the world. We employed fewer people than the restaurants on Castro Street did, but our business was much more valuable than all of those restaurants combined. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is a really hard way to make money. If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors \u2014 maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great-grandmother\u2019s recipe \u2014 your business is unlikely to survive.On its face, Thiel\u2019s example is preposterous. If you\u2019re in the business of running an Indian restaurant, the superiority of your naan is not a trivial differentiating factor; it\u2019s a signal one. But Thiel\u2019s real attitude is that running an Indian restaurant, even a profitable one, simply isn\u2019t worth doing. It\u2019s mere \u201cglobalization,\u201d the reproduction of what someone far away has decided is worthwhile.For all of the expectation, the speech was muted and, for people with any familiarity with Thiel\u2019s beliefs, predictable. The oil shocks of the early 1970s, and the ineptitude of the political class to deal with that decade\u2019s succession of economic crises, left America stagnant. Decades of public support for scientific research led to such triumphs as the Apollo space program; since then, he likes to say, \u201cWe wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters.\u201d Beneath all of this has always been a kind of \u201cwar is the health of the state\u201d mentality: It was only the climate of the Cold War that allowed for the efficient allocation of public resources to ambitious, organized, long-term projects.In his convention address, in front of an audience well primed for a story that connected our economic stagnation to both national-security cowardice and political correctness, he made the point explicitly. Ours was an era in which, he said, our fighter jets can\u2019t even fly in the rain. The relevant nostalgia wasn\u2019t even for Apollo; it was for the Manhattan Project. \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d he said, \u201cthe great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom.\u201d He went on: \u201cThis is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?\u201dThe line prompted cheers from the convention floor and frustration among the North Carolina delegates. But the target of his censure wasn\u2019t totally clear. The line could plausibly have been interpreted as \u201cHey, trans people, who cares where you go to the bathroom? Just suck it up and use the one you\u2019re supposed to\u201d \u2014 or as \u201cHey, Republicans, who cares where these trans people go to the bathroom? Just leave them alone.\u201d His point is that the very conversation itself is a distraction, because it\u2019s not about anything important. It\u2019s a vanity exercise, like trying to run an Indian restaurant. This was his version of Trumpian straight-talk. Let\u2019s all stop being so sensitive and just get on with what matters \u2014 fixing things, making them great.It\u2019s been pointed out, by observers inside and outside Silicon Valley alike, that Thiel\u2019s views aren\u2019t easy to reconcile with those of Trump. This is especially true for, say, trade; Thiel\u2019s free-market libertarianism doesn\u2019t square with the protectionist policy at the center of Trump\u2019s campaign. This assumes, however, that one is comparing two consistent positions, and to grant either the views of Trump or the views of Thiel much in way of coherence is an act of charity. This is obvious in the case of Trump, who has long benefited from globalization. For Thiel, yes, in theory he ought to support the free movement of capital, but in practice he uses \u201cglobalization\u201d as more of a metaphor than a specific set of policies. He sees something he calls \u201ctechnology\u201d and something he calls \u201cglobalization\u201d as opposing forces.Despite Thiel\u2019s advice to young entrepreneurs \u2014 don\u2019t act in accord with fashion, don\u2019t try to be liked \u2014 it seems he himself is of two minds. Professionally, he likes nothing better than to praise active government stewardship. Personally, he, like Trump, is far from immune to that mere desire to be liked. When the camera pulled back from his face, his right hand, clutched as if holding a \u201cJeopardy\u201d buzzer, trembled with an all-too-human terror.Silicon Valley, too, is of two minds. There are those who recognize that their uniquely innovative culture is a precipitate of a lot of expensive long-term institutional investment on the part of governments, universities and corporations, and that to function in a democracy you need to worry about stuff you personally don\u2019t think is important. And there are those who believe only in charisma and prowess, the blinding insight and iron will that get you from zero to one. To what extent, commentators have wondered, can Peter Thiel\u2019s politics be taken as representative of Silicon Valley? There\u2019s no answer, but it\u2019s exactly the right question.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bank Too Big to Jail", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byFair GameHave you ever wondered why the crippling 2008 financial crisis generated almost no criminal prosecutions of large banks and their top executives?HSBC and its American subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, agreed to pay almost $2 billion under the settlement, striking a deferred prosecution arrangement that remains in place. Under such deals, the government agrees to delay or forgo prosecution of a company if it promises to change its behavior.In spite of the settlement\u2019s size, it did not represent a body blow to the bank. Announced in late 2012, the HSBC agreement was almost a footnote to the earlier fallout from the mortgage crisis. Still, the facts outlined by prosecutors were damning enough to raise questions about why the bank had not been subject to harsher treatment, fueling the view that large financial institutions are not only too big to be allowed to fail but also are too significant to be prosecuted criminally.The report on HSBC was not adopted by the full House committee, but neither did it generate a dissent from others on the committee. It was released, the staff said, \u201cto shed light on whether D.O.J. is making prosecutorial decisions based on the size of financial institutions and D.O.J.\u2019s belief that such prosecutions could negatively impact the economy.\u201dThere doesn\u2019t seem to be much doubt about that. Indeed, the report concluded that the Justice Department\u2019s leadership overruled an internal recommendation to prosecute HSBC, citing concerns \u201cthat prosecuting the bank \u2018could result in a global financial disaster.\u2019\u201dThis will surprise few Americans who learned during the financial crisis that banks and their officials are rarely held to account.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said it was \u201ccommitted to aggressively investigating allegations of wrongdoing at financial institutions, and, along with our law enforcement partners, holding individuals and corporations responsible for their conduct.\u201d Since 2014, he said, It has prosecuted numerous individuals for corporate misconduct, including top executives.Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, did not return a phone call seeking comment about the report.Quoting from internal Treasury records, the report said that once the Justice Department decided not to prosecute HSBC, its officials began softening the deal offered to the bank. One change involved releasing the bank\u2019s employees, officers and directors from potential prosecution.The original agreement provided no protection from prosecution for employees who \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d processed financial transactions with countries under American sanctions, the report said.But the final deferred prosecution agreement gave a conditional release from liability for transactions disclosed to investigators during the period covered by the settlement.Citing internal documents that the United States Treasury took three years to produce, the report looks at the Department of Justice\u2019s 2012 settlement with HSBC.Another modification involved penalties to be exacted from executives if HSBC failed to live up to compliance requirements.While initial terms called for voiding the entire year\u2019s bonus compensation at the bank if it did not meet compliance hurdles, the final deferred prosecution agreement said only that a failure could potentially void the bonuses. This revision, the report said, \u201capparently leaves open the possibility for executives to get their bonuses, despite failing to meet compliance standards.\u201dAnother disturbing element turned up by the House committee: The settlement terms were given to HSBC before officials in the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or O.F.A.C., had assessed the full extent of the bank\u2019s sanctions violations.The Justice Department called for HSBC to pay $375 million to settle the sanctions violations. But officials in charge of analyzing those violations were still awaiting additional information from the bank when this figure was submitted. Therefore, they could not be sure the amount was adequate.\u201cNo matter that our sanctions numbers might come in higher than that,\u201d an official at the Treasury office wrote in an email to colleagues. \u201cWe weren\u2019t consulted. We were told.\u201dAs a result, the report said, officials of the Office of Foreign Assets Control \u201cdecided to hastily resolve internal concerns about the extent of HSBC\u2019s sanctions violations and \u2018frame\u2019 O.F.A.C.\u2019s final settlement number to mirror the $375 million \u2018deemed settled\u2019 value proposed\u201d by the Justice Department.\u201cIt would seem that in making the decision with respect to HSBC, Holder gave more attention to the concerns expressed by the F.S.A. than he did with respect to our own agencies,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said in an interview. \u201cAnd think about it: Congress spent three years trying to uncover this information that F.S.A. was getting at the time the events were unfolding.\u201dThat it took the House committee so long to receive the information from the Treasury Department once again raises questions about transparency in government, something the Obama administration has called a top priority.\u201cTreasury improperly impeded the committee\u2019s investigation\u201d for nearly three years before producing certain subpoenaed records, the report said. The department\u2019s production of records \u201cis missing dozens, if not hundreds, of pages,\u201d the report said.Joshua Drobnyk, a Treasury spokesman, disputed this characterization, saying the department had cooperated extensively with Congress. \u201cTreasury made hundreds of pages of documents available to the committee more than two years ago, in April 2014, and committee staff reviewed the materials five separate times,\u201d Mr. Drobnyk said in a statement.But Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee, doesn\u2019t buy it. \u201cIf an incomplete response to the committee after three years and the threat of deposition subpoenas isn\u2019t stonewalling, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAfter these revelations, if the Obama administration refuses to be transparent, produce the documents that it is withholding and address the urgent questions that this report has raised, the American people need to ask why.\u201dThe report should be viewed as \u201cevidence of an abuse of the regulatory system,\u201d Mr. Kane added. \u201cAnd unless proven otherwise, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

This verdant Scandinavian country, population five million, voted twice to stay outside the European Union in heated referendums that also turned on issues of sovereignty.Britain has other options, but they are hardly more palatable. It could negotiate trade deals with 27 remaining member nations, as Switzerland did. But that would be a lengthy mess. Or it could follow Canada\u2019s approach, striking deals for trading goods but limiting services, which could hit Britain\u2019s vaunted financial industry.Or the European Union might decline to strike any deal, creating uncertainty in Britain and around the world. In a meeting this week between the United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, Mr. Lew urged that both sides demonstrate \u201cflexibility\u201d in their discussions. \u201cA highly integrated relationship between the E.U. and the U.K. is in the best interests of Europe, the United States and global economic growth, stability and security,\u201d he said.The easiest thing, analysts say, is to just join the European Economic Area like Norway.That arrangement gives Norway sovereignty over two crucial industries that were the focus of Brexit campaigners. The country is free to pursue protectionist policies for its farmers and fishermen, for instance by slapping import tariffs of more than 270 percent on cheese from Europe.But it would not let Britain coddle one of its biggest industries \u2014 finance.As a European Union member, Britain has been able to foil attempts by France and Germany to curb or siphon business by vetoing certain measures, like a proposal to impose a single tax on the region\u2019s financial sector. London also won a victory at the European general court against a European Central Bank rule that would have moved trading of securities priced in euros to countries that use the currency. It would have meant a huge loss of business for the banks that have turned the City, the center of finance in London, into Europe\u2019s financial capital.Outside of the European Union, Britain would be left to do what Norway does: lobby hard behind the scenes and hope that its voice is heard in Brussels.\u201cIt goes without saying that exerting influence in a cooperation such as the E.U., where we are not a member, is challenging,\u201d said Elsbeth Sande Tronstad, Norway\u2019s deputy minister of European Economic Area and European Union affairs.Britain, as Europe\u2019s second-largest economy and a political powerhouse, would probably still have much more sway than tiny Norway. But the risks are there.From his perch in Hokksund, a bucolic industrial town nestled among emerald forests and dark fjords west of Oslo, Mr. Braathen has seen the consequences. Founded by his grandfather in 1932, his company benefited greatly from being able to sell products throughout Europe with little interference.Mr. Braathen reckoned he would have to invest millions in a new plant to meet the standards. If he did not, he would be barred from selling his products even in Norway, because European Union rules apply to his own country even though it is not a member.\u201cBut that was pure luck,\u201d said Mr. Braathen, who still had to refurbish many of his machines to meet other aspects of the directive. \u201cAnd if it hadn\u2019t happened, there was nothing we could have done,\u201d he said.Mr. Braathen swept his eyes over a lane of fir trees lining the entry to the factory. What had happened in his small world now seemed likely to reverberate on a larger scale in Britain \u2014 and with more dire consequences.\u201cI\u2019m sure Britain will have more weight in Brussels than Norway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any way you cut it, they will have a lot less voice on the issues that affect them than they do now.\u201d\u201cThey voted to take their country back,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you can\u2019t take something back without giving something up.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Britain. It is Europe\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany; it is not the largest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Worry if Hillary Clinton Wins: What to Do With Bill", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBut the steps that Clinton aides are planning to shape his new life do little to address a potentially thornier problem: Historically, when Mr. Clinton does not have a job to do, he gets into trouble.\u201cHe loves getting involved in things \u2014 no one loves policy and politics more than Bill Clinton,\u201d said Mickey Kantor, a longtime friend and secretary of commerce under Mr. Clinton. \u201cHe loves, and needs, to have a purpose.\u201dHow we analyzed in real time the second night of the Democratic National Convention, featuring Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright and Lena Dunham.Putting Mr. Clinton to good use, while containing his less helpful impulses, would be a major test for Mrs. Clinton as president, given the spotlight and pressure they would be under and her limited ability in the past to rein in his excesses. Mrs. Clinton sees him as her most trusted confidant and sounding board on national security and the economy, advisers say; one recalled a recent golf outing where Mr. Clinton received several phone calls and emails from Mrs. Clinton before reaching the 14th hole.Yet Mrs. Clinton is still not sure if she would give a formal position to Mr. Clinton or rely on him to help behind the scenes and keep a low profile, aides say. She clearly wants him busy: Appearing on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton said that it would be \u201can all-hands-on-deck time\u201d if she won the presidency and that she would rely on Mr. Clinton \u2014 as well as President Obama \u2014 and \u201cput \u2019em all to work.\u201dAt the same time, she emphasized that she and Mr. Clinton would not be co-presidents, leaving open the question of how he would spend his days when he is so close to the levers of power that he knows well.Given his insights and experience, Mr. Clinton could be more capable than anyone else in ensuring the success of her presidency \u2014 or he could cast a long shadow over her.\u201cTheir relationship as a current president and a former president would be a very, very sensitive issue early on, and they\u2019d need to carefully work out the rules of the road for the sake of both of them,\u201d said David Gergen, who was a senior adviser to several presidents, including Mr. Clinton.\u201cThere\u2019s some revisionist history underway about his presidency that clearly bothers him, for instance, and he may want to rewrite the story of his presidency partly by influencing Hillary\u2019s policies as president,\u201d Mr. Gergen added. \u201cThey both have to be very careful with that.\u201dAides and allies of the Clintons were emphatic that his sole focus would be on helping his wife and doing what she asked. They played down any controversies over the last several years, pointing out that Mr. Clinton had focused on the foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative during that time. But at the same time they acknowledged that Mr. Clinton would not be content to sit idly by or speak only when spoken to.At 69, even as age and health have somewhat slowed him, Mr. Clinton still has a strong desire to be in the center of the action, friends say, and his intellectual interests and curiosity remain vast.But if the Clintons return to the White House, his life will inevitably become more circumscribed, and he will be expected to show the self-discipline that most first spouses have demonstrated.\u201cHe\u2019ll do anything she wants and nothing more,\u201d said Erskine Bowles, Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff from 1997 to 1998. \u201cThat will be hard for him at times, but that\u2019s the reality of the situation if she is going to succeed on her own.\u201dTina Flournoy, who is Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, noted that Mr. Clinton had been a prodigious campaigner and fund-raiser throughout the campaign at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s request \u2014 a role that political analysts have described as a net asset for her candidacy.\u201cIf Secretary Clinton is elected, he will continue to support her whenever and wherever he\u2019s asked,\u201d Ms. Flournoy said.Mr. Clinton is not likely to shoulder many of the traditional duties of first ladies, advisers say, like selecting White House china and floral arrangements and presiding as the host in the national home and arranging state dinners. Some of that is expected to fall to the Clintons\u2019 daughter, Chelsea.Mr. Clinton also has not given thought to using the role of first gentleman to redefine ideas about American masculinity and patriarchy, nor has he decided if he will draw on his personal interests \u2014 like veganism \u2014 for a healthy-eating initiative the way Michelle Obama did, his advisers say.Friends of Mr. Clinton say the smartest way to use him would involve a major but focused appointment, like leading a task force to fight climate change, global poverty or the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic, which would be natural outgrowths of his foundation work. Others, including some who worked in Mr. Clinton\u2019s administration, like the idea of him as Middle East peace envoy, given his herculean efforts in the region during his presidency, or as a kind of jobs mastermind focused on rebuilding the most struggling regions of America.Milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal, state and local government.\u201cIn some ways the Middle East is the most natural job for him, because he\u2019s so popular with all sides and he spent so much time on peacemaking,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, a United States ambassador to Israel during the Clinton administration and a longtime negotiator in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.Aides to Mr. Clinton said Middle East peace envoy was not a job they had heard him express interest in. They also noted that for every possible job, there is a potential downside \u2014 that he would create tensions with his wife\u2019s secretary of state, Treasury secretary or other cabinet officer; that he might upstage Mrs. Clinton or box her in because she might have difficulty overruling him; or that he would become a political target of Republicans once again.Mrs. Clinton has some familiarity with the issue. In 1994, she led the White House\u2019s health care effort, an endeavor that put her in conflict with congressional Republicans and competition with Vice President Al Gore. Advisers say she is mindful of that experience and wary of putting Mr. Clinton in the cross hairs with a high-profile policy role.But the Clintons would not simply be changing roles if she became president and he the supportive spouse. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was new to Washington when she became first lady, Mr. Clinton brings a wealth of political relationships, untold diplomatic experience and vast firsthand knowledge about issues and crises that presidents face. He could easily be deployed to make discreet phone calls to governors, members of Congress and business leaders, or to play a role in negotiations between foreign leaders or in global hot spots.Advisers to Mrs. Clinton, asked about specific roles that Mr. Clinton might play, said she had not given the matter much thought.\u201cShe would certainly seek his advice and counsel,\u201d said Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBeyond that, it being July, it would be getting ahead of oneself to talk about any sort of formalized role for anyone in an administration.\u201dMr. Clinton would not necessarily be at the White House full time, advisers say. The couple would most likely keep their home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Mr. Clinton might continue doing some work in Manhattan with his foundation or at the offices he has kept in his post-presidency.When in Washington, he would be less likely to be a social planner for his wife than to be her protector within the White House. Some friends of the Clintons said they could see him taking a page from Nancy Reagan, who could be aggressive in ensuring that administration staff members were serving the interests of President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Clinton might know better than most if Mrs. Clinton was being overburdened or receiving bad advice.\u201cHe\u2019ll be her advocate, he\u2019ll be her lawyer, and if he thinks the staff isn\u2019t protecting her, they\u2019d have private conversations about it,\u201d Mr. Kantor said. He said, however, that he did not think Mr. Clinton would go as far as Mrs. Reagan, who orchestrated the ouster of Donald T. Regan as White House chief of staff.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Mr. Kantor said, \u201cin a negative way.\u201dAdvisers to the Clintons say they have no models for their lives in the White House if Mrs. Clinton wins; Mr. Clinton would be in a league of his own as a former president as well as the first male spouse.His focus at this point, advisers say, is simply to help Mrs. Clinton get elected.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Mr. Gergen said. \u201cShe would be the first president in history who is protecting the legacy of two presidents. And I think her presidency would bring him a certain amount of redemption \u2014 that the country did see the Clinton years as good enough that they wanted to return this couple to the White House.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Race Strongly Influences Mortgage Lending in St. Louis, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byIn the two years since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., the nation has come to learn much about the stark socioeconomic differences between black and white neighborhoods in the St. Louis area.Now, a new study says that mortgage lending appears to have played an important part in reinforcing segregation there.Federal data has long shown that the black neighborhoods of St. Louis have been almost devoid of mortgage lending in recent years. A major reason for the dearth of lending is that the incomes of many black residents may be too low to afford a house or qualify for a loan.Specifically, the report indicated that banks made fewer loans to middle- and lower-income borrowers in minority neighborhoods than to borrowers with similar incomes in white neighborhoods.This finding, as well as other data in the report, supports the view that banks avoid depressed minority neighborhoods over time, which in turn makes it harder for residents of these communities to take out loans that could be used to buy and improve properties. It is well documented that a steady rise in homeownership can help bolster the economy of lower-income neighborhoods.\u201cWe need a full and genuine commitment from financial institutions to responsibly serve all communities,\u201d John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in an email. \u201cWe need to make sure that your skin color or your ZIP code doesn\u2019t determine whether or not you have a fair shot to prosper.\u201dThe coalition\u2019s report also looked at trends in mortgage lending and race in Milwaukee and Minneapolis, which also have high levels of racial segregation. In each city, the coalition determined that income was often the most powerful determinant of who got a mortgage. But the researchers also tried to identify whether whites in the same income bracket as minorities got more loans.They first looked at how many mortgages were made to low- and moderate-income borrowers of all races. In St. Louis, these borrowers accounted for 32 percent of mortgages made in 2013. The researchers then looked at the racial makeup of the neighborhoods in which this particular set of loans were made, using United States census data and mortgage data that banks report to a federal financial regulator.They found that most of these loans went to neighborhoods in St. Louis where whites made up most of the population. Nearly half went to census areas where minorities made up less than 10 percent of the population, and another fourth went to areas where minorities made up 10 to 19 percent of the population. Only 3 percent of loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers were made in St. Louis neighborhoods where minorities made up 80 to 100 percent of the population.\u201cIn the city at large, we found that the lack of lending is not fully explained by income \u2014 race is a critical factor,\u201d Bruce Mitchell, a researcher at the coalition, said in an email. \u201cCredit is flowing more to neighborhoods with higher percentages of white residents than it is to majority African-American neighborhoods of the same income profile.\u201dThe disparity can be clearly seen in individual St. Louis census tracts.In one tract, where 23 percent of the population was African-American, and where residents had a moderate income, six mortgages were made per 100 homes in 2012 to the end of 2014.That number of loans was higher than in a nearby middle-income tract where African-Americans made up 58 percent of the population. In this area, 2.5 loans were made per 100 homes in the same period. (The frequency of lending is measured per 100 homes to account for the fact that tracts don\u2019t contain the same number of homes.)The low number of mortgages made in minority areas can be explained in part by the fact that fewer people in these areas applied for a mortgage. The lower number of applications may to a large extent be explained by lower incomes and the belief of some prospective borrowers that it is too difficult to qualify for a mortgage.That said, applicants for mortgages in minority neighborhoods were denied a loan at significantly higher rates than in mostly white neighborhoods. In areas where minorities made up between 10 and 19 percent of the population, 64 percent of mortgage applications by low- and moderate-income applicants were approved. In St. Louis areas where minorities made up 50 to 79 percent of the population, only half the mortgage applications in this income bracket were approved, according to the coalition\u2019s analysis.The lower approval rate in minority neighborhoods in St. Louis may partly be a result of factors like weaker credit scores and lower or more intermittent incomes. But the lower rate might also reflect the relatively low number of banks in some of these minority neighborhoods.\u201cSome areas of North City and East St. Louis may constitute \u2018banking deserts,\u2019 as they are isolated from access to conventional financial services,\u201d the coalition\u2019s report said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton? Keep an Eye on Obama\u2019s Approval Rating", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe Democratic convention was almost perfectly orchestrated to unify the party, build Hillary Clinton\u2019s image, diminish Donald Trump and perhaps even lift the mood of the country.But one of the convention\u2019s most striking elements was its full-throated embrace of an optimistic message about the future of the country when anger and dissatisfaction have dominated the year\u2019s politics. If the convention had any weakness, it\u2019s that it spent less time speaking to those concerns than soaring above them.Whether this positive message resonates \u2014 and whether Mrs. Clinton gets a big bounce in the polls and ultimately wins \u2014 might just turn on whether the country is as angry and dissatisfied as the conventional wisdom implies.It\u2019s a real question for the data as well. Think of it like this: Which is a better indicator of the public\u2019s mood and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chances, the president\u2019s approval rating or the number of Americans who think the country is on the \u201cright track\u201d?The right-track/wrong-track numbers, on the other hand, are terrible. A recent Gallup poll showed that just 17 percent were satisfied with the country \u2014 about as low as it has ever been.Historically, the president\u2019s approval rating is the more important piece of data. It\u2019s a very good predictor of the result of presidential elections. Only two candidates \u2014 Richard Nixon in 1960, and Gerald Ford in 1976 \u2014 have lost the popular vote when the incumbent president had a positive approval rating heading into the campaign season. Those were the two of the three closest races of the 20th century. The third, 1968, featured a president with an approval rating just a bit underwater.At best, knowing the right-track/wrong-track number has added no predictive value beyond what the president\u2019s approval rating and the state of the economy provide. At worst, it can mislead \u2014 as it did in 2000, 2004 and 2012. Indeed, a simple model would give you the counterintuitive finding that a strong \u201cright track\u201d number is actually bad \u2014 that\u2019s right, bad \u2014 for the president\u2019s party after controlling for any combination of the president\u2019s approval, the economy or incumbency.To be clear, I\u2019m not arguing that the right-track/wrong-track measure is totally useless. There have only been 11 or so elections since pollsters began asking the question. By 2100, perhaps it will turn out that the right-track number does add some value. Maybe this year will be the first of what will turn out to be many.But there are logical reasons the right-track/wrong-track numbers wouldn\u2019t be expected to tell us much that we don\u2019t already know.After all, dissatisfaction with the country should largely be baked into the president\u2019s approval rating \u2014 at least to the extent that voters believe the president and his party are responsible for the problems facing the country. Or put differently, if things are bad and voters aren\u2019t taking it out on the president, why would they be expected to take it out on the president\u2019s party?This year, you can conjure an argument for why, maybe, the president\u2019s approval ratings are high for reasons independent of the state of the country. Maybe voters just like Mr. Obama in comparison with Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump. Maybe it\u2019s possible for voters to think that Mr. Obama has done a decent job as president, but still believe it\u2019s time for a change.The president\u2019s approval rating helps Mrs. Clinton, but not by enough in the model to make up for middling economic growth and the country\u2019s traditional desire to head in a different direction. The president\u2019s party would be a modest 2-to-1 or so underdog under ordinary circumstances.But these numbers aren\u2019t terrible. They\u2019re not like 1980 or 2008, when the same data made the incumbent\u2019s party a big underdog \u2014 and when a convention like the Democrats\u2019 would have certainly seemed painfully out of touch. This year\u2019s \u201cright-track\u201d numbers are about as bad as in those two cycles, even though everything else seems to point toward a more normal election \u2014 one where the Democrats would be slight but not big underdogs.Whether voters are in a mood more like 1988 (when George H.W. Bush won the G.O.P.\u2019s third straight election after two terms from Ronald Reagan) than 2008 could easily decide this election. We\u2019ll probably get a sense pretty soon. In both 2012 and 2004, the incumbent party\u2019s convention boosted the president\u2019s approval ratings and the number of Americans who were satisfied with the direction of the country.Historically, polls conducted a few weeks after a convention tend to be fairly reflective of the outcome. They\u2019re certainly far more predictive than the polls immediately beforehand, or in the midst of the post-convention bounces. We\u2019ll know a lot more about the race and, indeed, just how angry the country really is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Didi Chuxing and Uber, Popular in China, Are Now Legal, Too", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Ride-hailing services in China have attracted billions of dollars in investments. They have pulled in money from some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, like Apple and Alibaba. They have become a crucial road test for one of America\u2019s best-known start-ups, Uber.On Thursday, they finally became legal.In a new law announced by several regulators, China\u2019s government gave the thumbs-up for ride-hailing companies like Uber and its Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, to operate in the country. The law clears up regulatory uncertainty and lays out a new framework under which ride-hailing companies can operate in the country.Uber and Didi have upended China\u2019s taxi industry by allowing drivers to take passengers in private vehicles with the help of hugely popular apps. Despite investments in technology, marketing and subsidies, both companies had operated in a legal gray zone, with drivers occasionally being detained by the police.Strict government rules have repeatedly tripped up local and foreign internet companies in China. Yet in the fast-moving Chinese tech industry, an \u201cinvest first, get approval later\u201d model has prevailed. For Uber and Didi, it appears that ethos has paid off.Analysts said the new law, which will take effect on Nov. 1, signaled a step back from earlier, stricter proposals. According to the rules, drivers must have three years\u2019 experience, be licensed by a local taxi regulator and have no criminal record. Cars with more than 600,000 kilometers, or about 370,000 miles, on the odometer may not be used.Drivers were divided on what to make of the new rules. On one hand, they said in a chat group, it was a relief to see their job permitted by the government. On the other hand, the finer points of the law were unclear, leaving open questions like whether cars licensed outside Beijing would be allowed to take fares in the city.In an interview, a 31-year-old driver with the surname Liu, who did not give his full name because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the ride-hailing services, pointed out that the law did not address other concerns; many drivers have seen incomes cut nearly in half recently as Didi and Uber have reduced subsidies.That has been more painful to drivers who bought cars to take advantage of the big bonuses that had been offered. One man, Wen Zhenjiang, 37, quit a job driving Coca-Cola trucks from Beijing to the western city of Xi\u2019an and bought a Volkswagen to start driving for Uber and Didi.\u201cI will see how much I can earn,\u201d Mr. Wen said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t earn much, even if it\u2019s legal now, there\u2019s no point in doing it.\u201dHe added that he thought many drivers would fail the licensing process and that he was wary of the GPS tracking devices the new law says must be installed on their vehicles as a safety measure. Similar devices have led to limits on how much time drivers can spend on the road in trucking, he said.\u201cI know the tracking devices,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you install that and drive more than eight hours a day, you will be fined, and your company won\u2019t pay the fine.\u201dExperts said there was nothing in the law to validate Mr. Wen\u2019s concerns.Uber and Didi issued statements welcoming the regulation. In a note from the senior vice president of corporate development for Uber\u2019s Chinese arm, Zhen Liu, the company said it was \u201cregulation-ready\u201d and would be working with local authorities to put the regulations into practice.Didi said its drivers would begin applying for local licenses. Didi\u2019s statement praised elements of the rules, like the fact that ride-hailing companies will be allowed to set their own prices.Calling the new law a \u201cmilestone\u201d for China\u2019s sharing economy, Wu Shenkuo, a Beijing Normal University law professor, said he did not see any evidence that the law would specifically take aim at foreign companies. Still, he said, the companies must take care to comply with the rules, which will be put in place locally.\u201cCompanies need to adjust to the new law, especially in terms of applying for licenses, screening drivers and equipping cars,\u201d he said, adding that the law creates a model as China seeks to regulate new internet-based industries that conflict with existing businesses. Taxi drivers in China have held mass protests over ride-hailing apps, which they say are unfair competition.\u201cFrom what I can see now, it is very likely that companies will give out less subsidies, raise the rate up for car-hailing, and as a consequence, there might be fewer part-time drivers,\u201d he added.While Uber remains in the middle of a brutal pricing competition with Didi, which has more of the market, the rules to some degree validate the American company\u2019s willingness to flout regulations in new markets.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Targets Executives, Pressed by an Angry Public", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Looking for answers after the deaths of scores of children and pregnant women from a mysterious lung ailment, a group of families in South Korea began to focus on a potential cause: a cleaner called Oxy.In 2011, South Korean officials suggested that toxic chemicals in Oxy \u2014 used to sanitize humidifiers and sold by the British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser \u2014 and similar products were responsible for the deaths. Ninety-five have been confirmed by the government, which is also reviewing hundreds of additional cases reported by families, who claim more than 460 fatalities. The government\u2019s punishment for Reckitt Benckiser: a $45,000 fine for falsely advertising Oxy as safe for humans.Five years later, simmering anger over the deaths has hit Reckitt Benckiser \u2014 and prompted widening hostility to white-collar crime that is directed at foreign and local companies alike.South Korean prosecutors in May arrested three local Reckitt Benckiser employees and charged them with professional negligence resulting in deaths. When a Reckitt Benckiser executive publicly apologized, a relative of a victim jumped onstage and slapped him in the back of the neck.To outsiders, South Korea\u2019s rash of criminal investigations and prosecutions against corporate officials make it look unusually aggressive in pursuing white-collar crime. But South Korean analysts and critics say the tough actions show the opposite: Government officials have little power to brandish big fines or other civil penalties, as their counterparts in the United States and Europe do.\u201cWhen people are outraged, the government has few things to show to them except asking prosecutors to get involved,\u201d said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering at Daelim University College, who has followed the Volkswagen scandal.For corporate scofflaws, South Korea can be a surprisingly forgiving environment. Fines are modest. Until recently, courts routinely suspended the sentences of tycoons convicted of bribery, embezzlement or tax evasion, citing the potential impact on their corporate empires \u2014 and, by extension, the country\u2019s economy. Class-action lawsuits and court awards are limited.The soft treatment is a legacy of South Korea\u2019s hard-charging economic past. In the decades after the end of the Korean War in 1953, military dictators in South Korea favored businesses \u2014 especially a handful of corporate families known as chaebol \u2014 with tax benefits, cheap electricity and bank loans and brutal crackdowns on labor activists.In the newly elected National Assembly, where President Park Geun-hye\u2019s pro-business governing party no longer holds a majority, lawmakers are pushing to allow plaintiffs to ask for punitive damages \u2014 large financial penalties used in the United States and elsewhere to punish white-collar crimes \u2014 in more types of cases.One South Korean group that monitors businesses, the People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, called the introduction of punitive damages one of South Korea\u2019s most urgently needed reforms.\u201cAs a result of our decades-long national strategy focusing on economic development, our legal system is too much geared toward protecting industries,\u201d said Kim Hyun, a former president of the Seoul Bar Association, who recently collected signatures from a thousand lawyers supporting punitive damages.Business groups say that punitive damages could victimize businesses.\u201cAs in the United States, we would see lawyers encouraging lawsuits against companies, costing them time and money in fighting these questionable lawsuits,\u201d said Lee Cheol-haeng, the chief of business policy studies at the Federation of Korean Industries, which represents big businesses in South Korea.Until recently, the cost of violating South Korean law could be modest, as the Volkswagen case shows.While the Ministry of Environment ordered Volkswagen Korea to recall 125,000 cars sold in the country, it could fine the company only $12.3 million. Under a law devised to protect local carmakers, the government can impose fines up to 1 billion South Korean won, or $867,000, per model that violates its clean-air law, no matter how many individual cars have been sold. The new law, enacted at the end of last year, allows up to 10 times that amount, or about $8.7 million.When the Ministry of Environment asked prosecutors to seek criminal charges against Volkswagen Korea executives earlier this year, Hong Dong-gon, a ministry official, said they were meant partly as \u201ca tool of pressure\u201d to wrest a more satisfactory recall and compensation package from Volkswagen.The biggest example of resistance to white-collar crime has become Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s local subsidiary. In addition to arrests there, some workers at local companies that made or sold rival products have been arrested on similar charges. Two university professors have also been arrested on charges of manipulating data on Oxy\u2019s toxicity in return for bribes from Reckitt Benckiser Korea.The families fighting Oxy did not gain national attention until this year. As the scandal threatened to become a major political burden for her government, which championed pro-business deregulation, Ms. Park called for a thorough investigation, and prosecutors began summoning company officials.In May, Reckitt Benckiser Korea apologized and acknowledged responsibility. It also promised to double a humanitarian fund it had founded for victims to $8.7 million, following a common practice among South Korean businesses in legal trouble to make large charitable donations while seeking lenience in court.Some of the families say that is not enough.\u201cIt has been as if there were only victims but no perpetrators,\u201d said Kang Chan-ho, whose daughter struggles with lung damage after his family used one of the toxic disinfectants. \u201cWe have been ignored both by the government and by the businesses.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about growing hostility to white-collar crime in South Korea misstated the dates of some events. A company, Reckitt Benckiser, apologized for the sale of a deadly cleaner in May, the same month that three of its South Korea employees were arrested, not last month. South Korean officials raided the homes and offices of top executives of the Lotte Group in June, not this month. The article also misstated the surname of a South Korean environmental ministry official. He is Hong Dong-gon, not Han Dong-gon.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, he stepped close to the edge of declaring his own independent candidacy for next year.Until government colleagues began giving him the cold shoulder over his undisguised political ambitions, he had been the standard-bearer for the pro-capitalism wing of the Socialists.But Tuesday night, he cast away allegiance to the party, and in over an hour of lofty rhetoric, Mr. Macron repeatedly suggested in front of thousands of cheering supporters that he was the man \u201cto change the country.\u201dHe cast himself as an iconoclast willing to upset the establishment.En Marche is \u201cagainst the established order,\u201d Mr. Macron declared, the one to \u201ctransform the country\u201d in an era calling for \u201ca fresh breath\u201d and when \u201cwe must overcome the divisions\u201d of the traditional parties. He said that France had a \u201cfurious desire for things to change.\u201dThe limited overhauls he had earlier proposed \u2014 opening up intercity bus routes and loosening restrictions on Sunday work hours \u2014 had to be forced through Parliament last year by the Socialists.Indeed, angry anti-Macron union demonstrators besieged the Left Bank meeting hall where the economy minister spoke Tuesday night, forcing his supporters to run a gantlet of police officers and protesters.Mr. Macron, repeatedly casting himself and his movement as France\u2019s top change agents, called En Marche an \u201cassembly of progressives\u201d that \u201cbelieves in liberty and justice.\u201dBut the crowd Tuesday night, which seemed affluent and monochromatic, did not appear to reflect the multicultural reality of urban and suburban France.Mr. Macron was introduced by an enthusiastic young woman who described herself as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d who had spent six years in Silicon Valley.Mr. Macron has irritated his colleagues with his ambition \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s time for all this to stop,\u201d his boss, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, was heard muttering Tuesday afternoon \u2014 and at the rally, the young minister stopped just short of gratifying his supporters.He did not overtly declare his candidacy, and he did not resign from the government, as some within it are saying he must do.But he came very close. \u201cNothing can stop this movement now,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cThis movement, we will carry it together to 2017, and all the way to victory!\u201d he shouted.And he got in a dig at his other boss, Mr. Hollande: \u201cOur country is weary of promises that have not been kept,\u201d Mr. Macron said, assuring the crowd he understood the \u201chuge transformations\u201d that were taking place in France\u2019s economy and society.But the French political scientist G\u00e9rard Grunberg underlined in an interview the difficulty of Mr. Macron\u2019s political position.\u201cIt is very difficult for him to go up against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, he wants absolutely to be a candidate. He is playing double or nothing.\u201dBut Mr. Grunberg dismissed Mr. Macron\u2019s strategy of presenting himself as an anti-establishment candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, because he\u2019s so much a member of the establishment, he can\u2019t play the populist card,\u201d he said, noting his close connection to \u201cthe ruling classes\u201d and the difficulty he will have connecting with the less-exalted in French society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nuclear Subsidies Are Key Part of New York\u2019s Clean-Energy Plan", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe blueprint for New York State\u2019s lofty clean-energy goals relies on the technologies of the future: The state, officials have promised, will draw half of its electricity from renewable and clean energy sources like wind and solar power by 2030.But as the plan takes shape at the state\u2019s Public Service Commission, talk of still-young technologies has been overshadowed by something of a throwback: the state\u2019s aging nuclear power plants.The subsidy is likely to grow into the multibillion-dollar range over the 12-year period proposed by the state, a sum that has caused watchdogs to question whether the state is about to approve a major industry bailout with minimal public scrutiny \u2014 even though it is the public\u2019s utility bills that will grow.Though the commission outlined the plan in January, saying that the subsidy could cost anywhere from $59 million to $658 million by 2023, not until 10 days before the deadline for public comments did it disclose that the actual amount would be closer to $1 billion over the first two years. (The commission pushed the deadline back another week, to Friday, after a minor outcry, while maintaining that it had offered plenty of time and information.)From the state\u2019s perspective, the subsidies are not simply handouts, but a way of putting a dollar value on the benefits of a reliable carbon-free power source. Propping them up for now, supporters say, will give the state time to foster a stable mix of renewable energy sources.The plants accounted for about a third of the power New York generated last year, as well as more than half of its emissions-free energy.\u201cNuclear has a role,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference, framing it as a matter of using the tools available. \u201cUnless we\u2019re willing to go back to candles, which would be uncomfortable and inconvenient, we need energy generation.\u201dExelon Corporation would stand to benefit the most from the plan; It owns two of the three upstate plants, and is in talks to buy the third, the FitzPatrick nuclear power plant in Oswego. Exelon has spent at least $426,000 on lobbying over the past two years, according to state records.\u201cWith very little process, and very little time for the public to even know this is happening, what they\u2019re proposing here is a multibillion-dollar uncompetitive subsidy to one company,\u201d said Jessica Azulay, a spokeswoman for the Alliance for a Green Economy, an environmentalist group.The alliance has calculated the total cost over 12 years as more than $7.6 billion.James Denn, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, dismissed that estimate, saying that if wholesale energy prices rise, as they are forecast to do, customers will ultimately pay less in subsidies.If the nuclear plants closed, he added, energy prices would increase, forcing customers to pay more than three times what they would pay for subsidies. He also said the subsidies would return about $5 billion in benefits.Advertisement"}

Clinton got Herr\u2019s vote in the primary. Another trucker who met her, Mark Kirsch, is a registered Republican but says that he would most likely have voted for Clinton over John McCain in the general election. \u201cShe seemed very down to earth,\u201d he says. \u201cShe seemed to relate to regular people.\u201dBoth men are now inclined to vote for Donald J. Trump. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even understand what the working class is anymore,\u201d Kirsch says. \u201cTrump might be an unmitigated ass,\u201d Herr says. \u201cBut he\u2019s our unmitigated ass.\u201dSo far, one of the most surprising aspects of the Democratic National Convention unfolding two hours east of Harrisburg this week is how little of it has been dedicated to shoring up Clinton\u2019s support with the white, working-class voters she aggressively courted in states like Pennsylvania eight years ago, the constituency she seems most likely to lose to Trump. The antigun, pro-abortion rights, immigrant-friendly and \u201cstronger together\u201d message in Philadelphia is no doubt intended to mollify both the Bernie Sanders loyalists and the minority groups that are expected to turn out heavily for Clinton in November. Watching the pageant unfold, it\u2019s easy to forget that Clinton, running against Barack Obama in 2008, unabashedly offered herself as the safe haven for white, blue-collar Democrats.Recent history suggests that Clinton has nothing to worry about in Pennsylvania, which a Republican presidential candidate has not won since 1988. That\u2019s been largely because the majority of the state\u2019s votes come from Philadelphia and the surrounding three suburban \u201ccollar counties,\u201d which are all heavily Democratic. (Obama carried the state in 2012 by 300,000 votes, almost entirely because of the 600,000-vote edge he received in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties.) But the Harrisburg-based G.O.P. pollster James Lee insists that this year could be different. \u201cThe Democrats have 900,000 more voters in this state than Republicans,\u201d Lee says. \u201cDespite that, in the primaries only 89,000 more Democrats than Republicans turned out to vote. Now, some of that is because the Clinton-Sanders race wasn\u2019t as energizing. But because both Trump and Clinton have such high unfavorable ratings, there are indications that the overall turnout in Pennsylvania this November could be far lower than it was the past two cycles. And that means fewer minority and college-age voters in Philadelphia and the collar counties.\u201dLee points out that in the last low-turnout presidential year, 2004, John Kerry beat George W. Bush in Pennsylvania by only 140,000 votes. At this stage, Lee says, Trump is significantly outperforming Bush in the state\u2019s 16 or so bellwether counties \u2014 populated in part by unionized miners and steelworkers, in addition to other lifelong Democrats who are nonetheless socially conservative. \u201cIn Cambria County, he\u2019s on track to win by twice the margin Bush did,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThe point being, if this happens in most of the swing counties, it\u2019s not hard to come up with the 140,000 votes Bush lost by in 2004.\u201d\u201cThis is almost duplicative of 1980, when middle-income working-class voters in Pennsylvania became Reagan Democrats,\u201d says former Harrisburg mayor Stephen R. Reed, a Democrat who supported Clinton in 2008. \u201cHillary had a very strong appeal to those voters in 2008. If the election were held today, a lot of those voters would be inclined to vote for Trump. I think they\u2019re gettable, but there has to be additional focus by her campaign to reverse the inroads that Trump has made with them. The focus in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio has to be on the economy \u2014 creating jobs, raising the minimum wage. I\u2019d leave the other issues to the side, frankly.\u201dWhen I visited the Capitol Diner myself Wednesday, my server, a 58-year old Greek-American woman named Athena, told me that she had waited on then-Senator Clinton at the 2008 event. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice, very intelligent lady,\u201d Athena said. \u201cBut after eight years of Obama, I think she would just be a continuation.\u201dI asked her if she was intending to vote for Trump.

It is still dealing with the aftershocks of financial and debt crises. It is coping with new threats like Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. And it is guarding against a shaky banking system in Italy.Here is what he had to say:\u201cEuro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what is going to be the final impact. The only thing that we can say is that it\u2019s a risk that has materialized, and it\u2019s a downside risk.\u201dHe was not asked about expectations the central bank will again try to bring financial market clearing operations \u2014 which serve as intermediaries in financial transactions \u2014 into the eurozone, from London. The central bank has tried that before, but it was blocked by the European courts. A renewed effort may be easier, as Britain may no longer be part of the European Union\u2019s single market and would not have the clout to prevent it. Frankfurt or Paris would be likely alternatives.\u201cSome steps have been undertaken in Italy.\u201d\u201cThey are certainly steps in the right direction. More should be done.\u201dThat is a problem for the European Central Bank, which is in charge of bank supervision across the eurozone. Italy will be a test of the central bank\u2019s crisis management skills, and of new European Union rules intended to ensure that taxpayers do not have to pay for bank rescues. Those rules say bank shareholders and creditors \u2014 for example, owners of bonds issued by the banks \u2014 should suffer first. But forcing shareholders and creditors to take the losses could create shock waves in financial markets.Mr. Draghi is well acquainted with the landscape. He was previously governor of the Bank of Italy, and, before that, he spent a decade as director general of the Italian Treasury.Eurozone banks in general \u201care better if not much better than they were before\u201d in terms of the danger they might go out of business, Mr. Draghi said. But he expressed concern that they are not very profitable, and that bank share prices were low, noting that banks have more trouble raising new capital from investors if their share prices are depressed.\u201cWe have given enough evidence not only of our readiness to act, and our willingness to act, but also to being able to adapt our programs so as to reach the objective.\u201dThe European Central Bank started buying bonds issued by eurozone countries in March 2015, part of a program called quantitative easing \u2014 a form of money printing intended to cut market interest rates and stimulate the eurozone economy. It has so far accumulated government debt worth \u20ac875 billion.The program has succeeded in pushing down interest rates, in some cases below zero. But the supply of such bonds is finite. By some calculations, the central bank will have trouble keeping its promise to maintain the debt purchases at least until March 2017. It said on Thursday that it would continue its pace of bond buying, and Mr. Draghi countered claims by some economists that the central bank will run out of debt to buy by arguing that the bank had shown a history of being ready and willing to adjust its bond-purchase plan in the face of changing circumstances.He declined to comment, however, on whether the bank could, for example, loosen its self-imposed restrictions on the bond buying. In particular, the bank could give itself more leeway to avoid bonds from Germany, which are in such demand that they have negative yields, meaning investors are willing to pay money, rather than receive interest, to own them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Fish Seen Escaping an Agency Pursuing Bank Fraud", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 United Commercial Bank in San Francisco had the dubious distinction of being the first bank to fail in 2009 after receiving nearly $300 million in bailout funds from the federal government.The question, at least according to its critics, is Sigtarp\u2019s relevance. The agency has recovered more than $10 billion through its investigations and has charged a total of 357 people with a crime, including 80 bankers. Of the bankers criminally charged, 58 have been convicted and 35 have gone to prison, according to the agency\u2019s latest quarterly report to Congress on Wednesday.Critics point out, however, that most of these cases involve small-time community and regional bankers. Prominent Wall Street executives have escaped largely unscathed.Christy Goldsmith Romero, the special inspector general, said in an interview that bank fraud at all levels of the industry still needed to be addressed. \u201cIf you have a banker, who when times were tough, was willing to cook the books and commit a crime to do that \u2014 maybe for the first time in their life or maybe they\u2019ve been committing a crime and they haven\u2019t been caught \u2014 we do not want that person not only in banking, we don\u2019t want them on the streets,\u201d she said.The agency employs 140 people, including 85 special agents who are permitted to carry badges and guns. It operates on an annual budget of nearly $50 million, including nearly $41 million appropriated from Congress and another $6 million to $8 million appropriated when the office was created.For its critics, the charges against community and regional bankers fudging their accounts and defrauding the bailout fund are in some ways beside the point.\u201cYes, if you break the law, you commit fraud, you should go to jail,\u201d said Edward Mills, a policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets. \u201cBut to the extent that the only folks who get in trouble are the smallest guys that you\u2019ve generally never heard of, that doesn\u2019t help the narrative.\u201dAuthorized by Congress during the heat of the financial crisis, the Troubled Asset Relief Program \u2014 the official name of the bank industry bailout \u2014 was initially granted $700 billion. Ultimately, the government used closer to $500 billion to stabilize the banking system, including injecting capital into troubled banks.Along with this program, lawmakers called for the creation of two new oversight bodies, the Congressional Oversight Panel, led by Elizabeth Warren, then a professor, and Sigtarp, which was to be the fund\u2019s inspector general, and gave existing agencies added duties. The congressional panel was dissolved in 2011.United Commercial Bank found itself stretched after nearly doubling in size during the mid-2000s. Executives, under pressure to help the company avoid reporting a third-quarter loss in 2008, delayed writing down the value of numerous loans on the bank\u2019s books. Then United Commercial took the federal bailout money before ultimately failing.Sigtarp was intended to stamp out cases like these where bailout funds were misused.Ms. Romero previously worked under Neil Barofsky, who earned a tough-cop reputation as the office\u2019s first special inspector general. She took over for Mr. Barofsky officially after being confirmed in 2012. Sigtarp\u2019s mission was to root out fraud and refer cases to prosecutors.\u201cWhen we built Sigtarp back in 2008-9, it was kind of a dream come true for a couple of federal prosecutors, to get to build a law enforcement agency from scratch that would only focus on complex white-collar investigations, and Sigtarp was built with that focus in mind,\u201d Mr. Barofsky said in an email. \u201cChristy, who was of course an important part of building that model as our chief of staff, has successfully built upon it, maintained its focus, and it has been a pleasure to watch the agency grow, thrive and succeed under her leadership.\u201dMs. Romero conceded that proving guilt at the highest levels of Wall Street banks has been difficult, though she noted that Sigtarp had been involved in the investigations that led to some of the largest civil actions against the likes of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America.\u201cCriminal intent is very hard to prove and if you have a very large institution, a lot of the information is going to be kept from those people, making it very, very difficult to prove criminal intent,\u201d she said.As for the cases involving senior managers at small and regional financial companies, \u201cWhat happened to these banks had a profound and painful impact on not only individual victims, like employees of the bank or local businesses, but on communities \u2014 and those communities roll up to local economies and regional economies,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that hits public confidence.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear what the agency\u2019s future might hold, as the Treasury\u2019s crisis-era relief program winds down. Just 23 of the 707 banks that received help through TARP\u2019s capital purchase program are still repaying their loans, and the fund\u2019s other programs are set to wind down in coming years.For her part, Ms. Romero says the mission remains the same: rooting out bank fraud and other crimes. Sigtarp indicted 92 people last year, including bankers and others, up from 55 in 2014. It has already charged 30 more people with a crime this year, as of June.\u201cFor us, it doesn\u2019t matter if a bank pays TARP, because you can\u2019t pay to get out of jail,\u201d she said. \u201cOur focus is no different. We are not in any way scaling down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has fallen below 1.4 percent, the lowest level in history.\u201cAlmost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market,\u201d the account said.The vote to do nothing at the June meeting was unanimous \u2014 a first for the Fed since January \u2014 but differences persisted over how long the Fed should wait. Some officials continued to argue for raising rates soon, while others saw little reason for urgency.Those in favor of moving argued that unemployment and inflation were close to levels the Fed regarded as healthy, and waiting could cause the economy to overheat. In their view, the minutes said, \u201ctaking another step in removing monetary accommodation should not be delayed too long.\u201dStanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said last week on the business cable news network CNBC that there was still reason for optimism about the economic outlook. \u201cFirst of all, the U.S. economy since the very bad data we got in May on employment has done pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the incoming data looked good.\u201dOthers, however, were inclined to leave rates near zero for some time. These officials, the account said, \u201cunderscored they would need to accumulate sufficient evidence to increase their confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand.\u201dRob Martin, an economist at Barclays, said the debate would be decided by job growth in the coming months. The government will release its June employment report on Friday.\u201cIf employment growth picks up this summer, members will become more optimistic over the outlook for activity,\u201d Mr. Martin wrote on Wednesday, after the release of the meeting minutes. \u201cLikewise, if employment growth disappoints over the summer, even the most hawkish member will begin to revise its outlook lower and no member would push hard for a September rate hike.\u201dSince the financial crisis, inflation has consistently failed to reach the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy. Inflation expectations have declined sharply. And, as inflation sags in other developed nations, some economists warn that central banks are not doing enough. But the Fed remains officially sanguine. The account said most officials expected faster inflation in coming years.The global economy also remains a concern. The June minutes said that officials saw signs of improvement \u2014 but that was before the British vote. There is general agreement that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will drag on growth, but the magnitude remains unclear.In the short term, that is another reason for the Fed to delay any rate increases.\u201cWe are still evaluating it,\u201d Mr. Fischer said on Friday. \u201cMy guess is that it will be less important for the U.S. than the countries directly involved \u2014 almost just logically so. We will wait and see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Four Seasons: A Most American Experience", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMY introduction to the Four Seasons restaurant, when I was in my 20s, came courtesy of Alexander Liberman, then the editorial director of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines and my boss (though to say he was my boss is like calling Barack Obama the boss of your local postmaster). I was a kid from Pittsburgh in love with New York as the capital of wit and style, neither of which I possessed, though I was hoping I could acquire them. I can only assume that he took me to the Four Seasons because he thought it was something I needed to experience.And it was. I had never seen a restaurant like it, which I attributed at the time to the fact that I hadn\u2019t seen enough restaurants. It was only years later, after having seen many, that I realized that in fact there was no place like it.But it was when I was living abroad that I came to appreciate just how American it was. And not just the food. On return trips to New York, I was struck by all the ways the restaurant seemed to mirror the culture in which it bloomed: the veneration of money and power, on parade in the Grill at lunchtime; the deference with which they welcomed not only the A-list regulars but the pilgrim tourist; the big statement and bold confidence inherent in design that crystallized the country\u2019s buoyant mood at the time of its opening, in 1959; the sense of theater implicit in the arrangement of the tables and the vaguely madcap Pool Room, an urban pond. It was one of those rare instances when a restaurant manages to capture the soul of a place.Last year, Aby Rosen, a German-born real estate developer and owner of the Seagram Building, which houses the Four Seasons, announced that its lease would not be renewed. (Julian Niccolini and Alex von Bidder, two of its current owners, will reopen next year a few blocks away.) In its place, Mr. Rosen will install a new restaurant. Those of us who took heart in the fact that the Four Seasons\u2019 interior was landmarked, in 1989, along with the building, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe with Philip Johnson, have lately been confronted with the limits of that protection. The shell of the rooms Johnson designed will remain. But the furniture and tableware, each item carefully considered for the part it played in the total experience, will be dispersed at auction on July 26.On a recent Saturday night, sitting at the bar, gazing out at the Grill Room one final time (the Four Seasons closes Saturday evening), I saw the restaurant through the eyes of the young man to my left. He had come to check it out after reading an article in that day\u2019s paper. Together we admired the 20-foot ceilings, the simple lines and extravagant materials. Three women chatted with the bartender. Over the years, they said, they had paid farewell visits to the old Tavern on the Green and Russian Tea Room, and now here. The crowd that night seemed divided between customers of long standing, who had turned out to commemorate the restaurant\u2019s role in their lives, and first-time visitors, who had come for a last-chance tour of a monument to midcentury optimism. Admission was the price of a drink.The Grill Room has been best known as a canteen for power brokers, but I can attest to the fact that the restaurant also catered to those of us whose presence conferred no status whatsoever. One night at dinner some 20 years ago, I told Mr. Niccolini that I needed to get home and pack for my trip to India the next day.\u201cIndia! For how long?\u201d he asked. Four weeks. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to have a good meal for a month,\u201d he protested. There are, of course, good restaurants in India, but they weren\u2019t on the itinerary, and in any case, I wasn\u2019t going for the food. The next day, 15 minutes before I left for the airport, my buzzer rang: It was a messenger from the Four Seasons delivering a tote bag with two appetizers, two main courses and two desserts in Tupperware containers, and two bottles of wine \u2014 a picnic my traveling companion and I unpacked on our flight that evening, unfolding our tiny tray tables in the next to last row of economy.Every generation, I suppose, witnesses the demise of its favorite places, but usually they run their course and fade away. Which in this case is not what happened. What rankles is the way Mr. Rosen has framed his decision as not capricious but inevitable, a clash between two cultures: old or older New York versus new or young New York, stuffy versus lively, an aging clientele of predigital corporate titans versus a crowd of up-and-comers, the past versus now. As if it\u2019s finally time for the parents to vacate the premises and let the kids get the party started.Mr. Rosen has engaged Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick \u2014 the team behind Carbone and Dirty French, both wildly successful downtown restaurants \u2014 to take over the space. In an interview with this newspaper, Mr. Carbone, one of the chefs, said he had been researching old Four Seasons menus on file at the New York Public Library with the intention of recreating many of the vintage dishes. \u201cI\u2019m really just doing the first decade,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much interest I have beyond that. I want to be playing in the J.F.K. world.\u201dSo the Four Seasons\u2019 unmaking will likewise be quintessentially American. Not even epidemic nostalgia for the \u201960s could save it. The restaurant where real live admen met for lunch is, it seems, less compelling than the world of Don Draper. Paris\u2019s Grand V\u00e9four, now over 200 years old, is still thriving, as is Milan\u2019s Sant Ambroeus, founded in 1936. But the Four Seasons, in many ways their New York counterpart, will not survive intact. The new operators will cherry-pick its past and use what they like. Our tolerance for the stuff of history goes only so far. In the end, it\u2019s all material.Holly Brubach is a writer and frequent contributor to The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delusions of Chaos", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byNational crime statistics, and numbers for all violent crimes, paint an only slightly less cheerful picture. And it\u2019s not just a matter of numbers; our big cities look and feel far safer than they did a generation ago, because they are. People of a certain age always have the sense that America isn\u2019t the country they remember from their youth, and in this case they\u2019re right \u2014 it has gotten much better.How, then, was it even possible for Donald Trump to give a speech accepting the Republican nomination whose central premise was that crime is running rampant, and that \u201cI alone\u201d can bring the chaos under control?Of course, nobody should be surprised to see Mr. Trump confidently asserting things that are flatly untrue, since he does that all the time \u2014 and never corrects his falsehoods. Indeed, the big speech repeated some of those golden oldies, like the claim that America is the world\u2019s most highly taxed country (when we are actually near the bottom among advanced economies).Yet there\u2019s no question that many voters \u2014 including, almost surely, a majority of white men \u2014 will indeed buy into that vision. Why?Again, however, it\u2019s one thing to have a shaky grasp on crime statistics, but something quite different to accept a nightmare vision of America that conflicts so drastically with everyday experience. So what\u2019s going on?Well, I do have a hypothesis, namely, that Trump supporters really do feel, with some reason, that the social order they knew is coming apart. It\u2019s not just race, where the country has become both more diverse and less racist (even if it still has a long way to go). It\u2019s also about gender roles \u2014 when Mr. Trump talks about making America great again, you can be sure that many of his supporters are imagining a return to the (partly imagined) days of male breadwinners and stay-at-home wives.But what are the consequences of these changes in the social order? Back when crime was rising, conservatives insistently drew a connection to social change \u2014 that was what the whole early \u201990s fuss over \u201cfamily values\u201d was about. Loose the bonds of traditional society, and chaos would follow.The point, however, is that in the minds of those disturbed by social change, chaos in the streets was supposed to follow, and they are all too willing to believe that it did, in the teeth of the evidence.The question now is how many such people, people determined to live in a nightmare of their own imagining, there really are. I guess we\u2019ll find out in November.Advertisement"}

For emerging markets, the move into the dollar could presage a tide of investment flowing out, imperiling economies from Brazil to Indonesia. For Europe, a weaker euro underscores fundamental doubts about whether leaders can finally muster a formula for economic vibrancy after years of disappointment and recrimination.When economies function in healthy fashion, money flows across investments in pursuit of rewards that are supposed to be correlated to risks. But when a shock hits and fear takes hold, investors tend to trust only storehouses with one key trait \u2014 the certainty of survival.The charge into the dollar says less about investors\u2019 faith in the United States and more about the alarming situations confronting other major economies.The 19 countries that share the euro appear vulnerable to political discord and widening separatism as they contend with an influx of refugees, aging populations and tepid economic growth. Years of confusion may be unfolding \u2014 the sort of turmoil that could make a money manager crave safety.The United States is not without risks. Its public debt exceeds $19 trillion. Fractious politics have in recent years brought the country to the verge of self-inflicted default. It has economic inequality rivaling the Gilded Age of the late 19th century and tens of millions of working people who have essentially lost faith in the American economic bargain as living standards have declined.And yet, the United States can print its own money while finding seemingly limitless demand for its debt. The dollar remains the foundation of global finance, the one piece of a cosmically complex puzzle in which continued faith is required or the totality ceases to make sense.\u201cRightly or wrongly, there are existential questions about the future of the euro,\u201d said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSay what you will about the dollar, no one questions that it will be around 10 or 20 years from now.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.The worst-off countries, like Greece, Spain and Portugal, have sought to unleash government spending, running deficits to stimulate their economies. Germany, the eurozone\u2019s most powerful member, has vetoed that move, demanding that they instead cut spending, including on pensions and social services.\u201cThe people running Europe have gotten so disconnected from what the majority wants, and has always wanted for decades,\u201d said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.Will Britain\u2019s withdrawal alter the politics and spur Germany to moderate its obsession with austerity? Will Berlin assent to less dogmatic economic policies aimed at bolstering growth and spreading the spoils?Every new development heightening doubts about the cohesion of the European project risks provoking investors to demand greater compensation for loans to debt-choked borrowers like Italy, Portugal and Greece. The more those countries have to pay to keep credit flowing, the greater the worries about the health of their banking systems. The greater the reduction in banks\u2019 willingness to lend, the tighter the chokehold on European economic growth. And the absence of growth is both cause and effect of the populist inclinations coursing through the region.And so the cycle potentially turns, with only one predictable outcome: a flight to safety.\u201cContinuing uncertainty is going to make the dollar go up more,\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at Harvard.\u201cIf the uncertainty continues, it\u2019s going to hit the periphery of Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to hit emerging markets.\u201dWorld markets are now so interconnected that when money shifts with unexpected severity, it can yield unanticipated effects.

Businesses suffered, laying off workers.A repeat today would unfold at an especially difficult time. The slowdown of China\u2019s economy has diminished the appetite for goods produced worldwide. Weaker growth in Europe puts more pressure on emerging markets.The Fed is supposed to serve American interests, yet as the taper tantrum brought home, its impacts are felt everywhere. Now, the Fed is weighing when to lift rates after years of maintaining them near zero.\u201cThere\u2019s a potential for huge volatility and huge shocks,\u201d said Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University. \u201cThe part of this that no one can say out loud is that the Fed is the global central bank.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fathers as Caregivers", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported bySunday DialogueReaders discuss the critical role that fathers play in parenting and what steps should be taken to remove stigmas and promote equity.To the Editor:Forty-five years ago I tried an experiment on my children\u2019s pediatrician. When my wife and I were both in the examining room, I noticed that the pediatrician directed all his questions to my wife \u2014 as if I weren\u2019t even there. On one visit, I suggested that my wife sit in the \u201cdaddy corner\u201d and allow me to answer all the doctor\u2019s questions. Despite the fact that I was next to him and answered each of his questions, he kept looking across the room and continued to address all his questions to her.Both reports demand our attention and offer recommendations for action that it would be wise for us to embrace, including these:1) Encourage men to enter professions involving early childhood, health and caregiving heretofore seen as women\u2019s professions.2) Teach all children about the importance and value of being caregivers.3) In child custody decisions, keep the best interest of the child foremost, even if it challenges the assumptions that traditionally favor mothers.4) Pass a national policy guaranteeing paid leave of equal length for mothers and fathers after a birth or adoption.What is often left out of the research findings is the benefit to fathers when they are positively engaged in their children\u2019s lives. Being a dad enriches them, reminds them of what is really important, diminishes their self-absorption, and fills their lives with humor, imagination, enthusiasm, a willingness to make mistakes, and a sense of wonder.ALLAN SHEDLINChevy Chase, Md.The writer, a former educator and founding executive director of the National Elementary School Center, is a parenting coach and the founder of the DADvocacy Consulting Group and Reel Fathers.When society fails to value fathers as caregivers, it hurts everyone \u2014 including businesses and the economy. Allowing men an equal chance to care for children allows women an equal chance to stay at work \u2014 and that allows businesses a better shot at holding onto their best employees, regardless of gender.Many in my generation grew up on \u201cFree to Be \u2026 You and Me,\u201d Marlo Thomas\u2019s album that emphasized gender equality at work and at home. But then we became adults, had children and discovered that the workplace missed the parenting revolution.In addition to pushing for gender-equal laws and policies and an end to anti-dad stigmas, it\u2019s incumbent on each of us to look at our own ingrained attitudes as well. Male privilege and female gatekeeping continue to hold us back. We can all do more to move society forward.JOSH LEVSAtlantaThe writer is a former CNN correspondent.Surely, one of the most significant events in the lives of my children, born and yet to be born, came when my wife announced that she wished to return to work at the end of her maternity leave, with the unspoken corollary that I should man up and accept the responsibility for quitting my own job in the defense industry to stay at home and care for our first child, a daughter. I never had Allan Shedlin\u2019s problem with pediatricians ignoring me, because I was usually the only parent in the room during office visits. Volunteering in my children\u2019s public school classrooms eventually led to employment as a para-educator, which led to teacher credentialing and a career in special education. I lost count of the times a parent or administrator remarked how important it was that Johnny, or Jane, have a male teacher. It\u2019s been a great run: I wasn\u2019t emasculated by my spouse\u2019s ability to earn a family wage, I was emancipated. And the kids, now adults, a software engineer and a public prosecutor, are doing just fine.RICHARD SLETTVETHansville, Wash.LYNN K. RUDICHWoodbridge, Conn.Having worked extensively in education in rich and poor communities, rural and urban, I found that fathers are not nearly as present as mothers, regardless of geography or demographics. Fathers were far less likely to pick kids up from school, talk to me on the phone about their kids, attend school events and trips, etc. Fortunately, as I raise my baby girl and my friends begin starting families, the trend is starting to reverse and my male friends with kids are actively engaged in every possible way. Now the obstacle is more bucking society\u2019s expectations; across the board, my male friends make more money than their partners, which makes staying home much harder. Additionally, employers almost universally expect men to return to work too soon after a child\u2019s birth, and are not nearly as generous toward men with work-from-home and other scenarios that allow parents to balance work and parenting.DAVE GRAYBrooklynWhile I am all for more involved fathers, statistics still show that unless the father is of the stay-at-home variety, then women are still far and away the primary caregivers of children and still do the overwhelming majority of home chores. As we do not even have guaranteed maternity leave in this country (a scandal if you ask me), perhaps we should aim for a reasonable federally guaranteed maternity leave policy before we ask for equal maternity and paternity leave.KRISTIN INGLESBYHoboken, N.J.Having been raised by a mother and grandmother in the 1940s, I based my knowledge of fathers on the ones I saw in the movies. My favorite was Edward G. Robinson in \u201cOur Vines Have Tender Grapes\u201d (1945), who provided his daughter with the three C\u2019s that every child needs: care, concern and compassion. Men incapable of providing these necessities should leave fatherhood to those who can. Not every man can be a dad.BERNARD F. DICKTeaneck, N.J.As a P.T.A. president, I believe that parent engagement is the key to a student success. When I was a little girl, my father always came to school for parent-teacher conferences. I felt proud when he walked down the halls of the school and students would marvel at how tall he was. He became an icon in my school; he would bring cakes for parties, volunteer for field trips and bring presents for my teachers on the last day of school. My father made me feel special. He encouraged me to do my best, ask for help and never give up. In today\u2019s society many families are missing a male figure. Fathers matter. They bring to the table a different perspective on life. I thank my father every day for his support.CARRIE HOLMESAlexandria, Va.I applaud Mr. Shedlin\u2019s suggestions, but asking men to take up jobs in child care is a problem. Men in traditional female professions already pay a disproportionate financial and emotional price for such choices. I\u2019m concerned that \u201cgood men\u201d in caring professions are more likely than men higher up the income scale to end up alone and unpartnered. If men who enter the caring professions are to be fathers as well, they cannot do it alone. They need help from women who are willing to place a higher value on preschool teachers than on venture capitalists.CHARLES CARROLLVancouver, British ColumbiaFor several decades, a social movement has been quietly growing as we re-examine gender roles, expand the definition of family and redefine what it means to be masculine. Mr. Slettvet\u2019s description of feeling \u201cemancipated\u201d after he decided to \u201cman up\u201d and quit his job so he could care for his first child while his wife earned a living wage is a fitting example.The Daddying Movement continues to pick up momentum. Nobody trumpeted its coming, and, unlike most movements, it began without an articulated injustice. It is evolving without a strategic plan, without an identifiable leader and without bellicose tactics; it is occurring one father-grandfather-father figure at a time.Mr. Levs\u2019s letter, which supports the recommendations I cited from the two reports on fathering from Promundo and the American Academy of Pediatrics, notes the twin benefits to home life and workplace. But as Mr. Gray points out, there is still a disconnect between emerging gender-equaling corporate policies and corporate cultures that have not caught up to these new policies.We have done much in the last five decades to chip away at the glass ceiling that too many women still experience in the workplace. It\u2019s encouraging to note the undeniable progress that continues to chip away at the glass ceiling that too many men still face at home and in the caring professions. After all, dads matter to kids, kids matter to dads, and families and communities are better off when fathers and children are positively engaged in each other\u2019s lives.ALLAN SHEDLINChevy Chase, Md.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dreaded Forecast for Our Times: Algae, and Lots of It", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byEvery Thursday night, Bill Korbel, a veteran meteorologist, offers his standard weather forecast to viewers on a Long Island cable channel. Then he follows up with his outlook for toxic algae.On a map, Mr. Korbel points out areas with high concentrations of algae \u2014 natural gatherings of microscopic plankton that, while often innocuous, can degrade water quality and even be dangerous.\u201cBrown or red tide is much catchier than harmful algal bloom,\u201d Mr. Korbel joked about the right wording to use in his broadcast. It\u2019s a relatively new topic for him, something that was never part of his decades-long career. Nor was it part, he said, of his meteorology training at New York University. \u201cThat was down the hall, in oceanography,\u201d he said.Mr. Korbel may not be an outlier for long. If a growing number of scientists have their way \u2014 and can get federal funding they say is desperately need to protect the public \u2014 algae forecasts could become as common as weather reports, and as essential.Sophisticated sensors can be deployed to measure when toxins are reaching harmful levels, allowing officials to redirect fishing, beachgoers or water treatment efforts.So money for algal bloom science comes from more general federal science funds, and those pots are shrinking. Congressionally approved funding for a broad range of related science is around $9 million this year, down 45 percent from five years ago, according to several scientists involved in the research. That means less money for deploying sensors or even to pay for boats and crews to monitor the shorelines.\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox,\u201d said Christopher Gobler, a professor of marine sciences at Stony Brook University who provides the data for Mr. Korbel\u2019s weekly report and believes the field should be more mainstream. \u201cWe need it more than ever, and we\u2019ve brought ourselves to the precipice of making great forecasts, but we can\u2019t make it happen.\u201dDr. Gobler and his team do their sampling the old-fashioned way \u2014 by fanning out on Mondays around Long Island and scooping up water samples. His project is financed largely by foundations.In the case of Dr. Lessard, though, the grant money for the sensor was not enough to cover the cost of training to use it, and of deploying it off San Juan Island, Wash.Scientists say at least 20 sensors are needed around the country at a cost of about $7 million, including training and deployment. The only sensors now in use for any extended period, they say, are in the Gulf of Mexico, though the funding for those is scheduled to run out in 2018.Vera Trainer, a NOAA scientist in Seattle who studies algal blooms, had to ask for volunteers to go on a research expedition to study algal concentrations in the Pacific Ocean because she did not have the money to send her own staff.\u201cI feel like a beggar,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just robots that we need,\u201d Dr. Trainer added. \u201cWe need the research that helps us understand the hot spots, when the cells are most toxic, in what years they\u2019re going to be most intense, the effects of climate change.\u201cWithout the basic knowledge, we have no forecast.\u201dPresident Obama\u2019s 2016 fiscal-year budget called for $13 million for research related to harmful algal blooms.\u201cUnfortunately, there has been an increase in the number, frequency and type of algal blooms,\u201d 19 House Democrats wrote in a letter late last year to ranking members of the House Appropriations Committee, in a failed effort to have the funding level met. The increase in blooms, the letter stated, \u201cis having a crippling effect on local and regional economies.\u201dMr. Spain said the early warning systems could help fishermen avoid millions of dollars in losses like those they suffered last year when toxic blooms devastated the West Coast crab season.\u201cWe can\u2019t live in a world where we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and we don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more advanced notice, the better we know what to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last week he agreed to a four-year, $64 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers. It was a little like a character actor suddenly being paid more than Will Smith for a bit part in a summer blockbuster.The past week in the N.B.A., in which players whose contracts had expired began to negotiate new deals, has turned the sports economy on its head. An infusion of billions of dollars into the league\u2019s coffers from a television contract agreed upon two years ago has led to this: That random guy on the bench is getting upward of $15 million a year.Matthew Dellavedova, who last season often sat on the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 bench alongside Mozgov, also cashed in, agreeing to a four-year, $38 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. Ryan Anderson, a sharpshooter who plays questionable defense, scored $80 million over four years with the Houston Rockets. That annual rate, $20 million, is higher than what any player made on last season\u2019s 73-win Golden State Warriors, including Stephen Curry, the league\u2019s two-time most valuable player.The numbers were even bigger for players considered more talented, even if they are not recognizable to casual sports fans. The Memphis Grizzlies agreed to give Chandler Parsons $94 million over four years and Mike Conley $153 million over five years \u2014 the biggest contract in N.B.A. history. Conley is a very good point guard; LeBron James he is not.This startling redistribution of wealth is a product of a TV rights extension that will go into effect next season, under which ESPN and Turner (which carries games on TNT) are paying the league $24 billion over nine years \u2014 about a 180 percent increase over the last contract. The enormous jump was seen as a reflection of the general value of live sports in an age of DVR and YouTube clips and specifically of the appeal of a star-stocked, exciting league.\u201cAs shocking as the numbers seem, the reality is the business is that much stronger, and the players are just getting their rightful share,\u201d said Marc Fleisher, a basketball agent and the son of Larry Fleisher, who helped found the N.B.A. players union.The salary cap \u2014 the maximum amount each team can spend on salaries (with some exceptions built in) \u2014 was $70 million last season, a $7 million rise from the previous season. But next season it will be $94 million, and it is projected to be $107 million for the 2017-18 season. Also rising was each team\u2019s salary floor, mandating that franchises spend at least 90 percent of the cap\u2019s value on their players.Translation: There had never been a better time to be an N.B.A. free agent than this month, and there may never be again. Players whose contracts expired at the end of the recently completed season hit the jackpot as frenzied teams scrambled for bodies.\u201cPanic is probably not the right word, but teams get afraid that they\u2019ll be left with nothing after months and months of planning and seeing everyone get snatched up quickly,\u201d Fleisher said.Each pro sports league has its own, often complicated salary structure. Right now, basketball players seem charmed in comparison with their counterparts in the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball.In the N.F.L., where the players\u2019 union is relatively weak, contracts are typically not even guaranteed. In baseball, which has the strongest union and no hard limits on spending, the biggest stars have received gargantuan contracts. But the equivalent of a Dellavedova \u2014 a reserve utility infielder? \u2014 probably does not receive $9.5 million a year.Because N.B.A. salary rules also restrict maximum payouts, favor veterans and strictly slot rookie contracts, many milquetoast players are paid above what their open market value would be. If there were an Occupy Wall Street of the N.B.A., it would not consist of the 99 percent revolting against the 1 percent. Rather, its youngest players and maybe its biggest superstars, who many argue are paid less than what they are truly worth, would take on the vast middle class.\u201cVeterans have decided, \u2018We want to shift the money from rookies to veterans,\u2019\u201d said Warren Zola, who teaches sports business at Boston College\u2019s Carroll School of Management. That decision was reached when most of this season\u2019s rookies were too young to drive.Although basketball fans generally believe that more revenue should go to the players rather than the owners, many have nonetheless been dazzled by recent deals.\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked Chandler Parsons got a max contract,\u201d Joel Martinez, who, under the name The Kid Mero, co-hosts a popular podcast, said on Twitter, \u201cuntil I found out it was for basketball and not spraying cologne at Abercrombie.\u201dAfter committing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to Conley and Parsons, the owner of the Grizzlies, Robert Pera, posted an image of one of the Little Rascals throwing money out a window.As much money as Pera and his fellow owners are throwing around this summer, though, they, too, are enjoying the N.B.A.\u2019s boom times. The high contracts reflect a fundamental reality: Business has never been better.\u201cThe bottom line is the players get somewhere between 49 and 51 percent,\u201d Fleisher said, referring to the current apportionment of what is known in the jargon as basketball-related income. \u201cSo the fact that the players are getting this just shows you how much the owners are making.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ever since the installation of Christo spanned the lake, an estimated 40,000 visitors everyday have applauded his accomplishment. And it is a gasping sight, to see something so radically different from the antiquated bridges. Though for me who believes at the heart of our society lies the desire for human networking, Christo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspiration doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop at its physical beauty; the Floating Piers represent a surreal physical manifestation of something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve entitled as intangible \u2014 human connection. With the 21st century making its emphatic exclamation on the development of technology, all forms of physical interactions are becoming obsolete. However, in the midst of all losses, Christo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artwork reminds us of the value in intimate companionship that only human interactions can foster. The truth is that we are connected to each other through millions of threads: nature, technology, politics, economy, love. Among those threads, Christo built new ones\u2026To say that these saffron walkways embody the impalpable connections between people might be bizarre. However, the sensation of walking on the Floating Piers, I imagine, realizes the intangibility of human intimacy with the tenderness of the fabric\u00e2\u0080\u0099s texture as it extends across the distant islands that are now so close to one another.Runners-UpHonorable MentionsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Falling Behind the Joneses Fueled the Rise of Trump", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byA house may be large or small; as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small, it satisfies all social requirement for a residence. But let there arise next to the little house a palace, and the little house shrinks to a hut.In it, you are asked to choose between living in a 4,000-square-foot house where all the neighbors have 6,000-square-foot homes or living in a 3,000-square-foot house where all the others are 2,000 square feet.The most common choice, Frank reported, was the 3,000-square-foot house. Even though a 4,000-square-foot house has more room in absolute terms, the 3,000-square-foot house has more relative value compared with its neighbors.Housing is a positional good: we get additional satisfaction from a larger house not only because a larger house is better in absolute terms, but also because a larger house is better is relative terms. That is, we get additional satisfaction from having more house than the Joneses next door. Trouble is, the Joneses are no different, and when they too work harder to fund their own bigger house, our relative satisfaction gain disappears. We are now merely keeping up with the Joneses.Their wages have stagnated or declined; the ascendance of minorities has threatened their cultural dominance; and the growth of an increasingly large and affluent upper middle class has pushed goods and services once viewed as theirs by right beyond their reach.As Frank explained in Vox last year:The median new house in the U.S. is now 50 percent larger than it was in 1980, even though the median income has grown only slightly in real terms. Houses are growing faster than incomes because of a process I call \u201cexpenditure cascades.\u201dIn an email exchange with me, Frank observed thatFor those who are not absolutely poor, the central economic question is, \u201cDo we have enough income to achieve our goals?\u201d The answer depends to a significant extent on the spending of other families in the community. Most families want to send their children to good schools, for example, but a family\u2019s ability to achieve that goal depends on how much other families are spending on housing. That\u2019s because school quality is an inescapably relative concept.The problems of positional status and relative deprivation are fueled by income inequality, Frank argues:A family at the median income level would reasonably aspire to send its children to schools of at least average quality. But to do that, it would have to buy or rent a house near the median of its city\u2019s housing price distribution. And that\u2019s become significantly harder to do.In effect, the increase in the resources commandeered by the overclass has pulled the rug out from under the once upwardly mobile white working class.Housing is a key example of the rising cost of positional goods, but there are many others. \u201cMost families reasonably aspire to host a reception for their daughter\u2019s wedding that guests would remember as special,\u201d Frank writes in the Vox piece, but \u201cthe inflation-adjusted cost of the average wedding in the U.S. was $31,000 in 2015, up from about $10,000 in 1980.\u201dCrucially important is the fact that rising inequality constitutes a double whammy. It raises the cost of sought-after goods and it increases the economic gap between the working class and the affluent, spurring nostalgia for what was (even if what was really wasn\u2019t).Growing income inequality in the U.S. has meant that as those at the top are able bid up the price of valued goods like housing and access to good schools, those in lower groups have struggled to maintain their positions.Manhood is an uncertain, tenuous status and one that is easily threatened; thus, men will often take compensatory measures to restore or affirm manhood. In this case, manhood can be affirmed symbolically through one\u2019s vote or show of support to a candidate who embodies manhood.For working class whites, Vandello wrote, the loss of their privileged status and loss of manufacturing jobs go to thecore of what it means to be a man in our culture \u2014 being the protector and provider.highlighting group differences, cultures, etc. has contributed to Trump\u2019s appeal, especially given that white men are often blamed for being oppressive or the source of many of the issues being protested.The result in the white working class, Geary argues, is to sharpen the us-versus-them character of politics.You cannot consistently have different groups arguing for equality, protesting etc. without creating an in-group, out-group mentality \u2014 an evolved bias that is easily invoked \u2014 within the U.S.Many of Trump\u2019s supporters have been left behind, marginalized by the economic, cultural and demographic transformations brought about by globalization. Trump likes to assure these beleaguered voters that he will restore their vanished status, but the reality is that his chaotic appropriation of right-wing populism \u2014 its threats and its promises \u2014 is fraudulent, as bereft of value as his bankrupt casinos.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrants and Smugglers Won\u2019t Be Stopped by Donald Trump\u2019s Wall, Ranchers Say", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "This LandRanchers near the Mexican border see smugglers and sometimes find bodies, but they favor a different approach to illegal immigration from Donald J. Trump\u2019s wall.Supported byNACO, Ariz. \u2014 John Ladd has two old pickups he uses to bang around his ranch, which rambles for 10 miles beside the Mexico line. One\u2019s a red Chevy that not long ago carried the body of yet another border crosser who had died on his property. The other is a blue Dodge with better shocks, and that\u2019s what he is driving now, along an unpaved road in an unincorporated place called Naco.To his immediate right, cattle roam the mesquite and grass of his family\u2019s 16,000-acre ranch. To his left, a mix-and-match set of interlocking fences slices into the distance, this one 12 feet high, this one 18 feet high, this one a metal mesh, this one a vertical grille, section after section after section.Mr. Ladd, 61, looks and acts the way a rancher is expected to, with brush mustache, hard squint and matter-of-fact affect, all kept tight under a sweat-stained cowboy hat. Bouncing westward, he points to spots where fencing had been peeled in the past like an upturned can of Spam. In the last four years, he says, more than 50 vehicles have rumbled through fence cuts and across his property.What is the protocol when you encounter armed drug smugglers driving on your land? \u201cYou pull over and say, \u2018Adi\u00f3s,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ladd says. \u201cYou don\u2019t get in their way, because they\u2019ll kill you.\u201dHere is one aspect of everyday life along the southern border, where national demarcations are blurred by the supply and demand for what the United States continues to crave: drugs and cheap labor. The attendant casualties include human rights, property rights, civil discourse and the security of sovereignty.The answer heard time and again from Mr. Ladd and others along the border is a weary no. \u201cThe wall?\u201d says Larry Dietrich, a local rancher. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s silly.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Mr. Ladd says.Ed Ashurst, 65, an outspoken rancher who manages land about 20 miles from the border, is more assertive, but he needs to address something else first. \u201cI\u2019ll be straight up with you,\u201d he says with a scowl. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton gets elected, I\u2019m moving to Australia.\u201dTime will tell whether the Arizona rancher is forced to blend into the Outback, but his assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is just as succinct. \u201cTo say you\u2019re going to build a wall from Brownsville to San Diego?\u201d he says. \u201cThat is the most idiotic thing I\u2019ve ever heard. And it\u2019s not going to change anything.\u201dThe solution favored among ranchers is infused with a fatalism that nothing will change \u2014 government being government, and the cartels always one step ahead \u2014 so why bother. But here it goes:Intensive, round-the-clock patrols along the border are required for a fence or wall to work; otherwise, those determined to cross will always find a way. But, they argue, if you have boots on the ground, you will have no need for anything so beautiful as the Great Wall of Trump.It is easy, from a distance, to dismiss the ranchers along the border as right-wing Chicken Littles whose complaints hint of racism. Too easy, in fact.Ranchers will say they saw people with backpacks trekking across their property last week, last night, early this morning. Some will say they have grudging agreements of access with drug cartels, as long as trespassers stay far from their homes. Dogs bark, motion lights flicker, things go missing.The unnerving has become everyday life, Mr. Ashurst says, and then he asks my colleague and me where we live. Metropolitan New York, we answer.Nice, Mr. Ashurst says, still scowling. \u201cBut how would you like it?\u201d he asks, referring to the ebb-and-flow parade of strangers, some armed, past his door. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re more important than the poor moron who has the misfortune to live along the border?\u201dTrue, the overall number of migrants has plummeted in the last 15 years or so. Here, in what the Border Patrol categorizes as the Tucson sector \u2014 about 90,000 square miles, with 262 miles of border \u2014 there were 63,397 arrests in the 2015 fiscal year, compared with 10 times that in the 2001 fiscal year.Paul Beeson, the patrol\u2019s chief agent for the Tucson sector, attributes the drop to an increase in officers and tactical equipment, an improvement in the Mexican economy, and the fencing erected along the border about a decade ago.But Mr. Ladd and other ranchers say there has been an unsettling swap: fewer migrants, but many more drug traffickers.Mr. Beeson acknowledges the change in demographics, and the challenge in facing an adversary with comparable intelligence and surveillance abilities. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to move their product today,\u201d he says of the cartels. \u201cThey can move it tomorrow. They can sit and watch, and they do that. Watching us. Watching us watching them.\u201dBut he says the Border Patrol continues to bolster its \u201ctactical infrastructure\u201d \u2014 higher resolution cameras, for example, and an increased use of drones. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable to us that folks along the border should be experiencing this type of activity,\u201d Mr. Beeson says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can.\u201dBut, really, what is a Glock going to do?About 100 miles northeast of Naco, in a New Mexico dot called Animas, a few people gathered recently to sip iced tea and discuss where things stand. The Elbrocks \u2014 Tricia and Ed \u2014 set the tone by recalling how drug smugglers kidnapped one of their ranch hands a few months ago.According to the Elbrocks, the smugglers threatened to kill his family, loaded his pickup with packs of marijuana and drove him and the drugs 75 miles to the Arizona town of Willcox. Then they tied him up and abandoned him and the truck the next morning.A spokesman for the F.B.I. in Albuquerque said the kidnapping remained under investigation. As for the ranch hand, Ms. Elbrock said, \u201cHe\u2019s in counseling.\u201dBack in Naco, Mr. Ladd continues his dirt-swirling ride between Mexico and his ranch, along a 60-foot road called the Roosevelt Easement. His family has been in Naco for more than a century \u2014 before there was a Naco, in fact. Some say the name comes from combining the last two letters of Arizona and Mexico, but Mr. Ladd isn\u2019t so sure.Naco is a drowsy dog of a place that seems not to have benefited much from being a sanctioned port of entry to Mexico. Adding to the stillness is a collection of abandoned barracks, built a century ago for American troops who chased after the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa after he attacked the New Mexico town of Columbus.They never caught him.Mr. Ladd says his family has sponsored three Mexicans for citizenship \u2014 but has seen more border sorrow than joy. Over the years, he says, the bodies of 14 people trying to get someplace else have been found on Ladd property. The last was in September. A party of six got caught in flooding; five were rescued, and the body of the sixth was found several days later.Mr. Ladd waited for the authorities, but it was getting dark. So he moved the man\u2019s body in his red pickup to Route 92, where a funeral home took custody. He recalls the event in that same measured way that underscores how common the uncommon is along the border.Rumbling west along the rutted road, Mr. Ladd points to his left and, referring to the cartels, says, \u201cThis is where they cut the wall down to drive trucks through.\u201dHe is like an art museum denizen who has memorized the history of the permanent exhibits, commenting on the changing fence designs as he drives, noting the insignia of the military units who installed some of them on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security.The truck stops suddenly. \u201cWell lookee there,\u201d Mr. Ladd says, pointing to his right. \u201cI got a cut fence.\u201d Snipped again, and Lord knows how many times his cows have wandered off as a result.The rancher slips white work gloves over his rough hands and reaches for a ball of blue hay-baling string. Soon he is stitching together what has been broken, as gunmetal rain clouds move east from the Huachuca Mountains and the wind whistles through the mesh divide.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May\u2019s British Cabinet Has New Faces but Old Divides", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byBut her moves to put her mark on the government also highlighted how the referendum on Britain\u2019s relationship with the Continent, intended to settle a long-simmering battle within the Conservative Party, left the party still split over how to go about decoupling from Europe.On Thursday, Ms. May jettisoned one of the nation\u2019s most divisive politicians, Michael Gove, who had been the justice minister. Mr. Gove had worked closely with Mr. Johnson in managing the Leave campaign, but then maneuvered Mr. Johnson out of the race to become prime minister, only to see his own effort to secure the job fall short.Even before Mr. Gove was fired, fault lines were emerging over how to carry out \u201cBrexit,\u201d the British exit from the European Union. On Thursday, the new chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who is responsible for economic policy, stressed the importance of securing access to the European Union\u2019s single market for Britain\u2019s financial services sector and maintaining London\u2019s place as a global financial capital. He suggested that the country move quickly to forge a new relationship with Europe to reduce the uncertainty hanging over the economy.Yet, partly to shield herself from the right of her party, Ms. May has put some of those most committed to British withdrawal in charge of negotiating Brexit, politicians whose previous statements suggest that they plan to play hardball, which may put back the prospects of a deal with Europe.\u201cTheresa May needed to bring some Brexiteers into the government in order to protect herself and to counter the charge that she is a closet remainer,\u201d said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research institute, noting that she had argued to stay inside the European Union, albeit rather tepidly.\u201cBut the risk is that this prolongs the very high degree of uncertainty over the British economy, that we see relations deteriorating with other countries, and that this militates against negotiating a deal,\u201d he added.While Ms. May promises to deliver Brexit, she speaks with more passion about her domestic agenda. On the steps of 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, she said that she would lead a battle against \u201cburning injustice\u201d and help create opportunities for all, not just a \u201cprivileged few.\u201dShe wasted no time in dispensing with the services of George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer and the architect of public spending curbs, and appointing new faces to domestic ministries: Amber Rudd at the Home Office, and Justine Greening at the Department of Education.However, Mr. Osborne\u2019s replacement, Mr. Hammond, who must find the money for any new social spending programs, \u201chas a reputation as a fiscal hawk, which potentially conflicts with May\u2019s pledge to ease up on the pace of austerity,\u201d said Kallum Pickering, the chief economist for the United Kingdom at Berenberg, an investment bank.Mr. Hammond on Thursday highlighted the importance of resolving Britain\u2019s new relationships with the European Union, telling the BBC that \u201cif there is one thing that is damaging our economy today \u2014 right now \u2014 it is uncertainty for businesses.\u201dMr. Hammond made a special plea on behalf of London\u2019s financial services sector, a prominent part of the country\u2019s economy and a huge generator of tax revenues that finance social spending.\u201cWe have to make sure that in our negotiations with the E.U. we have very clearly in our minds the need to ensure access to the European Union single market for our financial services,\u201d he added.The French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, urged Britain to quickly begin the process to leave the European Union, saying, \u201cWe cannot let this ambiguous and murky situation last, in the interest of the British themselves, I would even say.\u201dBut that may not be the priority of David Davis, a veteran lawmaker and former Europe minister, who will head up a new ministry responsible for Brexit, or of Liam Fox, who will be in charge of negotiating international trade deals.\u201cOnce the European nations realize that we are not going to budge on control of our borders, they will want to talk, in their own interest,\u201d he said.Yet European leaders have made clear that they do not intend to give way to Britain\u2019s demand that it get unimpeded trading rights with the Continent without adhering to the bloc\u2019s immigration rules, which require member countries to let European Union citizens live and work where they wish. That open-borders policy, as much as any other factor, drove British sentiment against the bloc.As a result, the uncertainty could drag on for some time if Ms. May\u2019s negotiators are not willing to reach a compromise on immigration, potentially hurting the economy and giving other nations time to poach British business, not least from among banks and investment firms that are now considering moving some operations away from London.Mr. Tilford argues that the main pro-Brexit campaigners are ill equipped to negotiate, saying that they lack understanding of how the European Union works, what trade-offs are required and, therefore, of what deals are possible.He pointed to some of Mr. Davis\u2019s Twitter posts that called for \u201ca UK-German deal\u201d allowing access to Britain for German cars and other goods in exchange for a deal on British exports, and claimed that \u201csimilar deals would be reached with other key EU nations.\u201dIn fact, the European Union reaches trade agreements as a bloc, rather than on a country-by-country basis, so Germany would not even negotiate directly with Britain.But Mr. Tilford said that there might be \u201cmethod in the madness\u201d of Ms. May\u2019s central pro-Brexit cabinet appointments.\u201cThey are going to be confronted by the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be possible for them to continue to claim that you can have your cake and eat it. They are going to be negotiating with other countries, and they will no longer be able to rely on bluster and obfuscation.\u201dMr. Tilford said that if ideological supporters of Brexit failed or were discredited, that would force a reality check on their supporters, leading to a more flexible negotiating stance.Even under this scenario there is a hitch, however: the economy. \u201cIn the short to medium term, things can get a lot worse,\u201d Mr. Tilford said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the reporting credit with this article misspelled the contributor\u2019s given name.

{"Headline": "Price-Fixing Truck Makers Get Record E.U. Fine: $3.2 Billion", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief imposed a record fine of 2.9 billion euros, or $3.2 billion, on a group of truck makers on Tuesday, part of a trend toward steeper penalties for competition violations in the 28-nation bloc.Among the companies cited in the statement for having broken antitrust rules is the truck maker MAN, which is owned by Volkswagen. MAN is not among the companies being fined, however, as it revealed the existence of the cartel.In the statement, the commission said it did not find any links between the cartel and so-called defeat devices installed by Volkswagen in passenger cars.The truck makers being fined are DAF, Daimler, Iveco and Volvo-Renault. Daimler faces the largest single fine, and it must pay slightly more than \u20ac1 billion, also a record.Together, the five companies account for about nine in 10 medium and heavy trucks produced in Europe, the commission said.A sixth company, Scania, was not included in the fines announced on Tuesday as it has not settled.Fines in the region for cartel violations have steadily risen in recent years, largely because financial punishment is the main way for European Union regulators, who unlike their American counterparts cannot jail price-fixers, to enforce their laws. From 1990 to 1994, the bloc imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac540 million. Two decades later, from 2010 to 2014, the commission imposed fines on cartels totaling \u20ac8.7 billion.Even so, the number of American companies in her sights has led some critics to suggest that Ms. Vestager and her predecessors have a bias against competition from the United States. The record-breaking fines imposed against the truck companies \u2014 which are all based in Europe \u2014 could help counter that view.In a separate case on Tuesday, Ms. Vestager\u2019s team opened an investigation into whether French government plans for financially supporting Areva, a beleaguered state-owned maker of equipment for nuclear power plants, are compatible with European Union competition rules.Advertisement"}

Institutions like Brandman University and Empire State College allow students to learn online, in-person or through a mix.

It is how European leaders should feel in the wake of Brexit. As the reality of a British departure from the European Union sinks in, policy makers are being forced to concentrate their minds on some very uncertain and unsettling repercussions.Despite a clear win for the Leave faction, the impact of the Brexit vote is ambiguous both for Britain and for the European Union. It\u2019s not even clear when and how the exit will occur. One can\u2019t help but hum a line from the Eagles: \u201cYou can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.\u201d The Brits have checked out, yet are in no hurry to go. The lasting sentiment from the vote seems remorse, not resolve. Euroskeptical leaders on the Continent may be quick to claim that history has changed course, but recent opinion polls and the outcome of Spain\u2019s parliamentary elections suggest that Brexit frightens rather than inspires, and it is the pro-European mainstream rather than the anti-Europe extreme that may benefit from the current maelstrom.What is worrying in a post-Brexit Europe is not only the state of emotions, but the state of the argument. The debate is in some ways a clash of two nostalgias, between two camps that want nothing more than to hop into a time machine. Sovereignists, represented by populist parties in the West and several of the governments of the East, pine for the late 19th or early 20th centuries, the golden age of the nation state (if ever such a golden time really existed for small European nations), when governments guarded their borders, managed their economies and enforced social cohesion.In contrast, federalists, centered in the employment rolls of the expansive European institutions, dream of a United States of Europe and fantasize about returning to the 1990s, before the euro, before eastward expansion, when the European Union was smaller, smarter, more prosperous and decidedly Western \u2014 and hardly anyone challenged the vision of an \u201cever closer Union.\u201dBut if time machines make good literature, they usually produce poor politics. Brexit scarcely brings Britain back to the time of the classical nation state; rather, it threatens the very disintegration of the nation state itself. If Scotland decides to leave Britain, the Leave campaign can pride itself not only for the unraveling of Europe but for the undoing of Britain as well. With the collapse of a British party system in which both major parties experience leadership and identity crises at the hands of a right-wing populist insurgency, it\u2019s easy to wonder whether the same thing could happen across the Continent: If the union disintegrates, liberal democracy itself may soon follow.It\u2019s also easy to overestimate the thickness of Brexit\u2019s silver lining. Yes, opinion polls hint at a renewed pro-European sentiment on the Continent, but a belief that Brexit signals a \u201cfederalist moment\u201d is delusional. In practice, that moment means a consolidation of power in the west while the east and south stay politically isolated and tranquil \u2014 or that the illiberal turn in places like Poland and Hungary can be contained.Such a view is demeaning \u2014 Central European societies as a whole remain the most pro-European \u2014 and an easy way to forget that the rise of populism is not just a Central European phenomenon. In fact, the dream of \u201ctwo Europes\u201d could lead to no Europe at all. In the context of widespread resentment against concentrating additional powers in the European Commission, recycling the federalist dream of the 1980s and early 1990s could provoke a backlash powerful enough to destroy the Union. It is important to remember that elites are out of sync almost everywhere across the Continent. Nine out of 10 economists and nine out of 10 celebrities campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, but a majority of the voters opted for Leave.More Europe can only mean less Brussels. The fact that Europe\u2019s oldest democracy voted to leave the union to secure its self-governance makes it particularly dangerous for a mistrusted political establishment to push for a federalist solution. More complicating, populist parties are part of the governing coalitions in a third of the union\u2019s member states. Clearly, populist parties on the far left and far right are not simply protest parties that will vanish in the next electoral cycle. They don\u2019t represent a mood; they manifest a trend, so the hope that the European Union can be saved by recycling old cherished ideas from Brussels is a dangerous illusion.This is particularly important to bear in mind when 34 union-related referendums are being introduced in 18 member states. The insistence that the future of the European Union should be decided by referendums and not in parliaments is what unites populists of both extremes. In their view the electorate is a sovereign whose vocabulary is limited to two words: yes and no.Rumor has it that after the fall of the Berlin Wall the esteemed British diplomat Robert Cooper, then head of the Foreign Office\u2019s policy planning department, developed a special stamp: \u201cOBE \u2014 Overtaken By Events.\u201d Cooper asked his colleagues to go through existing files and to stamp OBE wherever appropriate.European leaders should take inspiration from Mr. Cooper and stamp OBE not only on the aspiration for some 19th-century-styled sovereign, liberal nation state, but also on any fantasy of 1980s-style federalism. The future of Europe cannot be found in the past \u2014 and European leaders need to start writing that future today.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Trump, Business Leaders Are More Elites to Resist", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byCommon Sense\u201cThere\u2019s a great sense of frustration here,\u201d John Engler, the group\u2019s president and a former Republican governor of Michigan, told me this week. \u201cWe\u2019re now faced with two candidates who, when it comes to the United States economy, have diametrically opposite viewpoints from us. It\u2019s cause for great concern.\u201dThat a Democratic candidate might diverge from the group\u2019s pro-business agenda is no surprise, but Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of economic policies that are anathema to its members is seen as a betrayal of bedrock Republican principles.\u201cWe\u2019re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration,\u201d Mr. Engler said. \u201cEverything has been upended.\u201dIf anything, Mrs. Clinton seems more closely aligned with the business group than Mr. Trump. Although she now opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal she supported as secretary of state, \u201cFundamentally, she and her husband come from a free trade perspective,\u201d said Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe in her heart of hearts she\u2019s opposed to free trade. And in general, she\u2019s more aligned with mainstream economic thought.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that Trump doesn\u2019t know many of our members and they don\u2019t know him,\u201d Mr. Engler said. \u201cRomney knew almost everyone.\u201dMr. Trump and his campaign staff did not respond to requests for comment.Although not going quite as far as Mr. Trump in repudiating existing free trade deals, the Republican Party largely embraced his protectionist philosophy this week, declaring in its draft party platform that all trade deals should \u201cput America first.\u201d In sharp contrast, the Business Roundtable says on its website, \u201cOpen markets for international trade and investment are essential for supporting U.S. economic growth and jobs.\u201dThe business group\u2019s support for free trade has widespread bipartisan support among economists. Mr. Trump\u2019s positions \u201cshow a complete lack of understanding of international trade,\u201d said Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton, a former economics adviser to President Clinton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cThrowing up barriers doesn\u2019t work. It will raise the exchange rate, which will hurt exports and push the deficit up. Barriers may help a favored few, but at the expense of everyone else.\u201dProfessor Mankiw agreed. \u201cThere are few things economists are unanimous about, but support of free trade comes pretty close. There are good reasons for international specialization, and by and large Americans have benefited tremendously. Do we really want to produce T-shirts here and pay $60 for something that now costs $15?\u201dHe acknowledged, \u201cTechnological progress has displaced many manufacturing jobs. That raises productivity, which is the main driver of a better standard of living. But economic change is rarely good for everyone. In the short term, workers lose their jobs, and that\u2019s hard. There are winners and losers, and Trump is tapping into the losers.\u201d\u201cIt makes no sense to bring the best students to our graduate schools and then force them to go home,\u201d Mr. Engler added. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that with athletes. We get the best in the world. We should be doing that for engineers.\u201d\u201cThe xenophobia of Trump supporters isn\u2019t really economic,\u201d Professor Mankiw said. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural. They don\u2019t want people here speaking foreign languages.\u201dAlthough no one, including the Roundtable, supports illegal immigration, many economists fear the potential economic disruption of deporting millions of people. \u201cWhere are you going to find the millions of workers to replace these people?\u201d Professor Blinder asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s without even touching on the humanitarian aspects.\u201dProbably no issue has more closely united business interests and Republicans over the years than tax policy, although even most Democrats and the Obama administration agree that it is in urgent need of change.The Roundtable says \u201cAmerica needs a modern tax system. Key components of business tax reform include: setting the corporate tax rate at 25 percent; adopting a modern international tax system; and making U.S. tax policy permanent.\u201dMr. Trump goes further: He would lower the corporate tax rate (now 35 percent, the highest in the developed world) to a flat 15 percent while cutting corporate loopholes.\u201cWe proposed 25 percent because we felt we had to suggest something fiscally sustainable,\u201d Mr. Engler said. \u201cWe thought we made a reasonable proposal that could thread a bipartisan needle. You can get to 25 percent without blowing a hole in the budget.\u201dMr. Trump will no doubt get an earful if he accepts the business group\u2019s pending invitation to meet in an off-the-record session in September. (The group has invited Mrs. Clinton as well.) Neither candidate has accepted, but both have said that they are interested, according to Mr. Engler.Indeed, Mr. Trump could have had Roundtable members in mind when he lumped together \u201cpowerful corporations, media elites and political dynasties\u201d as \u201cthe people who rigged the system,\u201d as he put it in a speech this month.\u201cI want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who\u2019ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another,\u201d he told cheering supporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Payday Options for Making Ends Meet", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byFor decades, most American companies have paid their workers once every week or two, minimizing the administrative costs of frequent paydays and maximizing the interest the companies earn by keeping the money in the bank.And for equally long, workers have complained about the unfairness of waiting for their paychecks.But now, thanks in part to the gig economy, a small but growing number of employers and start-ups are testing ways to give employees faster access to their wages. A variety of options \u2014 some involving payroll cards, and others using A.T.M.s and other methods \u2014 have recently hit the market, permitting people to take home their pay as soon as they have earned it.On one hand, this could be good news for people who live from paycheck to paycheck. If the trend catches on, it could reduce the demand for products like payday loans, which workers use when they run short of money, but which charge very high interest rates. On the other hand, the services that are providing on-demand wages charge fees every time a worker uses them, so there is a trade-off.From the employer\u2019s perspective, instant payment for a day\u2019s work has the potential to motivate employees to work longer hours \u2014 after all, instant financial gratification is a powerful productivity incentive.But gig services are a niche part of the job market. Fast cash has long been a perk for waiters, bartenders and other tipped workers. Most Americans draw their paychecks from companies with more rigid financial systems. In that market, there has been little incentive for change \u2014 until recently.Michael Fox, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he was initially skeptical but became a convert when he saw what a big difference the option made for some workers.\u201cWhen you have people living on the edge, very small things can cause a rapid acceleration into very bad conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just $60 or $90 short, and can\u2019t make a rent payment or buy medicine, it spirals. One little thing creates a huge disaster.\u201dPayActiv\u2019s founder, Safwan Shah, talks with a missionary zeal about the potential impact. \u201cThe biggest bank in this country is the bank of the employer, and two to three weeks of salary for most people is stuck there,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a corporate responsibility issue.\u201dGetting employers to view it that way, though, is an extremely hard sell. Frank Dombroski knows. He has been making the pitch for five years and is only just starting to see signs of momentum.\u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a struggle, but we kind of knew that going in,\u201d he said.He thinks the tide is starting to turn. A new partnership with ADP, a big provider of payroll services, has helped FlexWage get on the radar of bigger businesses. The company says it is finalizing deals with two employers that would double the 8,000 people currently using its system.\u201cThere\u2019s been so much attention to the high cost of short-term lending, like bank overdraft fees and payday loans, that employers understand a lot more clearly now the dire need,\u201d Mr. Dombroski said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them that there\u2019s a problem any longer. Now we need to convince them there\u2019s a solution.\u201dLike almost all fast-cash borrowing options, the services have fees that can be steeper than alternatives like credit cards. Activehours has a hippie-ish \u201cpay what you think it\u2019s worth\u201d fee structure, but FlexWage and PayActiv charge rates that typically cost $3 to $5 per transaction. A worker who pays $3 to withdraw $100 a week before payday is effectively paying an annual percentage rate of 156 percent for the money.But those costs still tend to be lower than those of bank overdrafts, payday loans and other emergency lending sources. Eric Zsadanyi, a forklift driver at Goodwill, has been using PayActiv advances almost monthly to pay his rent, which consumes more than one of his biweekly paychecks. He is usually only $50 or $100 short, but if his rent isn\u2019t on time, he owes a $50 late fee.Mr. Zsadanyi keeps his withdrawals low so that his next check won\u2019t shrink more than he can afford. Knowing that in a bind he can get cash for rent or groceries is a relief, he said.Factories, hospitals, call centers and other employers with large numbers of variable-hour employees have been among the most receptive to the idea, according to executives at PayActiv and FlexWage. Especially in industries with thin margins, companies are willing to consider new ways to relieve financial strains on their employees \u2014 without actually paying them more money.Still, the biweekly payday is a ritual most companies don\u2019t want to disturb. The regularity with which clients of Paychex, one of the nation\u2019s largest payroll processors, pay their workers \u2014 weekly, biweekly or on some other cycle \u2014 has not shifted by more than 1 percent over the last eight years. Martin Mucci, the company\u2019s chief executive, is skeptical that faster access to wages will ever move beyond the gig economy.\u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re seeing a large demand for among employees who have a more traditional work relationship with their employer,\u201d Mr. Mucci said.\u201cAs the economy has gotten faster and people\u2019s lives have become more tenuous, the speed at which people get paid starts to matter lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a flash-in-the-pan thing. A year or two in, these are products that have significant user engagement, and they\u2019re growing very quickly.\u201dFor workers, choosing between speed and delayed gratification can be a balancing act.Amanda Brannon, a single mother of four in Warner Robins, Ga., said that same-day pay was a major incentive for her to moonlight for Uber. If she needs to supplement her grocery or gas budget, she hops in her car and starts driving. A recent 12-hour Saturday shift netted her $220, which she cashed out immediately.But in her day job, as a legal secretary, she is happy to stick with a traditional lump-sum check.\u201cIt makes it easier to pay for the big stuff,\u201d Ms. Brannon said. \u201cUber is perfect for daily cash, but getting paid every two weeks is good, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary, This Is Why Democrats Are Still Struggling", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Dear Hillary,Donald Trump has presented you with an amazing opportunity to become a world historical figure! If you crush him in this election, you could create a new Democratic majority and reduce the G.O.P. to an ever-declining rump of ethnic nationalism. On the other hand, if you fail to beat Trump, you will go down as America\u2019s most hapless political loser and be vilified forever for enabling an era of American Putinism.No pressure! Have fun in Philadelphia!To end up on the right side of this equation you\u2019re probably going to have to resist three natural tendencies, two of them your party\u2019s and one your own.First, you\u2019re going to have to fight your party\u2019s materialistic mind-set.This is 2016, not 1992. Over the past few years, economic and social anxiety has metastasized into something spiritual and existential.Americans are no longer confident in their national project. They no longer trust their institutions or have faith in their common destiny. This is a crisis of national purpose. It\u2019s about personal identity and the basic health of communal life. Americans\u2019 anger and pessimism are more fundamental than anything that can be explained by G.D.P. statistics.Many Democrats have trouble thinking in these terms. When asked to explain any complex phenomenon, they instinctively reduce it to a materialist cause. If there\u2019s terrorism there must be lack of economic opportunity. If marriage is declining it must be because of joblessness.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.This materialistic mind-set means that many Democrats are perpetually surprised by events that involve cultural threats and national identity. Why don\u2019t working-class Kansans vote for us? We offer them more programs. Why did the Brits leave the E.U.? It\u2019s against their economic interest.The mind-set is also reductionist. There\u2019s a tendency to break national problems into small, interest-group-size chunks and then deliver pandering policy promises.If Democrats wage that kind of niche-targeted campaign this year they will lose. Voters are worried that the whole society is falling apart. If Democrats think a crisis of national identity can be addressed with targeted tax credits they are living in a different century.To stand a chance, Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re probably going to have to talk as adeptly about threats to personal dignity as you do about day care. You\u2019re probably going to have to talk bluntly about the American civic religion. You\u2019re going to have to show you understand the way members of your class have slighted people who are less educated and less cosmopolitan.Of course, this is general election suicide. If you want a perfect way to turn off suburban service economy office park workers who will decide this election, then the Bernie Sanders route is it! The economic nostalgia of the left is as futile as the demographic nostalgia of the right.Somehow you\u2019re going to have to come up with an updated muscular Clintonism. For 30 years your name has stood for a Democratic governing style that is internationalist in foreign affairs, socially moderate and pro-global integration (while softening its edges). That open, optimistic approach has to be combined with a more aggressive and radical effort to help people compete in the new economy.Third, you\u2019re going to have to answer hatred with love. Your tendency so far in your career has been to answer hostility with distrust, and secretiveness.You\u2019ve ended up projecting coldness but also weakness and hurt. People who build emotional walls amid conflict do so out of fear, not strength.Along the way you\u2019ve made yourself phenomenally unpopular. The polls show that you are now just as distrusted by the American people as Donald Trump is.The confident move is to break out of the emotional bunker with vulnerability. The sign of strength is to answer the \u201cLock Her Up\u201d enmity with a confident honest account of what it feels like to be you \u2014 embroiled in the political combat, encased in this global celebrity role, but maintaining authenticity in a world that conspires against it.Imagine if you displayed honest self-appraisal and even moments of remorse. You\u2019d have the world rooting for you, not against you.This convention is about resetting relationships: establishing trust between you and voters, restoring optimism that we can thrive in the modern economy, redefining a soul satisfying faith in the American project.Advertisement"}

But when the lights went out, Miss Universe might just as well be the poor, sooty little match girl if she couldn\u2019t make him shout hallelujah.\u201dSo Helen Gurley Brown became an expert in the sack. She might have been dogged by insecurities her whole life, always feeling insufficiently attractive. But she was also uncommonly intrepid for her generation, willing to talk dirty and dress slinky and master the hydraulics of oral sex.Once you understand how liberating her youthful insight was \u2014 sex can be weaponized! \u2014 you understand the man-pleasing evangelism of Cosmopolitan magazine, over which Brown presided for 32 years. She was simply encouraging millions of ordinary-looking \u201cmouseburger\u201d women like herself to go to war with the army they had, not the army they wish they had.This attitude has clear advantages. It frees Ms. Hirshey to do a compassionate, psychologically complex biography, arguing the world from her subject\u2019s point of view. Brown, who could run the risk of appearing like a caricature, never once does so here.We see her big-game man-hunting in the context of her poor background, spent mainly in Arkansas, and of her family\u2019s continuing financial problems. \u201cMarrying for love was not an option,\u201d Ms. Hirshey writes. \u201cThere were too many mouths to feed and doctors to pay.\u201d (At 37, Brown managed to find both love and security in the Hollywood producer David Brown.) We see the daffy, often shameless advice she gave in \u201cSex and the Single Girl\u201d \u2014 to steal from petty cash at the office, to make your \u201cbeau\u201d replace the booze he drinks in your sexy home \u2014 in that same context.\u201cShe was addressing her own, still-struggling underclass,\u201d Ms. Hirshey writes.Most poignantly, we see her anorexia, exercise mania and macabre plastic surgeries \u2014 heck, her entire professional drive \u2014 in the context of her mother\u2019s unforgiving gaze: Cleo Gurley made it clear that she never thought her daughter was beautiful. She was far too obsessed with her daughter\u2019s volcanic acne. \u201cMy shrink says I\u2019m doing this for my mother,\u201d an 80-year-old Brown told the playwright Eve Ensler of the latest fat injection into her cheeks. She was speaking between situps.Strangely, the moment Brown becomes editor of Cosmo, \u201cNot Pretty Enough\u201d becomes less involving. The book often slides into a media history, with stories about Cosmo\u2019s soaring ad sales and expanding international editions, its models and stylists, its star turn as a mock issue of The Harvard Lampoon. Brown, who once billowed with life, now deflates on the page.This would have been the time to report in greater depth on her relationship with her feminist contemporaries. Ms. Hirshey needn\u2019t have weighed in on the political merits of their respective positions; she need only have included a few reaction shots from Brown to her critics\u2019 insults. Betty Friedan called Cosmo \u201cquite obscene and horrible.\u201d How did Brown, so sensitive to snubs and slights, feel about that?Ms. Hirshey\u2019s meticulous re-creation of Brown\u2019s single-girl years in Los Angeles, where she went through 19 secretarial jobs and juggled boyfriends like plates, are alone worth the price of admission to this circus. She cavorted with big-time generals, she revenge-dated a Getty. She also tolerated an extraordinarily high level of sexism in the workplace. You can see how Matthew Weiner drew on \u201cSex and the Single Girl\u201d for \u201cMad Men.\u201dBut in one of her final secretarial jobs, at the advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding, Brown finally got her big break: Her boss\u2019s wife noticed that Brown\u2019s \u201cWhile You Were Away\u201d memos were written with unusual \u00e9lan, and suggested that maybe she ought to write for a living.So it came to pass. Her boss made her a copywriter. All because of her scribblings on little pink pieces of paper. Brown always had a flair for small economies.Thus began one of her greatest and most enduring love affairs \u2014 with the office itself. \u201cBusiness I could rely on,\u201d she told a friend. \u201cIt never went away and left you.\u201dNot Pretty EnoughThe Unlikely Triumph of Helen Gurley BrownBy Gerri HirsheyIllustrated. 500 pages.

{"Headline": "Taking Down Politicians for Decades, and Rising in India\u2019s Government", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileMUMBAI, India \u2014 He does not act the part. At 76, Subramanian Swamy has a youthful demeanor, is frequently cheeky but is almost always composed. Yet he is arguably the most vicious infighter in Indian politics, where he has spent a career of more than 40 years taking down ministers and governments. Lately, he has been on a roll.Next he set his sights on the chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry.Then he made a veiled attack on the finance minister for wearing a business suit on a trip to China instead of traditional Indian garb, saying he looked like a waiter.In the process, Mr. Swamy, an economist, has become the subject of intense controversy, an unapologetic Hindu nationalist whose antics are increasingly threatening the stability of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now, the question is whether Mr. Modi will be able to keep him on a tight enough leash to prevent him from cannibalizing his government.Before his latest forays, he was \u201cthe chief wrecker\u201d of the government in 1999, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, causing its fall after 13 months, said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a close adviser to Mr. Vajpayee.\u201cThey\u2019ll face the worst consequences\u201d from tolerating him, Mr. Kulkarni said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great spoiler.\u201dNot only has Mr. Modi tolerated Mr. Swamy, he has actively promoted him, rescuing him from the political wilderness by elevating him to a seat in the upper house of Parliament. The reason, political observers say, is Mr. Swamy\u2019s value as one of India\u2019s most effective fighters against the country\u2019s endemic corruption, something that Mr. Modi has made a centerpiece of his plans to modernize and invigorate India\u2019s economy.\u201cIf Modi is going to live up to his promise to clean up government, he needs Swamy,\u201d said Madhav Das Nalapat, a former editor of The Times of India and a friend of Mr. Swamy\u2019s.In an interview in his New Delhi office, where one wall is covered with pictures of himself with Indian leaders of recent decades, Mr. Swamy declared his latest attacks had the support of \u201csenior colleagues in the party\u201d and were made only after they \u201ctold me, \u2018You are absolutely right.\u2019 \u201dThe son of a government bureaucrat, Mr. Swamy was raised in New Delhi but left in 1962 to pursue a doctorate in economics at Harvard, the beginning of a nearly 50-year affiliation with the university, as an associate professor and summer lecturer.In 1969, after obtaining his degree and teaching at Harvard for several years, he returned to India, hoping to build an academic career there. But as an outspoken advocate of free-market economics, he found himself shut out of the intelligentsia, then rabidly leftist.Unable to find a permanent place in India\u2019s top academic institutions, Mr. Swamy was contemplating a return to the United States when he fell in with a Hindu nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cMy critics began saying I was a chauvinist, nationalist, mad nationalist,\u201d Mr. Swamy said, prompting the Hindu nationalist group to begin wondering, \u201c \u2018Who is this guy who is speaking our language and we don\u2019t even know him?\u2019 \u201dThe group offered Mr. Swamy a seat in the upper house of Parliament in 1974. He took it, beginning his career in politics.Over the years, Mr. Swamy has served five terms in Parliament for two different parties that have since become part of Mr. Modi\u2019s governing party. He settled into a routine of spending winters in India and summers teaching at Harvard.Mr. Swamy, in an interview, was unapologetic about the article and restated his theory of Muslims in India being descended from Hindus. He added that he wished the Harvard faculty had at least given him a chance to make his case before canceling his courses.Few who know him say they believe he is really anti-Muslim, suggesting that his comments are aimed at building a support base among Hindu nationalists. \u201cSwamy is a closet secularist,\u201d Mr. Nalapat said. \u201cOtherwise, how do you explain his family?\u201dMr. Swamy\u2019s wife, Roxna, is a member of the Parsi community, which emigrated centuries ago from Iran. One of his sons-in-law is Muslim.Whatever his role in Hindu nationalism, Mr. Swamy has been a force behind some of India\u2019s landmark corruption cases. He petitioned the Supreme Court in 2010 to prosecute the telecommunications minister at the time over his involvement in awarding cellphone spectrum to companies below market rates. That helped fuel the perception of widespread corruption and led to the defeat of India\u2019s longtime governing Congress Party.He also brought a lawsuit against several Congress Party leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, its president, and Rahul Gandhi, her son and the party vice president, accusing them of illegally acquiring a newspaper for its real estate assets and forcing them to show up in a New Delhi courthouse as the accused and post bail.\u201cEveryone thought that nothing could nail the Gandhi family,\u201d said Sanjaya Baru, a onetime spokesman for former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. \u201cSwamy showed it\u2019s possible.\u201dIn April, as the question of whether Raghuram G. Rajan would continue as central bank governor was being debated, Mr. Swamy leapt into the mix. In an open letter to the prime minister, he accused the bank governor of an \u201capparently deliberate attempt to wreck the Indian economy\u201d by refusing to lower interest rates, which would have made it cheaper for small and medium-size companies to get loans.Not content to attack Mr. Rajan on interest rates, a genuine policy choice, Mr. Swamy also questioned his loyalty to his country. Citing the bank governor\u2019s possession of a United States green card, allowing him to work and reside there, Mr. Swamy suggested that Mr. Rajan was \u201cmentally not fully Indian.\u201dMr. Rajan has not publicly commented on his decision to step down, but his parents told the newspaper The Indian Express that their son had been hurt by the attack \u2014 and the government\u2019s failure to rise to his defense.Mr. Swamy is convinced that without his attack, Mr. Rajan \u201cwould have gotten an extension,\u201d because he had supporters and it would have been easy to follow the path of least resistance and allow him to stay in the job.Mr. Rajan\u2019s departure seemed to energize Mr. Swamy, who found a new target in Arvind Subramanian, the Finance Ministry\u2019s chief economic adviser. Dredging up testimony before a United States congressional committee from several years earlier, in which he was critical of India\u2019s policy on intellectual property, Mr. Swamy again raised questions about loyalty and tweeted, \u201cSack him.\u201dLater, as the Indian news media reported increasing unease in the Bharatiya Janata Party about his comments, he protested that he had not been referring to Mr. Jaitley, who looked \u201cvery smart in a coat.\u201dFour days later, Mr. Modi, in a rare interview on Indian television, denounced Mr. Swamy\u2019s attacks as inappropriate and publicity stunts, saying, \u201cthe nation won\u2019t benefit from such behavior.\u201d Too late for Mr. Rajan and his supporters, he rose to the central bank governor\u2019s defense, saying, \u201cI believe Raghuram Rajan\u2019s patriotism is no less than any of ours.\u201dIf Mr. Swamy was chastened, he showed no signs of it. On Twitter, he made fun of Mr. Modi\u2019s interviewer and fired off some new attacks on the Gandhi family.Kaushik Swaminathan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Hillel Moerman, a co-head of Goldman Sachs Private Capital, will join the board of CargoX.The start-up, whose headquarters are in S\u00e3o Paulo, is going after Brazil\u2019s complex trucking industry. CargoX, founded in 2013 by Federico Vega, an Argentine and a former JPMorgan Chase vice president, is using mobile technology to reduce inefficiencies. It says it has now mapped and connected 150,000 truck owner-operators in the country.In Brazil, a majority of freight is transported by trucks, which often run into bottlenecks.Several investors and business groups have cheered Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster, even though questions remain over the legitimacy of the process. Brazil\u2019s benchmark Ibovespa stock index had rallied until falling on Wednesday, and Brazil\u2019s currency has strengthened in recent months.Mr. Vega said in an interview that the current political and economic drama did not factor into his company\u2019s new financing round. He said he hoped that in tough times, truckers would have more reasons to improve efficiency.Michael Nicklas, a partner with the Valor Capital Group, said in an interview, \u201cThe political and economic situation was not a variable\u201d in the start-up\u2019s latest fund-raising.Valor, whose founders include Clifford M.

I\u2019ve been plowing through stacks of them to make your life simpler. Here are some of my favorites.This is a tell-all of Mr. Martinez\u2019s experience in venture capital and later at Facebook, filled with insights about Silicon Valley \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe tech whorehouse\u201d \u2014 mixed with score-settling anecdotes that will occasionally make you laugh out loud. Clearly there will be people who hate this book \u2014 which is probably one of the things that makes it such a great read.The dedication page includes this gem: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d Mr. Martinez is particularly incisive when it comes to illustrating how failed ideas that happen to work are often spun into great successes: \u201cWhat was an improbable bonanza at the hands of the flailing half-blind becomes the inevitable coup of the assured visionary,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe world crowns you a genius, and you start acting like one.\u201dThe biggest surprise for me was that the most successful entrepreneurs didn\u2019t quit their day jobs to pursue their ideas; instead, they stayed at work until they had worked all the kinks out of their plans and gotten them off the ground. The other head-scratcher in this book? Procrastination is a great thing. (This was a terrific revelation.)The book is peppered with stories about the likes of Michael Milken, Bruce Wasserstein, Felix Rohatyn and Martin Lipton \u2014 a cast of characters who defined an age that irrevocably shaped corporate America today. But more than any book I\u2019ve read, Mr. Teitelman\u2019s has managed to capture how power shifted from a company\u2019s boardroom to its shareholders, a change that is often seen as positive but clearly comes with its own pitfalls.\u201cSo profound has been that revolution that memories of an earlier corporate identity \u2014 the patriarchal company managed for the stakeholders, the Platonic corporation \u2014 have grown dim, as if it had never existed,\u201d Mr. Teitelman writes.Mr. Gramm has collected a series of deliciously rich letters, many of which were never before published, sent to chief executives by investors by everyone from Warren Buffett to Ross Perot. They are eye-opening, often chilling and include fascinating lessons about business.My personal favorite is this letter from Mr. Loeb to the chief executive of Star Gas Partners: \u201cIt seems that Star Gas can only serve as your personal \u2018honey pot\u2019 from which to extract salary for yourself and family members, fees for your cronies and to insulate you from the numerous lawsuits that you personally face due to your prior alleged fabrications, misstatements and broken promises. I have known you personally for many years and thus what I am about to say may seem harsh, but is said with some authority. It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites. The matter of repairing the mess you have created should be left to professional management and those that have an economic stake in the outcome.\u201dMr. Greenspan is a fascinating subject because for so long he was considered a genius, only to later be blamed for the financial crisis. Mr. Mallaby does an exquisite job going beyond these two versions of the Greenspan narrative and taking the reader inside the complicated mind of a man who may have had one of the largest ever influences over our economy.Advertisement"}

Here are Mr. Kaine\u2019s positions on some key issues, and how they align with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s views.Mr. Kaine is an outspoken advocate of free trade, but he appears to be shifting that position since Mrs. Clinton selected him on Friday.He has defended the North American Free Trade Agreement and voted in favor of \u201cfast track\u201d authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that President Obama has championed. It now appears that Mr. Kaine, in joining the Democratic ticket, will oppose the deal.Mr. Kaine personally opposes the death penalty, but he oversaw 11 executions during his tenure as governor, and Virginia has had the second-highest number of executions since the 1970s. He said his obligation to uphold the law as governor overrode his moral opposition to capital punishment, which was shaped by his Roman Catholic faith. In the Senate, Mr. Kaine has advocated overhauling the criminal justice system and supported a measure that would give judges more flexibility on sentencing.Last week in Cleveland, New York Times photographers covered the Republican National Convention at \u2014 and outside of \u2014 Quicken Loans Arena.Mr. Kaine supports Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions that would have shielded as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowed them to legally work in the United States. He also backs a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would allow those living in the country illegally to gain legal residency if they pay taxes and a fine.When he was governor of Virginia, Mr. Kaine helped expand the state\u2019s preschool programs that serve at-risk children in families with incomes near or below the poverty line. He also introduced a bill in the Senate to expand nationwide access to prekindergarten programs. Mr. Kaine supported the Every Student Succeeds act, which de-emphasized standardized testing and gave states more flexibility to set education policies. On higher education, Mr. Kaine has pushed measures to reduce the cost of attending college.Mr. Kaine cites Virginia\u2019s river and bay cleanups as evidence that stronger environmental policies can stimulate tourism and fishing economies. Mr. Kaine has expressed concern about the rising sea levels along the coast of Virginia, which he fears could impair military operations and endanger businesses. But he also supported opening Virginia\u2019s coast to offshore oil drilling.Mr. Kaine supports \u201ctargeted spending reductions\u201d but wants to close tax loopholes for the wealthy.Advertisement"}

In Cleveland and Philadelphia, art installations and performances \u2014 taking the form of neutral civic forums, partisan provocations and everything in between \u2014 will be cropping up all around the convention centers.\u201cOne of the major things limiting our democracy is the narrow way we now frame our values,\u201d said Hank Willis Thomas, a New York artist who conceived of the booth with the artists Ryan Alexiev and Jim Ricks. Mr. Thomas, an African-American artist whose work often delves into advertising and race, added: \u201cThere are a lot of false dichotomies out there. This piece is about trying to get to common denominators.\u201dThe artists, who call the installations \u201ctemporary monuments,\u201d have previously melted down \u201cMiddle Class,\u201d \u201cEconomy,\u201d \u201cFuture\u201d and \u201cDemocracy,\u201d a version of which made it about six hours on a steamy day during the 2008 Republican convention in St. Paul.\u201cPart of this is to examine an overused term in political discourse,\u201d Mr. Reese said, adding that discussion around their pieces tends to be about stagnant incomes, concentration of wealth and dwindling opportunity for working-class people. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that these types of events and installation suspend disbelief. They break a hole in things, and people talk and think while they watch the words go away.\u201dHe added: \u201cEven though they\u2019re very ephemeral, they do have meaning for the people who see them. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be spending so much energy to organize this project if we didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d\u201cThe movement wants to be faceless, not to have a group of leaders or to have something you see that boils it all down to one idea,\u201d she said.The works, by artists like Alec Soth, Carrie Mae Weems, Fred Tomaselli and Pablo Helguera, are for the most part not politically pointed but suggestive and open-ended.\u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to do is reintroduce the idea of nuance into some very polarized conversations,\u201d Mr. Gottesman said. \u201cWe started a super PAC because we didn\u2019t just want to be cynical about the process but to be involved, to have skin in the game.\u201dMr. Gottesman added, \u201cMarketing and advertising govern politics now, so our conception is that advertising is really the most potent way to reach people.\u201dThe graphic, by Preston Whited, a production planner at a kayak-paddle company north of Seattle, was a lark that grew out of a Facebook chat among Mr. Whited and his friends. \u201cWe have a pretty dark sense of humor,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWe came up with it, and I just took a Bernie ad and redid it on Excel and put it out there.\u201d He added that, besides having no real graphic art experience, \u201cI really don\u2019t have any political faith in anything.\u201dA few weeks after he put the logo on Facebook, enterprising souls elsewhere on the web picked it up and began selling it on bumper stickers, shirts and hats. \u201cWhich is cool with me,\u201d Mr. Whited, 30, said. \u201cIf I\u2019d tried to copyright it and claim it, it never would have had the exposure it\u2019s had.

But Ms. Bronson\u2019s proposal \u2014 to ask large companies to pay for child care \u2014 is unlikely to succeed, because only half of Americans work for large businesses and because it is hard to imagine that companies will be incentivized or coerced to take on large-scale early education programs in-house.There is another proven solution. Countries with developed economies have paid for early education with public funds, just as the United States does for public school. This country ranks 33rd among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in support for early care and education; only Slovakia, Cyprus and Estonia are ranked lower.Given the economic advantages of early education for our economy as well as its benefits for young children, we must play catch-up.

Thank you for that amazing welcome.And Chelsea, thank you.I\u2019m so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you\u2019ve become.Thanks for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago is still going strong.It\u2019s lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us.And I\u2019ve even gotten a few words in along the way.On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my Explainer-in-Chief is still on the job.I\u2019m also grateful to the rest of my family and the friends of a lifetime.To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight.And to those of you who joined our campaign this week.And what a remarkable week it\u2019s been.We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton.And the man of Hope, Barack Obama.America is stronger because of President Obama\u2019s leadership, and I\u2019m better because of his friendship.We heard from our terrific vice president, the one-and-only Joe Biden, who spoke from his big heart about our party\u2019s commitment to working people.First lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine \u2014 you\u2019re soon going to understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from City Council and mayor, to Governor, and now Senator.He\u2019ll make the whole country proud as our Vice President.And \u2026 I want to thank Bernie Sanders.Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.You\u2019ve put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.And to all of your supporters here and around the country:I want you to know, I\u2019ve heard you.Your cause is our cause.Our country needs your ideas, energy, and passion.That\u2019s the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.We wrote it together \u2014 now let\u2019s go out there and make it happen together.My friends, we\u2019ve come to Philadelphia \u2014 the birthplace of our nation \u2014 because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.We all know the story.But we usually focus on how it turned out \u2014 and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the King.Some wanted to stick it to the king, and go their own way.The revolution hung in the balance.Then somehow they began listening to each other \u2026 compromising \u2026 finding common purpose.And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.That\u2019s what made it possible to stand up to a King.That took courage.They had courage.Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.America is once again at a moment of reckoning.Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart.Bonds of trust and respect are fraying.And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees.It truly is up to us.We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.Our country\u2019s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one.Will we stay true to that motto?Well, we heard Donald Trump\u2019s answer last week at his convention.He wants to divide us \u2014 from the rest of the world, and from each other.He\u2019s betting that the perils of today\u2019s world will blind us to its unlimited promise.He\u2019s taken the Republican Party a long way \u2026 from \u201cMorning in America\u201d to \u201cMidnight in America.\u201dHe wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.\u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201dNow we are cleareyed about what our country is up against.But we are not afraid.We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have.We will not build a wall.Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one.And we\u2019ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!We will not ban a religion.We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight terrorism.There\u2019s a lot of work to do.Too many people haven\u2019t had a pay raise since the crash.There\u2019s too much inequality.Too little social mobility.Too much paralysis in Washington.Too many threats at home and abroad.But just look at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges.We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.We have the most tolerant and generous young people we\u2019ve ever had.We have the most powerful military.The most innovative entrepreneurs.The most enduring values. Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.We should be so proud that these words are associated with us. That when people hear them \u2014 they hear \u2026 America.So don\u2019t let anyone tell you that our country is weak.We\u2019re not.Don\u2019t let anyone tell you we don\u2019t have what it takes.We do.And most of all, don\u2019t believe anyone who says: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dThose were actually Donald Trump\u2019s words in Cleveland.And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.Really?I alone can fix it?Isn\u2019t he forgetting?Troops on the front lines.Police officers and fire fighters who run toward danger.Doctors and nurses who care for us.Teachers who change lives.Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem.Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.He\u2019s forgetting every last one of us.Americans don\u2019t say: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dWe say: \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it together.\u201dRemember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers.Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.And you know how the community responded?Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.That\u2019s how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.20 years ago I wrote a book called \u201cIt Takes a Village.\u201d A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that?This is what I mean.None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.I believe that with all my heart.That\u2019s why \u201cStronger Together\u201d is not just a lesson from our history.It\u2019s not just a slogan for our campaign.It\u2019s a guiding principle for the country we\u2019ve always been and the future we\u2019re going to build.A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in.A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach.Where families are strong \u2026 communities are safe.How we provided real-time analysis of the final night of the Democratic National Convention, featuring Chelsea and Hillary Clinton.And yes, love trumps hate.That\u2019s the country we\u2019re fighting for.That\u2019s the future we\u2019re working toward.And so it is with humility \u2026 determination \u2026 and boundless confidence in America\u2019s promise \u2026 that I accept your nomination for President of the United States!Now, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.As you know, I\u2019m not one of those people.I\u2019ve been your first lady. Served 8 years as a Senator from the great sate of New York.I ran for President and lost.Then I represented all of you as secretary of State.But my job titles only tell you what I\u2019ve done.They don\u2019t tell you why.The truth is, through all these years of public service, the \u201cservice\u201d part has always come easier to me than the \u201cpublic\u201d part.I get it that some people just don\u2019t know what to make of me.So let me tell you.The family I\u2019m from \u2026 well, no one had their name on big buildings.My family were builders of a different kind.Builders in the way most American families are.They used whatever tools they had \u2014 whatever God gave them \u2014 and whatever life in America provided \u2014 and built better lives and better futures for their kids.My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did.And he was right.My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.When the war was over he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had.And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.She was saved by the kindness of others.Her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share.The lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me:No one gets through life alone.We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith:\u201cDo all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\u201dI went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house.She told me how badly she wanted to go to school \u2014 it just didn\u2019t seem possible.And I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of my mother and what she went through as a child.It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough.To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.You need both understanding and action.So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.It\u2019s a big idea, isn\u2019t it?Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.But how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year \u2026 sometimes even door-by-door.And my heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who \u2014 because of those changes to our laws \u2014 are able to get an education.It\u2019s true \u2026 I sweat the details of policy \u2014 whether we\u2019re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.Because it\u2019s not just a detail if it\u2019s your kid \u2014 if it\u2019s your family.It\u2019s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.Over the last three days, you\u2019ve seen some of the people who\u2019ve inspired me.People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning.They told their stories Tuesday night.I first met Ryan as a seven-year old.He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed forty pounds.Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed \u2026 and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year.Lauren was gravely injured on 9/11.It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.I was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others ten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.In this campaign, I\u2019ve met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for change.And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.For the struggling, the striving and the successful.For those who vote for me and those who don\u2019t.For all Americans.Tonight, we\u2019ve reached a milestone in our nation\u2019s march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for President.Standing here as my mother\u2019s daughter, and my daughter\u2019s mother, I\u2019m so happy this day has come.Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.Happy for boys and men, too \u2014 because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky\u2019s the limit.So let\u2019s keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves.Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.Let\u2019s begin with what we\u2019re going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.Now, I don\u2019t think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. That\u2019s real progress.But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.We\u2019re still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.I\u2019ve gone around our country talking to working families. And I\u2019ve heard from so many of you who feel like the economy just isn\u2019t working.Some of you are frustrated \u2014 even furious.And you know what? You\u2019re right.It\u2019s not yet working the way it should.Americans are willing to work \u2014 and work hard.But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do.And less respect for them, period.Democrats are the party of working people.But we haven\u2019t done a good enough job showing that we get what you\u2019re going through, and that we\u2019re going to do something about it.So I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.From my first day in office to my last!Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country.From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.And here\u2019s what I believe.I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.I believe that our economy isn\u2019t working the way it should because our democracy isn\u2019t working the way it should.That\u2019s why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And we\u2019ll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return.Many of them are. But too many aren\u2019t.It\u2019s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together \u2014 and it\u2019s the right thing to do.Whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage \u2026 and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty \u2026 join us.If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care \u2026 join us.If you believe that we should say \u201cno\u201d to unfair trade deals \u2026 that we should stand up to China \u2026 that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers \u2026 join us.If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions \u2026 join us.And yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay \u2026 join us.Let\u2019s make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.Now, you didn\u2019t hear any of this from Donald Trump at his convention.He spoke for 70-odd minutes \u2014 and I do mean odd.And he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn\u2019t believe these things.No wonder he doesn\u2019t like talking about his plans.You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.In my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.If we invest in infrastructure now, we\u2019ll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.And we will transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.It\u2019s just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can\u2019t refinance theirs.And here\u2019s something we don\u2019t say often enough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.We\u2019re going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.We\u2019re going to give small businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.We\u2019re going to help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the \u201cwoman card,\u201d then Deal Me In!(Oh, you\u2019ve heard that one?)Now, here\u2019s the thing, we\u2019re not only going to make all these investments, we\u2019re going to pay for every single one of them.And here\u2019s how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that\u2019s where the money is.And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we\u2019ll make them pay us back. And we\u2019ll put that money to work where it belongs \u2026 creating jobs here at home!Now I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all sounds pretty good.But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Look at my record. I\u2019ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as President.But Trump, he\u2019s a businessman. He must know something about the economy.Well, let\u2019s take a closer look.In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you\u2019ll find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.People who did the work and needed the money, and didn\u2019t get it \u2014 not because he couldn\u2019t pay them, but because he wouldn\u2019t pay them.Milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal, state and local government.That sales pitch he\u2019s making to be your president? Put your faith in him \u2014 and you\u2019ll win big? That\u2019s the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado.Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again \u2014 well, he could start by actually making things in America again.The choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security.Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.From Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we\u2019re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership.You want a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it will be my highest priority.I\u2019m proud that we put a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program without firing a single shot \u2014 now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel\u2019s security.I\u2019m proud that we shaped a global climate agreement \u2014 now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.I\u2019m proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.I\u2019ve laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS.We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.It won\u2019t be easy or quick, but make no mistake \u2014 we will prevail.Now Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do.\u201dNo, Donald, you don\u2019t.He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are \u201ca disaster.\u201dWell, I\u2019ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee.I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.We entrust our commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces.Decisions about war and peace. Life and death.A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country \u2014 including the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.Ask yourself: Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief?Donald Trump can\u2019t even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he\u2019s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he\u2019s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally.Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.I can\u2019t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started \u2014 not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men \u2014 the ones moved by fear and pride.America\u2019s strength doesn\u2019t come from lashing out.Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.That\u2019s the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be.And if we\u2019re serious about keeping our country safe, we also can\u2019t afford to have a President who\u2019s in the pocket of the gun lobby.I\u2019m not here to repeal the Second Amendment.I\u2019m not here to take away your guns.I just don\u2019t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn\u2019t have a gun in the first place.We should be working with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.For decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics were too hot to touch.But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing?You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence.You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.I refuse to believe we can\u2019t find common ground here.We have to heal the divides in our country.Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more.That starts with listening to each other. Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other\u2019s shoes.So let\u2019s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.Let\u2019s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.We will defend all our rights \u2014 civil rights, human rights and voting rights \u2026 women\u2019s rights and workers\u2019 rights \u2026 LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.For the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.They think he couldn\u2019t possibly mean all the horrible things he says \u2014 like when he called women \u201cpigs.\u201d Or said that an American judge couldn\u2019t be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain \u2014 a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.At first, I admit, I couldn\u2019t believe he meant it either.It was just too hard to fathom \u2014 that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.But here\u2019s the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump \u2026 This is it.And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get: that America is great \u2014 because America is good.So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump\u2019s not offering real change.He\u2019s offering empty promises. What are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country \u2014 to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.The choice is clear.Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger.None of us can do it alone.I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we\u2019ll ever pull together again.But I\u2019m here to tell you tonight \u2014 progress is possible.I know because I\u2019ve seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.And I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I\u2019ve had to pick myself up and get back in the game.Like so much else, I got this from my mother. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. \u201cGo back out there,\u201d she said.And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.We lost my mother a few years ago. I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.That\u2019s what we need to do together as a nation.Though \u201cwe may not live to see the glory,\u201d as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, \u201clet us gladly join the fight.\u201dLet our legacy be about \u201cplanting seeds in a garden you never get to see.\u201dThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2026 not just in this hall, but on this Earth.The Founders showed us that.And so have many others since.They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.Yes, the world is watching what we do.Yes, America\u2019s destiny is ours to choose.So let\u2019s be stronger together.Looking to the future with courage and confidence.Building a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.When we do, America will be greater than ever.Thank you and may God bless the United States of America!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JPMorgan Chase Has Strong Quarter as Earnings Top Estimates", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byThe bank, the nation\u2019s largest, said that it was seeing broad demand for loans from consumers and businesses in the United States. JPMorgan\u2019s loan portfolio in the second quarter grew 16 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the previous quarter.\u201cThat speaks well for the U.S. economy and the consumer in particular,\u201d said JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting continuing moderate growth and demand in the U.S.\u201dJPMorgan is the first of the big banks to announce its quarterly financial results, and its signs of growth appeared to please investors. Stocks rose after the results were released. Nine of the 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index showed gains Thursday, and banks rose the most, 0.9 percent.For the second quarter, earnings at JPMorgan slipped to $6.20 billion, or $1.55 a share, from $6.29 billion, or $1.54 a share. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of $1.43 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Improving results from its Main Street and Wall Street divisions helped push up the firm\u2019s overall revenue 3 percent, to $25.2 billion, from a year earlier.Goldman Sachs reported a 78 percent jump in quarterly profit as the Wall Street bank earned more from bond trading and its expenses fell.Mr. Dimon wrote that the move was driven in part by his optimistic outlook and would allow his employees to share in the economic growth.And on Thursday, the bank sounded a relatively optimistic note about the potential impact of Britain\u2019s recent vote to leave the European Union.\u201cWe see this as a political and economic challenge, but not a financial crisis,\u201d Ms. Lake said.Before the vote, Mr. Dimon had warned that JPMorgan might have to move thousands of employees out of Britain if it opted to leave the European Union.Ms. Lake said on Thursday that the company would decide on any moves only after the exact terms of Britain\u2019s exit had been negotiated.\u201cIt\u2019s very early days \u2014 things will unfold very slowly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like to believe that we can continue to have our European franchise headquarters based in London.\u201dThe trading activity around \u201cBrexit,\u201d as Britain\u2019s decision to exit the European Union is called, appears to have helped the results from JPMorgan\u2019s trading divisions, and particularly its bond and fixed-income units. Those units have been struggling in recent years. In the second quarter, revenue from fixed-income markets rose 35 percent from a year earlier.Banks have been hit hard in the market turmoil during the first half of the year, and there has been concern about the potential impact of Britain\u2019s exit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cyberattack: The \u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Story So Far", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported by\u201cHello, friend.\u201dElliot, an engineer at a cybersecurity firm called Allsafe and a \u201cvigilante hacker,\u201d was recruited by a man known as Mr. Robot into fsociety, an anarchist group partly inspired by entities like the Occupy movement and Anonymous. The cabal\u2019s goals included wiping out all debt and taking down E Corp, an Allsafe client that is the world\u2019s largest corporation.Elliot referred to the conglomerate as \u201cEvil Corp,\u201d and soon other characters did as well. That\u2019s one clue that much of what viewers saw reflected Elliot\u2019s unreliable perspective, which stemmed from mental and emotional ailments including depression, social anxiety, morphine addiction and, most crucially, dissociative identity disorder.Mr. Robot was revealed to be a delusion based on Elliot\u2019s dead father.

Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College who helped revolutionize how home prices are tracked by real estate professionals and home buyers alike, died on July 15 in Wellesley, Mass. He was 69.Mr. Case had Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple myeloma and died in a hospice near his home, his wife, Susan, said.While the daily ups and downs of prices for stocks and bonds have long been easy to obtain and analyze, the housing market was much more opaque when Mr. Case teamed up in the 1980s with a Yale economist, Robert Shiller, to develop an economic model to track home values.The two collected information like the price of the same property over time as it changed hands, and tweaked the data to account for reliability and other quirks. This created what has become the benchmark for gauging the value of the single biggest investment most Americans own: their home.The Case-Shiller Index charted the remarkable rise of housing prices in the bubble that preceded the Great Recession, its subsequent bursting, the sharp declines in 2008 and 2009, and the slow but steady recovery in the real estate market since then.Both men warned before the recession that the housing market was getting ahead of itself. Mr. Case presciently sounded the alarm about the danger posed by rising subprime borrowing in the decade before the financial crisis.\u201cHe was more connected to the business world than most academics,\u201d Mr. Shiller said in an interview. \u201cHe also talked to people in the real world, like home appraisers, in order to isolate data for housing prices, which wasn\u2019t easy.\u201dKarl Edwin Case, who was known as Chip, a childhood nickname, was born in New York City on Nov. 5, 1946, the son of Karl Case, a banker, and the former Lillian Collier, a homemaker.Mr. Case graduated from Miami University in Ohio in 1968 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and then spent three years in the Army, running field hospitals in Vietnam at the height of the war there.He met his future wife, Susan Galbraith, when the two were undergraduates at Miami. They married in 1969.In addition to his wife, an education consultant, Mr. Case is survived by a daughter, Kristen Case, an English professor at the University of Maine at Farmington; a half brother, George Calnan; and two grandchildren.Mr. Case began teaching at Wellesley after earning a doctorate in economics from Harvard in 1976. His focus on housing was propelled by the real estate boom in the Boston area in the 1980s as computer companies there, like Digital Equipment Corporation and Data General, prospered, foreshadowing the current boom in Silicon Valley and other tech-driven areas.Mr. Case was introduced to Mr. Shiller by Sharon M. Oster, a Yale economist and colleague of Mr. Shiller\u2019s. The two men found they had complementary interests that would prove useful as they developed and expanded their index.Mr. Shiller had studied bubbles in the bond and stock markets; Mr. Case was an expert on taxes and incentives, as well as low-income housing.As they developed their model for broader use, Mr. Case and Mr. Shiller also showed that housing prices were not necessarily rational. Like the prices of stocks, home values are susceptible to momentum and human impulses like fear and greed.In 1991, the two worked with Allan Weiss, a management consultant who had studied with Mr. Shiller at Yale, to develop their model commercially. They sold it to Fiserv in 2002. Mr. Case retired from teaching at Wellesley in 2010.From tracking four cities, the Case-Shiller data has expanded to cover dozens of cities and thousands of ZIP codes, as well as providing national benchmarks.Their creation is now produced by Standard & Poor\u2019s and CoreLogic and is known as the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.\u201cWhat Case and Shiller put together is really the gold standard for price changes in the housing market,\u201d Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard, said in an interview. \u201cIt has the beauty of being both transparent and reliable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can We Ignore the Alarm Bells the Bond Market Is Ringing?", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe financial media tend to report breathlessly about what the stock market did yesterday. But savvy economic analysts have always known the bond market is the place to look for a real sense of where the economy is going, or at least where the smart money thinks it is going.And right now, if the bond market is correctly predicting the economic path ahead, we should all be terrified.But, please, read on before panicking. There\u2019s a lot more to the story.The stock market can rise and fall for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes for no apparent reason at all. But the bond market, where trillions of dollars change hands and long-term interest rates are determined, is steadier (normally). Its prices are generally tied closely to the outlook for growth and inflation over the years ahead.The long-term interest rates that currently prevail across all the major advanced economies are consistent with a disastrous economic future. Taken at face value, they imply that the smart money expects inflation will remain extraordinarily low for years to come, and that growth will stay so weak that central banks won\u2019t be able to raise rates for years. It is a shift that has accelerated since Britain\u2019s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, but one that has been underway for years.Prices for inflation-protected bonds suggest that consumer prices will rise only about 1.4 percent a year through 2021 \u2014 and only 1.5 percent in the five years after that. They suggest that not only is the Federal Reserve unlikely to find conditions that warrant an interest rate increase in the remainder of 2016, but also that there is only about a 50 percent chance of a rate increase in 2017.Across other major advanced economies, the signals sent by bond prices are even worse. Ten-year bonds are now offering negative interest rates in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark and, as of Friday\u2019s close, the Netherlands. That means buyers of these securities will get fewer euros, yen, Swiss francs or Danish kroner back than they invested, a development without precedent in hundreds of years of financial history.But that phrase \u201ctaken at face value\u201d is doing some heavy lifting here. There are reasons to think that current prices are reflecting idiosyncrasies in the supply and demand for safe assets, rather than a conviction among global investors that very bad times are ahead.Many of the purchasers of government bonds do so not because they find the returns offered compelling but because they have to. Insurers face regulators who may require that they do so. Pension funds seek to offset long-term obligations with safe assets of similar duration. Banks buy bonds to comply with rules limiting how much risk they can take.In the last few years, central banks have become the biggest buyers of bonds. The Federal Reserve\u2019s program of quantitative easing \u2014 buying bonds to try to stimulate the economy \u2014 ended in 2014, but the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are just getting going; the E.C.B. is buying 80 billion euros\u2019 worth of securities a month.So you have a strong demand for bonds coming from institutions that are willing to buy at almost any cost \u2014 they are inelastic, in economic terms.Whatever you think of the wisdom of using government deficits to try to prop up a faltering economy, governments for the most part simply are not responding to very low interest rates and depressed economies by radically increasing deficit spending and thus increasing the supply of bonds.So rising demand for bonds that is largely indifferent to price (even a willingness to buy the bonds at a certain loss) along with pretty much fixed supply combines to drive up prices, which in the bond market means driving down rates.And even though the United States isn\u2019t the prime driver of this \u2014 the Fed has ended its Q.E. program, and American debt outstanding continues to rise \u2014 the bond market is sufficiently global that it\u2019s an important part of the story.When German and Japanese bonds are offering negative returns, the 2 percent or so that United States Treasury bonds were offering earlier this year looked extremely attractive. Essentially the United States has imported this very low interest rate environment from overseas, even though the domestic economy is in pretty good shape and the Federal Reserve had been planning interest rate increases.So even though in normal times bond prices give useful information about the likely path of inflation and growth, this might be an instance when those indicators are less useful.Among the evidence that the recessionary signals out of the bond market are wrong? If bond prices are an unreliable yardstick, we can look to other markets that may be flawed, but are at least flawed in different ways.And those other markets are not flashing recession warnings at all: The United States stock market closed on Monday at a record high; indexes of future stock market volatility are quite low; and oil prices, after a furious rally since the winter, have mostly held onto their gains.So how much of the drop in interest rates can we really pin on these supply-and-demand factors in the market for bonds, as opposed to a genuine shift in investors\u2019 expectations about the future? Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro, has tried to disentangle the parts of the puzzle.He estimates that about three-quarters of the drop in American Treasury yields since the start of the year is because of a decline in the \u201cterm premium,\u201d or the compensation investors demand for tying up their money over many years. This is largely attributable to those supply-and-demand factors. He attributes about one-eighth of the drop to investors\u2019 perception that the Fed will raise rates more slowly for any given economic circumstance than they had assumed at the start of the year.He attributes only one-eighth of the drop to an actual belief among bond buyers that the economy will grow more slowly in the years ahead than they had thought at the start of 2016.There is good news in that as well as bad. The good news is that most of the drop in long-term interest rates is being driven by things that have little to do with the underlying strength of economic growth. The bad news is that some portion of the drop really is being driven by more pessimistic economic views, at a time a great deal of pessimism is already baked in.The bond market right now is like a speedometer that is miscalibrated and therefore unreliable. It may be less useful than usual, and is not to be interpreted literally \u2014 but it\u2019s still telling us something. And that something is that we should be worried about the possibility the world is in a nasty deflationary economic trap that won\u2019t get better anytime soon.Advertisement"}

Looking at a stolen car, he wonders whether it was a mother\u2019s ride to work, but the question is strictly rhetorical and quickly dropped. In South Africa, he spends a little more camera time establishing the connection between poaching and the decimation of abalone.Making these points may be important to Mr. Williams, but they\u2019re secondary in the Viceland scheme of things. Vice Media, on its HBO show, occasionally commits real news reporting, but Viceland makes what you could think of as the extreme-sports versions of the sort of lifestyle-travel shows you find on the Travel Channel or CNN.\u201cBlack Markets\u201d has the usual mix: the frisson of danger, the sheen of immediacy, the claims of injustice, the tinge of sentimentalism, the scarcity of hard information or attribution.

Mr. Williams assumes that when shantytown residents cheer for the abalone poachers, it\u2019s to celebrate their escape from the police, but you may wonder whether they were just responding to the presence of a camera crew.None of that would matter so much if Mr. Williams and his fellow producers came up with something revelatory \u2014 aha moments or fascinating characters.

{"Headline": "An Unfinished Bridge, and Partnership, Between Russia and China", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byNIZHNELENINSKOYE, Russia \u2014 Trumpeted for the past decade as an emblem of Russia\u2019s destiny as an Asian as well as a European power, the huge steel bridge thrusts out from the Chinese side of the Amur River, stretching more than a mile across the turbid waters that divide the world\u2019s most populous nation from its biggest.Then something strange happens: The bridge abruptly stops, hanging in the air high above the river just short of the Russian shore at Nizhneleninskoye, a remote frontier settlement nearly 4,000 miles from Moscow.The unfinished rail bridge across the Amur River, however, offers a more realistic picture of the chasm separating what the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, recently described as the \u201ctruly inexhaustible potential\u201d of Moscow\u2019s \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Beijing and the reality of unfulfilled promises and thwarted hopes.The only sign of construction in Nizhneleninskoye on a recent afternoon was a group of border guards from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, digging with their bare hands and a shovel near a security fence.Russian officials insist that construction work is about to start and that the bridge will be ready to carry rail traffic within two years or so \u2014 a decade after the Russian and Chinese governments agreed to proceed on the project.The gulf between expectation and reality has become a recurring feature of Russia\u2019s relationship with China. After promises by leaders to increase trade between the nations to $100 billion by this year and $200 billion by 2020, for example, two-way trade volume slumped last year by 28 percent, to just $68 billion. It picked up a few percentage points in the first few months of this year.The sheen has also dulled on a 30-year gas deal estimated to be worth $400 billion when it was signed during a visit by Mr. Putin to China in May 2014. A pipeline that Russia needs to build to transport the gas has stalled.At a conference in May in Moscow, Chinese speakers complained that Russia needed to improve its performance. Li Fenglin, a former Chinese ambassador to Moscow, expressed dismay over the slow pace of construction on the so-called Power of Siberia gas pipeline and other projects.\u201cDon\u2019t just drag your feet. You should start working energetically,\u201d Mr. Li said. He added that China and Russia had \u201ca single destiny\u201d but would get their partnership into gear only if they moved away from mammoth state-sponsored ventures and shifted toward market-driven interaction between small and medium-size companies.There is also frustration on the Russian side, particularly among businesspeople whose dreams of tapping Chinese markets and pools of cash have mostly fizzled.\u201cWhat should be noted from the results of our work of the last year is that there has been a catastrophically low level of cooperation between the two countries,\u201d said Viktor F. Vekselberg, a billionaire and the chairman of the Russian chapter of the Russian-Chinese Chamber for Commerce in Machinery and High Technology Products, at the Moscow conference.In the long run, China and Russia have too much of what the other badly needs \u2014 natural resources in Russia and a huge market and capital in China \u2014 not to lift their friendship beyond grand but often hollow declarations by leaders.That is certainly the hope of officials and mining executives here in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, a resource-rich but cash-poor region in Russia that has long looked to the Amur River rail bridge as a way to tap into China\u2019s economic dynamism. If ever completed, it would be the first year-round link between Russia and China along a stretch of frontier more than 2,000 miles long.Valery A. Samkov, the head of the district government in Leninskoye, a border area that includes Nizhneleninskoye, said he hoped the bridge and the business opportunities it would generate would revitalize a community whose population has shrunk to 18,000 from 30,000 since the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991.He said he was optimistic that progress was being made on the Russian side. After years of visits by \u201cmen with ties and nice haircuts,\u201d he noted, he is now receiving tieless visitors from construction companies who ask where they can dump their garbage and find water when work actually starts.Mr. Putin has strengthened and empowered the Russian state and disciplined it to speak with one voice in public. But its various agencies rarely move in lock step or swiftly, particularly when large sums of money are at stake for well-connected insiders.Victor Larin, a leading Russian expert on China at the Far East branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Vladivostok, said Russia\u2019s fumbling of the bridge showed that parts of the country\u2019s elite remained in the grip of \u201cthe China threat syndrome.\u201d He was referring to a deep-seated wariness in Russia of a neighbor whose population is nearly 10 times bigger, economy more than five times larger and military spending twice as large.All the power that has accrued to Mr. Putin, Mr. Larin added, has left Russia \u201cunder manual control\u201d by the Kremlin, meaning that little gets done on any issue unless the president intervenes directly and forcefully.So while the Kremlin has endorsed the bridge, others lower in the Russian government ranks, Mr. Larin said, have stalled, with finance officials in Moscow complaining about the cost and military officers asking, \u201cWhy build a bridge over which Chinese tanks can come?\u201dThe Kremlin, he said, has a clear vision of where it wants relations with China to go, but \u201cthe lower you go, the worse it gets.\u201d Much of Russia\u2019s elite \u201chas not made the turn psychologically\u201d to viewing China as a reliable partner rather than a potential enemy.Though initially conceived as a private project, the Amur River bridge quickly evolved into a venture funded and carried out by the Russian and Chinese governments. The arrangement, said Valery Gurevich, a former vice governor of the Jewish autonomous region, allowed China to take the lead.\u201cOver there, one party decides everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes things much easier.\u201dEven the seemingly simple issue of where the bridge\u2019s pillars would stand, Mr. Gurevich recalled, stirred a hornet\u2019s nest of arguments between three state landowners in Nizhneleninskoye \u2014 the Federal Security Service, the state forestry fund and municipal authorities.\u201cAt times, you just wanted to hang yourself,\u201d he said.Tougher still was the question of who, on Russia\u2019s side, would get construction contracts potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Chinese decided years ago to entrust the construction of their portion of the bridge to a state-owned engineering company, which quickly got to work and, according to Chinese state television, finished the job two years ago.But in Russia, where state-funded projects invariably go far over budget and yield expansive opportunities for theft, it took until June to choose among different construction companies, each with powerful backers in Moscow. The winner was SK Most Group, a well-connected private Russian company known for its role in building a bridge in Vladivostok that ended up costing the state more than $1 billion.The recent arrival in Nizhneleninskoye of heavy construction equipment has raised hopes that the bridge to China might finally be finished. The regional government, in response to written questions, said the delays were because \u201cthis project is unique with no analog in world practice and required the solving of a long list of questions.\u201d The government said the Russian portion would cost 9 billion rubles (around $140 million) and would be finished by June 2018.Chinese criticism has stung Russian pride. In a recent interview with a local television station, Dmitri Astafyev, the head of Rubicon, a state-controlled company supervising the project, urged China to curb its criticism.\u201cWe\u2019re being criticized because our partners in China have built two kilometers already while we\u2019re not able to build as little as 309 meters,\u201d Mr. Astafyev said.\u201cWhile the Chinese are, of course, talented, they have, for starters, built the easy part,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the key point is the following: They say they\u2019ve built the bridge. Good. But it\u2019s not suitable for traffic.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philippines v. China: Q. and A. on South China Sea Case", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported by What is this case about?But the Philippines also went further, asking an international tribunal to reject China\u2019s claim to sovereignty over waters within a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that appears on official Chinese maps. The dashes encircle as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea, an area the size of Mexico that is vital to global trade and rich in natural resources, including potential oil deposits.The Philippines also accused China of violating international law by dredging sand to build artificial islands out of several reefs in the South China Sea, including one it says is in its waters.The tribunal largely agreed, declaring that there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d for the nine-dash line and concluding that China had unlawfully built an artificial island in Philippine waters. What does international law say?The treaty says a country has sovereignty over waters extending 12 nautical miles from its coast, and control over economic activities in waters on its continental shelf and up to 200 nautical miles from its coast, including fishing, mining, oil exploration and the construction of artificial islands.The treaty sets out detailed rules for defining these zones, what to do when two nations\u2019 zones overlap and how to resolve disputes.China\u2019s nine-dash line includes waters beyond these zones, and Beijing has cited what it calls historical evidence to support it.But the tribunal rejected that argument, saying any historic rights that China enjoyed previously \u201cwere extinguished\u201d by the treaty. The tribunal also said that while Chinese navigators and fishermen had historically used islands in the sea, there was no evidence Beijing had ever exercised exclusive authority over the waters or their resources. What does China say?China has boycotted the international tribunal that was set up to hear the case.China has been blocking fishermen from a reef near the Philippines for four years, in another flash point in the dispute over the South China Sea.The argument goes like this: If you don\u2019t know what countries these specks of land belong to, you can\u2019t use the treaty to draw territorial and economic zones in the waters around them. And the judges can\u2019t decide whom the specks of land belong to because the Law of the Sea deals only with maritime disputes, not land disputes.China also says it reached a deal with the Philippines years ago to settle disputes in the South China Sea through negotiations. That agreement, it says, prohibited the Philippines from taking the case to the tribunal.Why is this case important?Tuesday\u2019s decision is the first time an international tribunal has ruled on any of these disputes. It could set a precedent or establish principles for easing tensions. It could also alter the political dynamic in the region, restraining some countries while emboldening others.China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea, creating seven new islets in the region and straining already taut geopolitical tensions. Why does the Chinese government care so much about the South China Sea?Chinese military strategists say China needs to control the sea to defend itself, to push the United States out of the Western Pacific and to become a naval power.China also depends on the shipping routes that go through the sea, and is eager to lay claim to oil and other resources to fuel its voracious economy.There are domestic political factors, too. Chinese schoolchildren are taught that the sea has belonged to China since ancient times, and President Xi Jinping has used the construction of artificial islands in the sea to fan nationalist sentiment and strengthen his authority over the Chinese military. What happens if the tribunal rules against China? The Chinese government has said it will not \u201caccept, recognize or execute\u201d the decision.While the decision is binding, the tribunal has no power to enforce it, and no one expects that China will volunteer to dismantle its artificial islands and return the sand to the ocean floor.But the United States, the region\u2019s dominant military power, could use the decision to justify more naval patrols in the area, to recruit new allies and give more support to old ones, and to rally world opinion against Beijing\u2019s behavior.While it will denounce the decision in public, the Chinese leadership may decide to back off and begin easing tensions with neighboring countries. It could start with the new Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who says he wants to improve relations with China and has proposed talks on maritime cooperation.But some analysts are worried that President Xi will respond instead with defiance.Chinese diplomats have already suggested China might withdraw from the Convention on the Law of the Sea.It could also begin transforming the reef at the center of the dispute, Scarborough Shoal, into a military outpost, risking a clash with the Philippines, an American ally.And it might try to impose a new \u201cair defense identification zone\u201d over part of the South China Sea, asserting the right to identify, monitor and take military action against planes in the area.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Indonesia.

Not until Friday \u2014 three months after the Start-Up New York report was supposed to be released, and the day before the start of the July 4 holiday weekend \u2014 did the results from 2015 emerge, with the quiet uploading of a 16-page document to the website of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency that administers the program.Even then, the data about the jobs the program had produced was tucked into a cluster of small-print footnotes at the bottom of the tenth page. Ultimately, the footnote says, the businesses are projected to create 4,140 new jobs by the end of 2020. There were 76 jobs created by Start-Up businesses in 2014, when it began, meaning last year\u2019s new jobs added up to 332.In an interview, Leslie Whatley, the program\u2019s executive vice president, said Start-Up would grow more quickly in coming years as the infrastructure the state set up began to reach its potential. Part of the program\u2019s success, and that of the costly ad campaign that promoted it, lay in changing the perception that New York was unfriendly to business, she said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to build off the momentum; we\u2019re going to continue to admit more companies,\u201d she said, noting that the agency would soon announce a new crop of Start-Up companies. \u201cSuccess breeds success.\u201dMs. Whatley attributed the delay in releasing the report to the time-consuming process of verifying the job data each company had submitted. Empire State Development had also decided to include explanations of the state\u2019s other job-creating programs in an effort to give context to the Start-Up numbers, pushing the report\u2019s release back even further, she said.She said the numbers had gone into a footnote in an effort to keep the report, which contains several other statistical charts about the program, from getting any longer.If there is anything less than triumphant about the results, the report does not let on. Sprinkled with job targets culled from other state programs, it credits Mr. Cuomo\u2019s economic development strategy with producing 26,942 jobs and keeping 77,881 more.The Start-Up program has drawn 159 new, expanding and relocating businesses into tax-free zones across the state, according to the report. The companies have invested about $13 million in the state\u2019s economy. Each zone is on or near campuses of the State University of New York, of the City University of New York or of private colleges, an arrangement designed to help the companies draw on the institutions\u2019 academic resources, faculty and students.The companies are exempt from state and local personal income taxes for 10 years, though those benefits are reduced if they fail to meet job targets. So far, the tax benefits have added up to $1.19 million, according to the report.Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said the agency was basing its evaluation of the program on performance. \u201cAnd taxpayers should be, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Benjamin Millepied Left the Paris Opera Ballet. Now What?", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byIn a recent Skype call from London on a day off, Mr. Millepied looked happy and relaxed, quick to laugh. Words tumbled out of his mouth in sometimes hard-to-follow torrents. He spoke about his constantly expanding plans, his state of mind post-Paris and his love for Los Angeles. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.It sounds like your idea is to create a sort of peripatetic dance company, with a foot in several cities.I really see the company as a different model. It\u2019s organized as a start-up. I see how difficult the economy of dance is in America, and I see where it\u2019s going in Europe, which is also, differently, falling apart. The idea is I can create this international aura with quite a bit of touring but some strong partnerships. And I\u2019m going to be doing a lot of projects on the digital side, because that\u2019s how I think you can reach a larger audience. And I think you can monetize it. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m going to be working on.What are your short-term plans for the L.A. Dance Project?One bit of big news is that both Carla Korbes and Janie Taylor [two colleagues from his days as a dancer at New York City Ballet] will start dancing with the company this fall. There\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t start to put on some more classical works. I want to create a home for the great American repertory across modern dance and have some dancers that have a more classical base, to create this really unique company. And I\u2019d like to do more Cunningham and Trisha Brown.And longer term?I want to grow the company. I\u2019d love to grow it to 20 dancers, but there\u2019s no rush. One of the projects I\u2019d like to do is a collaboration with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. We\u2019re talking about scores that require a larger group of dancers.What does the residency in Arles offer you?It gives us a home to create in a place that is going to be very important for contemporary art for years to come and keeps me in touch with what goes on in Europe.I\u2019m interested in this idea of monetizing content. How will that work?I don\u2019t want to say too much, because these are my secrets, and I don\u2019t want other companies to steal them. (Laughs.) I\u2019m brainstorming with people in the private sector to figure out a way to monetize the company. There are quite a few brands that are interested in a relationship. We will make content together, most likely digital content.You already have a relationship with Van Cleef & Arpels, for instance.There\u2019s this organic connection there because of \u201cJewels\u201d and Balanchine. [\u201cJewels\u201d is a 1967 ballet by George Balanchine inspired by gemstones, the idea for which was suggested by Claude Arpels.] They sponsored three ballets of mine that have become part of the archive of Van Cleef & Arpels. They can use this in their materials, and they invite their clients. It\u2019s not a homage to \u201cJewels\u201d or anything, but I took the simple concept of the stones and created these three works. [One of them, \u201cOn the Other Side,\u201d will be performed in New York.]But L.A. Dance Project is still a Los Angeles company?Yes, and I also want to emphasize the presence in Los Angeles. My goal is to have a home that is open to the city. I\u2019m looking for an open space, essentially a warehouse where we can put hundreds of seats, where we can do longer runs, but that\u2019s also a place that can be used for art exhibitions. It will have multiple functions. And I might invite other people to perform there.What is the lure of Los Angeles for you?What I love is the diversity. If you drive around, you see the buildings from the \u201920s, \u201930s, \u201960s, \u201970s, right next to each other. All these people and areas colliding under this beautiful light. My life on a daily basis provides me with aesthetic pleasure. I think I realized how sensitive I am to color in general. A lot of my work is very colorful.Does it feel more diverse than New York?Than Manhattan, yes. Contemporary artists have gone there because it\u2019s affordable, and the galleries that have moved there are showing work that is more challenging than what you see in New York. It\u2019s a place that\u2019s not yet totally saturated. You\u2019ve always had a lot of great artists living in L.A. In our neighborhood, there\u2019s Thomas Ad\u00e8s down the street and Jean-Yves Thibaudet.How did your time in Paris change you?It changed me a lot. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm and passion and energy, but also you walk into a situation that\u2019s deeply complex. It would take two hours for me to give a rundown of what it\u2019s like. I made a lot of things happen. Artistically, socially, my time there was important, but it was not sustainable. But what has been very clear is that all the things I was trying to bring to the company were things that deeply mattered to me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Designing an Active, Healthier City", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byFixesThis is not just a New York phenomenon. Mass urbanization has caused populations the world over to reduce the amount of time they spend moving their bodies. But the root of the problem runs deep in a city\u2019s infrastructure.Safety, graffiti, proximity to a park, and even the appeal of stairwells all play roles in whether someone chooses to be active or not. But only recently have urban developers begun giving enough priority to these factors.Planners in New York have now begun employing a method known as \u201cactive design\u201d to solve the problem. The approach is part of a global movement to get urbanites onto their streets and enjoying their surroundings on foot, bike or public transport.Even adding items as straightforward as benches and lighting to a streetscape can greatly increase the likelihood of someone\u2019s choosing to walk, she said.This may seem obvious, but without evidence its importance could be overlooked. \u201cWe\u2019ve now established that\u2019s actually the case,\u201d said Frank.How can things change? According to Frank, four areas are critical: transportation, recreation, buildings and access to food.In buildings, one focus is on whether people will opt to use the stairs.Have you ever stopped to think why you would take the stairs? Or what might dissuade you from riding the elevator? Quite a few factors affect this otherwise subliminal decision: their location, their proximity to the entrance of a building, their lighting, their grandeur, their odor, etc.\u201cWe really want stairs to be enticing,\u201d said Frank. \u201cSo things like natural light, views onto a second-story landing, those kind of things pull people along.\u201dSeemingly small things, she added, can help people change unhealthy routines. \u201cJust six flights of stairs a day greatly reduces the risk of stroke in men, and also offsets the average annual weight gain of an American,\u201d said Frank. But there is a problem: Do alluring stairwells exist, or could they be restored where they have been allowed to deteriorate, in the areas where they are most needed?\u201cIf you look at a lot of buildings, they might not have safe stairwells,\u201d said Carol Horowitz, an associate professor of health policy and medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine who is trying to stem a high incidence of overweight and severe diabetes among her patients in Harlem.\u201cThere are bike rentals all throughout New York City, but they haven\u2019t come up north to East Harlem,\u201d she added. \u201dThere\u2019s malls people can walk in \u2014 they\u2019re not in East Harlem.\u201d The same can be said of other underserved neighborhoods, including much of the Bronx. \u201cAccess is the big issue,\u201d said Frank. \u201cPoorer neighborhoods have less access to this infrastructure.\u201dIn other areas, meanwhile, some things are changing.Altman and Frank have been helping to redesign the streets of New York City, and the buildings found on them, through their respective organizations.\u201cThis has increased the number of people gathering and walking more,\u201d Frank said.Community nonprofit organizations are now able to apply to create plazas in their neighborhoods, and a number of them have sprung up in scattered areas. The most prominent, perhaps, is a 25-block pedestrian walkway that stretches south from Times Square toward Union Square along Broadway, complete with room for stands where local vendors do business with the passers-by.\u201cThis program was one of the first to make use of active design strategies,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne of the most congested major traffic arteries was closed off for pedestrians and it was a crazy experiment that worked.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a really thoughtful building right from the streetscape to the fencing and window guards,\u201d Frank said. As a part of the experimentation, a randomized population was chosen to live there, in order to accurately study any benefits the building provided to human health.\u201cWomen have changed from obese to overweight,\u201d Frank said, and have experienced hip-to-waist ratio improvements. In surveys, 58 percent of residents reported an increase in the number of flights of stairs they climbed weekly, and in interviews others described feeling inspired to live healthier, Frank said.The Center for Active Design is now partnering with Mount Sinai Hospital to replicate the experimentation in a new affordable housing development named Prospect Plaza, in central Brooklyn.\u201cWe would very much like to see this become the status quo, like sustainable design has become the norm in good design practice,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are projects and places all over the U.K., including housing schemes, parks, playgrounds and changes to streets,\u201d said Rachel Toms, a program leader at the Design Council. To address weight problems among young children, her organization has advised local councils and organizations in central London on projects that include changing the design of new playgrounds and play equipment to make them more inviting.\u201cDesigners worked with children to come up with play equipment that the kids scramble all over and challenge themselves,\u201d Toms said. The playground was also intended to improve social cohesion in a multicultural and underserved part of London, while also appealing to different age groups. \u201cThe key point was to be inclusive,\u201d Toms said.In its campaign against obesity, the Design Council is hewing close to the pattern used at Arbor House in New York.\u201cCurrently there is big housing demand in the U.K.,\u201d said Toms, adding that \u201cit\u2019s an enormous opportunity to build great neighborhoods that are appealing, mixed use, offer lots of activities and resilient for the future.\u201d She emphasizes that Britain\u2019s national economy also benefits alongside public health.Toms, Frank and Altman all stress that active design is not difficult to do and can have a large social payoff.\u201cPeople need to love where they live and where they work,\u201d said Toms, adding that they also need to be \u201cin a place that really boosts their health, not making them unhealthy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Canon representatives in the country could not be reached.International companies that have financial deals with relatives of Mr. Hun Sen risk violating United States anticorruption laws and should consider severing their business ties with the family, the report said.The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which became law in 1977, prohibits American companies and companies listed on a United States stock exchange from providing anything of value to a foreign official to influence a decision or gain an improper business advantage.Mr. Hun Sen, 63, is a former commander of the Khmer Rouge, whose rule of terror in Cambodia lasted from 1975 to 1979. One of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, he came to power in 1985 and refused to step aside in 1993 after he was voted out of office. Critics say he has relied on brutality and intimidation to remain in power. He has said he plans to stay in office for another decade.Patrick Alley, director of Global Witness, called on foreign companies to examine their ties with the prime minister\u2019s family and ensure that they were not contributing to a corrupt government.\u201cIt\u2019s time for international partners and investors to recognize that Cambodia is a dictatorship and is likely to become a dynastic one,\u201d he said in an interview.The report does not specify what business deals American companies may have struck with members of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s family. Many of the foreign companies named by Global Witness sell consumer products in the Cambodian market.One relative cited in the report is Sok Sopheak, the wife of a nephew of Hun Sen, who chairs iOne, Cambodia\u2019s leading Apple retailer. She could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.Hun Mana, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s eldest daughter, appears to be the most active in business of his children, with reported holdings of more than $66 million and an interest in at least 22 companies, the report said. Her interests include media, energy, tourism, aviation, finance and telecommunications, Global Witness said. She also is chairwoman of an advertising business that includes numerous global companies among its clients, the report said. Reached by phone, she declined to comment.Global Witness said that it had contacted all the Hun Sen family members named in the report and that only one, his son-in-law Sok Puthyvuth, had responded. In an email to the organization, he said he had gone into business because his family did not want him involved in government.\u201cI can understand your assumption that I have abused my power to get to where I am today, but I can assure you that I take seriously the challenge of building a responsible and respected private sector group,\u201d he said, according to the report.Mr. Alley said Global Witness would be contacting international companies in the coming days requesting that they evaluate their business dealings with the prime minister\u2019s family.The United States is Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partner, and the two countries have about $3 billion in trade annually. The governments in Washington and Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, are negotiating a bilateral investment treaty to bring additional United States investment to Cambodia.\u201cThe family\u2019s holdings span the majority of Cambodia\u2019s most lucrative business sectors as well as those characterized by high levels of corruption, human rights abuses and environmental damage,\u201d the report said.Neou Vannarin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Advertisement"}

Lew, returned to London on Thursday to meet with his British counterpart, after meeting with his predecessor earlier in the week. The last-minute schedule change reflected not just the close American-British relationship, but the global desire to minimize any disruption from the so-called Brexit.The British central bank on Thursday again pointed to potential signs of stress after the referendum. Some businesses were beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment, while consumer sentiment was weakening.Even so, the central bank decided to take a wait-and-see attitude before making another move. The financial system, it noted, looked resilient after the referendum, while banks remained on solid ground in terms of capital.\u201cThe Bank of England has decided that patience is a virtue,\u201d said Paul Diggle, an economist at Aberdeen Asset Management.Mr. Carney has sought to reassure investors, saying the central bank has several tools available to stabilize the market.He made 250 billion pounds, or about $331 billion, available as a backstop to keep the system functioning. The central bank has also lowered the amount of capital that banks are required to keep in reserve, which would in theory allow them to lend more to consumers and businesses.But the central bank, for now, is keeping those two major tools in reserve.The Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the bond purchasing program at the same level, \u00a3375 billion, as it has been for the last four years.\u201cThe committee had taken some reassurance from the evidence that markets had continued to function effectively throughout the period,\u201d the central bank\u2019s minutes said. \u201cThe overall resilience of the U.K. financial system, and the flexibility of the regulatory framework, had allowed the impact of the referendum result to be dampened rather than amplified.\u201dThe next steps will depend on the data.The central bank is expected to unveil in August its updated forecast for inflation, an important metric for monetary policy decisions. It also will keep its eye on the extent to which economic activity has slowed since the referendum \u2014 from housing starts to hiring.One member of the committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, already felt a cut was warranted, pointing in part to the \u201coutlook for medium-term inflation \u2014 even taking into account the boost from the lower level of sterling.\u201d And the committee broadly suggested a rate cut was likely next month.\u201cWhatever the economic merits or demerits of cutting interest rates at this juncture, the lack of clear direction is more likely to add to economic uncertainty and therefore be detrimental to demand and the economy,\u201d said Angus Armstrong, the director of macroeconomics at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Most rejected it, but the local government sent in bulldozers anyway.\u201cThere were several hundred police on the scene, and they wouldn\u2019t allow us to get anywhere near the farm,\u201d said Mr. Mo, a 51-year-old with dirt caked under his close-trimmed fingernails. \u201cMy heart ached and I cried because I was really upset.\u201dThe coal plant is part of a huge and expensive government push to reinvigorate the Chinese economy. Officials have fast-tracked the plant in recent months along with scores of bridges, railways, factories and other construction projects to counter an economic slowdown. China on Friday reported that its economy grew 6.7 percent in the quarter ended in June compared with a year ago, a level that matches the slowest pace since the global financial crisis.Such revival efforts have worked before. Seven years ago, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, China unleashed a lending-and-spending binge that spared the country the painful recessions that struck the United States and Europe.But times have changed, economists say. With China\u2019s debt levels mounting and its industries plagued with unneeded factories, China\u2019s traditional tactics don\u2019t pack the same punch.Instead of new growth, \u201cwe\u2019re going to continue to see a rise in debt levels, and credit not really having the impact that it could to support the economy,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.After the financial crisis, as now, a lot of the government money went into areas where China already has too many idle or underused factories, like steel, manufacturing and coal-fired power plants. \u201cCredit creation is driving a rising misallocation of resources,\u201d Mr. Magnus said.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The Leizhou plant is one of scores of new coal-fired plants being built across China, representing about 200 gigawatts of generating capacity, according to estimates from Greenpeace, or about twice the total capacity of Britain.Coal-fired power plants, in particular, look increasingly unnecessary. Last year, China\u2019s coal plants \u2014 which generally aim to operate an average of about 5,500 hours per year \u2014 operated at an average of about 4,300 hours, according to Alvin Cheng and Jenny Huang, energy analysts at Fitch Ratings. Fitch expects average use to fall to fewer than 3,600 hours by next year.\u201cThere\u2019s so much overcapacity, there is no point in building a plant like this,\u201d Lin Boqiang, an energy expert at Xiamen University, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis would be a waste of investment,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as this.\u201dBuilt by an arm of the state-run company China Datang Corporation, the Leizhou plant will be able to produce up to 2 gigawatts of power \u2014 more than the total coal-fired power generation capacity installed in the state of New York.Datang had been trying to build the plant for a decade but started construction in earnest only in December, after receiving final approval around the time that many other infrastructure projects around China were getting the green light or expedited. Officials said antipollution equipment will make it a \u201cnear zero emission\u201d plant that will be \u201cinternationally advanced.\u201dLocal officials and Datang executives did not respond to requests for comment.Leizhou is one of the poorer places in Guangdong Province, according to official data. Industry is scant here, although the province includes one of China\u2019s main manufacturing hubs. In Leizhou\u2019s main urban area, giant billboards tower over street intersections warning against the dangers of taking drugs \u2014 locals say methamphetamine and ketamine are most common.Mr. Mo is one of hundreds of villagers who say their livelihoods and the local environment are at risk. For generations, people in villages here along the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin have lived off the land and the sea, farming, fishing and processing sea salt. The ample summer rains and subtropical climate lend themselves to growing fruit.Some residents are skeptical that the plant will bring jobs for locals, saying that most likely it will import workers from other areas.\u201cThe project brings us no benefits, and we have no compensation,\u201d said Zhou Shu, 35, a fisherman who was playing cards with friends in the shade of a tree near a village store on a recent afternoon.They worry instead that related construction along the coastline could destroy their livelihoods. \u201cWe live by the sea, so we depend on it to make a living,\u201d he said.The big worry for many is pollution. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of land to farm in our village,\u201d said Liang Zhuang, a fisherman from Gangcai whose family has been making a living from the sea here for generations. \u201cSo if there\u2019s pollution in the sea, we will lose the main safeguard of our livelihood.\u201dThe land seizures began two years ago after a number of farmers declined buyout offers. The money local officials offered to Mr. Mo, the onetime mango and jujube farmer, who made about $1,500 a year selling the fruit he grew, was less than half what Chinese law requires for official land purchases.On a recent steamy afternoon, with a rooster crowing in his backyard, Mr. Mo showed a petition against the land seizures that was signed by around 400 villagers, who included their thumbprints in red ink on the reams of sweat-stained paper.

Nearly a month after the country\u2019s ill-advised referendum on union membership, it is becoming clear just how bad it will be.The European Commission is even more pessimistic. It says Britain\u2019s economy could shrink 0.3 percent next year under its \u201csevere\u201d scenario. Both bodies also warned that the uncertainty caused by Brexit will slow growth in the rest of Europe. The I.M.F. lowered its forecasts modestly for global growth in 2016 and 2017.British and European leaders need to take these forecasts seriously as they negotiate how to remove Britain from the union and structure a new economic relationship. Britain trades extensively with the E.U., and London is the biggest financial hub in the union. Economists say a disruptive breakup would be bad for everybody, leading to job losses and a spike in the prices in Britain of basic necessities like food that it imports from Europe. The pound has already fallen about 11 percent against the dollar and 9 percent against the euro since the referendum, raising prices in Britain for imports of goods and services.But a long delay would carry risks, too, by increasing uncertainty, which would depress business investment and consumer spending. What is clear is that Britain now finds itself in a no-win position.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "By the Sea Where the Sirens Called, an Italian Town Beckons Tourists With Art", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byPraiano JournalPraiano, a town of about 2,000 people, is not blessed with an alluring wide beachfront or an elegant seaside piazza where tourists can gather for a glass of prosecco. The beach was the victim of a landslide 90 years ago, and the town sprawls instead along the coast\u2019s steep cliffs.\u201cWe wanted to give a strong identity to the town and make it a final destination for visitors, not just a place they pass through,\u201d said Roberto Pontecorvo, a board member of Agenda Praiano, a community association founded in 2013 to jump-start the town\u2019s sense of civic responsibility and, hopefully, its economy.Praiano is not a place to gawk at from the comfort of an air-conditioned bus. It must be savored at a slow pace, if only because many of the itineraries require steep climbs up and down terraced slopes and alleyways, offering grand vistas of the coast as a prize. Residents boast that the town offers the most beautiful sunsets on the Amalfi Coast.Like many towns along the coast, Praiano has a tradition of ceramic decorations, including a network of centuries-old small religious shrines made of majolica tiles.Ceramic tiles are also used to mark street names and offer admonitions, like picking up after one\u2019s dog. In the large square in front of the town\u2019s ceramic domed cathedral, a sign warns, \u201cNo soccer playing allowed.\u201d But on a recent warm night, a group of young boys boisterously challenged the ban under a string of colorful lights.Giuseppina De Rosa, who is retired, created a colorful raised garden of flowers and scented herbs \u2014 thyme, fiery chili peppers and wild fennel \u2014 along a narrow alley that borders one of the walks. The patch has become a tourist draw, she said, \u201cperhaps because it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201dThe planners included artworks by eight artists with ties to the area. The pieces, 150 in total, were inspired by landscapes, traditions and mythology. After all, this is the area where Ulysses is said to have resisted the call of the Sirens, a theme several artists touched upon.\u201cThe idea was to install these ceramics in such a beautiful place, where people built their homes and terraced gardens are inserted in nature,\u201d said Patrizia Marchi, one of the artists. Her walk, which includes colorful masks of humans and animals, climbs from Praiano into woods that lead to a Dominican convent. \u201cIt seems like a magical site.\u201dPaolo Sandulli, a ceramist and sculptor, instead focused on capturing the spirit of the fishermen who once provided the bulk of the town\u2019s economy, before tourism became a more prosperous alternative for many families.\u201cI wanted to recount that old world of the sea,\u201d keeping the memory of long-gone fishermen alive, said Mr. Sandulli, who works out of an old tower on the beach.Mr. Sandulli\u2019s seven terra-cotta panels line a walking path that leads to Marina di Praia beach, a pebbly stretch wedged between the cliffsides.On a recent afternoon, a man with a wheelbarrow laden with cases of wine walked down the path, sweating in the hot sun. \u201cDown here, they transport everything by hand,\u201d Mr. Sandulli said.The idea for the project began with a small group of Praianesi who contributed their cash and time. Along with the town\u2019s City Hall, the association received a 250,000-euro grant (about $275,000) from the European Union, one of 31 projects funded in the Campania region.While increasing tourism was the central goal, the group also wanted to get more residents involved. Building up social capital was important to the project\u2019s long-term viability, they said. Most Praiano residents work in tourism-related businesses in other towns along the coast, something the planners hope to change.In preparation for the inauguration of the itineraries in late May, for example, a group of dedicated residents spruced up the streets, whitewashing graffiti, burying open cable lines and fixing town signs.Giovanni Di Martino, Praiano\u2019s mayor, said his administration had adopted the association\u2019s plan and broadened it to include the restoration of religious shrines.The request for funding from the European Union also included the restoration of 15th-century frescoes in a local convent and the recovery of the walking paths that link Praiano to the \u201cPath of the Gods,\u201d a spectacular if physically challenging footpath high along the coast from the town of Agerola to Praiano.\u201cWe tried to involve the entire town around a broader notion of tourism whereby even the corner of a small house can be an element of discovery,\u201d the mayor said.\u201cSeen from the outside, this may not seem like a big achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the south, where there is no tradition of doing things from the bottom up, it shows that you can actually do things with public funding, but without being connected\u201d to politicians or interests.\u201cIt\u2019s a small step for Praiano but a leap forward for southern Italy,\u201d he added.So far, the local reaction has been a mix of skepticism and pride, as dozens turned out for the project\u2019s inauguration.\u201cThere is still much work to be done,\u201d said Raffaele Cuccurullo, the town\u2019s council member responsible for tourism. \u201cThere are still people who are convinced that we don\u2019t live off tourism, so they don\u2019t care if the town is dirty.\u201dYet Mr. Cuccurullo, who is also a carpenter, sounded an optimistic note, saying work orders had increased as more local homes were transformed into bed-and-breakfasts or vacation homes. \u201cThe more people come, the more activities will open, like restaurants and bars,\u201d he said.Mr. Pontecorvo, the board member of Agenda Praiano, offered a different goal. \u201cWe needed to get locals to believe in their own town,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

That would lead to fewer choices and higher premiums for individuals and employers in places like New York, Los Angeles and Kansas City, Mo. The mergers could also hurt doctors and hospitals, because they would have less bargaining power against the larger insurers when negotiating reimbursement rates.These two proposed mergers are the culmination of a series of deals in the health care industry that have reduced the number of insurers and caused the consolidation of hospitals and doctors\u2019 practices everywhere. Every merger seems to compel another as competitors bulk up, lest they find themselves with less leverage in negotiations between insurers and providers.There are clearly benefits to better-coordinated care, but that does not justify all of these mergers. Coordination can often take place without concentrating so much market power in the hands of a few companies. And rather than making the system more efficient, recent research has found that increased concentration has driven up the cost of health care.The Anthem-Cigna deal would affect national corporations that buy insurance for employees. In its lawsuit, the government says the two companies together control at least 50 percent of the national employer-based insurance market. They also compete over local employers in 35 metropolitan areas, like New York, Los Angeles and St. Louis. Eliminating that competition would increase their ability to demand higher fees from corporations.Officials shouldn\u2019t allow any merger unless it is structured in a way that improves competitive conditions and helps consumers through lower prices or better service.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Rude Awakening", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 IT\u2019S official now. Puerto Rico has about as much sovereignty as a United States colony.The word came down from Washington in mid-June, in two Supreme Court rulings that insult our pride as self-governing United States citizens.One said our courts lacked the power of state courts to try local criminals separately after federal prosecutors weighed in. The other said we must go hat in hand to Congress if our public utilities are to get debt relief. Unlike states, we cannot help them seek bankruptcy protection.A third insult \u2014 from Congress \u2014 came as we reached the brink of default two weeks ago. As it finally consented to debt relief, the Senate also approved an oversight board that could tell our elected government how to handle our finances.In vulgar street talk here, Puerto Rico has been stripped naked and put on show to be shamed.This after we\u2019d grown up being told we had a unique, privileged relationship with the United States \u2014 we were full citizens, free to migrate north, and autonomous to govern our own affairs. A bit like a state, without surrendering our Latin personality.But now it is clear that was a charade. We\u2019ve learned how much it left us at the mercy of an unsympathetic Washington. Even as he offered debt relief, the Senate\u2019s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, rubbed it in. \u201cThe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is in crisis,\u201d he declared.Territory? Really? I thought \u2014 as did Justice Stephen G. Breyer in his dissent from the prosecutorial powers ruling \u2014 that Washington granted us a far better status in 1952. As the United Nations pushed for global decolonization, Justice Breyer wrote, we and the Truman administration entered into a social contract that made us neither colony nor state, but something new, called a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d in English and, in Spanish, an \"estado libre asociado\u201d (free associated state).My generation, the baby boomers, was told autonomy made us equal but exceptional as citizens, and indeed there were advantages. Tax breaks initiated in the 1970s attracted employers like pharmaceutical producers. Billions of federal dollars flowed to us. All we had to do was behave, serve in the military when called (I was wounded in Vietnam as a combat medic), and not call ourselves a \u201ccolony.\u201dDissenters advocating statehood warned that \u201cself-government\u201d was a mirage without a vote in Congress, or for president. Still, Congress never showed interest in accepting a bicultural Hispanic state that had more workers than jobs.There were occasional nationalist uprisings. But Puerto Ricans have never been good at rebellion. Instead, we jabbered away about our politics. And every few years we replayed the same referendum: Statehood? Independence? Stay autonomous?A clear majority never emerged, partly because the plebiscites were just theater. The results weren\u2019t binding on us, nor on Congress. And we didn\u2019t want to fracture a close-knit island society over that.So we drifted, even as globalization began undermining what competitive advantages we had; in 1996, Congress even withdrew the tax exemptions that had lured statesiders to invest in industry here.Today, those industries, jobs and many stateside banks have fled, private employment has cratered, and our debts are due. Our main employer is our destitute government. Emigration and violent crime have soared. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of compatriots have left, bringing to more than five million the number of Puerto Ricans living in the states, according to the Pew Research Center; local demographers estimate that only 3.4 million remain here.An image, passed down many years ago by my grandfather, haunts me now, in this terrible summer.Grandpa Chu was a little boy during the Spanish-American War, living near where the last, short battle for Puerto Rico was fought at Asomante, in the island\u2019s central mountains. Afterward, United States troops searched house to house for arms, ordering inhabitants to stay home.The first \u201cAmericano\u201d whom Grandpa Chu saw frightened him; he had eyes like hailstones in a freckle-spattered face. All the soldiers were stone-faced and humorless, even when showered with local hospitality. He stared at them, not knowing what to expect.Now I feel something similar, after the triple whammy of political reality we have endured. I ask how we can help ourselves. This much has become clear to me: Puerto Ricans must first rediscover our inner political strengths, and unite to demand that Congress, within a decade, allows us a binding referendum on our island\u2019s status.The choices would be statehood, with whatever consequences for our culture and economy, or independence, with its own economic pitfalls and challenges.\u201cAutonomy\u201d would not be a choice. It has been drained of all appeal by promises broken over the decades, and indignities recently inflicted; it should be put to rest as the sham it was all along.This won\u2019t be easy. Puerto Ricans will have to organize politically where members of Congress can hear us \u2014 their own districts. For that, we can call on perhaps four million enfranchised compatriots of voting age stateside to form a huge bloc to campaign \u2014 and vote \u2014 in our support.In short, we must demand the respect due every United States citizen by using that most powerful weapon of democracy: one person, one vote.Rafael Matos, a former writer and editor at The Associated Press, The Miami Herald and The San Juan Star, is a co-editor of \u201cNoticia y Yo,\u201d an anthology of Puerto Rican journalism from 1935 to 1980.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Power of Altruism", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byWestern society is built on the assumption that people are fundamentally selfish. Machiavelli and Hobbes gave us influential philosophies built on human selfishness. Sigmund Freud gave us a psychology of selfishness. Children, he wrote, \u201care completely egoistic; they feel their needs intensely and strive ruthlessly to satisfy them.\u201dClassical economics adopts a model that says people are primarily driven by material self-interest. Political science assumes that people are driven to maximize their power.But this worldview is clearly wrong. In real life, the push of selfishness is matched by the pull of empathy and altruism. This is not Hallmark card sentimentalism but scientific fact: As babies our neural connections are built by love and care. We have evolved to be really good at cooperation and empathy. We are strongly motivated to teach and help others.When we build academic disciplines and social institutions upon suppositions of selfishness we\u2019re missing the motivations that drive people much of the time.Worse, if you expect people to be selfish, you can actually crush their tendency to be good.In 2001, the Boston fire commissioner ended his department\u2019s policy of unlimited sick days and imposed a limit of 15 per year. Those who exceeded the limit had their pay docked. Suddenly what had been an ethic to serve the city was replaced by a utilitarian paid arrangement. The number of firefighters who called in sick on Christmas and New Year\u2019s increased by tenfold over the previous year.To simplify, there are two lenses people can use to see any situation: the economic lens or the moral lens.When you introduce a financial incentive you prompt people to see their situation through an economic lens. Instead of following their natural bias toward reciprocity, service and cooperation, you encourage people to do a selfish cost-benefit calculation. They begin to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in this for me?\u201dBy evoking an economic motivation, you often get worse outcomes. Imagine what would happen to a marriage if both people went in saying, \u201cI want to get more out of this than I put in.\u201d The prospects of such a marriage would not be good.Many of our commitments, professional or civic, are like that. To be a good citizen, to be a good worker, you often have to make an altruistic commitment to some group or ideal, which will see you through those times when your job of citizenship is hard and frustrating. Whether you are a teacher serving students or a soldier serving your country or a clerk who likes your office mates, the moral motivation is much more powerful than the financial motivations. Arrangements that arouse the financial lens alone are just messing everything up.In 1776, Adam Smith defined capitalism as a machine that takes private self-interest and organizes it to produce general prosperity. A few years later America\u2019s founders created a democracy structured to take private factional competition and, through checks and balances, turn it into deliberative democracy. Both rely on a low but steady view of human nature and try to turn private vice into public virtue.But back then, there were plenty of institutions that promoted the moral lens to balance the economic lens: churches, guilds, community organizations, military service and honor codes.Since then, the institutions that arouse the moral lens have withered while the institutions that manipulate incentives \u2014 the market and the state \u2014 have expanded. Now economic, utilitarian thinking has become the normal way we do social analysis and see the world. We\u2019ve wound up with a society that is less cooperative, less trusting, less effective and less lovely.By assuming that people are selfish, by prioritizing arrangements based on selfishness, we have encouraged selfish frames of mind. Maybe it\u2019s time to upend classical economics and political science. Maybe it\u2019s time to build institutions that harness people\u2019s natural longing to do good.Advertisement"}

It is powered invisibly by forces that any city would envy: a green grid that is highly energy-efficient and a superfast one-gigabit internet connection.\u201cPeople would kill for this internet connection,\u201d said Tom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cFor us to grow our tech network, we needed to double down on fiber network.\u201d The new Burlington economy is going to be knowledge- and skills-based, he added.This digital superhighway runs through beautiful Burlington, a small city sandwiched between the distant Green Mountains and the 125-mile-long Lake Champlain. It is an outlier as far as emerging technology hubs and so-called smart cities go. But Burlington, which has a lower unemployment rate than Silicon Valley, is now spawning a wave of technology pioneers.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give people an unfair advantage,\u201d said David Bradbury, president and fund manager at VCET. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing too big that you can\u2019t dream here. And the snowball is moving faster.\u201d\u201cSmart cities and new technologies have the potential to change everything,\u201d said Mr. Schirling, a former Burlington police chief. \u201cWhen you put in the right building blocks, you get a collision of ideas, which can become self-generating. It\u2019s attitude and infrastructure. \u201dA result is that Burlington, once a timber port, has a stunningly low unemployment rate of 2.3 percent. On the downside, the city is also experiencing a skilled-labor shortage; hundreds of coding jobs alone languish on job boards. Burlington was named a TechHire city by the White House in 2016 to help link local employers with local workers, and to help these workers get the skills they need for a fast-changing economy. The designation does not come with funding, but it does help Burlington get grants for free training.The TechHire mandate in Burlington is to train 400 technology workers through 2020.\u201cWe want younger people to know that there are career opportunities here,\u201d Mr. Torti said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to grow our work force rather than importing it.\u201dA nonprofit organization known as Vermont Hitec is a crucial part of that vision.It works in partnership with local companies to offer boot camps online and in classrooms that teach skills such as medical coding and programming that lead to good-paying jobs with benefits.Vermont Information Processing, which develops software for the beverage industry, has been working with Vermont Hitec so that it can retrain or recruit employees as its business grows and it becomes less interested in outsourcing.Colleges like the University of Vermont, which offers a biotechnology program, and Champlain College are also helping solve the employment puzzle. Champlain College offers degrees in high-demand careers like digital forensics and game programming, along with a special program for federal employees who can get online degrees in high-growth fields.\u201cWe\u2019re responsive, nimble and entrepreneurial,\u201d said Don Laackman, president of Champlain College. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection between employment needs and sources offered.\u201dBurlington got its first push into technology start-ups when IDX Systems, a health care software maker, was founded there in 1969. It was sold to General Electric about 10 years ago.\u201cIDX created a lot of wealth and talent, and these people could be angel investors,\u201d Mr. Bradbury said. \u201cIt was a tipping point.\u201d\u201cIn the future, there will be several $50 million to $100 million exits here,\u201d Mr. Lane said, \u201calong with other larger ones mixed in.\u201dHe credits Vermont\u2019s community and socially conscious spirit with his success. \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy the philosophy that we had to be in a hot spot,\u201d said Mr. Lane, who returned to Vermont after working in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cEven Zuckerberg realized that he could have been anywhere to build Facebook.\u201d\u201cIn Burlington, I can call anyone and learn from their experience,\u201d said Ms. Dibble, who was born in a small Vermont town with no ZIP code. \u201cThe degrees of separation are lessened here. There\u2019s a shared Vermonti-ness.\u201dThe energy to power GameTheory\u2019s innovation comes from Burlington\u2019s green grid, which is owned by the city. The state has long been one of the country\u2019s greenest. But in 2014, Burlington upped the ante by turning only to wind, water and biomass to power the city \u2014 one of the first cities in the nation to do so. There are also incentives for reducing energy. Landlords, for example, can choose to have free energy audits, and more than 100 have done so.Other Burlington businesses also work hard to save energy on their own. Seventh Generation, which makes environmentally conscious household products and was founded in Burlington, gives its employees bonuses for helping reduce greenhouse gases. Like many other companies in Burlington, Seventh Generation also aims to be socially responsible and was formed as a B Corp, which means it has to meet social, environmental, accountability and transparency standards.With this focus on energy efficiency, the city\u2019s electricity rates have not risen in eight years, said Neale Lunderville, general manager of the Burlington Electric Department. \u201cAnd there are no rate increases on the horizon,\u201d he said, \u201csince we\u2019re not chasing the next kilowatt-hour.\u201dElectric cars even have their own parking spaces with chargers.Burlington will eventually become a net-zero city, said the mayor, Miro Weinberger. \u201cOur isolation promotes a commitment to pride and place,\u201d he said.The city that helped propel Senator Bernie Sanders also has its own nonprofit urban farm called the Intervale Center. The land was once an abandoned dumping ground with old tires and cars. That space now contains 350 acres with bee hives, commercial farms, greenhouses and other projects. Through its food hub, local foods are delivered to area businesses and individuals.Intervale\u2019s farm incubator, a five-year program, even teaches new farmers the ropes, said Travis Marcotte, executive director of Intervale Center. \u201cThey then transition out of the Intervale,\u201d he said, \u201cSo we\u2019re spinning off whole farms.\u201dIt is a hopeful message, Mr. Marcotte said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Path to Prosperity Is Blue", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionHOW can America\u2019s leaders foster broad prosperity? For most Republicans \u2014 including Donald J. Trump \u2014 the main answer is to \u201ccut and extract\u201d: Cut taxes and business regulations, including pesky restrictions on the extraction of natural resources, and the economy will boom.Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are united by the conviction that cutting taxes \u2014 especially on corporations and the wealthy \u2014 is what drives growth.A look at the states, however, suggests that they\u2019re wrong. Red states dominated by Republicans embrace cut and extract. Blue states dominated by Democrats do much more to maintain their investments in education, infrastructure, urban quality of life and human services \u2014 investments typically financed through more progressive state and local taxes. And despite what you may have heard, blue states are generally doing better.We identify blue states as the 18 that supported the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and red states as the 22 that backed the Republican candidate (alternative definitions yield similar results). If you compare averages, blue states are substantially richer (even adjusting for cost of living) and their residents are better educated. Companies there do more research and development and produce more patents. Students score better on tests of basic science-oriented skills like math.How can conservative commentators claim that red states dominate? A tactic favored by Mr. Trump\u2019s economic adviser Stephen Moore is to rely on measures goosed by population expansion, like job growth or a state economy\u2019s size.That\u2019s like portraying India as a beacon of prosperity because it has one of the biggest economies in the world and creates millions of jobs annually. Economic performance is measured in the lives of individuals, not aggregates.Another favorite approach is to cherry-pick a handful of red states with decent records and contrast them with the most troubled blue states. With Texas now stumbling as oil prices fall, the new conservative favorite is Utah.Utah\u2019s low poverty rate and long life expectancy are impressive, but spotlighting a single state ignores the more numerous red states that dominate the lowest ranks of state performance \u2014 whether for life expectancy, obesity, rates of violent crime and incarceration, or labor force participation of prime-age workers.Many of these differences are longstanding. Our reddest region, the South, has long been the poorest part, too. The gap between today\u2019s red and blue states was enormous for much of the 20th century. It then narrowed substantially, thanks in part to huge federal transfers to the poorest states to raise them toward the national level.Yet income differences between red and blue states stopped closing around 1980 and, in some revealing cases, widened. For example, Texas and Massachusetts \u2014 often considered exemplars of the red and blue models \u2014 had almost converged by 1980. Since then, Texas\u2019 per capita income has fallen significantly relative to Massachusetts\u2019. The same is true of Utah.Yes, the cost of living is higher in Massachusetts than it is in Texas \u2014 by about 11 percent in the last few years, according to recent government calculations by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But even this significant difference (surely longstanding) can\u2019t close the widened gap.This red-blue divergence is all the more striking because red states still receive much more in federal spending relative to the federal taxes their residents pay. In other words, blue states are generally outperforming red states even while heavily subsidizing them.Why are red states no longer consistently gaining ground? An important reason is that modern knowledge economies increase the rewards for education, research and development and urban hubs that promote the exchange of ideas and development of talent. This has made local conditions more important even in this age of globalization. And the places where these effects have been most successfully promoted are overwhelmingly blue.Yes, there are fast-growing red state economies. But many, like North Dakota, look more like Saudi Arabia than Silicon Valley. Not all states are sitting on huge fossil fuel reserves, and tapping these reserves isn\u2019t costless. It creates pollution and other problems \u2014 negative externalities \u2014 that go beyond states\u2019 borders, notably the costs associated with carbon emissions.Not all blue states are economically successful, of course, and not all red states are struggling. Some red state innovation hubs like Austin, Tex., are thriving (even if these \u201cblue islands\u201d are at odds with state governments over wage rules and public investments). Yet few of the cities that do the most research or advanced manufacturing or that produce the most patents are in red states.On the other side, blue states have found it difficult to maintain their historic investments in education and infrastructure. In some cases, state policies are to blame. Connecticut, Illinois and Rhode Island are now having to deal with badly underfinanced pension funds.But blue states have also been affected by cutbacks in federal funding for research, infrastructure and higher education \u2014 a reminder that federal policy still matters enormously.And blue states have higher average inequality than red states do (in part because of their success in promoting high-paying jobs), and their dense urban economies continue to harbor troublingly deep pockets of disadvantage.Local restrictions that stymie construction of new affordable housing play a big role. These policies not only hurt less affluent residents; they also make these states poorer because the most innovative cities are less dense and hence less productive than they could be.We should tackle these problems. But we should remember that the key drivers of growth are science, education and innovation, not low taxes, lax regulations or greater exploitation of natural resources.And we should be worried, whatever our partisan tilt, that leading conservatives promote an economic model so disconnected from the true sources of prosperity.Jacob S.

The minister of state in the vice president\u2019s office, reached on her cellphone, hung up.\u201cIf he\u2019s leaving the hotel, the country needs to know,\u201d said Mr. Zvorwadza, the leader of the protesters who have held demonstrations outside the hotel since last December. \u201cThis is the syndrome we are fighting. A public figure must be accountable to his citizens.\u201dGiven the dire conditions, the vice president\u2019s stay in the presidential suite has even raised eyebrows among the president\u2019s traditional allies.\u201cIt\u2019s something unheard-of where a vice president can remain in a hotel for so long,\u201d said Cephas Msipa, a retired politician who was a senior member of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party, known as ZANU-PF. \u201cHis behavior is quite strange.\u201dResponding to local reports that the couple had turned down a $3 million mansion, the vice president sounded annoyed last month.The hotel, which used to be part of the Sheraton chain, is owned by the Rainbow Tourism Group, a private company. The government owns the building, which was constructed by a company from the former Yugoslavia in the early 1980s.\u201cYugoslavia was our fair-weather friend from the war, so they got the contract,\u201d said Ibbo Mandaza, a former chairman of the Rainbow Tourism Group and a political scientist. \u201cThat\u2019s before the demise of Yugoslavia as an entity.\u201dEvery visiting head of state stayed in the 17th-floor presidential suite, Mr. Mandaza said, \u201cexcept for Qaddafi,\u201d the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, who, as was his habit on foreign visits, pitched his own tent in Harare.Mr. Mphoko had to temporarily vacate the presidential suite during a visit by President Xi Jinping of China and a subsequent one by President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone, according to a hotel manager and workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired.According to the manager, the government pays about $1,000 a day for the suite and meals on Mr. Mphoko\u2019s behalf. The manager and workers said that the vice president and his wife usually stayed inside the suite with a bodyguard, preferring to hold meetings and take their meals there.When reports of the vice president\u2019s extended stay first emerged last December, Mr. Zvorwadza, the protest leader who was taken away by the police last month, became enraged. A longtime activist and member of the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, Mr. Zvorwadza is also chairman of the National Vendors Union, an association of street hawkers.At a meeting, vendors discussed the need to repair a public toilet used by hundreds of members in the city center. With no help coming from the city, the vendors got a $400 estimate to fix the plumbing of the facility, known as the \u201cCopacabana Toilets\u201d after a restaurant that used to operate in the area. A member pointed out that the cost of one night in the presidential suite could more than cover the cost of fixing the toilet.\u201cWhy can\u2019t Mphoko just give us one night?\u201d the vendors asked, as they organized the first demonstration last December.Mr. Mphoko, now 76, moved into the hotel right after being named one of Zimbabwe\u2019s two vice presidents. A military leader during this country\u2019s war of liberation, he served as an intelligence officer in several embassies after Zimbabwe\u2019s independence in 1980, and eventually became ambassador to Botswana, Russia and South Africa. His family is a major shareholder in a supermarket chain called Choppies Zimbabwe, whose parent company\u2019s headquarters are in Botswana.Mr. Mphoko served as Choppies Zimbabwe\u2019s chairman before becoming vice president. Activists protesting his stay at the hotel have also called for a boycott of Choppies.In the Highlands neighborhood last week, a police officer stood watch before a large house identified as the vice president\u2019s future official residence. Workers could be seen carrying out renovations behind a high, concrete wall and tall pine trees.But even in the Highlands, the capital\u2019s budgetary problems were visible on the streets. The road leading to the house was dotted with potholes. Fraying of the paved surface made it difficult for two large vehicles to drive past each other. Workers were filling potholes and resurfacing parts of the road.\u201cThanks to the vice president for choosing to come and live in our area, our road has received a face-lift,\u201d said a resident of the block, Mike Kanduri, who was standing outside the gate of his home. \u201cWe pray he would come and truly live at the house.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}

Signs of the totoaba slaughter began showing up in the upper Gulf of California around 2011, says Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, head of marine mammal conservation and research for the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) in Mexico.Here are some additional reactions:China has a vital role to play in saving the vaquita by aggressively rooting out the trafficking of totoaba in Hong Kong and mainland China. The illegal gill-net fishing of totoaba in the northern Gulf of California is causing the vaquita\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perilous decline. Fortunately, just last month the United States and China made important commitments to reduce the impact of wildlife trafficking on totoaba. These commitments and the additional commitments made by Mexico and the United States offer a path for vaquita survival. It is critical for all three countries to live up to their promises\nBoth the Chinese government and nonprofit groups need urgently to address the demand issue with well thought out public education programs. Since the government banned the use of shark fins in government banquets, for example, and celebrity-fronted campaigns such as Wild Aid\u2019s effort with Yao Ming, it appears that demand for shark fins has dropped.  If both the vaquita and totoaba are to survive, China must become part of a multi-faceted solution, rather than the major market for an illegal marine product that is helping to drive the vaquita to extinction.FollowAdvertisement"}

Jobs, Mountains and, Yes, Weed", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported bySeated cafeteria-style in the main dining area one recent night, a young crowd, many in hoodies and yoga pants, were sampling dishes from seven local start-up restaurants. Udon noodles, tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and Venezuelan-style flatbreads were among the choices offered by entrepreneurial restaurateurs, most of them food-truck vendors hoping to make the leap to brick and mortar.Nothing cost more than $15.\u201cIt\u2019s good, solid cuisine at affordable prices,\u201d said Avanti\u2019s co-owner, Patrick O\u2019Neill. \u201cThat goes a long way with millennials.\u201dThe youthful party continues on many nights around the renovated Union Station in the trendy Lower Downtown district, known locally as LoDo, and along Larimer Street in River North, or RiNo. It was unclear on a recent evening whether there were more bars than signs supporting Bernie Sanders, but both were plentiful. Scruffy Murphy\u2019s Irish Pub, Los Chingones\u2019 rooftop bar and the Wynkoop Brewing Company (one of 65 microbreweries here, according to the Colorado Brewers Guild) were all doing a brisk business.As for the Vermont senator, so popular with millennials, he was depicted on a two-story painted wall mural \u2014 like something you\u2019d see in Los Angeles or Belfast celebrating heroes \u2014 with a fist raised and the slogan \u201cRise Together!\u201dAccording to a Brookings Institution analysis of population movement from 2009-14, the city had a net annual migration gain of 12,682 people ages 25 to 34, the highest of any metropolitan area in the United States. That means an average of 12,682 more millennials per year moved here than left, for each of the five years measured.Similarly, an analysis of census data by Zillow, the real estate website, found that 18- to 34-year-olds accounted for 35 percent of the city\u2019s population growth from 2010 to 2014, up from 26 percent in the first 10 years of the century.While definitions of a millennial vary (a widely used one is someone born from 1981 to 1997), it\u2019s clear that many of this generation are attracted to this city. One obvious reason is the economy: the city\u2019s is healthy \u2014 and hiring. Development Research Partners, a local research firm, found that of the 1.6 million jobs in metropolitan Denver, about 33.2 percent were held by 19- to 34-year-olds.Those were some of the attractions for Adam Frank, 35, a Brooklyn native and lawyer who moved here in 2011.\u201cBest decision I ever made,\u201d Mr. Frank said. \u201cIt has a lot of old homes with character and doesn\u2019t look like a prefab community.\u201dHe also cited the brewpubs and restaurants, as well as access to skiing and hiking, which he loves and could do only rarely while living in New York.Mr. Frank and his wife, Kathleen, a California native, met here and live in the Baker section in an 1886 two-story, mansard-style house. A partner in a civil rights law firm, he said he appreciated the entrepreneurism here that helped give him and his law partner the impetus to put up their shingle in 2015.\u201cIt is definitely a friendly place for people looking to start a business or throw new ideas out there,\u201d he said.How much impact does that have on the city\u2019s coolness factor among millennials? \u201cSome have speculated that it helped put Denver on the map,\u201d said Carrie Makarewicz, an assistant professor in the College of Architecture and Planning at the University of Colorado Denver. \u201cIt got national news coverage and made people think of Denver as this more progressive place.\u201dBut other, more significant developments have also made the city attractive to a young generation. \u201cDenver was in a major recession in the \u201980s,\u201d said Professor Makarewicz, an urban planner. \u201cThe main industry was gas and oil, so when the energy sector bombed, the business community and government got together and decided they needed to diversify and make some major investments.\u201dAmong the changes over the next two decades were a growth boundary to limit urban sprawl, better air-quality controls, a new airport and a downtown baseball stadium (Coors Field, where the Colorado Rockies play).The efforts of local preservationists kept many historic buildings from destruction, while new zoning laws changed neighborhoods to accommodate mixed-use buildings and what urban planners call a form-based code. That means, Professor Makarewicz said, that \u201cbuildings are approved more by how they look than what\u2019s in them.\u201dMatt Prosser, a vice president of Economic and Planning Systems, a California-based consulting firm, said the transit system was a \u201ccentral component\u201d in the area\u2019s ability to draw millennials.\u201cIt makes living here a lot easier for younger folks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily have to own a car.\u201dGov. John Hickenlooper, a former mayor of this city, is often cited as an important political force in the city\u2019s evolution. \u201cPeople are flocking here,\u201d he said in an email, citing the U.S. News ranking and a study showing that 16 percent of the population were young adults. \u201cWe have worked hard to ensure that Denver creates the things that millennials are looking for.\u201dAs mayor, Mr. Hickenlooper led the effort behind the FasTracks referendum. He is also a founder and former owner of the Wynkoop Brewing Company.Underlying it all \u2014 the beer, the trains, the mountains and, yes, the legal weed \u2014 is a sense of identity for this city that millennials find appealing.Mr. Prosser\u2019s firm, Economic and Planning Systems, is working with the city on the latest version of its 30-year comprehensive plan, Blueprint Denver.\u201cAs we started talking about what made Denver successful over the last 10 years, particularly with millennials, one theme kept coming up: the openness,\u201d Mr. Prosser said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that you can move into and feel like you\u2019re accepted and find your way.\u201dStill, the allure of the city remains powerful.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a culture of, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s cool, let\u2019s support each other,\u2019 whether it\u2019s in business, or the arts or in politics,\u201d said Mr. Frank, the transplanted New Yorker. Notwithstanding what he says is a lack of good pizza \u2014 the city\u2019s one detriment, in his view \u2014 he is firm on his views of his adopted, youthful city.\u201cWe\u2019re never leaving,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Frequent Fliers Pay for a First-Class Upgrade That Once Was Free", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byItinerariesThe perks of being a frequent flier are not as valuable as they once were. That is especially evident to travelers hoping to score a free upgrade to first class.Airlines, more and more, would rather get money for those upgrades. So they are using last-minute deals to entice passengers to pay to move to the front of the plane, while leaving frequent fliers languishing on the waiting list.That is how Caroline Libresco, a documentary filmmaker and Sundance Institute program director from Los Angeles, was able to pay only $50 recently to upgrade one of the legs of her $388 round-trip coach ticket to first class, on her Alaska Airlines flight from Burbank, Calif., to Seattle. When she originally booked the flight, refundable first-class tickets were listed in the $900 range.As an employee of a nonprofit, \u201cI\u2019m definitely a budget business traveler\u201d who would never purchase a full fare first-class ticket, Ms. Libresco said.Frequent fliers are seeing those inexpensive upgrade offers, too, of course. But it is a case of being asked to spend money on a perk they once had a better chance of getting free.Take Dan Pellegriti, a bond salesman for Cambridge International Securities in Westport, Conn., who flies as many as 200,000 miles a year.\u201cWhen I booked my seat, I got an offer to pay to upgrade to first class,\u201d Mr. Pellegriti said, describing a recent trip. \u201cThen, when I checked in 24 hours before the flight, I got another offer.\u201dIn the past he probably would have received a complimentary upgrade, he said.The shift from free first-class seats to paid ones has been happening gradually over the last few years. It has everything to do with airlines\u2019 efforts to wring more money from travelers however they can, in this case by monetizing the chance for roomier seats and pampered service that constitute first class.\u201cWhen I paid $90 to upgrade to first class on a flight last month, it meant someone didn\u2019t get it for free,\u201d said Seth Kaplan, an editor at Airline Weekly, an industry publication.In the past, airlines used a much blunter approach, Mr. Kaplan said, by pricing domestic first-class tickets at three or four times the price of coach seats. As a result, many went unsold. So the airlines gave those empty first-class seats to frequent fliers to reward and encourage their loyalty.In 2011, for example, only 14 percent of Delta Air Lines\u2019 first-class seats were paid for. The rest were given away or remained empty.Recognizing that this was not a profitable use of airplane real estate, Delta and the rest of the industry began to look for new ways to earn revenue for more of those seats, even if it meant narrowing the price gap between first class and economy.The offers are working. By last year, slightly more than half of Delta\u2019s first-class passengers had paid to be there. By 2018, Delta says it hopes that percentage will grow to 70 percent, which would leave less than a third of the best seats available for free upgrades. Other big airlines, including United and American, cite similar shifts.\u201cWe\u2019d rather have travelers pay a bit and know they get a seat in the front, rather than get on a list and feel disappointed if they aren\u2019t given an upgrade,\u201d said Andrew Wingrove, Delta\u2019s managing director for merchandising.For shorter flights, Mr. Pellegriti is more likely to take his chances by putting himself on the waiting list for a free upgrade. One of his typical routes, Newark to Miami and back, costs about $400 round trip.At booking, he is often offered an upgrade for each leg of the trip for $200 to $300. Closer to departure, he might be offered the same upgrades for $129 each. Even then, he is likely to take his chances on the free-upgrade list, he said.But when flying farther, like Newark to Los Angeles, Mr. Pellegriti is more willing to pay to be comfortable. A $550 round-trip coach ticket might initially be offered with a $650 upgrade each way, he said, but the upgrade price might drop to $279 closer to the flight. That is when he is likely to grab it, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t mind the short flights in coach, but on a cross-country flight, I\u2019d rather pay and know for sure I\u2019ll be in first class,\u201d Mr. Pellegriti said. \u201cI hate wondering at the gate to see if I made it off the list.\u201dDepending on their status level with the airline, travelers can be added to the waiting list for a free upgrade during booking or on arrival at the airport gate. Several factors determine who on that list will get the coveted spots at the front of the cabin \u2014 including how frequently they fly with the airline, what they paid for the ticket and the number of first-class tickets still unsold.\u201cI still get the short-flight upgrades, but I rarely get upgraded on transcontinental flights anymore,\u201d said Daniel J. Korn of New York, a marketing professional for Havas Worldwide who travels frequently for business. He typically flies coach, unless he gets a free upgrade.Airlines might be more concerned about alienating loyal frequent fliers if they thought travelers had more alternatives. But Mr. Kaplan, the editor, said consolidation had given consumers less leverage. \u201cAn unhappy frequent flier doesn\u2019t have as many other options as before,\u201d he said.Some airlines let customers offer their own price for an upgrade, and take the highest bids. Hawaiian Airlines recently announced a new auction service, offering guests the chance to bid for a first-class upgrade on flights between Hawaii and the mainland by email 10 days in advance.International airlines are also introducing cheaper ways to upgrade. Customers flying on the Israeli airline El Al may bid on an upgrade to business class when they book tickets.It is all part of a customer-segmentation strategy that major airlines are following. Traditionally, travelers had only two choices, first class or coach. But the new gradations include \u201cpremium economy\u2019\u2019 seats with a little more legroom and a few other small perks.For some frequent fliers, as a result, the new if lesser prize is an automatic upgrade to premium economy. A top-level flier on United, American and Delta who buys a regular coach ticket may choose a seat in the premium economy section.Nancy Brown, a molecular geneticist in Davis, Calif., and a United frequent flier, is always automatically upgraded to premium economy. As for the ever-more-elusive upgrade to first class, she puts herself on the waiting list, but ignores offers to pay for the privilege.\u201cI just wait to see if I get it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Moreover, his name recently surfaced in the leaked secret documents known as the Panama Papers in a long-running corruption case involving the alleged theft of Ukraine\u2019s natural gas resources for himself and his political allies.Even more, Mr. Lazarenko is waging two fierce battles with the United States government. One is over $250 million in offshore accounts in Guernsey, Switzerland, and elsewhere that the government claims are the fruits of Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s \u201cfraud, extortion, bribery, misappropriation and embezzlement.\u201d The other is his effort to remain in the United States, where he has been seeking political asylum since arriving in 1999.So far, Mr. Lazarenko is more than holding his own. With an army of lawyers, he has been able to stave off deportation, even though he served time in federal prison on a felony money-laundering conviction a few years ago. The battle over returning his riches to Ukraine has been tied up in courts for years, and will be for years to come.He is in legal limbo \u2014 not a citizen, not a visa holder \u2014 and yet he is able to operate freely from his California home. What the Lazarenko case demonstrates is just how difficult it is for the United States government to go after what it says are the ill-gotten gains of those with outsize power and influence.\u201cThis shows you who outguns whom in the battle against corruption,\u201d said Kenneth Hurwitz, an anticorruption officer at the Open Society Justice Initiative. \u201cHe\u2019s got the resources, and a lot of money is at stake.\u201dIn response to questions, Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s attorney, Daniel Horowitz, declined to comment or make Mr. Lazarenko available.These days, Mr. Lazarenko, 63, lives in Marin County, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, with his second wife and a new family.While his current home is comfortable, it is a far cry from the 18,000-square-foot Novato mansion \u2014 one of the largest in California \u2014 he bought before fleeing Ukraine in 1999 just one step ahead of the prosecutors.That Novato mansion, also in Marin County, was seized by the federal government in 2013 after Mr. Lazarenko became only the second head of state \u2014 Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, was the first \u2014 to be convicted in American courts of money laundering. In a sweeping 53-count indictment in 2000, the government identified $114 million that Mr. Lazarenko laundered through financial institutions in the United States. He was sent to prison in 2009.\u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if the United States granted him asylum,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anticorruption Action Center in Kiev. \u201cIt\u2019s quite cynical of him to apply for U.S. asylum at the same time he is fighting the U.S. for $250 million that the U.S. has frozen and is trying to repatriate to the Ukraine government.\u201dMoreover, Ms. Kaleniuk said, \u201cU.S. taxpayers have paid a lot to fight cases against him in Washington and California.\u201dIn America, the strange saga of Pavlo Lazarenko began as his plane touched down at John F. Kennedy Airport in February 1999. He was fleeing accusations that he had ordered the murder of a political rival; he had barely escaped an assassination attempt. He left days before Ukrainian prosecutors were to charge him with embezzling government resources (they set the charges aside when he fled the country). He was wanted by the Swiss government as well.By all accounts, he arrived expecting the life of an offshore oligarch. He already had a Panamanian passport. A series of hidden shells funneled money to buy his $6.75 million mansion in Novato. The sprawling estate, once occupied by the Hollywood star Eddie Murphy, featured two helipads, multiple swimming pools, a barn-size ballroom and gold-plated door knobs. Waiting for him were his first wife and their three children, already in local schools.Also waiting was the F.B.I., which had him on a watch list. He was whisked to a Queens jail and never spent a night in his California palace. A year later, he was indicted on charges of money laundering. In 2004, he was found guilty and, after appeals, entered federal prison in 2009. After leaving prison in November 2012, he was in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, although I.C.E. declined to say when it released him.While Mr. Lazarenko was in prison, a case brought by the United States government in 2004 to seize his offshore assets limped along. Over time, the government pinpointed money Mr. Lazarenko had stashed in Guernsey, Antigua, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Lithuania. It fended off other claimants to the money and obtained a freeze order preventing Mr. Lazarenko from gaining access to it. But the case is so complicated, involving voluminous discovery in many countries, that it is not expected to go to trial until 2018.\u201cThis case takes the cake in every category,\u201d said David B. Smith, an asset forfeiture attorney representing Mr. Lazarenko. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest, longest-running and most complex case. It has the most discovery and involves governments all over the world. Motions alone fill 10 volumes. Few cases go on for 13 or 14 years. It\u2019s staggering.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s name surfaced in the Panama Papers. Documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists show that Mr. Lazarenko used many tricks of the offshore trade: shell companies, British Virgin Islands addresses and the services of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the heart of the leaked documents.The Panama Papers include search warrants issued in 1998 by the British Virgin Islands for all Mossack files related to three companies connected to Mr. Lazarenko; Yulia Tymoshenko, who later became Ukraine\u2019s first woman prime minister; and her husband. The warrants allowed for B.V.I. officers to \u201center the said premises, by force, and breaking of doors, if necessary\u201d to get the documents.One of the companies named in the search warrants \u2014 Bassington Ltd. \u2014 was a B.V.I. shell set up by Mossack to hold the shares and be the parent of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, which controlled Ukraine\u2019s natural gas supply. Mr. Lazarenko and Ms. Tymoshenko were political allies as well as partners in United Energy, which the United States government said allowed millions of dollars to flow to Mr. Lazarenko and his associates. Much of that money is now in the offshore accounts that Mr. Lazarenko and the government are fighting over.The Mossack files also provide details of a key business relationship between Mr. Lazarenko and his closest Ukrainian crony that was central to the government\u2019s money-laundering case. Mr. Lazarenko was co-owner, with the Ukrainian businessman Peter Kiritchenko, of a B.V.I. company, Bainfield Company Ltd., that the United States government said was used to \u201cconceal and disguise\u201d money \u201ccorruptly and fraudulently\u201d paid to Mr. Lazarenko.The two men had a longstanding arrangement in which Mr. Kiritchenko, who named Mr. Lazarenko as his child\u2019s godfather and vacationed with his family, sent 50 percent of the profits from what the F.B.I. called \u201cmyriad criminal schemes\u201d in Ukraine to Mr. Lazarenko through Bainfield. Mr. Kiritchenko later fled to the United States and became a key witness against Mr. Lazarenko, helping send him to prison.Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Horowitz, declined to comment. In court filings, he likened Mr. Lazarenko to Jean Valjean, the persecuted but ethical hero of Victor Hugo\u2019s \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d who is hunted by an obsessed police inspector. The American government, he said, approached Mr. Lazarenko with \u201cthe intensity usually reserved for drug kingpins, child pornographers or other highly dangerous individuals.\u201dMr. Horowitz, a celebrity defense lawyer and frequent television commentator, traveled the world gathering evidence to defend Mr. Lazarenko. His website says Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s \u201cpro-Western views and his belief in a free economy angered the dictators of Ukraine and led to the back door deal that led to his arrest. Ukraine has never recovered.\u201dDuring Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s legal battles, his personal life changed greatly. He is now married to Oksana Tsykova, who was his translator at his 2004 trial and was carrying his child \u2014 the first of three \u2014 at the time. Ms. Tsykova owns their current Marin County home, valued at $1.8 million, in a trust in her name. She is also a lawyer in Mr. Horowitz\u2019s firm.The Justice Department has led an effort to recover assets that it says were stolen by foreign officials \u2014 dictators, politicians and ruling elites \u2013 and laundered in the United States. Here is a look at some of the cases it is pursuing:It is doubtful that he would return to Ukraine. The prosecutor\u2019s office has said Mr. Lazarenko would be arrested and has stockpiled evidence against him.At the moment, Mr. Lazarenko is pleading poverty. In court filings, he says he has no income, owes a former lawyer $100,000 and relies solely on his wife\u2019s salary. Mr. Lazarenko also says, in court filings, that he lacks work authorization and is unemployed. Even more, by all accounts, he does not speak much English and relies on a translator.Not everyone buys Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s story. Martha Boersch, the former lead prosecutor on the money-laundering case, said, \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of money left and hidden away.\u201dOne of the big questions is why Mr. Lazarenko, a felon, has not been deported.\u201cIt strikes me as bizarre,\u201d said Mr. Hurwitz, of the Open Society. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 12-year-old kids from Central America being kicked out and he\u2019s still here.\u201dIn general, a criminal conviction does not prohibit asylum seekers from pleading before an immigration court. Marc Van Der Hout, Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s former immigration lawyer, declined to comment on the case, but said that it was not unusual for asylum cases to drag on for years. As policy, I.C.E. does not comment on individual cases.The fight over Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s offshore assets is heating up. He recently added Blank Rome, one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms, to his team, which claims the government lacks jurisdiction to seize his offshore millions since they were not deposited in the United States but only passed through in brief electronic transfers.\u201cThe money was in the United States for a matter of seconds,\u201d said Mr. Smith, of Smith & Zimmerman, which is working with Blank Rome. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough to show that it had any connection to the U.S.\u201dSome experts say Mr. Lazarenko is making headway. \u201cThis is such a politically sensitive case,\u201d said Linda J. Candler, a California lawyer who represents the Anticorruption Action Center in Kiev, which wants the money repatriated to Ukraine. \u201cLazarenko is fighting this vigorously. He\u2019s got good counsel and they are making solid arguments.\u201dIn the end, perhaps the best comparison with Mr. Lazarenko\u2019s case is the infamous Jarndyce and Jarndyce in Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cBleak House.\u201d\u201cThis is like something out of a 19th-century novel,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cIt seems like this case will go on forever.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with an article about Pavlo Lazarenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister, misstated, in some copies, the amount of time Mr. Lazarenko spent in the federal prison at Terminal Island, Calif. He was sentenced to nine years, but was held there from 2009 to 2012, not \u201cmore than 10 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Police Investigate Abuse Accusations Against Cardinal George Pell", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Cardinal George Pell, the de facto Vatican treasurer and Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic cleric, is being investigated in connection with multiple allegations of child sexual assault that date back four decades, a top police official said on Thursday.\u201cWe investigated and are still investigating,\u201d Mr. Ashton said in an interview with the radio station 3AW in Melbourne, when asked about an inquiry.The Victoria police have established a task force that is looking into such allegations in both religious and nongovernmental organizations.The email added: \u201cA brief of evidence has been prepared and presented to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. Once the advice from the D.P.P. is received it will be reviewed. However, as with any investigation, it remains a decision for Victoria police as to whether charges will be laid.\u201dIn a statement to the ABC, the cardinal\u2019s office denied the allegations.\u201cClaims he has sexually abused anyone, in any place, at any time in his life are totally untrue and completely wrong,\u201d the statement said.Australia\u2019s Catholic Church declined to comment on the matter on Thursday, referring questions to the cardinal\u2019s office at the Vatican.Cardinal Pell was born and grew up in Ballarat, a Victorian country town. After being ordained as a priest, he began work in the area, best known as a center for gold mining in the 1850s.The ABC reported that two men have said that he sexually abused them at a swimming pool in Ballarat in the 1970s.\u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d one of the accusers, Lyndon Monument, told the broadcaster. \u201cBut because it was the church, he was George Pell, we just weren\u2019t game ever to say anything.\u201dIn 2013, Australia established a royal commission, an investigation into matters of great national importance, into the sexual abuse of children within institutions. Its inquiries are continuing.As archbishop of Melbourne in 1996, Cardinal Pell coordinated the response by the church in the city to allegations of child sexual abuse. In 2012, he said that the news media had begun a campaign against the Catholic Church, but since then he has had to answer questions about abuse allegations before both the royal commission and a Victorian parliamentary inquiry. In 2014, he apologized to a former altar boy who was abused by a priest, and he has also said that victims of abuse have the right to sue the church.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Donald Trump at the G.O.P. Convention", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of Donald J. Trump\u2019s remarks at the Republican National Convention, as prepared for delivery on Thursday by the campaign:Donald J. Trump Republican Nomination Acceptance SpeechFriends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16 of last year we \u2014 and I say \u201cwe\u201d because we are a team \u2014 would have received almost 14 million votes, the most in the history of the Republican Party, and that the Republican Party would get 60 percent more votes than it received four years ago. The Democrats, on the other hand, received almost 20 percent fewer votes than they got eight years ago.Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored.The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.I will present the facts plainly and honestly.We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully crafted lies, and the media myths \u2014 the Democrats are holding their convention next week.But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.These are the facts:Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration\u2019s rollback of criminal enforcement.Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America\u2019s 50 largest cities. That\u2019s the largest increase in 25 years.In our nation\u2019s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.In the president\u2019s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 grade-point average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.I\u2019ve met Sarah\u2019s beautiful family. But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn\u2019t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.What about our economy?Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper:Nearly four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58 percent of African-American youth are not employed.Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.Another 14 million people have left the work force entirely.Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000 \u2014 16 years ago.Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly $800 billion last year alone.The budget is no better.President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing \u2014 it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.Another humiliation came when President Obama drew a red line in Syria \u2014 and the whole world knew it meant nothing.In Libya, our consulate \u2014 the symbol of American prestige around the globe \u2014 was brought down in flames.America is far less safe \u2014 and the world is far less stable \u2014 than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America\u2019s foreign policy. I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.Her bad instincts and her bad judgment \u2014 something pointed out by Bernie Sanders \u2014 are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today.Let\u2019s review the record.In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control.After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.Iraq is in chaos.Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.But Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy does not have to be America\u2019s legacy.The problems we face now \u2014 poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad \u2014 will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents is that our plan will put America first.Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.This will all change when I take office.The American people will come first once again.My plan will begin with safety at home \u2014 which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation\u2019s most powerful special interests.That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.That is why Hillary Clinton\u2019s message is that things will never change.My message is that things have to change \u2014 and they have to change right now.Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned.I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.I am your voice.I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws \u2014 or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash \u2014 I am not able to look the other way.And when a secretary of state illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can\u2019t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence \u2014 I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.When the F.B.I. director says that the secretary of state was \u201cextremely careless\u201d and \u201cnegligent,\u201d in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it \u2014 especially when others, who have done far less, have paid so dearly.When that same secretary of state rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders \u2014 he never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and wealth.Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly, and justly, for each and every American.In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next vice president of the United States: Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job.The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed.Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, La.Three were killed, and three were badly injured.An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job done.In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.This administration has failed America\u2019s inner cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed them on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime. It\u2019s failed them in every way and on every level.When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson, who have the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America?To make life safe for all our citizens, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over \u2014 at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, and many more.Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Fla., 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our L.G.B.T.Q. community.As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our L.G.B.T.Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.We must have the best intelligence-gathering operation in the world.We must abandon the failed policy of nation-building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the state of Israel.Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost.Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism \u2014 a true step in the right direction.Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there\u2019s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely.Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.These families have no special interests to represent them.There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities.But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?Where was the sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?Where was the sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?These wounded American families have been alone.But they are alone no longer.Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America\u2019s Border Patrol agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored.By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied \u2014 and every politician who has denied them \u2014 to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.On Jan. 20 of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty and join the middle class.I have a different vision for our workers.It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.It\u2019s been a signature message of my campaign from Day 1, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.I have made billions of dollars in business making deals \u2014 now I\u2019m going to make our country rich again.I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed Nafta, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.Never again.I am going to bring back our jobs to Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan and to all of America \u2014 and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence.My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.She supported Nafta, and she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization \u2014 another one of her husband\u2019s colossal mistakes.She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea.She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 which will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long \u2014 and which no one from our country even reads or understands.We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheats.This includes stopping China\u2019s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.Our horrible trade agreements with China, and many others, will be totally renegotiated.That includes renegotiating Nafta to get a much better deal for America \u2014 and we\u2019ll walk away if we don\u2019t get the deal that we want.Our country is going to start building and making things again.Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year \u2014 Democrat or Republican.Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone.America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all.Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it.We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades.My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work \u2014 that will never happen when I am president.With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans.We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children.We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again.And we will fix T.S.A. at the airports!We\u2019re going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we are protecting, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice. My opponent dismissed the V.A. scandal \u2014 one more sign of how out of touch she really is.We are going to ask every department head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I\u2019m going to do it.We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views, principles, and judicial philosophy. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community in general who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.We can accomplish these great things, and so much more \u2014 all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.It is time to show the whole world that America is back \u2014 bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.In this journey, I\u2019m so lucky to have at my side my wife, Melania, and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: You will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.My dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest-working man I ever knew.I wonder sometimes what he\u2019d say if he were here to see this tonight.It\u2019s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.Then there\u2019s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people have ever known, and a great judge of character.To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love \u2014 you are most special to me.I have had a truly great life in business.But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country \u2014 to go to work for you.It\u2019s time to deliver a victory for the American people.But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics.Remember: All of the people telling you that you can\u2019t have the country you want are the same people telling you that I wouldn\u2019t be standing here tonight.No longer can we rely on those same people in the media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.Instead, we must choose to believe in America.History is watching us now. It\u2019s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.I\u2019m asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m With Her.\u201dI choose to recite a different pledge.My pledge reads: \u201cI\u2019m With You \u2014 the American People.\u201dI am your voice.So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight:I\u2019m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise:We will make America strong again.We will make America proud again.We will make America safe again.And we will make America great again.God bless you and good night.Advertisement"}

Trump in two weeks, a convention city chosen with Battleground Ohio much in mind, a vortex of headwinds are rising against Mr. Trump in the state.The barely concealed disdain of Gov. John R. Kasich, a former rival who has not endorsed the presumptive nominee, echoes through the state\u2019s Republican leadership, whose full engagement in the fall campaign will be needed to turn out voters.Images of disunity in Cleveland, where delegates are gathering July 18-21 in the shadow of local polls showing a majority of Republicans prefer a different nominee, could make it harder for the party to attract grass-roots activists for the fall campaign.Mr. Trump ignored Ohio for six weeks after clinching the nomination, until a visit last week to coal country, where he spoke to an audience of largely white working-class voters, including some Democrats. It was the group he has performed best with in primaries and polls.But in describing a trade deal during the same visit as a \u201crape of our country,\u201d his oratory and protectionist policies are turning off other Republican-leaning voters, including suburban women and business interests, in a state whose economy depends on global exports.\u201cThe flip side is Trump\u2019s appeal to white working-class men very well may cost him other kinds of Republican voters,\u201d Mr. Green said.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Public polling of Ohio, which has been scant, shows Hillary Clinton with an average lead of about three percentage points.Mrs. Clinton and her supporters are already spending heavily in the state on ads to define Mr. Trump negatively, and last week Mrs. Clinton visited Cincinnati with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who electrified the crowd by mocking Mr. Trump for running a campaign no deeper than the slogans on his \u201cgoofy\u201d hats.Bob Seszko, a school bus mechanic from rural Bellaire, Ohio, said he voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but planned to vote for Mr. Trump in November. In the 1980s, he had made good money at a steel plant in the Ohio River Valley \u2014 until it closed.\u201cOverseas was selling it cheaper than we could make it, so I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s more sincere than Hillary is. She\u2019s riding on the coattails of her husband.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s appeal to such voters is likely to be strong, especially in the industrial region around Youngstown and Akron.To counter the threat, Mrs. Clinton and her supporters began a barrage of general-election television ads in Ohio and other swing states in May, and for the Fourth of July weekend, they planned a $13 million blitz mostly in Ohio and Florida.He said Mr. Trump recently called him after reading that Mrs. Clinton was far ahead in hiring field staff members in Ohio.In March, Mr. Borges and other Republican leaders in the state bluntly warned that if Mr. Trump were the nominee, he could not carry their perennially close-fought state.\u201cWe want to distance ourselves from the kind of rhetoric that Donald Trump is using to divide Americans,\u201d Mr. Borges said at the time. \u201cIf Donald Trump is unfortunately our choice and our nominee, it could imperil not only the race for the White House but many other candidates down-ticket.\u201dThe state\u2019s Republican leaders, who supported their native son Mr. Kasich before his withdrawal from the race, no longer openly scorn Mr. Trump. But they pick their words carefully, withholding full support.\u201cA great many people in Ohio are watching Mr. Trump closely to see if over the weeks and months he will emerge as an individual of presidential stature,\u201d said Brad Sinnott, chairman of the Republican Central Committee of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital. \u201cThere is some work to be done.\u201dMr. Trump, who has signaled a strategy of outsourcing grass-roots organizing to the national party, hired a state director only late last month. The Republican National Committee, which promised last year to hire more than 200 field staff members in the state, has about 50 now, and has yet to open its first Ohio office.The Clinton campaign, which declined to say how many staff members it has in Ohio, is also coordinating with state and national Democrats, who collectively have more than 100 people in the field, said Kirstin Alvanitakis, a state party spokeswoman. The Clinton campaign plans to open offices across the state in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal helped drive record turnout in the primary in March. \u201cI told him we had a million new Republicans,\u201d Mr. Borges recalled of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump. \u201cHe asked, \u2018Is that because of me?\u2019\u201d\u201cI told him yes,\u201d he said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a stop-Trump movement without Trump,\u201d Mr. Borges said.An earlier version of this article gave the wrong name of an Ohio village that is home to Bob Seszko, a bus mechanic who plans to vote for Donald J.

{"Headline": "Brexit and Irish Unity", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDublin \u2014 IN 1998, for the first time since partition in 1921, the people of Ireland, North and South, joined in voting for change when they took part in referendums on the Good Friday Agreement. That agreement was founded on the democratic principle that the people of Ireland, North and South, should determine their own future.The Good Friday Agreement replaced decades of conflict and injustice with a deal that put power-sharing and equality at the heart of government. The agreement was endorsed by a resounding 71 percent of voters in the North and a remarkable 94 percent in the South of Ireland. History was made, and work began to establish all-island institutions that for nearly two decades have secured peace and justice in Ireland.That achievement and legacy is now at risk. In last month\u2019s referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, the citizens of the North of Ireland voted by 55 percent to 45 percent to remain within the union. As voters in the North did in the 1998 referendum, Irish nationalists, British unionists and others found common cause.In Scotland, too, a strong majority of citizens voted to remain within the European Union, while more people in England and Wales voted to leave. That was their right, but because the total votes narrowly went in favor of Brexit, by 52 percent to 48 percent, the British government will now seek to drag the North of Ireland out of the European Union \u2014 based on the preference of voters in England and Wales.The Brexit vote has caused political turmoil in London, a collapse in the value of the pound, predictions of a recession and economic uncertainty across the country. American investors have postponed a visit to the North of Ireland, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, a think tank, has forecast a slowing of growth across the whole of Ireland.This referendum had nothing to do with Ireland\u2019s economic interests, or even with reform of the European Union. Instead, it was precipitated by a toxic mix of factional fighting and leadership intrigue within the British Conservative Party and the rise of far-right, anti-immigrant groups like the U.K. Independence Party.Leave campaign leaders like Michael Gove were also opposed to the peace deal in Ireland, which he once called a \u201ccapitulation.\u201d The Tory Party\u2019s presumptive new leader, Theresa May, believes that Britain should withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a central component of the Good Friday Agreement.In this Tory political game, the people of Ireland, our peace, economy and institutions, would all become collateral damage. By its reckless action, the British government has set aside the democratic consent that was central to the Good Friday Agreement and set a course that would fundamentally alter the relationships between the North and South of Ireland, and between Ireland and Britain.The first and most obvious impact will be on the North-South border. In the past, this was marked by checkpoints, military bases and customs posts. Today, thanks to the peace agreement, the long stoppages and searches are gone, and the border is almost impossible to discern.As a consequence of Brexit, that near-vanished border will become an international frontier between the European Union and an external state. Ireland\u2019s economy and people will face the renewed imposition of checkpoints, as well as blocks to trade, services and the free movement of workers. Communities united by the Good Friday Agreement will be divided once again.With the loss of European Union funding for peace programs, progress on North-South cross-border cooperation will stall. A hard border will also undermine the operation of the All-Ireland bodies that promote business links, tourism and investment in health care and higher education.This is preventable \u2014 if the Irish and British governments respect the vote of the people in the North to remain within the European Union.Successive presidents of the United States, with the support of Irish-Americans, have played a central role in promoting political progress in the North of Ireland. Given its investment in the peace process, America\u2019s leaders must act to safeguard it, insisting that the British government honor its obligations under the agreements and give effect to the North\u2019s choice to remain.As a party of Irish republicans and democrats, Sinn Fein believes in Irish unity. The Good Friday Agreement already allows for concurrent referendums on reunification to be held in the North and South. The British and Irish governments are obliged to legislate for the unity of Ireland if a simple majority in the North supports change.The Brexit vote provides both a reason and an opportunity to enable this democratic decision. The British government should respect the popular vote in the North for European Union membership by bringing forward a referendum on Irish unity. The Irish government, too, should act on this.The people of the North could then choose whether they wanted to be part of a Britain outside the European Union or belong to a unified Irish state in Europe. For the Irish after Brexit, that is the democratic way forward.Gerry Adams serves as a member of the Dail, Ireland\u2019s Parliament, for Louth and is the president of Sinn Fein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Clinton: A Perfectly Imperfect First Gentleman", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIt would be laughable for anyone to expect that of the 42nd president. In fact, Bill Clinton will be liberated from the fundamental, suffocating burden of first wifehood precisely because we know him so well, and most of us, like it or not, have come to accept his glaring imperfections.We expect the president\u2019s wife to be a devoted spouse and mother and nothing short of the embodiment of American womanhood. Lady Bird Johnson summed up these impossible expectations best when she said Americans wanted their first lady to be a \u201cshowman and a salesman, a clotheshorse and a publicity sounding board, with a good heart, and a real interest in the folks.\u201dThe reason Mr. Clinton would be exempt from such impossibly high standards is partly that he is who he is, but it is also that he is a man. He exists outside of all norms: His gender and his membership in the elite fraternity of ex-presidents (he is one of only four former presidents alive) are inextricable. \u201cA male spouse who wasn\u2019t a former president would have been a way to tiptoe into this uncharted territory,\u201d said Gahl Hodges Burt, social secretary under Ronald Reagan, \u201cinstead of blasting our way into it.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s exceptionalism would make it easier for the next man married to a president to continue his career while living in the White House \u2014 something no first lady has done. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s husband, Bruce Mann, who is a law professor at Harvard, would have a far easier time continuing to teach if his wife ever became president because of the way Mr. Clinton could transform what it means for a man to be married to the leader of the free world.The former president would probably not be asked to take up the household duties we expected career-driven women like Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton to embrace as presidential spouses. The Clintons will most likely pick an experienced social secretary who can handle details usually assigned to the first lady, including giving final approval to floral arrangements, guest lists and dinner menus.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.Clinton insiders doubt that Mr. Clinton will take up residence in the quiet East Wing, where first ladies have generally been confined. \u201cPersonally, I can\u2019t imagine his office in the East Wing,\u201d said Melanne Verveer, Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief of staff in the White House. In fact, friends of the Clintons use terms like \u201cspecial envoy\u201d and \u201celder statesman\u201d when they consider what his expansive role would look like.In the past, Americans have been largely unforgiving of perceived lapses when it comes to first ladies. A member of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s administration grumbled that Eleanor Roosevelt, the original activist first lady, should \u201cstick to her knitting\u201d; Rosalynn Carter earned the nicknames \u201csteel magnolia\u201d and \u201cthe second president\u201d because she sat in on her husband\u2019s cabinet meetings and quietly took notes. West Wing staff members called Nancy Reagan \u201cthe missus\u201d behind her back, and the press contemptuously referred to her as \u201cQueen Nancy\u201d because of her designer clothes.Name a first lady and she has been reprimanded for being too outspoken or too reserved, too controlling or not ambitious enough.Recent first ladies will undoubtedly envy the freedom a first gentleman Bill Clinton would be granted if his wife wins the election. He\u2019s not perfect, which means he is perfectly suited to remake the role of presidential spouse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Voters Don\u2019t Buy It When Economists Say Global Trade Is Good", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewOne defining characteristic of recent political debate \u2014 in the United States and abroad \u2014 is anxiety about foreigners.You certainly see it in the British decision to exit the European Union, which has become known as Brexit. That vote flummoxed most political forecasters, and it makes one wonder whether Americans might also produce a surprise in November.What\u2019s going on?But all this raises the question of why so many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, are ready to embrace a move away from international economic engagement when expert opinion overwhelmingly calls for a very different approach. Economists do not have a good answer, but some political scientists have been studying the issue.For an economist, one natural hypothesis to entertain is that people\u2019s attitudes toward globalization are based on their self-interest. That is because textbook economic theory says that openness to international trade increases a nation\u2019s overall prosperity, but it also says that some people gain and others lose. Even if the gains exceed the losses over all, those who get the short end of the stick may still object.Yet Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz reject this theory of voter attitude. If people were just looking out for themselves, their view of globalization would be determined by the industry in which they worked. Those in industries with a high concentration of exports should be favorable to an open economy, while those in industries that have to compete with imports should be opposed. In actuality, however, people\u2019s attitudes about free trade and offshore outsourcing are unrelated to the characteristics of the industry in which they are employed.After analyzing their survey data on individuals\u2019 attitudes and attributes, these political scientists conclude that voters embrace policies based on the broader national interest. This theory is called sociotropic voting. There are several reasons people may look beyond narrow self-interest.One is simply that people are more altruistic than economists usually think they are. But it\u2019s also possible that it is just hard for people to determine with much precision how national policies affect their personal circumstances, and in light of this uncertainty, it is reasonable to presume that any policy good for the overall economy is probably good for you, too.The issue then becomes why people think that globalization is bad for the economy in the first place. In other words, why do they doubt what so many economists teach about the gains from trade? The data analysis of Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz suggests that skepticism about trade and outsourcing is closely related to three other sets of beliefs.The first is isolationism more broadly. Trade skeptics tend to think, for example, that the United States should stay out of world affairs and avoid getting involved in foreign conflicts. They are not eager for the United States to work with other nations to solve global problems like hunger and pollution.The second is nationalism. Trade skeptics tend to think that the United States is culturally superior to other nations. They say the world would be better if people elsewhere were more like Americans.The third is ethnocentrism. Trade skeptics tend to divide the world into racial and ethnic groups and think that the one they belong to is better than the others. They say their own group is harder-working, less wasteful and more trustworthy.As Mr. Mansfield and Ms. Mutz put it, \u201ctrade preferences are driven less by economic considerations and more by an individual\u2019s psychological worldview.\u201d They also report that this isolationist, nationalist, ethnocentric worldview is related to one\u2019s level of education. The more years of schooling people have, the more likely they are to reject anti-globalization attitudes.In the long run, therefore, there is reason for optimism. As society slowly becomes more educated from generation to generation, the general public\u2019s attitudes toward globalization should move toward the experts\u2019.The short run in which we find ourselves now, however, is another story.N.

{"Headline": "In Truck Attack in Nice, Mainstay of Commerce Reinvented as Tool of Death", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byMore than five years ago, Al Qaeda called on its followers to use cars as tools of terror. Soon after, the terrorist group that had brought down the twin towers scrapped the idea, feeling that the tactic was too indiscriminate, too likely to kill Muslims.But the idea of the car as a weapon was revived by the Islamic State shortly after it broke with Al Qaeda in 2014 following years of discord over the Islamic State\u2019s brutal methods.\u201cIf you are not able to find an I.E.D. or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman or any of their allies,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a speech. \u201cSmash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car,\u201d he said, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group.10 PhotosNone of the vehicle attacks carried out in the name of the terrorist groups resulted in mass casualties, possibly because the attackers used S.U.V.s and smaller cars.And their ubiquity means that the trucks would be difficult to spot, and stop, if an attacker used one as an instrument of violence.Survivors of the attack in Nice, France, describe a windy night at the beach, fireworks, and then terror.The idea of using cars as an instrument of terror was first floated by Al Qaeda in 2010 in an article in its Inspire magazine.Featuring a picture of a heavy-duty Ford truck under the headline \u201cThe Ultimate Mowing Machine,\u201d the article compared people to grass and encouraged supporters to \u201cmow down the enemies of Allah.\u201dYet when a copy of the magazine made its way to Osama bin Laden, then the leader of Al Qaeda, he took exception to the article, according to files recovered in his compound in Pakistan, said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has spent years tracking the terrorist group. He said that bin Laden worried that using a car as a weapon would lead to indiscriminate violence, possibly killing Sunni Muslims, the very category the group was trying to win over.\u201cYou see a desire over time to calibrate their terrorism to be more targeted and to have a specific message,\u201d Mr. Joscelyn said, describing Qaeda tactics since the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. By contrast, the message of the Islamic State is to \u201ckill anywhere and everywhere,\u201d he said.Even though Al Qaeda dropped the idea, the concept appears to have remained in the collective subconscious of the terrorist network, and it was revived by the Islamic State after its fissure with Al Qaeda in 2014 in one of the earliest speeches by Mr. Adnani.Documenting devastation along a one-mile stretch of waterfront.The Islamic State has repeated the call to use cars as weapons on several other occasions, including last November in a video tailored for an audience in France featuring three French fighters in Syria.13 Photos\u201cThere are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit,\u201d one of the French fighters says, according to SITE. \u201cKill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars. Do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them.\u201dWhether the driver of the delivery truck in Nice was acting at the behest of the terrorist group, or after being inspired by its propaganda, was unclear.On Friday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said the attacker was \u201ca terrorist who is probably linked to radical Islam one way or another.\u201dBut the authorities had not yet provided evidence of radicalization, and there had not been any sign that the attacker, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a 31-year-old immigrant from Tunisia, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, one of the group\u2019s requirements for those who wish to act in its name.The Islamic State, which has claimed attacks carried out in its name within hours of the killings, has been silent about the Nice attack. The group\u2019s daily radio bulletin on Friday made no mention of Nice. The Amaq News Agency, which acts as the group\u2019s news wire and was the first to claim the attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., as well as the recent killings in Bangladesh and in Magnanville, France, also made no mention of the deaths.However, media accounts that are closely tied to the Islamic State have cheered the killings and urged their followers to promote the atrocity on social media.Hours after the truck plowed through the crowd, the Kilafah News Channel on the encrypted phone app Telegram, which analysts believe is one of the terrorist group\u2019s official media outlets, issued a directive: \u201cTo all #Islamic State supporters we ask you to participate in these following hashtags to show the world the truth about the war on the Islamic State and how they brought this to themselves.\u201dThe channel then instructed its followers to hijack hashtags dedicated to mourning the dead in Nice, including #PrayForNice.videoAdvertisement"}

But the oil price collapse and subsequent devaluation of the currency is straining the government.Last month, security forces killed two dozen attackers identified as sympathizers of the Islamic State in the northwestern town of Aktobe after the militants stole guns from sporting goods stores and attacked the police and a national guard base.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Terrorism Scares Away the Tourists Europe Was Counting On", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The shocks have come one after another: Islamic State killings of civilians in Brussels and Nice. A deadly outburst of terrorism in Germany. A fresh terror-linked atrocity in a small French town. Warnings abound that more may be on the way.The surge of attacks in Europe has raised questions over whether a potentially durable new threat to stability is settling in. The political challenges for Europe\u2019s leaders are stark, and the impact on the region\u2019s economy may be just as profound.\u201cWe are experiencing a structural change, a phenomenon of war on our doorstep that didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d said Georges Panayotis, the president of the MKG Group, a tourism consulting company based in Paris. \u201cIf it\u2019s not resolved, the problem will continue.\u201dThe effects of that shift on businesses, large and small, have been deep.American and Japanese visitors in particular canceled reservations, even though the site, perched on an isolated rock off the northwest coast of Normandy, is far from Paris. Gilles Gohier, the chief executive, said he had to tell nearly a third of his 230 employees to go home for four months, and temporarily shut half of his five hotels and four restaurants. Since then, he has eliminated 17 positions and is hiring new employees only on temporary contracts.\u201cWhat happened in Rouen shows that it could happen here, or anywhere,\u201d Mr. Gohier said. \u201cThis makes it impossible to plan for business in the future,\u201d he added.All of that has hit the European economy in one of its most vital sectors, tourism, just as a tenuous recovery was starting to take hold.Uncertainty has multiplied in recent months as terrorist assaults have become more frequent and widespread. Investors have not pulled away. But visitors are rethinking Europe as a central travel destination, and the tourism industry, which accounts for 10 percent of economic activity in the European Union, has begun to feel the sting.European governments, meanwhile, are spending hundreds of billions of euros on enhanced domestic security and operations against the Islamic State, even as Brussels pressures countries to cut deficits.France, the European Union\u2019s third-largest economy after Britain and Germany, was already struggling to emerge from a long period of stagnation and high unemployment. France is the most visited country in Europe, attracting more than 84 million tourists last year, and economists had forecast a long-awaited uptick in growth for 2016. After the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks, the momentum slowed, and a slump in foreign tourism had only recently started to reverse.But when further Islamic State-inspired attacks were carried out in Europe, the impact was magnified.In France, growth in nightly hotel room bookings after the Paris attacks fell to single digits from 20 percent. After the Brussels bombings, bookings went negative, and after Nice, bookings fell by double digits, said Mark Okerstrom, the chief financial officer of Expedia, a global travel website.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a bounceback,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know for certain is whether there\u2019s an overall dampening impact to global travel, or to Europe specifically.\u201dAt Paris Plage, a makeshift beach erected along the Seine, a dozen armed police officers guarded an entry checkpoint on a recent day. Army troops marched past families playing in the sand and half-empty activity points along the river. The patrols, which cost taxpayers about 1 million euros, or $1.1 million, a day, will add to an already mounting bill after France pledged to spend \u20ac816 million this year to reinforce security.The ripple effect has been tangible.Rental apartments in Paris and Nice sat empty after people canceled plans to visit France, said Adrian Leeds, the head of the Adrian Leeds Group, a French real estate agency with properties in both cities. And clients who had been thinking of moving to France have suspended their property searches.\u201cIt\u2019s really affected things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people will come back when things have settled down.\u201dThe terrorism threat adds another layer of complexity in a region already grappling with a large influx of migrants and the repercussions of Britain\u2019s vote last month to leave the European Union.Finance ministers from the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, meeting last week in China, cited geopolitical conflicts and terrorism as growing threats to the global economy. \u201cThe world has already known terrorist attacks,\u201d said the French finance minister, Michel Sapin.\u201cBut today, the frequency of the attacks is creating a new situation of uncertainty,\u201d with economic consequences, he added.All that may turn travelers away from Europe\u2019s largest economies and toward calmer places like Spain, Greece or Scandinavia.That may not stop terrorism concerns from hitting the industries that make travel possible. Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, two of Europe\u2019s largest air carriers, recently slashed their profit forecasts for the year, citing repeated terrorist attacks in Europe as deterring tourists and business executives from traveling.The attacks have also taken a toll on the luxury industry, which relies heavily on foreign tourists, especially from Asia, for European sales. Leading brands like Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton and Prada have reported slumping sales as high-spending tourists stay away.On a recent morning, a handful of visitors flitted through Louis Vuitton\u2019s mammoth flagship store on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a contrast to previous years, when the summer tourist season would see the shop buzzing with customers. This week, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported flat sales in the first half of the year, citing a falloff in European tourism after the attacks.\u201cWe do not see any improvement in tourist traffic in France, and we will not see one while we are in a state of emergency, which prevents customers from coming,\u201d said Axel Dumas, chief executive of Herm\u00e8s, the maker of \u20ac10,000 Birkin bags.For Mr. Gohier, whose hotels and restaurants face the Mont-Saint-Michel, that can only be bad news for a smaller business like his.\u201cWhen you lose business, it has an economic impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThe terrorists want to create maximum damage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Suggests a Growing Chance That Rates Will Rise This Year", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, but it issued an upbeat assessment of economic conditions that suggested a growing chance that it would increase rates later this year.The Fed, in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, said that the economy had overcome wobbles this year and that job creation had increased with moderate economic growth.Importantly, the central bank added that it saw fewer clouds on the horizon as the United States entered the eighth year of an economic expansion.\u201cNear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished,\u201d the statement said, though it added that the Fed remained wary about the weakness of inflation and about \u201cglobal economic and financial developments.\u201dJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, has won broad support among Fed officials for a patient approach to raising rates.But after a unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged at the Fed\u2019s last meeting in June, there was one dissent at the July meeting. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted for a quarter-point increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate.Ms. George, who has expressed concern that persistently low rates will lead to financial instability, voted in favor of rate increases in March and April.Recent data \u201cindicates that the labor market has strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate,\u201d the Fed said in its statement. \u201cJob gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.\u201dYet pockets of weakness remain, the Fed said, including a paucity of investment by businesses.The Fed did not raise rates at its last meeting in June, citing concern about a downturn in domestic job growth and uncertainty on the eve of Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the European Union.Those concerns have eased. The economy added 287,000 jobs in June and financial markets rebounded quickly even though the British unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union.Yet Fed officials made clear in the days before the July meeting that they were inclined to wait at least a little longer.Moreover, Fed officials have increasingly concluded that rates may remain unusually low for the foreseeable future. Before the financial crisis, the Fed estimated that holding its benchmark rate around 5 percent was a neutral policy, neither providing stimulus nor hitting the brakes.Now, after years of downward pressure on global rates, the Fed pegs that neutral rate at around 3 percent. That means the impact of holding the benchmark rate near zero has diminished \u2014 and it also means the Fed\u2019s return to \u201cnormal\u201d may not take as long.Still, some Fed officials have continued to emphasize that they expect to raise rates at least once before the end of the year. Some analysts predict that the Fed will move at its next meeting in September, although markets put the chances at only 20 percent. There are also meetings scheduled in November and December.In the next big event on the Fed\u2019s calendar, Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak at an annual policy conference in Wyoming in late August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May\u2019s Shock Therapy", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 There is a genteel savagery to the British prime ministerial system. If you blinked last week, you\u2019d have missed David Cameron\u2019s exit and the arrival in No. 10 Downing Street of Theresa May. No period of transition separates one regime from the other, allowing the nation to acclimatize to its new head of government. One prime minister is hustled out No. 10, and another is hustled in.Though British politics has grown increasingly presidential, ever more focused on the personality of the prime minister, its system remains parliamentary, and the party that commands a majority in the House of Commons chooses the prime minister. Last week, Mr. Cameron was driven out by his defeat in the European Union referendum, only 13 months after winning a general election. The slender majority of parliamentary seats that he achieved as leader of the Conservative Party is inherited by his successor, Ms. May. In theory at least, the mandate belongs to a party, not a person.The new prime minister was the home secretary for Mr. Cameron\u2019s entire six-year term. Throughout, she positioned herself discreetly for a run at the top job, occasionally raising her profile with a speech that ranged outside her regular policy portfolio. She not only wooed the party\u2019s right wing with pledges to cut back immigration, but also courted the \u201cmodernizers\u201d who believe that the party must reach beyond its base with her commitments to same-sex marriage and racial equality.After the Brexit vote, the news media and the Conservative Party were all prepared for a battle between George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London. In the event, neither entered the race, which Ms. May won with ease.Those who expected her to offer respectful continuity were immediately disabused of the notion. Ms. May\u2019s first act was a ruthless reshuffle of her predecessor\u2019s team. Out went Mr. Osborne, apparently too associated with the ancien r\u00e9gime for the new prime minister\u2019s liking. Out, too, went Michael Gove, the former justice secretary. He would have been an asset but, in Ms. May\u2019s judgment, could not sit at the same cabinet table as Mr. Johnson, her newly appointed foreign secretary. (The two had been allies in the pro-Brexit campaign, but Mr. Gove dramatically ended that alliance when he ran for the party leadership himself, ruining Mr. Johnson\u2019s chances.)Even the most seasoned analysts of British politics were struck by the brutality of Ms. May\u2019s hirings and firings. This was no accident: The prime minister wanted to send a clear signal that she represents change, not the status quo. This was intended to be a shock to the system; the new prime minister wants to be seen as a Tory radical rather than a caretaker of Mr. Cameron\u2019s legacy.Her leadership will be turbulent, whether she wants it to be or not. Her primary task is to carry out the result of the referendum and ease Britain out of the European Union with the best possible deal. Although she was a nominal Remain campaigner, her slogan since the vote has been \u201cBrexit means Brexit.\u201dThis naturally disappoints those Tory members of Parliament \u2014 perhaps a majority \u2014 who still hope that the practicalities of leaving the union will be prohibitive, and that a second referendum (or a general election in which continued European Union membership is a central issue) might yet thwart an exit.Not a chance. Prime Minister May has in effect staked her reputation on delivering a comprehensibly advantageous solution to this hugely complex problem.At present, Britain is woven into the fabric of the European Union by countless threads of business, law, administration and security. Those strands cannot all be cut in a single slice: Some are desirable, even to the most committed Brexiteer. Ms. May will be judged on the extent to which she and her negotiators \u2014 led by the new Brexit secretary, David Davis \u2014 can repatriate control of immigration but retain access to the union\u2019s single market.This is a diplomatic conundrum of horrendous difficulty. It will test Ms. May\u2019s new government to the limit.The parlous state of public finances should ensure that Ms. May\u2019s new chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, will not want the government to spend more than it already does \u2014 though we do not yet know whether he is as committed to deficit reduction as his predecessor was. His priority will be to maintain a fiscal regime that encourages foreign investment in Britain and compensates for the chilling effect of Brexit on the economy.Prime Minister May is neither a demagogue nor a showboater. As a senior minister, she was widely regarded as a technocrat, a practical politician rather than an ideologue. Yet her speech when she arrived in Downing Street was an exhilarating pledge to represent the disadvantaged, the excluded and those who, as she put it, are \u201cjust managing.\u201dIt is precisely these voters who have felt most deserted by the political establishment and most detached from the Westminster soap opera. Ms. May\u2019s outstretched hand is a bold gesture. It could end in angry disappointment, but what is the point of holding office if not to try?Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a political columnist for The Guardian and The Evening Standard and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Above her, dozens of once-gleaming light bulbs, now dark.And looking back at her on Wednesday, in the company of sea gulls and a handful of protesters baking in the midday heat, hundreds of locals familiar with the handiwork of Donald J. Trump filled a patch of this historic boardwalk that has, in recent years, had too few customers.\u201cPeople get hurt,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, speaking briefly in bumper sticker, \u201cand Donald gets paid.\u201dMrs. Clinton had come to perhaps the foremost site of Mr. Trump\u2019s checkered business history to make the case that his appeals to working people belie his history of hurting them.She spoke of unpaid contractors and despondent lenders.She said the voters he was courting \u201care the same people he\u2019s been exploiting for years.\u201dShe checked off the casinos that had come and faltered, one after another, noting that Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses stumbled long before the rest of the city followed in its latest series of setbacks.\u201cJust down the boardwalk is the Trump Taj Mahal,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald once called it the eighth wonder of the world.\u201dThe exhibition was the most conspicuous foray yet into a new territory for Mrs. Clinton: the art of the troll. For weeks, since Mrs. Clinton fully turned her attention to Mr. Trump after becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, she and her aides have seemed to take delight in trying to torment him.There was a viral Twitter post, when Mr. Trump insulted President Obama\u2019s endorsement of her: \u201cDelete your account,\u201d she wrote, using one of the medium\u2019s most common (and family-appropriate) three-word insults.There was a campaign video project last week, when staff members ventured from their Brooklyn headquarters to the lobby of Trump Tower, musing about the origin countries of Trump-branded products and quizzing strangers.In her remarks Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton provided the punch line: \u201cHe wants to make America great again. Maybe he should start by actually making things in America again.\u201dIt is not a risk-free rhetorical strategy. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s latest bid to depict Mr. Trump as reckless in business came one day after the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, called Mrs. Clinton \u201cextremely careless\u201d in using a private email and server as secretary of state.In a statement issued as Mrs. Clinton wrapped up, Mr. Trump defended his business record as \u201ctremendously successful\u201d and said that \u201cno one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gambit also represented a departure of sorts from some of her past campaign efforts to sully Mr. Trump. Early in his campaign, she often tried a hokier brand of humor, joking about his hair or facial hue.More recently, she has spoken sternly of the threats she says he would pose \u2014 a theme she sustained at times on Wednesday.Echoing a refrain from an economic policy speech last month, she invoked her father, who owned a small drapery business in Chicago, while describing Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to pay workers.She was introduced by Marty Rosenberg, whose family\u2019s plate glass business became entangled with Mr. Trump over unpaid services at the Trump Taj Mahal.It was a campaign appearance in a would-be Springsteen song, beside a shuttered restaurant, a public restroom and a miniature golf course littered with cigarette butts.In at least small doses, though, Mrs. Clinton has appeared to relish the chance to brandish a more lacerating wit, grinning through laugh lines and using campaign muscles that have generally been untapped in her two primary runs, when any intraparty squabbles have demanded a different tone.On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton gleefully tweaked the state\u2019s governor, Chris Christie, whose devotion to Mr. Trump has been the subject of persistent mockery: \u201cIf your governor would start doing his job instead of following Donald Trump around holding his coat, maybe we could really get New Jersey\u2019s economy moving again!\u201d she said to cheers.Mrs. Clinton has on more than one recent occasion tried wordplay involving books and bankruptcy proceedings: \u201cWe need to write a new chapter in the American dream, and it sure cannot be Chapter 11,\u201d she said.And she eagerly riffled through bygone lines, like a comedy news anchor rolling old footage, to highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s boastful predictions about his now-defunct casinos.\u201cDonald Trump once predicted, \u2018It will be the biggest hit yet!\u2019\u201d she said of the casino behind her.As she closed, she moved to cast Mr. Trump as the avatar of \u201ca system where the rich and powerful stick it to everybody else.\u201d\u201cHe got rich playing by those rules and he wants to keep it that way,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\u201cSo do you!\u201d a protester shouted as she pressed on.Moments later, after her speech, Mrs. Clinton joined workers picketing the Trump Taj Mahal, shaking hands and chatting with voters.The area beside the stage began to clear.

{"Headline": "Prices Have Fallen for Second Homes Along the French Coast", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byNICE, France \u2014 For families wealthy enough to afford it, the traditional vacation home with shuttered windows opening onto a view of the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea has long been an aspirational mainstay of French life: a place to cook, swim and entertain friends.But data released in May by Notaires de France, an association for French notaries, showed that average prices of homes had dropped in the course of 2015 in more than three-quarters of the coastal towns and cities that were analyzed. Although most of the price drops were less than 10 percent, some towns with a significant proportion of second homes posted bigger decreases, including, on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, with a drop of 12.8 percent, and Hy\u00e8res, with a drop of 11.1 percent.In Saint-Malo, an attractive walled town with a marina on the English Channel in Brittany, average home prices fell 11.4 percent in 2015. (Few locations posted large price increases, although the association found that houses in the Atlantic seaside resort of Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne rose in price by an average of 5 percent last year.)In comparison, the average price of existing homes in France in general \u2014 including houses and apartments in Paris and other urban centers\u2014 rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months ended May 31, according to the association\u2019s latest projection. The group reported that in this wider market \u2014 dominated by primary residences \u2014 there was a \u201cfavorable alchemy that combines a drop in interest rates and an increase in volumes, which therefore implies greater fluidity and a foreseeable rise in real estate prices.\u201dThat is not the case for vacation homes.\u201cBut second-home sales are a less urgent market,\u201d said Thierry Thomas, a notary who helped draft the report. \u201cWhat we see is that vendors often do not need to sell and are not in a rush to do so, and so only drop their sales price slowly. But when prices of a critical mass of vacation homes start to drop in a given location, as happened in 2015 in Saint-Rapha\u00ebl and Hy\u00e8res, which are both classic French seaside resort towns, they can drop quite quickly, as vendors actively seek out buyers.\u201dFor the time being, cuts in asking prices of seaside vacation homes may mean that now is a good time to buy.Fallout in currency markets from the British vote last month to leave the European Union isn\u2019t helping sales either.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what the long-term impact of the \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote will be, but it\u2019s a given that some overseas buyers\u2019 budgets will have been affected by the volatile currency situation,\u201d said Jelena Cvjetkovic, an associate director at Savills International Residential, an international real estate agency based in London.In Saint-Cast-le-Guildo, a resort town almost 20 miles west of Saint-Malo, a detached home built in 1910 within walking distance of a popular sandy beach and with sea views has an asking price of 1,760,000 euros, or $1,960,000, reduced from \u20ac2.1 million in May (through the agency Emile Garcin).The stone-built, partly half-timbered property has 15 bedrooms and a total of 665 square meters, or about 7,160 square feet, of living space. There is also a housekeepers\u2019 cottage on the 1.8 hectares, or nearly 4.5 acres, of grounds. This home \u2014 atypically big for this stretch of coast \u2014 would probably suit a buyer with the time and budget to make upgrades and particularly to install new bathrooms: At present, a line of six wash basins in a second-floor corridor of the main residence is intended for the use of a half-dozen bedrooms.Meanwhile, near Saint-Tropez on the French Mediterranean coast, in a town with about 5,600 permanent residents, a four-bedroom, four-bathroom villa on a 1,475-square-meter plot, and with 240 square meters of living space, is available for \u20ac4.9 million. The asking price of this property was also lowered in May, from \u20ac5,775,000, according to Leggett Immobilier, the agency handling the sale. The house has an open-plan living-dining area that opens onto a wooden deck, next to an outdoor swimming pool, and there is an off-road parking lot for four cars.Saint-Tropez was a quiet fishing village before it became popular with the international jet set in the early 1960s. It is crowded with vacationers in the summer, but like the rather less glamorous, family-friendly resorts on the coastline of Brittany and other seaside communities in France, it can feel very quiet in the winter, when many businesses simply shut down. As an example, La Vague d\u2019Or, a restaurant in Saint-Tropez with three Michelin stars, opened for the season in April and will close in early October.Few industry observers doubt that the main reason for the generalized drop in value of seaside homes is a stagnant French economy and a lack of confidence that it will pick up soon. \u201cIn general, we are seeing figures for homes in vacation resorts along the coast exchanging hands for prices 20 percent lower than their peak in 2008, just before prices started to plummet,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien de Lafond, the president of MeilleursAgents.com, a French property portal. \u201cMeanwhile prices for homes intended as primary residences in many cities in France, including Paris, are already above their 2008 values, and have essentially recovered after the crash.\u201d But the most difficult proposition of all from a vendor\u2019s perspective, says Mr. de Lafond, are houses in the French countryside, far from both urban centers and also the shore. Some of these properties, in Normandy, for instance, have been popular among city-dwellers as rural retreats. \u201cHere, we\u2019ve seen price drops of up to 50 percent since 2008,\u201d said Mr. de Lafond. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about some homes that are, at present, basically unsellable.\u201dBut for Mr. de Lafond there is an unanswered generational question: Do young people today even want to own a second home?Advertisements in magazines and on the Paris M\u00e9tro promote the charms of far-off destinations in Southeast Asia, South America and elsewhere. The French, in short, are becoming more adventurous. What will this mean for the future of the vacation home by the shore?\u201cIn the long term,\u201d Mr. de Lafond said, \u201cno one knows what will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 2010, Forbes magazine, the global plutocracy\u2019s official score\u00adkeeper, counted nine Latin Americans among the world\u2019s 100 top \u00adbillionaires.Among them was Eike Batista, a spanking new magnate from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Nowhere on Forbes\u2019s list just three years earlier, he was by 2010 the second-richest Latin American and the eighth-richest person in the world. And he was setting his sights even higher. \u201cSlim had better clean his rearview mirrors because on one side or the other, I\u2019m going to pass him,\u201d he proclaimed to Charlie Rose.Batista \u2014 Eike to Brazilians \u2014 portrayed himself as a different breed of titan, not a lucky scion, inheritor of past fortune, but a builder of empire. Unlike other rich Brazilians, he claimed, he didn\u2019t make his money from government contracts and political connections. He was, of course, the son of Eliezer Batista, a former chief executive of Vale, Brazil\u2019s state-run mining colossus. Yet he represented himself as the American-style entrepreneur of legend, pulling himself up by the power of his talent, will and perseverance.Ultimately, though, Batista was peddling aspirations. Part visionary, part snake oil salesman, he may have thought of himself as a bona fide creator of wealth, unique amid Latin America\u2019s coddled barons of industry and commerce. But what he sold, to eager investors at home and abroad, was Brazil\u2019s dream of greatness. And just as Brazil\u2019s dream collapsed, Batista\u2019s billions evaporated.The rise and fall of Batista is dramatically rendered in \u201cBrazillionaires,\u201d Alex Cuadros\u2019s enjoyable, deeply reported account of Brazil\u2019s outsize collection of tycoons. Cuadros, a young American journalist, spent the last six years in S\u00e3o Paulo, mostly as the \u201cbillionaires reporter\u201d for Bloomberg News. His job included calculating and recalculating the wealth of titans like the Marinhos of the Globo TV empire, of construction magnates like the Camargo family and even of Edir Macedo, the founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.This reporting provides the book\u2019s backbone. But \u201cBrazillionaires\u201d offers more than a flat collection of billionaire tales. Cuadros shrewdly presents his collage of immense wealth against an underlying background of corruption. There are kickbacks for government contracts. There are gigantic taxpayer subsidies: In 2009 alone, the state-run development bank, BNDES, lent out $76 billion, \u201cmore than the World Bank lent out in the entire world.\u201d And of course there are lavish campaign contributions, attached to the inevitable quid pro quos. JBS, which leveraged government loans to become the largest meatpacking company in the world, spent $180 million on the 2014 elections alone. \u201cIf every politician who had received JBS money formed a party,\u201d Cuadros writes, \u201cit would be the largest in Congress.\u201dIn his telling, Brazilians seem to embrace the cozy relationship between business and government as a source of pride rather than a risk for conflicts of interest. In one passage, Cuadros underscores the contrast between Adam Smith and the 19th-century Brazilian thinker Jos\u00e9 da Silva Lisboa, viscount of Cairu. Lisboa\u2019s \u201cPrincipios de Econom\u00eda Politica\u201d was meant to be an adaptation of Smith\u2019s \u201cWealth of Nations.\u201d But rather than present a paean to the invisible hand of the market, the viscount offered a rather paternalistic view of economic progress.\u201cThe sovereign of each nation must be considered the chief or head of a vast family,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand thus care for all those therein like his children, cooperating for the greater good.\u201d Swap \u201cgovernment\u201d for \u201csovereign\u201d and the passage still serves as an accurate guide to the Brazilian development strategy. It\u2019s just that some children \u2014 the Marinhos, the Camargos \u2014 are cared for better than \u00adothers.Of course, Cuadros notes wryly, the winners in this rigged race to the top cannot help believing in their own merits. The nation, they insist, prospers because of them. They deserve their station in life. In a revealing moment, Batista tells Cuadros, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Brazil is the Brazilian dream, and I happen to be the example.\u201dBatista is Cuadros\u2019s main antihero, \u00adoccupying most of the book\u2019s second half. His virtue may have been timing. He burst onto the scene in 2008 just as Brazil seemed on the cusp of achieving its long-held aspirations to greatness, included alongside Russia, India and China in what came to be known as the BRIC countries. China was buying much of Brazil\u2019s production of iron and soy. Foreign investors poured money in.Batista wrapped himself in the flag. Backed with billions in subsidized loans from the state-run development bank, he sold himself as Brazil\u2019s future.By 2010, he had raised many billions of dollars from Brazilian and foreign investors for five of his companies. There was his mining giant, his power generator and his ports company. There was his manufacturer of platforms from which to drill for oil in Brazil\u2019s vast newfound reserves under the Atlantic. And there was the crown jewel, a petroleum company, which Batista promised would soon be pumping more crude than Oman.The government in Bras\u00edlia loved Eike\u2019s story, which fit snugly into its plan to build up national champions, lavishly funded with subsidized credit, that could go head-to-head with the mightiest multinationals in the world. BNDES, the only lender in Brazil that charged single-digit interest rates, lent billions to Eike\u2019s projects. And Eike loved the government back, providing lavish campaign contributions to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and his successor, Dilma Rousseff.When Batista\u2019s luck turned sour \u2014 the oil wasn\u2019t gushing quite as he had promised, a grand port project at A\u00e7u was years behind schedule \u2014 President Rousseff wasn\u2019t in a position to bail him out. She became entangled in her own problems; this year legislators began impeachment proceedings against her for using the state-run banks to finance the government on the sly, and she ultimately let Batista go.Brazil has stumbled from its decade of grace. China is no longer buying as much iron and soy. Money has been flowing out rather than in. The International Monetary Fund expects the economy to contract by 8 percent between 2015 and 2017. And Batista has fallen from the Forbes list. But there are still 31 Brazilian billionaires, four in the top 100. Most, if not all, benefit in one way or another from the entanglement of business and political power.It would be wrong, however, to understand Brazil\u2019s plutocracy as the product of some unique outcrop of corruption. The hold on political power by the rich is hardly an exclusive feature of Brazil. \u00adLatin America has suffered for generations from the collusion between government and business. Where I grew up, in Mexico, it is the norm.Indeed, Cuadros is too smart to claim any exceptionalism. \u201cThis book is about Brazil and about billionaires,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut more than that, it\u2019s about how wealth is accumulated in the modern world and the stories we tell ourselves to explain this process.\u201d American billionaires also like to talk about their contribution to the world\u2019s prosperity, even as they pour money into American elections to purchase political power. \u201cAmerillionaires\u201d might not have to same ring to it. It would nonetheless ring true.Eduardo Porter writes the Economic Scene column for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise, Fall and Possible Renewal of a Town in Laos on China\u2019s Border", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byBoten JournalBOTEN, Laos \u2014 For five years, this remote town on the China-Laos border has lived in the shadow of more prosperous times.On the main street, weeds grow where bustling shops and restaurants once stood. Old nightclub signs blister and peel in the tropical climate. Around town, abandoned multistory hotels loom like decaying sentinels, colonized by armies of jungle insects.About a half-dozen years ago, Boten was a casino boomtown, a pinprick of neon amid thickly forested hills. Its gold-rush economy revolved around the Chinese casinos and gambling halls, which drew in thousands of visitors a month from across the border in Yunnan Province.\u201cWhen the casinos opened, there were many people visiting,\u201d said Thong Arn, 54, a Lao businesswoman whose restaurant is one of the few remaining on a strip of shuttered shop fronts with faded Chinese signs. \u201cNow there are no more tourists, only the people working here.\u201dBut Boten\u2019s luck may be about to turn once again. Chinese investors have poured more than $1.5 billion into a new development called the Beautiful Boten Specific Economic Zone, according to Laotian state media.Beautiful Boten resurrects many of the original plans for the town, with one crucial tweak: no gambling.Vixay Homsombath, a Laotian official who sits on the board of the new development, said in an interview that the government had learned its lesson from Boten\u2019s aborted gambling experiment. In a rush to bring development to this outlying region, the government gave the Chinese concessionaires too much control.\u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t have experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old developers focused on the casinos \u2014 that was their first priority.\u201d And the government had little idea of the potential risks.In 2003, a Hong Kong-registered company signed a 30-year lease with the Laotian government to set up a 1,640-hectare (about 6.3 square miles) special economic zone known as Boten Golden City, a trade and tourism hub intended to kick-start development in this backwater region of northern Laos.Concrete was laid and brightly colored buildings rose in the hills. Chinese tourists and business merchants poured over the border, drawn by visa-free access and gambling, which is illegal in mainland China. The casinos spawned a satellite economy of brothels, nightclubs and karaoke bars, even a cabaret featuring cross-dressing dancers from Thailand.With the Laotian customs office placed a few miles inside of Laos to make border-crossing easier, Boten became a virtual Chinese outpost, with clocks set to Beijing time and transactions conducted in Chinese currency.But just as gambling powered Boten\u2019s rise, it also brought about its fall.In late 2010, reports emerged that casino concessionaires were locking up visitors who were unable to pay off gambling debts. According to reports in the Chinese news media, officials from Hubei Province were sent over the border to negotiate their release.Shortly afterward, even though Boten is in Laos, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the casinos closed, tightened border controls and cut the power supply to the town.Boten quickly went into decline. Most shop and restaurant owners packed up and went home. From a population of around 10,000 at its peak, the town is now home to just 500 souls, eking out a living amid the collapsing infrastructure of Boten\u2019s heyday.At the Jingland Hotel, formerly the Royal and once the showcase development of Boten Golden City, rooms are empty and a tropical dampness spreads through the upper floors. A jagged hole gapes behind the lobby: the former entrance to a demolished casino annex. Across the tarmac other buildings stand empty, their doors fastened with cheap bicycle locks.\u201cI\u2019ve been here a year, but business isn\u2019t great,\u201d said Deng Jie, 25, who owns a bare-walled restaurant and karaoke bar on another forlorn strip of shuttered stores.Now he\u2019s considering selling out. He sighed, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t keep going on like this.\u201dBut amid the decay there are some small signs of renewal. Construction is underway on a series of 18-story towers along the highway through town, which has been lined with billboards showing President Xi Jinping of China shaking hands with Choummaly Sayasone, until recently the president of Laos.Not far away, an old casino has been converted into a gem emporium, chandeliers aglow above marble floors and rich red carpets. Even the cabaret with cross-dressers is back in business.The grand plans for Boten reflect the intimate ties between landlocked Laos and its giant northern neighbor. Since the early 2000s, Chinese money has poured into this communist nation of seven million people, mostly into mining, agriculture, hydropower and real estate.In late 2013, the cumulative value of Chinese investment topped $5 billion, making China the largest foreign investor in Laos for the first time. The cash has been accompanied by a wave of economic migrants from China, who have settled in Vientiane and in enclaves across the country\u2019s mountainous north.Paul Chambers, director of research at the Institute of South East Asian Affairs in Chiang Mai, Thailand, said that while the early investments in Boten had a freewheeling nature, the spotlight now is on more strategic interests.\u201cChina\u2019s new focus on Boten is to make it a transportation hub facilitating greater Chinese penetration of Laos,\u201d he said.Despite all the promises, the benefits have been slow in coming. The main duty-free mall, converted from an old nightclub, is bereft of customers, its shelves of cigarettes and single-malt whiskey standing as still and pristine as museum exhibits. More popular is an adjoining room filled with slot machines and electronic roulette tables, the only type of gambling now permitted in Boten.Analysts say that much depends on the progress of the China-Laos railway, which has been plagued by funding problems and other delays. Joshua Kurlantzick, a Southeast Asia expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, gave the project a \u201c50 percent chance\u201d of succeeding.The slow progress makes many Chinese business owners nostalgic for Boten\u2019s glory days, when the lights shone brightly and the town was mobbed by cashed-up tourists.Zhang Xiangxun, 51, a shopkeeper from Anhui Province who came to Boten six years ago, runs a small grocery on the main street, its shelves heaving with Chinese beer, soap, snacks and fireworks. Business is slow. Mr. Zhang and his wife, Zou Zhonghua, 46, say they earn around 500 renminbi (about $75) per day, barely enough to cover rent and other costs.But after so many years in Laos, they have decided to wait it out. \u201cThe casino\u2019s shut and everything\u2019s very quiet, but we\u2019re still staying,\u201d Mr. Zhang said, tapping cigarette ash into an empty Harbin Beer box.While the couple are optimistic that Boten\u2019s fortunes, and their own, have finally turned, Mrs. Zou thinks the real solution is much simpler. \u201cIf they just opened the casinos again,\u201d she said, \u201cbusiness would increase a thousand percent.\u201dBecause of an editing error, the Boten Journal article on July 7, about a remote Laotian town that is hoping a new development plan will bring back its once-thriving tourist business, misstated the imperial equivalent of the 1,640-hectare project. It is the equivalent of about 6.3 square miles, not 2.5 square miles.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the number of businesses left over in Boten from its glory days. One business remains, not two.Advertisement"}

And many of the readers, who were predominantly male, would not give their names, saying they feared stigmatization.These responses have been edited for length and clarity. And because many of the issues raised are highly contentious across Europe, we have provided context with each submission.Symbolic politics of \u201chelping\u201d those who need help by inviting them in regardless of circumstances and economy don\u2019t help. Our economy doesn\u2019t increase along with the never-ending supply of immigrants. To help, you figure out the cause of the problem and fix it. It\u2019s like buying buckets for a leaky roof instead of just fixing the roof itself.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.Three things make me consider voting for the Sweden Democrats, even if I find the party\u2019s historical links to white supremacy repugnant and don\u2019t agree with their anti-E.U. and anti-NATO membership stances: mass immigration and open borders, identity politics, and \u201cestablishment\u201d propaganda for the previous two.Sweden has had massive immigration over the past couple of decades. Instead of acknowledging the problems related to mass immigration, the mainstream parties and mainstream media have for decades either ignored them, blamed them on Swedish/Swedes\u2019 racism, blamed them on lack of social services or claimed that while there may be initial cost with immigration, it\u2019s profitable long term.Why would a male, ethnic Swedish worker want to vote for political parties which see \u201cwhite men\u201d as oppressors and regularly denigrate their ethnicity and culture?As a young adult, I would like to vote for something fresh with no or few connections to the previous regime. Only the far-right party is speaking about real problems, e.g., the two largest parties promise to solve Gypsy-related issues (their low education, their low income), but they never do anything.I like Europe and have plenty of friends from other countries in Europe, but this does not alter the fact that I do not feel a sense of belonging to Europe, especially not the \u201cEurope\u201d sold to us by the E.U. project. I feel that France\u2019s destiny lies with Africa and our close European neighbors, which is something that the National Front embraces: a truly independent France working for its own destiny. I may not embrace all of the party\u2019s solutions and proposals, but everything starts and ends with sovereignty.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.Watching 800,000 uninvited illegal migrants wander into the country, and seeing Germany allow these people to ignore the law and do what they wanted, I realized that countries that can\u2019t control their borders \u2014 or won\u2019t because of misguided na\u00efve ideas about \u201chuman rights\u201d \u2014 are doomed unless the people who pay the taxes and make things work have some say in the matter. It is a new \u201csilent majority\u201d that has been cowed into submission by a liberal press and cowardly politicians. Time to end this.I\u2019ve voted for the F.P.\u00d6. for many reasons related to foreigners, but in most cases, the foreigners are not guilty. Our government is responsible for the hate against foreigners, because many Austrians feel like second-class citizens in their own country.In Austria, it\u2019s mandatory for young men to serve in the army. If your military service is not over, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get a job. So when I dropped out because of problems with high blood pressure, I had to apply for social care. Because I had never worked before, I only got the absolute minimum of 313 euros a month. Refugees got more than \u20ac700 a month at the same time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkish Leader Erdogan Making New Enemies and Frustrating Old Friends", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, strode onto a stage a month ago looking down upon a sea of a million fans waving red Turkish flags. They were celebrating the 15th-century conquest of Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, the golden moment of Turkey\u2019s Muslim ancestors triumphing over the Christian West.\u201cThe conquest means going beyond the walls that the West thought were impervious,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said as the crowd roared. \u201cThe conquest means a 21-year-old sultan bringing Byzantium to heel.\u201dThe spectacle, complete with a fighter-jet sky show and a re-enactment of the conquest with fireworks and strobe lights, projected an image of unity and command, of a nation marching together toward greatness, drawing on the achievements of a glorious past. But that soaring vision is being grounded by sobering realities.Mr. Erdogan, who long professed a foreign policy of \u201czero problems with neighbors,\u201d now seems to be mired in disputes with just about everybody and just about everywhere. Kurdish and Islamic State militants have struck Turkey 14 times in the past year, killing 280 people and sowing new fears. The economy has suffered, too, as the violence frightens away tourists.\u201cI think this is an indicator of how desperate they are,\u201d said Cengiz Candar, a visiting scholar at the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies.Where Mr. Erdogan once held up Turkey as a model of Muslim democracy, he now frequently attacks democratic institutions. The editor in chief of Turkey\u2019s largest daily has fled the country, and another is on trial on charges of revealing state secrets. The president has grown intolerant of criticism, purging his oldest allies from his inner circle and replacing them with yes men and, in some cases, relatives. (His son-in-law is the energy minister.)Mr. Erdogan hints darkly in near-daily speeches on Turkish television that foreign powers are plotting to destroy him, and he has moved from a modest house in central Ankara to a grandiose, Persian Gulf-style palace on the edge of the city. Brown and pink buildings for his staff dot meticulously landscaped grounds so enormous that staff members are driven around in minibuses.Now he has set his sights on a new target: transforming Turkey\u2019s parliamentary system of government into a presidential one, a change his critics say could soon open the door to his seizing the title of president for life. On the night of the airport bombing, the Parliament, which his party controls, worked until 5:45 a.m. to pass sweeping legislation that will help pave the way by purging hundreds of judges from Turkey\u2019s top two courts.\u201cThe ship is going very fast toward the rocks,\u201d said Ergun Ozbudun, a liberal constitutional expert who once defended Mr. Erdogan. \u201cPray for us.\u201dThe story of how Turkey, a NATO member with the eighth-largest economy in Europe and a population the size of Germany\u2019s, ended up here is as much about Mr. Erdogan as it is about the country\u2019s unlucky geography in a convulsing Middle East. While Mr. Erdogan has seemed to have nine lives, wriggling out of every crisis, he now finds himself cornered by conflicts on many fronts, including deep divisions in his own society that he has helped create.\u201cErdogan is still the most popular political leader, but there is unease in the population,\u201d said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and professor at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. \u201cA lot of people are thinking this is an untenable situation.\u201dMr. Erdogan, 62, is one of the most talented politicians Turkey has ever known, rising from a poor neighborhood in Istanbul to the heights of power, where he has won election after election since 2002. He succeeded where others had failed in tearing down Turkey\u2019s rigid, classist system of government; sending the meddling military back to its barracks; and opening up the bureaucracy, long deeply suspicious of Turkey\u2019s pious underclass.In his early years as prime minister, the economy soared and, as incomes rose sharply, so did his popularity. But his critics \u2014 and even some of his admirers \u2014 say he became so absorbed in battling his enemies, both real and perceived, that he lost his way. He became distracted, they say, by delusions of imperial grandeur and in the process badly damaged institutions critical for a functioning democracy.Even a former friend, who like others feared being identified, said he had known Mr. Erdogan for 40 years, but no longer recognized him.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s advisers point out that institutions like the free press and judiciary were never all that free to begin with. They say that his government has genuinely been in danger, a claim Western officials corroborate, and that changes in the judiciary aim to fix a broken system.Ilnur Cevik, one of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s chief advisers, said the rapprochement with Russia and Israel was part of a strategy to turn the page and might soon be followed by similar measures to quiet some of the storms Mr. Erdogan had raised, like the one with Egypt: Mr. Erdogan had a falling-out with that country in 2013 over the ouster of Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president.There was good news on the media front, too: On Thursday night, a journalist and a human rights activist were released from jail.\u201cWe have to kind of change gears regarding foreign policy, regarding the press, regarding many issues in Turkey, and I think Mr. Erdogan will start doing that,\u201d said Mr. Cevik, seated in a spacious palace room recently outfitted, so it smelled like the interior of a new car. \u201cWe have to show our true face to the American public. We are completely misunderstood at the moment.\u201dA political outsider, Mr. Erdogan helped found the Justice and Development Party, a diverse and inclusive grass-roots political machine that turned out to be very good at winning elections, not because it cheated but because its members worked hard.\u201cHe really listened to his friends,\u201d said Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, another of the party\u2019s founders. \u201cHe was patient. He would consult with a rich and varied spectrum of people. When he saw violence, he knew how to step back.\u201dTo gain control of Turkey\u2019s bureaucracy, Mr. Erdogan struck an alliance with an opaque religious group led by a Muslim preacher, Fethullah Gulen, filling the ranks of the police and the judiciary with its highly educated members.\u201cI told him I didn\u2019t think any part of the state should be left to the control of people with a certain ideology,\u201d said Mr. Firat, a Kurd who has since left the party. \u201cHis answer was, \u2018We will not be harmed by those who look toward Mecca.\u2019 We were not an Islamist party \u2014 we were a democratic party. But he was already drifting away.\u201dThat was because he could: With the military out of the picture, the major check on his power had been removed.But Islam was not his undoing. Absolute power was. As Mr. Erdogan grew more popular, winning broad pluralities and even majorities in each successive election, he began to behave with a kind of Bolshevism, believing that he was the very embodiment of the people, former officials said.Others argue that Turkey\u2019s problems are as much about the country as they are about Mr. Erdogan.\u201cWe treat Erdogan as the cause, but in some sense, he is the consequence of Turkish society \u2014 he is our creation,\u201d said Hakan Altinay, the director of the European School of Politics at Bogazici University in Istanbul. \u201cWe have learned that even though we have the hardware of democracy \u2014 institutions, elections \u2014 our software is not good. We are too attuned to status, too willing to submit to authority.\u201dToday, many say Mr. Erdogan has simply adopted the bad habits of former Turkish leaders he came to power to defeat. He needs allies, so he has struck an alliance with the military \u2014 the chief of staff was a witness at his daughter\u2019s wedding \u2014 and extreme nationalists are now resurgent. That is deeply troubling to human rights advocates who have documented the missing-person case of a Kurdish politician from Sirnak, Hursit Kulter, the first such disappearance since 2001.\u201cErdogan today has been captured by the patriotic forces of Turkey,\u201d said Dogu Perincek, the head of a nationalist political party close to the military, who was jailed for conspiring against the state but recently released.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel is the economy. His voters, while loyal, care about their pocketbooks more. Incomes have stagnated in recent years, and foreign direct investment, a major indicator of economic direction, has been declining, not counting real estate purchases.\u201cWe have an ulcer, not cancer,\u201d Atilla Yesilada, a financial consultant in Istanbul, said of the economy. \u201cBut all signs point toward sicker.\u201dSafak Timur contributed reporting from Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey.videoAdvertisement"}

We received more than 2,500 emails.All over California, communities are grappling with a shortage of affordable housing.Is Airbnb part of the problem?The company is increasingly at odds with local governments in the state.Airbnb has resisted, accusing officials of overreaching.Now, Airbnb is in a legal battle with its hometown, San Francisco, which has brought up wrenching questions about inequality, neighborhood change and the free market.Founded inside a San Francisco apartment, Airbnb is a major local success story.But Airbnb has also become a focal point for anger at the tech industry \u2014 even more so than the Google buses that bring workers to jobs in Silicon Valley.Short-term rentals in San Francisco are being blamed, at least in part, for rising rents that are driving out longtime residents.Last year, Airbnb spent more than $8 million to defeat a ballot measure that would have limited rentals to no more than 75 nights a year.Last month, San Francisco supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance that would fine Airbnb $1,000 per day for each host listed on its website who is not registered with the city.\u201cThis legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb,\u201d the company said.\u201cIt\u2019s this very visible sign of the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just of gentrification, but of how wide the disparity is between people who have opportunities and people who don\u2019t.\u201dWhen questioned by reporters about the state budget, which he signed this week, Governor Brown responded with a parable, Aesop\u2019s \u201cThe Ant and the Grasshopper.\u201dAesop, an ancient Greek fabulist, \u201chas some credibility,\u201d Mr. Brown said.That was one of the governor\u2019s less obscure literary references.Since returning to Sacramento in 2011 for a second stint as governor, he has quoted poets, religious scholars and biologists.He invoked the book of Genesis, Oliver Wendell Holmes, a king of Spain and \u201cThe Little Engine That Could\u201d all in the same 2013 speech.\u201cOver the mountain the little engine went \u2014 we are going to get over that mountain,\u201d he said, making an analogy to California\u2019s high-speed rail plan after quoting the children\u2019s book.The unusual source material has perplexed some analysts.But his literary breadth may also help reinforce his image as a wise, old \u2014 well, experienced (he\u2019s 78) \u2014 politician, who will keep his party\u2019s impulses to spend in check.During a speech last year about climate change, Mr. Brown said proudly that he was among the last politicians with a classics degree.\u201cIt does come in handy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause some of the same mistakes have been made over and over again.\u201dCalifornia Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man vs. Machine", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe ShortlistDavenport and Kirby make a strong case that as machine intelligence makes progress, humans will need to distinguish their skills: \u201cstepping up,\u201d or being smarter than machines at seeing the big picture; \u201cstepping aside,\u201d choosing jobs machines cannot do; \u201cstepping in,\u201d being the person who can be a bridge between machines and humans.These may be good options, but it is difficult to see how they would apply to a majority of the world\u2019s workers or in a political and economic system in which corporations have incentives to disempower employees. When discussing, for example, why despite advances in technology, the workweek hasn\u2019t gotten shorter, the authors point to economists who argue that we work more in order to consume more and psychologists who say we find work satisfying. Haunting this discussion is the fact that people have little choice as longer hours are imposed on them.The authors do appeal to businesses to augment human labor with technology, but such a strategy is likely to be applicable only to a very highly skilled work force. Technology disempowers workers not because of its bits and bytes but because of how our economy is set up. Without changing that reality, any path to rescue is likely to have little staying power, since the next round of ever-\u00adadvancing technology will come and sink that lifeboat, too.Rid\u2019s new book offers a detailed retelling of the early days of humanity\u2019s encounter with intelligent machines, emphasizing the social context and response to new technology from World War II to the present world of hacking, cyber-insecurity and looming dangers of autonomous warfare.The initial narrative is centered mostly on the ideas of the mathematician Norbert Wiener, who popularized the notion of a new age of computer-controlled systems but also came to worry that automation might be the \u201ceconomic equivalent of slave labor.\u201d He warned of mass unemployment and loss of human dignity, disagreeing with those who, like the mathematician Alice Mary Hilton, believed machines would herald a golden age \u201cfree of human drudgery.\u201dIt is easy to scoff at the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of technical visionaries of earlier eras, as Rid sometimes does. Their anxieties and grand hopes might seem extreme, but it may well be that we have grown complacent and shortsighted. As we enter an age of machine intelligence, we might take Wiener as an early, flawed prophet whose warnings we should heed (admittedly with the benefit of grounded and realistic analyses). Rid\u2019s book offers a useful history as well as a chance to re-examine our current technological crossroads.This survey of the legal and policy landscape around the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in the digital age reads as a painful reminder of why laws that were developed before the invention of photography and sound recording fall short when we consider dignity and privacy today.In his 2009 book \u201cDelete,\u201d Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger warned that digital networks could \u201cforever tether us to all our past actions, making it impossible, in practice, to escape them.\u201d Jones reminds us that this tether is not automatic but a \u201cstructure of discoverability\u201d that can be altered. For example, in 2014, Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that individuals could ask Google to have negative information removed or \u201cdelisted\u201d from search results. What we need, Jones argues, is not complete erasure but \u201cdigital redemption,\u201d as in the way American bankruptcy laws allow people in debt to start over. Applied to our digital lives, such measures would keep us from being eternally haunted by an embarrassing photograph or ill-advised tweet.The book leaves us wanting more in the way of suggested regulations, but by laying out the terrain so thoughtfully, and highlighting the concepts that should guide our actions, Jones has created the groundwork for a much needed conversation on the profound problem of permanent digital ballasts in the 21st century.To computer scientists, \u201calgorithm\u201d means a well-\u00adordered set of steps to achieve a particular goal. An everyday example might be the algorithm to tie your shoelaces: Hold one lace tightly, make a loop with the other. Do you have a computer file that is a long, unordered list that must be sorted? A need to handle a lot of records that don\u2019t fit into the memory, or run a lot of programs simultaneously? There\u2019s an algorithm (or two or three or more) for that. In this nuanced introduction, Christian and Griffiths do a fine job of explaining basic sorting and optimization algorithms used in computer science \u2014 along with their weaknesses.The book delves deeper when it claims to show how these tools can solve everyday problems, from the trivial to the profound. I found the examples fascinating, but the computer science algorithms felt more easily applicable to simpler problems (how to seat everyone at a wedding to maximize pleasant company) rather than the more complex questions (how to decide whom to marry).As software only becomes ever more sophisticated and powerful \u2014 deciding who might get hired or fired, given a loan or denied, convicted or paroled \u2014 perhaps the most important function of this entertaining and educational book is in revealing the limiting assumptions, narrow boundaries and tight restrictions of algorithms, and how different they can be from the messy world of humans.Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a contributing opinion writer for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Midea of China Moves a Step Closer to Takeover of Kuka of Germany", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Chinese appliance maker has struck a $1.3 billion deal that brings it closer to taking over a German robotics company, a proposed transaction that has stirred concerns in Germany about Chinese purchases of the country\u2019s industrial skills.Midea \u2014 which manufacturers consumer electronics like air-conditioners and rice cookers \u2014 holds 13.5 percent of Kuka shares and will become the largest shareholder, once it acquires Voith\u2019s stake.During a visit to China last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that she would not block the deal, but she also said that nothing was stopping a German bidder from emerging.After Midea made promises to shield Kuka\u2019s data and keep its business locations and jobs in place, Kuka\u2019s board recommended last week that shareholders accept the offer. Kuka said that its industrial property rights and the data of its customers and suppliers would be protected by the agreement and that Midea would not be able to gain access to or move databases.\u201cWe conducted intensive negotiations with Midea and ensured that the announced assurances have now been made legally binding,\u201d said Till Reuter, Kuka\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt protects the interests of our company, our business partners, our employees and our shareholders until well into the next decade.\u201dRobots made by Kuka, based in Augsburg, Germany, have already helped Midea, which employs about 100,000 people, to reduce its staff as part of its efforts to automate more of its production lines.The deal highlights China\u2019s interest both in German companies as acquisition targets and in the machinery sector. China\u2019s deals with Germany have increased in number to 25 so far this year from 11 for the period in 2015, according to data from Dealogic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Hillary Clinton Become the Champion of the 99 Percent?", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "FeatureA coalition of progressives has been quietly building a plan to bring Occupy-style ideas into the political establishment. Will the Democratic nominee get on board?Supported byIn the car, Wong heard the candidate say: \u201cThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201dOh, my God, Wong thought, I can\u2019t believe she just said that. Each time she repeated this story to me, she narrowed her eyes toward an imaginary car radio and pointed in disbelief.\u201cProsperity can\u2019t be just for C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers,\u201d the candidate continued. \u201cDemocracy can\u2019t just be for the billionaires and corporations.\u201dOh, my God, Wong thought again, I can\u2019t believe she just said that. It may have been political boilerplate, but Wong thrilled to it. Her incredulity had yielded to pleasure and admiration. Republicans, the candidate went on, \u201cpledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures.\u201dWong stopped the car to check her phone. Exultant emails were streaming in. \u201cThis is our plan!\u201d one Roosevelt board member wrote. \u201cThis is your plan!\u201d\u201cOur plan\u201d was \u201cRewriting the Rules of the American Economy,\u201d an inventive combination of narrative history and policy platform that Roosevelt published the month before. The report billed itself as a comprehensive agenda to ameliorate inequality. First, it said, inequality is a choice, not an inevitable byproduct of technology, globalization and the uneven distribution of personal virtue. Second, it held that the longstanding notion of an economic trade-off between growth and equality is a fiction.Unlike the myriad other white papers that each week were drafted, edited, somnolently received at other think tanks and shelved without fanfare, this report \u2014 original not so much in its ideas as in its clarity and vigor \u2014 had captured wide and consequential attention. In the months leading up to its publication, the Roosevelt team was in close touch with Clinton speechwriters and advisers, and in subsequent rallies the candidate continued to draw upon the report, even at the level of explicit language; calls to \u201crewrite the rules\u201d found their way into more of her addresses. The many news reports that linked the speech to Wong\u2019s organization consistently and erroneously relocated her team to Washington. (Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for \u201crevolution,\u201d finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party\u2019s near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment.As the party heads into its convention in Philadelphia, this coalition sees encouraging signals \u2014 perhaps most notably the role that Elizabeth Warren, a key Roosevelt ally, has come to play in the campaign \u2014 that Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic sympathies might ultimately lie further to the left than skeptics supposed. Roosevelt is a 501(c)(3), and though it does maintain a political-action arm, it does not work to elect specific candidates. Still, various representatives from Clinton\u2019s speechwriting and policy teams regularly solicit the organization\u2019s input. Roosevelt in turn has redoubled its efforts not only on advancing the ideas in \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d but also in recruiting the personnel necessary to carry them out, in the form of a methodical effort to find suitable candidates for economic positions in a future presidential administration.Rob Stein, the liberal operative whose establishment of the Democracy Alliance in 2005 did perhaps more than any other act to funnel new money and new ardor into progressive causes, told me: \u201cLike no other progressive institution, Roosevelt is bringing strategically relevant insight to the deeper structural problems of our economy.\u201d Part of the reason Wong and her team remain mostly unheralded is that they eschew power politics for the quieter work of developing networks to act on ideas. They thus do not see themselves as pushing or pulling or dragging the Democratic nominee to their position. They believe that this candidate, of all candidates, is unlikely to respond to public hectoring or ultimatums. The greatest incentive they can offer is a demonstration that Clinton may well already be the candidate that progressives \u2014 and the electorate \u2014 have been waiting for.One cold, dreary spring day I accompanied her to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. building on 16th Street NW, a foreboding grid of polished beige stone with a lobby dominated by a hallucinogenic two-story marble mosaic. Wong often proceeds by indirection, and the obvious contrast of this first meeting \u2014 between Big Labor\u2019s encumbrances and Roosevelt\u2019s dexterity \u2014 made, in retrospect, a deliberate point.Damon Silvers, the organization\u2019s policy director, greeted us in a cluttered low-floor office that looked as if it might belong to a law professor. He showed us seats at a wobbly round table and talked about wages and productivity and economic pain. \u201cThere have been a few years over the last 30 with broad-based wage growth,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut those are the outliers, the exceptions \u2014 a few years under Reagan, some under Clinton, but stagnation has been the regime since 1980.\u201d He praised Roosevelt as the source of \u201cheavyweight economic thinking\u201d on this, and for \u201cupping the ante.\u201dWong deflected the credit. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been saying this,\u201d she replied, \u201cand Elizabeth Warren says it, and Stiglitz has been saying it for 30 years, but now it\u2019s almost common knowledge.\u201d Wong was more concerned about how they planned to put that common knowledge into action before the looming convention.\u201cDespite President Obama\u2019s efforts, the rules of the economy continue to drive runaway inequality,\u201d Silvers went on. \u201cThe power dynamics that were in place in 2008 are still in place now, and we don\u2019t have all the time in the world to fix this.\u201dThis continued for a while, as Silvers relaxed into the comfortable contours of his analysis and Wong steered the visit toward what might actually be done. Eventually she was summoned to see the union\u2019s president, Richard Trumka, whose seigneurial berth looks down on the White House. Silvers directed me in the meantime to a vitrine of the fat blue bill-signing pens L.B.J. used to enact the Great Society \u2014 food stamps, public broadcasting, urban mass transport, water quality, wholesome poultry products. \u201cIf you want to see what structural change looks like,\u201d he told me, tapping on the glass, \u201ctake a look at this.\u201dThe progressive organizations in Wong\u2019s rotation take as a matter of course the idea that the Obama administration was a significant missed opportunity for transformation on that order. They do not entirely blame Obama. He had his legislative victories \u2014 most importantly in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but one lesson they drew from his time in office was that liberals had long been overly fixated on legislative success. (Johnson had a Congress he could work with; Obama mostly did not, and the next president probably won\u2019t, either.) The right has set the agenda for the past 35 years because they built their economic movement deductively (from the first principle of the unregulated market) and took their victories where they could find them. The left, by comparison, tended to moralize, and spoke in the language of justice instead of growth. When they did talk about economics, it took the form of individual issues \u2014 minimum wage, student debt, paid family and sick leave \u2014 rather than overarching pronouncements. This muddle worsened during the Bush era, when urgent noneconomic concerns forced the left to privilege short-term electoral tactics over long-term strategy.Roosevelt was designed to be a place, independent of the party establishment, to unite all of these factions under the banner of long-term, coherent economic thinking. Had such a movement existed in 2008, it might have seized on the financial crisis as an opportunity for structural economic reform. Obama\u2019s recovery model, to the group\u2019s lasting dismay, remained in thrall to old superstitions about growth. The goal of the bailout was to fix the existing financial system and get credit flowing back into the economy while keeping an eye on deficit spending. But today, though high-level macroeconomic numbers like monthly job growth or the headline unemployment rate have improved, almost half of the new jobs created in the first five years of the recovery were poverty-level. Repaired with a kludge, the system went right back to doing exactly what it did before: allowing the extraordinary concentration of power in the hands of the few to dominate the prospects of the many.Roosevelt and its allies believe that the crisis could have been an occasion \u2014 unseen since the New Deal \u2014 for the diffusion of authority, large-scale infrastructural investment, attention to low-wage growth and relief for the plight of overextended homeowners rather than banks. But that opportunity passed by because, in the absence of a strong, organized countervailing force, responsibility for the bailout simply defaulted to the claque of Citigroup veterans and sympathizers that had administered Democratic economic policy for what was now a full generation. The critics didn\u2019t think that these ex-bankers were unscrupulous, but rather that they acted in accordance with the free-market orthodoxy they inherited from their predecessors.With all this resentment of bankers, a news consumer might have thought the enthusiasm in this milieu \u2014 that is, all the groups that resisted the legacy of deregulated, race-neutral, free-market bipartisanship \u2014 would accrue to Bernie Sanders. But Sanders in fact came up only rarely in my conversations with them, usually in praise of the sincerity of his message. The common view of the Democratic contest was that Sanders did a great service in pushing Clinton to the left. Though in some senses this was clearly the case \u2014 on the minimum wage and on college tuition \u2014 there was an alternate interpretation. As Sanders gained traction, it seemed to Wong and her partners that Clinton had simply ceded to him the territory of aggressive financial reform. Sanders, in their view, hadn\u2019t so much pulled her to the left as pushed her to swivel.The Roosevelt coalition agreed by and large with the direction of Sanders\u2019s economic program, but they regretted the crudeness of his exposition. They understood, for example, the appeal of a call to break up the banks but found greater sophistication in Clinton\u2019s proposals to regulate \u201cshadow banking.\u201d They wished his advisers had been more careful with the numbers. And the personal iconoclasm and moral purity of the Sanders campaign didn\u2019t lend themselves to governance. How, given the way Obama\u2019s ideals foundered on a kind of Washington default mode, did Sanders plan to staff an entire administration?On the left, there are lots of small organizations in Washington that publish granular research on specific economic trends. But the most significant liberal think tank in recent years has been the Center for American Progress, founded in 2003 by the former Bill Clinton chief of staff (and current Hillary Clinton campaign chair) John Podesta as his party\u2019s answer to the conservative Heritage Foundation. CAP has done a lot of innovative policy work, especially on universal preschool and health care, but it was always less of a research organization than a shadow government for an opposition in exile. When Obama was elected, roughly a third of CAP\u2019s staff went into his administration. CAP was founded in an era when few liberals were of the opinion that the system itself was broken: If you just found slightly better Democrats, elected them to office and put smarter policies in their hands, they believed, the country would return to the prosperity of the 1990s. Liberal Washington was not equipped, when the financial crisis broke, to tender a holistic analysis of what was ailing the economy. (Today, CAP\u2019s economic ideas are more in line with those of Roosevelt, and in 2015 it released a report on short-termism that anticipated part of \u201cRewriting the Rules.\u201d)In 2009, a political scientist named Andrew Rich, known for writing about the \u201cwar of ideas,\u201d was drafted to reinvent the Roosevelt Institute as a place for the radical thinking that postcrisis politics seemed to require. Roosevelt at the time was an ad hoc collection of spare progressive parts, including the upkeep of the F.D.R. Library in Hyde Park, N.Y. Rich believed that if you weren\u2019t in Washington, and you weren\u2019t beholden to the party apparatus, and if you got the right people \u2014 people who were too idiosyncratic or rough-hewn for academia, or academics who wanted to be politically relevant but needed help with finding an audience for their work \u2014 you could create a new kind of institution on a looser, livelier model.At that moment of upheaval and administration dithering, financial reform was the new Roosevelt\u2019s obvious first priority. Rich brought on Stiglitz and Mike Konczal, whose pseudonymous financial-crisis blog had a cult following among progressives. In 2010, the organization held a conference that prominently featured Elizabeth Warren, then early in her career as a public figure. While Warren worked on the TARP oversight panel, she needed somewhere to park her aide-de-camp, Dan Geldon, to help draft the details of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was being set up on the basis of her ideas. He served as a fellow, and he and Warren maintain close ties to Roosevelt. Warren insisted I come into her office, though she was late to a vote, so she could tell me how enormously enthusiastic she was about Roosevelt\u2019s work: \u201cIt\u2019s a new voice in American political discourse. Their message is, We can do better than this! They\u2019re bringing fundamental optimism back to the center of American life.\u201dWhen Wong took over in 2012, she continued to recruit staff members and fellows who were at once nonaligned and well connected: to the A.F.T. and S.E.I.U., Demos, MoveOn, the Clintons. By January 2015, Wong had decided, along with her communications director, Marcus Mrowka, and her vice president of research and policy, Nell Abernathy, to prepare for the coming election by creating a full-dress economic agenda that would be there for the candidates\u2019 taking. \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d got funding from the Ford Foundation, whose decision last year to refocus around the issue of inequality was influenced by Roosevelt, and whose president, Darren Walker, effused to me about Wong as an \u201cincandescent leader\u201d for the progressive movement. While written by Stiglitz, the paper was worked out in consultation with labor officials, academics, congressional staff members and \u2014 unusually for a think tank \u2014 advocates from places like Color of Change, Naral and the Black Civic Engagement Fund.The report lays out a stark narrative about the American economy as it exists today. Inequality, it maintains, is a function not of economic laws but of the preferences awarded to the powerful to extract rents \u2014 to exploit people who have little choice \u2014 especially on necessary goods like housing and health care. This may have been old wine, but it was poured into new bottles; economists after Keynes lost the habit of talking about power, and Roosevelt stressed that this vision was about the way that power and prejudice created not only distorted markets but also nonfunctional ones. The economy has stalled because too much wealth is being generated in nonproductive activity, hoarded to preserve for the rich all the things government no longer provides. The long-run situation, as Wong put it to me once, is America as \u201ca fear-catalyzed gated community for a privileged few, and a violent, racially hostile, \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 race to the bottom for the rest of us.\u201d\u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d then moves on to 37 policy recommendations. Some seek to reduce concentrated power via changes to the tax code, financial reform and labor-market interventions: enacting financial-transaction taxes; taxing corporations on global income; strengthening the right to collective bargaining; and rewriting laws \u2014 on intellectual-property rights, lending practices, health care \u2014 that present unfair opportunities for monopoly profits. There is a parallel pocketbook agenda: a Fed policy of full employment, via low interest rates and access to credit markets, rather than one designed to control inflation; higher living wages; gender and racial equality in pay; affordable child care. Last is infrastructure: public spending for public goods, and not just roads and bridges but also broadband, high-speed rail, smart grid, green buildings \u2014 and especially investments in schools and housing that might end racial segregation. All three categories rest in part on public options. The role of an activist government, as Roosevelt sees it, is not to monopolize any given service, on a command-economy model, but to exist as a permanently nonextortionate market player. The report calls for a postal bank, which would expand access to banking services to the underserved; a public option for mortgages; Medicare open to all; and an expansion of Social Security via voluntary public investment accounts modeled on I.R.A.s.From a budgetary perspective, at least, the report takes care to present its recommendations as feasible and responsible, imagining that all of those public options (for example) would be run as break-even enterprises. \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d does call for an increase in top individual marginal tax rates to perhaps 45 percent, a substantial increase by today\u2019s Republican standards but well in line with contemporary Europe or 20th-century America. What was novel was that, unlike the usual centrist Democrat call for more job training and an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, this was not about tinkering with the old tax-and-transfer liberalism but about changing the fundamental structure of the economy. Their demands were vaulting, but they held that an agenda offering freedom from exploitation (rather than freedom from regulation), and insisting that greater fairness would benefit everyone, would resonate with all Americans.Everywhere it has been pointed out that this election feels like a prolonged rehash of 1990s enmities. Wong has a Faulknerian view: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the same fights,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the exact same people.\u201d The story goes that there were two distinct factions in the Clinton White House: the free-market, centrist, \u201cneoliberal\u201d wing that we now associate with such figures as Larry Summers and Robert Rubin and such institutions as the Democratic Leadership Council; and then people like Stiglitz \u2014 who was head of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years \u2014 and Robert Reich. The Summers/Rubin wing largely prevailed. An approach to crime and poverty was engineered to win back Reagan Democrats so they could pass a deregulatory program that would appeal to emerging managerial wealth. The party\u2019s Rubinite/Citigroup lineage extended through Rubin\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Michael Froman, who as part of Obama\u2019s transition team helped usher Tim Geithner into the Treasury Department. It was this legacy that had, throughout the primaries, prevented so many people from taking the former first lady \u2014 especially as she tied herself to Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 as a credible voice for the economic reforms of \u201cRewriting the Rules.\u201dThis Manichaean story is a vast oversimplification for a variety of reasons, but it did inform the way many voters, especially on the left, viewed the primaries. The fight between Clinton and Sanders often seemed like a choice between a repudiation of the long 1990s entirely (Robert Reich has been an outspoken Sanders supporter) or an avowal that this time the party will choose the vision of Stiglitz. The obvious mystery then becomes: Where does Hillary Clinton herself stand? The problem is not that there\u2019s no answer, Wong and Stiglitz think, but that it\u2019s a badly phrased question. To pretend the battles are the same as they were in 1994 ignores the fact that the economic realities have changed, economic thinking has changed, the party has changed and \u2014 perhaps more than anything \u2014 the electorate has changed.Now, though, there\u2019s no excuse. \u201cBetween 1990 and 2015 we\u2019ve had the financial crisis, growth of inequality to unbounded levels, slow growth over all for a third of a century,\u201d Stiglitz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a third of a century as an experiment, and if you don\u2019t see the results of that experiment now, that\u2019s willful neglect.\u201dWong was a White House fellow in the Clinton administration in 1998 and had her own objections to the positions of that White House, though for her at the time it had more to do with a policy of race neutrality than with neoliberalism. (She helped write an 800-page book, in the voice of the president, about racial healing; it was spiked in part because it didn\u2019t hew to the administration\u2019s official line.) For Wong, too, this election has proved not that the disputes of the 1990s must be fought anew but that they have already been won, decisively and across the board. They have been won on the data, now that we have another two decades of it. And they have been won on the demographics, as the millennial generation \u2014 boisterously represented at Roosevelt by a large collegiate network and, in their office, by a young former U.C.L.A. activist named Joelle Gamble \u2014 has never known anything but market precarity.Since the 1970s, movement conservatism has consistently outperformed progressives in laying a talent conduit. Heritage identifies young candidates and grooms them for a smooth climb through the system; adjacent to its headquarters is a library-dorm for its interns, replete with piles of free Hayek. One of Roosevelt\u2019s youngest fellows, the legal scholar K. Sabeel Rahman, likes to point out that Department of Justice regulators, drawn from conservative legal and economic circles and influenced by the ideas of Robert Bork, essentially rewrote the federal guidelines for mergers and acquisitions and thereby weakened the government\u2019s power to make antitrust cases.Roosevelt\u2019s project, likewise, is about finding people with the economic, legal and regulatory experience to change the country\u2019s balance of power. Wong and her staff have been clear that what they are compiling is nothing so simple as a list. It is, rather, a process by which qualified candidates from all 50 states might be matched to possible jobs. This goes for top positions, like cabinet secretaries or the heads of agencies, but also down to the deputy under secretaries and staff members, whom they could introduce to the system. The people who hold these jobs now are probably lucky if their own relatives know their titles, but theirs are positions with real leverage, especially collectively: the Treasury\u2019s Domestic Finance Department\u2019s chief homeownership preservation officer; HUD\u2019s Office of Housing\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for risk management and regulatory affairs; the Department of Justice\u2019s deputy assistant attorney general for economics. It\u2019s important to look at these jobs in aggregate because centers of power in Washington are not fixed: A position, like the chief of staff of the O.M.B., that is relatively weak when filled by one candidate might, occupied by someone else, represent a key node.The team had a few different sources for leads: securities and banking regulators at the state and local levels; the offices of the state attorneys general, especially assistants in the departments of consumer protection, education and welfare; academics in law, economics and business; and other think tanks and policy institutes. \u201cWhere,\u201d they would ask a local banking regulator or assistant city manager in Seattle or San Antonio or St. Paul, \u201cdo you think you\u2019d want to be in five or 10 years?\u201d The ideal candidates have experience taking (or advocating for) regulatory action, and would thus know how to use the varied, extensive antitrust powers that individual agencies like the D.O.J. and the Federal Trade Commission already possess. Many of the prescriptions advanced by \u201cRewriting the Rules\u201d would require a congressional majority to make them real; the appointments project, by contrast, would help circumvent the congressional standstill on many issues where authority already resides in the executive branch.Wong thinks it\u2019s no longer accurate to even think of these issues in terms of left versus right. Instead, she holds, real political realignment means a long-term cultural change in the perception of government and its relationship to consolidated power. Wong has been resolute in refusing to draw a bright line, as some progressives would, to rule out bankers, in part because banks are only one element in the pattern. If most people have a hard time understanding or worrying about the concept of \u201cfinancialization,\u201d they have a much easier time recognizing \u2014 as Elizabeth Warren put it in a speech at the New America Foundation last month \u2014 that four airlines control 80 percent of American airline seats, three chains own 99 percent of drugstores and four companies sell 85 percent of the beef.The next day, I went to see Wong in her office. She did not want to seem na\u00efve, but she was optimistic. \u201cAll of my optimism now is based on all of the evidence \u2014 on all the polling, on all the people, on what the candidate herself has said. Hillary laid down a marker on Wall Street with her Roosevelt Island speech last year. We thought at the time, She\u2019ll move away from this, and she did. But it was there for her to go back to. And I think that\u2019s been vindicated in the last 48 hours.\u201dWong and I walked out into the blinding late-spring sun, and she put on her mirrored aviators. The famously infirm Citigroup Center, which had been built on feeble stilts reinforced in secret under cover of night, was reflected in them. \u201cMy optimism wasn\u2019t dumb. It wasn\u2019t just based on the academic views on the trickle-down experiment. Yesterday\u2019s speech was a great indicator. She hit every marker. I could go through every policy in that speech and tell you which constituency it was written for.\u201d After running down into the subway, Wong \u2014 who can\u2019t write a one-paragraph email without somehow mentioning eight books and 27 people \u2014 promptly emailed me an entire roster of the Clinton intimates who favored real reform, including Heather Boushey of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth; Maya Harris, one of Clinton\u2019s senior policy advisers; and Gary Gensler, the campaign\u2019s chief financial officer.Not all of Wong\u2019s allies take as rosy an outlook as she does. David Rolf, president of S.E.I.U. 775 told me, \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic enough to think that we\u2019re out of those woods yet. The Democratic Party, its leaders and its infrastructure, is very much of two minds about economics. The progressives have gained a lot of ground, but to think that the trickle-down elements of the party are gone?\u201d At Roosevelt\u2019s board meeting a few weeks ago, the Center for Popular Democracy\u2019s Marbre Stahly-Butts, an architect of the Black Lives Matter policy platform, worried that the evolving platform of the Democratic convention seemed \u2014 on matters of mass incarceration and policing in particular \u2014 to be anemically centrist.To Wong, though, much of the hand-wringing about Clinton is beside the point. People like to kibitz on the subject of who a politician \u201creally\u201d is, to claim that some votes or statements or gaffes or alliances are deeply revealing and others merely accidents, frivolities or improvisatory performances. We isolate and label a politician\u2019s essence in the hope we might predict with certainty how she\u2019ll behave in the future. But in Wong\u2019s view, the question of who a politician is \u2014 and above all who this particular presidential candidate is \u2014 is irrelevant. Her strategy is to proceed in public as if the candidate is certain to rise to the occasion.A few days after the speech, Wong wrote me an email at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, her favorite time to think. \u201cFor the 40 years that she has been in the public eye,\u201d she wrote, \u201cHillary Clinton has been the subject of constant political analysis, armchair psychoanalysis, horrible rumor verging on slander \u2014 and also adoration, especially from a number of women around her age who want to see her not just as a role model but a heroine.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe good news for those of us arguing strenuously for the wisdom of structural economic and political reform: Whether Hillary \u2018really believes in the cause\u2019 or not does not matter. This surfeit of attention leaves out a bunch of other politically relevant factors beyond what is \u2018true\u2019 about Hillary internally.\u201d\u201cAfter all,\u201d Wong said to me more than once, \u201cshe is unknowable. Nobody can know her. I certainly can\u2019t know her. All I can go by is what is on the public record, and who she\u2019s got around her. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be disappointed again. Over the next few months, we\u2019ll all be disappointed again. But I\u2019m only optimistic because there\u2019s evidence for me to be that way.\u201dAn article on July 24 about the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in Manhattan, misidentified the union chapter of which David Rolf is president.

{"Headline": "Nigeria Finds a National Crisis in Every Direction It Turns", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byOn their own, any one of these would be a national emergency. But here in Nigeria, they are all happening at the same time, tearing at the country from almost every angle.\u201cNigeria is the only country we have,\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari implored in a recent speech. \u201cWe have to stay here and salvage it together.\u201dDespite their name, which sounds as if it might be out of a comic book, the militants have roamed the waters of the south for six months, blowing up crude oil and gas pipelines and shattering years of relative peace in the region.Partly because of the Avengers and their sabotage, Nigeria has fallen behind Angola as Africa\u2019s top oil producer.Mr. Buhari then reconfigured those efforts after complaints that marauding soldiers had roughed up people and property while looking for militants in the south, creating even more resentment among the impoverished people who live there.Militants have struck in the south in the past, kidnapping or killing oil workers and police officers to demand a greater share of the nation\u2019s oil wealth. But the Avengers seem bent on crippling Nigeria\u2019s economy while it is particularly fragile, striking at the core of Mr. Buhari\u2019s plans for the nation.On the main highway in the southern port city of Warri recently, a long row of fuel tankers sat on the side of the road, idle. A bent-back windshield wiper served as a makeshift clothesline. A mini tube of toothpaste rested on the dashboard of one truck. The truckers were stranded, waiting to fill up.They had been there a month.Mr. Buhari\u2019s government has said it is open to negotiating with the group. But it is already stretched thin.Another longtime battle is flaring in the middle of the country, between farmers and nomadic Fulani herdsmen looking for grazing pastures. Hundreds have been killed in battles as herdsmen roam into new territory to look for vegetation for their cattle. Officials have blamed climate change and the nation\u2019s rapidly growing population for the scarcity of pastureland.And with their demands for economic equality for the south, the Avengers have been trying to stoke the aspirations of separatists elsewhere in the nation.More than four decades ago, at least one million people were killed during the Nigerian civil war, when separatists led an uprising that created an independent republic of Biafra in the southeast. It lasted three years, until 1970.Now, a Biafran separatist movement is simmering again, with the police and protesters clashing regularly since October, when a prominent activist was arrested and jailed. Some have accused the Nigerian security forces of seeking out and killing protesters.The Avengers are fanning the separatist sentiments, invoking the Biafran movement and calling for a \u201cBrexit\u201d-style referendum to split the nation along several fault lines.Many people in the predominantly Christian south say they believe that Mr. Buhari, a Muslim from the north, is neglecting them for political or sectarian reasons, even though conditions were also grim under his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner.\u201cYou always say you fought for the unity of this country during the civil war,\u201d the Avengers taunted Mr. Buhari on their website. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the Niger Delta, how can you know what the people are facing.\u201dIn his recent speech, Mr. Buhari recalled the horrors of the civil war, when he served in the military fighting Biafrans. \u201cThe president has a vision of one united Nigeria and is prepared to do everything to keep it as one,\u201d he said.This spring, Mr. Buhari announced that he would personally introduce a $1 billion cleanup program of the oil-polluted Niger Delta area. It was to be Mr. Buhari\u2019s first visit to the region since taking office, but with the Avengers\u2019 movement raging, the president abruptly canceled his trip. Residents of Delta State felt slighted.\u201cYears have passed with neglect, deprivation, environmental deprivation, poverty, no electricity, no roads, no hospital, no schools, but we are living in the country of Nigeria,\u201d said Blessing Gbalibi, a fuel-truck driver raised in the creek communities. \u201cOver there in Abuja,\u201d he added, referring to the capital, \u201cthey are taking our resources.\u201dYet many Niger Delta residents like Mr. Gbalibi oppose the Avengers because their acts of sabotage have degraded the already-poor quality of life in the region. Spills from explosions have further polluted farmland and fishing holes. Mr. Gbalibi and his fuel truck were among those stuck on the side of the highway for a month because the Avengers had disrupted fuel distribution.About a decade ago, another band of militants, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, prowled the creeks, blowing up pipelines. The federal government reined it in by setting up an amnesty program that offers cash and job training, some of it overseas, for more than 30,000 militants and residents, according to Paul Boroh, a retired brigadier general and the special adviser to Mr. Buhari for the program.But oil revenue finances the program, and the fall in oil prices prompted the president to consider ending the amnesty program at the end of last year. Mr. Boroh said he had lobbied to keep the plan for now, but to phase it out over the next two years.The Avengers movement sprang up around the time the president was considering an end to the program, prompting many Niger Delta residents to wonder if the shadowy group is made of former militants hoping to keep up amnesty payments.The amnesty program is far from universally loved in the creeks. Many residents say payments are routinely siphoned by corrupt community leaders. Others say the job training they received was virtually useless. Oil companies prefer to hire foreigners, they complain, or they hire locals only on a short-term basis \u2014 and then nothing.The program sent Mike Gomero, a former militant, to learn the teachings of Mohandas K. Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a two-week session in South Africa. He is no longer blowing up pipelines. But he still does not have a job.\u201cThe amnesty program is not a solution,\u201d said Williams Welemu, a former member of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. \u201cIt\u2019s palliative.\u201dCommunities like Ugborodo, so deep in the winding creeks that it is at least two hours from the mainland by speedboat, are dotted with homes that are little more than tiny zinc huts on islands that are sinking into the sea. They are filled with unemployed residents trained as geologists, pipe fitters and marine engineers.One of them, Collins Bemigho, stood along a dirty swamp, orange flares from a giant Chevron terminal glowing in the distance behind him. He complained about a lack of indoor plumbing, of good health care or a secondary school, and then pointed to a thick pipe jutting from the water.\u201cIf I wanted to bust a pipeline, I could do that right here,\u201d Mr. Bemigho said. \u201cWe\u2019re not rewarded for being well behaved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "By Bulgaria\u2019s Beautiful Black Sea", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerWhen I first set foot onto the hot sand of a Bulgarian beach and laid eyes on the Black Sea, I thought to myself, \u201cThis has to be the ocean.\u201d I was wrong, of course, but I couldn\u2019t get over how vast it was, stretching seemingly forever toward the horizon.The Black Sea, which connects southeastern Europe to western Asia, covers more than 160,000 square miles, making it about the size of California. It\u2019s encircled by a half-dozen countries, including Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria.It\u2019s also the perfect place for the traveler looking for a great deal. I spent a few days traversing the Bulgarian Black Sea coast by car, enjoying the bright, sunny weather, stunning ocean views and elegant, ancient cities that gild its shoreline. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this corner of the world became the new \u201chot\u201d destination in Eastern Europe, with its abundance of inexpensive lodging, fantastic seafood and gorgeous (free) beaches.It\u2019s also worth noting that Sofia and Plovdiv, a city 90 miles east of the capital, are destinations of the low-budget carrier Ryanair. One-way flights from Sofia to London cost as little as $19 (I took advantage of a cheap Ryanair flight to London out of Bulgaria).It was also a stick shift \u2014 luckily, after a few hours my high school driver\u2019s ed class kicked in. It helped that the roads are good in Bulgaria and that the main highway, the A1, is a four-lane road with a passing lane on each side. When you\u2019re on a two-lane road, however, you should drive defensively: Bulgarian drivers are aggressive passers. Don\u2019t tempt fate, and take your time.Indeed, the area is steeped in history. I love the rich, deep sense of the past that pervades areas like Burgas and the nearby towns of Nessebar and Sozopol. Around the seventh century B.C., Greek colonizers moved into old Thracian settlements on the western Black Sea coast. The archaeological museum in Burgas contains some fascinating Bronze Age artifacts, including the oldest marble statue found in Bulgaria. (Admission to the museum is 5 lev, and it\u2019s only 10 lev for a combination ticket to visit all four museums in town.)While I found few English speakers in Bulgaria generally, a woman working at the museum spoke some, and kindly walked me around town to show me the locations of the other museums. Most signage in Burgas is in Bulgarian, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Many businesses, however, especially those that cater to tourists, offer translations.While the history in Burgas is impressive, I was even more taken by the quality and price of the food. I went to Sladko & Soleno, a small bakery on Aleksandrovska Street, and had a series of great sweets, cookies and breads. My favorite was probably the big, soft kashkavalka, a pliant loaf of bread covered in cheese. Another day, I stopped by a small doner kebab stand on Aleko Bogoridi Boulevard and picked up a big flatbread stuffed with grilled chicken, French fries and parsley-based slaw for 3 lev.Exploring the town by foot is satisfying, but Burgas is big, and more ground can be covered by bike. I rented a two-wheeler through its bike-share program, which required buying a small magnetic tap-card for 10 lev. As opposed to renting the bike for a flat day rate, you get 10 hours of bike usage with the card and tap in and out every time you take or return a bike to one of the many kiosks around town, truly maximizing your lev.Exploring all of Nessebar\u2019s churches and museums would have taken all day, but I did check out several. My favorite was the peaceful St. Stephen church, a three-nave basilica that dates to the 11th century. (If you are looking to visit many of the churches in Nessebar, it\u2019s worth getting a seven-museum pass for 20 lev.) It\u2019s mostly just fun to walk the town\u2019s cobblestone streets, grab a freshly squeezed orange juice (I paid 4.20 lev for a large plastic cup) and maybe do a little shopping.There are plenty of places to get souvenirs, particularly leather goods. While I didn\u2019t make a purchase, I did peruse several shops: all-leather handbags were in the 150 to 200 lev range. If you\u2019re hungry, you can stop by Restaurant Old Nesebar, with tables overlooking the sea. The mussels are 16.50 lev, a substantial markup over Burgas, but it still won\u2019t break the bank.Afterward, we had dessert crepes next door at Happy Pancake Workshop, a ramshackle operation that was manned by three affable young actors from Sofia. Three crepes \u2014 plum and cinnamon, chocolate, and apple and rosemary \u2014 ran me about 9 lev.My beach excursion was impromptu, and I wasn\u2019t at all prepared, but I just went with it. I stripped down to my boxers, ditched my clothes in a secluded area near the sea wall and plunged in. The water was cool, and gloriously refreshing on my skin. I floated on my back, listened to the sounds of families picnicking, the lapping of the waves, a faint thump of music coming from somewhere down the beach, and wondered how I hadn\u2019t made it to this part of the world earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hotels vs. Airbnb: Let the Battle Begin", "Date": "2016-07-20", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayEver since Airbnb entered the lodging scene in 2008, the hotel industry has cast a wary eye, noting its popularity with young travelers. Despite a strong year for hotels \u2014 occupancy and rates broke records in 2015, according to the data firm STR \u2014 anxiety may be creeping into those corporate suites.Airbnb, the largest home sharing network with over two million listings worldwide, is newly targeting business travelers, the bread-and-butter clientele of hotels.Phocuswright, the travel research firm, noted that one in three leisure travelers in 2015 used private accommodations, up from one in 10 in 2011, and that 31 percent of travelers who used Airbnb in the last two years had used it for business.\u201cThis is a more challenging event in the history of the lodging industry than almost any other,\u201d said Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor of the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University.\u201cThere are things that are happening at traditional lodging companies that are accelerating related to Airbnb, and that is less uniformity,\u201d Mr. Hanson said. \u201cTen years ago at a hotel in Honolulu and in New York, the art and decoration might be identical. We\u2019ve seen brands recognize guests want a more genuine experience and a place that\u2019s more reflective of local culture.\u201dHoteliers say they have noted changes in consumer preferences, resulting in new social-oriented brands, homier settings and more functional apps.Hotel companies have expanded their portfolios by adding brands that are designed to appeal to millennial travelers and those who want less service and more connectivity \u2014 both technologically and with shared space.Moxy\u2019s rooms (from $69) are compact, and entry is keyless, connected via a smartphone app. The lobby has a full-service bar, grab-and-go food, games and plenty of outlets for charging electronic devices.Managers empower employees to connect with guests on a more casual basis, offering local tips not unlike an Airbnb host.\u201cNowadays it\u2019s about more real interactions, which are less rehearsed or checklist-oriented but authentic,\u201d said Jonathan Frolich, the vice president of Hyatt Centric.If your next hotel feels more like home, perhaps you can thank home sharing.Elizabeth Lowrey, a principal and the director of interior architecture at Elkus Manfredi Architects, recently worked on the new Aloft and Verb hotels in Boston. \u201cPeople who choose Airbnb are seeking an intimate, non-manufactured experience. They want to be embedded in the fabric of a community, where they can feel the uniqueness of place,\u201d she wrote in an email.\u201cThis desire for authenticity is driving today\u2019s hospitality design \u2014 each hotel must tell a story; it must be a place of context, reflective of its neighborhood and community,\u201d Ms. Lowrey added.\u201cI think the younger generation doesn\u2019t want four people to pick their bags up at the curb and then they have to tip this person and that person,\u201d said Randall T. Cook, the chief executive and a founder of Roost. \u201cThey\u2019d rather be in a cool neighborhood with bigger rooms, bigger space, maybe with a kitchen that makes them feel like, hey, this is what it feels like to live in San Francisco or Chicago.\u201dAirbnb provides an engrossing online experience. Sure, you need to spend a lot of time looking for the right rooms, but its mapping and destination photos help sell the service. Similarly, some hotels have bolstered their own apps focused on connecting guests to the city.\u201cUsually our clientele are people who want to be left alone and they don\u2019t want a concierge on top of them asking them what they want to do,\u201d said Alena Sarduy, reservations manager at Soho Beach House, where 79 percent of guests have downloaded the app.If home sharing has made thrift a virtue, it has cleared fresh ground for budget brands. \u201cAirbnb has created a new opportunity for some of the better quality hostel operators that are halfway between Airbnb and a hotel to seize on a new style of hotel,\u201d said Mr. Hanson of N.Y.U.\u201cThat just can\u2019t happen when you rent a room in someone else\u2019s flat,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cNo matter how beautiful it might be, you\u2019re immediately isolating yourself.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the lodging industry misidentified a center affiliated with New York University. It is the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management \u2014 not the Preston Robert Tisch Center, which is connected to the university through the NYU Langone Medical Center.The Getaway column on July 24, about competition between hotels and AirBnBs, erroneously included one business among those that are local partners of Arlo Hotels, which is opening in New York this fall.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Stranded in Indiana, Brings Running-Mate Competition to Him", "Date": "2016-07-13", "News": "Supported byStranded in Indianapolis on Wednesday after an aircraft malfunction, Donald J. Trump did what any gifted showman with a national campaign to run would do: He brought the presidential circus to him.Mr. Trump, who is approaching a self-imposed deadline for selecting a running mate, met throughout the day with three finalists for the position \u2014 including two, Newt Gingrich and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, flown in solely for that purpose.In a scene more reminiscent of entertainment television than a standard presidential campaign, a crush of reporters monitored Mr. Trump\u2019s departure from Mr. Pence\u2019s home, and the comings and goings of vice-presidential prospects from Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel throughout the day.In some respects, the display resembled a late-season episode of a television dating show, in which various suitors meet the family of their prospective spouse, in a taxing final test of compatibility and commitment.At least one vice-presidential contender approached the moment with a degree of lightheartedness. Mr. Gingrich, when asked why he was in Indiana, acknowledged he was going to meet with Mr. Trump\u2019s children.\u201cSee the kids, go to the zoo,\u201d said Mr. Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. (Though he is an animal lover and is known to visit local zoos, Mr. Gingrich clarified he was kidding about visiting the Indianapolis Zoo.)In addition to the three candidates who met Wednesday with the Trump family, Mr. Trump also spoke by phone with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the leader of Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, who has also been vetted as a potential running mate.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Mr. Pence is seen as the lowest-risk option: a stolid if unspectacular choice, helpful for locking up conservative votes and perhaps boosting Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal across the Midwest.At the top levels of the Trump campaign, there was a high degree of optimism earlier in the week that Mr. Pence would connect on a personal level with Mr. Trump during a planned visit to Indiana, and thus dispense with his competition for the job. Republicans have even begun to prepare for Mr. Pence\u2019s potential withdrawal from his race for re-election.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Yet Mr. Trump has so far given no particular signal of public enthusiasm for Mr. Pence. At a joint rally in Indiana on Tuesday, Mr. Trump mused that Mr. Pence could end up as vice president, but added, \u201cWho the hell knows?\u201dJeff Cardwell, the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence appeared \u201cvery relaxed\u201d together at a private fund-raising event in the state on Tuesday night. While there, Mr. Pence talked up Indiana\u2019s economy, Mr. Cardwell said, and Mr. Trump said that many people outside the state had taken note of its economic performance.Even as Mr. Trump\u2019s political advisers have largely rallied around Mr. Pence, there remains considerable affection for Mr. Gingrich within the Trump family, particularly from Ivanka Trump and her husband, Mr. Kushner.Mr. Gingrich has been an aggressive advocate for Mr. Trump, and he drew an enthusiastic response at a campaign rally in Ohio last week.And Sheldon Adelson, the casino billionaire who is among the country\u2019s most prolific Republican political donors, is said to have communicated to Mr. Trump\u2019s camp that he would prefer Mr. Gingrich, according to two Republicans familiar with his views. Mr. Kushner has been Mr. Adelson\u2019s frequent point of contact with the campaign in recent weeks.Mr. Adelson, who spent millions of dollars supporting Mr. Gingrich\u2019s unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2012, has promised to give generously to groups supporting Mr. Trump, but does not appear to have cut any significant checks yet.Mr. Trump may be merely reviewing his list of options one last time before making up his mind. But to some Republicans who have observed him in recent days, Mr. Trump has also appeared genuinely uncertain of the best course forward, and perhaps even of his own preferences.In interviews and private meetings, Mr. Trump has named different qualities as paramount in his choice of a running mate. Throughout the Republican primaries, Mr. Trump expressed a strong preference for a vice president with knowledge of Capitol Hill. During a fund-raiser on Long Island last weekend, Mr. Trump said it would be essential for him to feel a relaxed personal connection with his running mate, and that the person would have to exhibit a superior knowledge of government.In an interview this week with The Wall Street Journal, he added another characteristic to the wish list: His running mate, Mr. Trump said, must be an \u201cattack dog.\u201d But in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday, he backtracked and said he was not looking for an attack dog.The frenzied nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential courtship underscores one of the recurring themes of his 2016 campaign: the presumptive nominee\u2019s surprising remoteness from most of the other major figures in the Republican Party.To the extent Mr. Trump places a premium on his personal relationship with a running mate, Mr. Christie or Mr. Gingrich may have a leg up, as he has been friends with both men over the years.Mr. Pence, the favorite of the Trump political team and national Republican Party officials, is a comparatively unfamiliar face. If he would seem to be the safe choice politically, it would constitute a rare foray for Mr. Trump \u2014 going outside his personal comfort zone to make, perhaps, his most important decision of the general election.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But if he became president, he would take quite a protective and nationalist policy towards every country.\u201d\u201cPersonally, I prefer the lesser of the two evils,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she becomes the U.S. president, we are familiar with her.\u201dFor Chinese policy makers, that familiarity may offer limited comfort.Although Mrs. Clinton is seen as having pushed for stronger Chinese-United States ties at the beginning of her tenure in 2009 as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state, and is credited in China with facilitating an annual dialogue between top Chinese and American officials, she also angered Beijing by pressing for \u201cthe pivot,\u201d Mr. Shi said. This rebalancing of United States power toward the Asia-Pacific region, in response to China\u2019s growing assertiveness, was seen as an effort to \u201ccontain\u201d a rising China, and it rankled some top officials.Then too, \u201cwhen she conducted U.S. foreign policy on China, Iran, Russia, during the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019\u201d in 2011, Mr. Shi said, \u201cher language and style of discourse were direct and much more blunt than Obama\u2019s on issues such as human rights and website control.\u201cThe impression she left in China is quite negative. She criticized the Chinese government\u2019s control over information freedom, said it was not compatible with international norms,\u201d he continued.\u201cChinese people liked her husband. Bill Clinton was a very nice guy. Obama is also a nice guy. No one says Hillary is a very nice lady.\u201dLin Lin does.\u201cI really admire her,\u201d said Ms. Lin, 36, an events manager in Beijing. \u201cHillary has many years of experience in politics as first lady, and in her personal career she dedicated herself to politics. I think she\u2019s very smart and a much better person than Trump.\u201cAs a female professional, I do want Hillary, because the difficulties she has met didn\u2019t stop her but made her strong. She\u2019s a heroine.\u201dYet it is not just a feminist issue, Ms. Lin said.\u201cMy friends, female and male, like Hillary because of her experience, not because she is a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she is a good leader. She should do what her country requires her to do. I totally understand.\u201dGuo Jianmei, a lawyer and feminist, was there that day.\u201cPeople crowded onto chairs to hear her,\u201d Ms. Guo said. \u201cShe had charisma, style, knowledge, strength.\u201dMs. Guo said that since 1995, she has met Mrs. Clinton six times, in China and in the United States.\u201cI feel there\u2019s something else special about her,\u201d Ms. Guo said. \u201cI feel like she has a really global view of development. Not just for women, but on overall issues, including the economy.\u201dThe conference on women\u2019s rights might have influenced Mrs. Clinton\u2019s views on China, Mr. Shi suggested, saying she was \u201cnot affectionate\u201d toward the Communist Party. It took place at the height of China\u2019s one-child policy, when many women were being forced to have abortions, among other abuses.\u201cOne thing is consistent,\u201d Mr. Shi said. \u201cShe has always been quite negative towards China\u2019s human rights situation. We don\u2019t know if it was the Beijing women\u2019s conference, maybe that had some effect.\u201dStill, he said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s election would offer some pluses for policy makers in China.In Chinese social media, comments on Mrs. Clinton often focus on her gender.\u201cHer femaleness makes her unpopular,\u201d Mr. Shi said, adding that her image on the internet in China is of \u201ca harsh lady.\u201dEven in the Paper, an online news site that caters to an educated, politically interested elite, readers\u2019 comments can be both sexist and ageist.With thumbs up and smiley faces, several commenters who speculated that the men were gay expressed their support.Ultimately, Mr. Shi held out hope that a Clinton presidency would not mean an upheaval in relations with China.\u201cIf Obama was 70 percent negative about China, she\u2019s 75 to 80 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too much more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Turks Prefer Even Flawed Democracy to Coup", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe worst democracy is better than the best coup,\u201d he said on Sunday.Turkey\u2019s politics are notoriously polarized, and its history of coups remains branded in the memories of its older generations. But the scarcity of popular support for the attempt to topple Mr. Erdogan over the weekend suggests a broad commitment among Turks to the processes of democracy, even if they do not always like the results.Here is a visual timeline of the country\u2019s violent and chaotic insurrection.But analysts say the military\u2019s independence has been curtailed in recent years through the sensational trials of top officers. And shifts have occurred in Turkish society as the economy has expanded, incomes have risen and many Turks have grown proud of living in a democracy in a region dominated by monarchs and strongmen.\u201cWe are not giving up on democracy,\u201d declared a computerized sign on a highway in Istanbul that usually provides traffic updates. Most of the army and security services stood by Mr. Erdogan during the coup attempt, and all of the parties in Parliament, including those that bitterly oppose Mr. Erdogan, condemned the uprising during a session on Saturday: a rare show of unity.For many in Istanbul and Ankara, where most of the fighting between those involved in the coup and the security services took place, Sunday was a day of loud pro-government rallies and funerals for the more than 260 people killed over the weekend, most of them civilians or members of government forces that opposed the coup.\u201cThere is no God but God!\u201d they chanted while carrying Mr. Sagman\u2019s coffin, draped in a red Turkish flag, and placing it in the back of a truck.While there were no demonstrations of popular support for the coup during the weekend, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters sprang into action to oppose it.\u201cYou cannot rule by force,\u201d Mr. Donen added. \u201cYou have to rule by the will of the people.\u201dFor Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters, the coup\u2019s failure was a relief that they believed would strengthen his mandate.\u201cWhen the F-16s were flying overhead, we thought it was all over,\u201d said Zerrin Kuday, 24, who runs a Turkish bagel cart in a conservative Istanbul neighborhood. Now, she wants Mr. Erdogan to harshly punish those who tried to topple him.Ms. Kuday acknowledged that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents had accused him of acting like a dictator, but she said his tenure had been positive for her. The economy has grown, government services have improved, and public space has been expanded for religious women, like her, who wear Islamic head coverings.A coup could have reversed that progress, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of party,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of country, of homeland.\u201dIn some ways, Mr. Erdogan and his allies were lucky that the coup failed so quickly.Opposition to him and his policies remains strong in other parts of Turkish society. And while the leadership and organization of the uprising remained unclear, Turkey\u2019s justice minister said on Sunday that about 6,000 people had been detained on suspicion of involvement in the coup, suggesting a large plot.Had the coup\u2019s backers captured Mr. Erdogan or his prime minister, Binali Yildirim, and prolonged the uncertainty, other opposition elements might have mobilized.A minority of Turks interviewed on Sunday said they wished the coup had succeeded, arguing that military intervention was the only way to stop Mr. Erdogan from gaining more power.And reflecting Mr. Erdogan\u2019s reputation as a wily political operator, some said they suspected that he had engineered the coup to justify even tougher action against his opponents.At a small pub a short walk from Mr. Sagman\u2019s funeral, three gray-haired men sharing a Sunday afternoon beer listed the reasons they hated Mr. Erdogan: He is power-hungry, he uses religion to rally his supporters, and he is trying to bring Turkey closer to the Arab world and its conservatism.But they disagreed on the best way to oppose him.\u201cI really, personally, want him to be ousted,\u201d said Mustafa Kaya, a retired factory worker. \u201cIt would be a step back for democracy, but we can\u2019t improve without coups. That is our society.\u201dHis friend Halil Aydiner, a retired teacher, disagreed, saying Turkey was better off if the military remained in the barracks.\u201cNow we have the sword at our neck, but not the sharp edge,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is a coup, we\u2019ll face the sharp edge.\u201dSafak Timur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Should Let the Boeing Deal Proceed", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialBefore adjourning for the summer, lawmakers in Congress found time to pass several bills that could imperil one of the most significant global security achievements in many years: the year-old nuclear deal that President Obama struck with Iran.That encouraging track record, however, seemed to matter little when the House of Representatives voted to prevent the Boeing Company from selling 80 passenger planes and leasing 29 others to Iran Air, the national airline, at a cost of at least $20 billion.The deal could be one of the agreement\u2019s most significant economic outcomes. It would mark the largest American business transaction with Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution ended diplomatic relations between the two nations. It would also provide a much-needed political boost for Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, whose constituents are disillusioned that the deal\u2019s promised economic benefits have not so far materialized. Because of years of sanctions, Iran\u2019s commercial airline fleet is so decrepit and unsafe that many people fear flying on the planes.Republicans in Congress have argued that Iran has a long record as a state sponsor of terrorism and could use the new aircraft to support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria or Hezbollah militants in Lebanon or even reconfigure the planes for military purposes. It is also possible that Iran Air could provide some of the planes to Mahan Air, an airline that remains under sanctions.More broadly, officials believe, an Iran that now finds itself free of nuclear-related sanctions and able to engage more fully in the international economy will be reluctant to act in a way that will provoke a reimposition of sanctions. It can also be argued that once Iran obtains the planes, Mr. Rouhani and other more moderate elements will be in a stronger position to defend the deal and push back against hard-liners in Tehran who, like hard-liners in Washington, are working to make it fail.It\u2019s quite true that Iran\u2019s behavior on other fronts \u2014 its recent indictment of an Iranian-American businessman, Siamak Namazi, and ballistic missile tests are two examples \u2014 makes it hard for many Americans to believe that there could be a positive new future for the two countries. Nevertheless, the nuclear deal has proved its value by halting a dangerous and destabilizing nuclear program. The United States has a responsibility to make it work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Both Parties Used to Back Free Trade. Now They Bash It.", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats and Republicans agreed on almost nothing at their conventions this month, except this: free trade, just a decade ago the bedrock of the economic agendas of both parties, is now a political pariah.Donald J. Trump has made unraveling the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history, the centerpiece of his campaign, upending more than half a century of Republican orthodoxy.The fragile pro-trade coalition on Capitol Hill once led by Republicans is also unspooling, and congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would include 12 countries that together account for roughly 40 percent of the global economy, seems increasingly unlikely during the Obama presidency. Republican leaders in both chambers are not planning to bring it up this year.Opponents of multilateral trade agreements, convinced that they have unduly harmed American workers, have enjoyed a stunning success that may signal a long-term political and policy realignment in both parties.Republicans, proponents of free trade for decades, have found their base this year expanding to include anti-trade voters from poor and working-class areas who have joined forces, if not voting habits, with the Democrats\u2019 most liberal voters.\u201cThe primaries created seismic changes,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. \u201cIt will never be the same again. Neither Republicans nor Democrats will ever again be unabashed advocates for trade.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the trade pact is far more frontal. In addition to tearing up the deal, he has said he would slap a 45 percent tax on imports from China.In some ways, Mr. Trump is pulling Republicans back to their protectionist prewar roots. They were the party of the ultimately disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised tariffs on imports, a position that was later reversed.Democrats, with their deep ties to organized labor, have soured on trade deals in recent decades, especially in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed into law by the Clinton administration.They say the deals have cost manufacturing jobs and lowered wages, though global trade accounts for fewer lost jobs than automation and other technological advances. (The apparel and furniture sectors, which employed many of the workers now backing Mr. Trump, are exceptions.)The anti-trade talk \u201cresonates with people who have been on the short end of the stick,\u201d said Jeffrey J. Schott, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cThere are a wide range of reasons why this segment of the population has been left behind,\u201d he added. \u201cBoth the attacks on trade and on Mrs. Clinton are a surrogate for concerns about globalization.\u201dOther Republicans have since remained quiet, or also pulled back. Mr. Portman, who is in a tough re-election fight against Ted Strickland, the former Ohio governor, recently received the endorsement of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters.These are positions that worry the administration greatly. \u201cGlobalization is a force, and trade agreements are how we shape globalization,\u201d said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative who has been criticized on Capitol Hill all year from members of both parties. \u201cThere is a lot of rhetoric in the campaign that reflects real anger and concerns about changes in our economy, but the right prescription is not to get out of trade agreements.\u201dRepresentative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said \u201cthe White House is making progress, but it needs to pick up the pace and pick it up significantly.\u201dHe added, \u201cCongress has the final say on whether trade is good for our country and workers, and there are outstanding issues that have eroded that support.\u201dMr. Sanders and Mr. Trump have relentlessly bashed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and multilateral trade deals throughout the campaign, pushing Mrs. Clinton toward Mr. Sanders\u2019s position and leaving Republicans largely scared into silence, or equivocating.\u201cIt\u2019s been a one-sided conversation in this race, which is unfortunate,\u201d said Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is a rare member of his party in the House who supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cThe current rhetoric about trade is in members\u2019 minds,\u201d Mr. Froman said, \u201cbut we are working hard to push back against misinformation that is out there.\u201dThe White House is trying to allay concerns in Congress about when and how member countries will change their laws to adjust to the agreement and how the data of financial companies will be treated.A fight over how intellectual property protections are managed for the biopharmaceutical industry has been sticky, and the topic has been the subject of discussions between the administration and Republicans in Congress.Still, there is deep resistance to voting on the trade measure. \u201cThe chances are pretty slim that we\u2019d be looking at that this year,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. House leaders are equally indifferent.Mrs. Clinton has expressed strong reservations to aspects of the deal, and it is not clear what she would do to move a trade pact forward as president. Even less is known about what Mr. Trump\u2019s approach might be, other than his assertions that his deal-making prowess would achieve accords that are better for workers.Even so, the long-term impacts on both parties seem inevitable.\u201cWe are not going back to business as usual,\u201d Mr. Schott said. \u201cIf Mrs. Clinton wins, I think there are feasible ways for her to fix what is broken and make it better. If Mr. Trump wins, he wants to just break the china, and once he does that, you won\u2019t be able to put the pieces together again.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Clinton administration\u2019s role in the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was not negotiated by the Clinton administration, it was signed into law by the Clinton administration. It was negotiated by the first George Bush administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Is the Stock Market So High? Ask the Bond Market", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byStrategiesThe American stock market has reached new highs this summer for some unsettling reasons.This time, though, many of the factors that typically propel a rising market are absent: Corporate earnings aren\u2019t strong, the economy isn\u2019t booming, and stock prices aren\u2019t cheap.None of those fundamental indicators have been auspicious, but it hasn\u2019t mattered because the fuel that is making the stock market soar seems to be coming from outside the stock market entirely.In fact, it appears that we need to thank the bond and foreign exchange markets for providing the underpinnings for the stock rally.Bonds have risen sharply in value, and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. That has made stock prices look cheap and dividends generous. The average dividend for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is about 2.1 percent \u2014 much higher than the yield on a 10-year Treasury note. Many investors have moved to stocks in search of a better deal.That has helped make stocks rise, even though stock valuations aren\u2019t particularly appealing after seven years of price increases.That\u2019s part of the story. But there\u2019s more. Not all parts of the stock market are being affected in the same way. Another factor, the strong dollar, has made stock sectors that are fairly impervious to exchange-rate shifts especially attractive. When foreign earnings in, say, euros or pounds translate into fewer dollars, American stocks with predominantly domestic revenue streams usually benefit.That\u2019s why many American utility and phone company stocks \u2014 which both pay high dividends \u2014 have been soaring.\u201cThese stocks have hit a sweet spot,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, who focuses on telecom companies, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. As a group, telecom companies have far outpaced the market as a whole, even though Mr. Moffett is skeptical about the prospects for the sector\u2019s stocks. Many of them are overvalued, he says.\u201cAs an analyst, it\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter what the specific issues are for these companies as businesses. Their stocks at the moment are trading for other reasons: interest rates and the dollar.\u201d He has found a strong correlation between these factors and telecom stocks.\u201cAt the moment,\u201d he said, \u201cinterest rates and exchange rates outweigh the stock fundamentals.\u201dStock investors, therefore, may want to seek guidance from these markets, especially the bond market, which has moved into historically unusual territory.The 10-year Treasury note, for example, has had an average yield of more than 6 percent since 1965 but has fallen to less than 1.5 percent today, and that counts as a solid yield in the current global market. More than $13 trillion in government bonds around the world carry negative yields, a concept that is difficult to grasp. Buy a bond and you will lose money \u2014 unless yields drop even further into the negative zone, driving up bond prices.Market prices suggest that a rate increase won\u2019t occur before December, especially with a presidential election looming in November. But other central banks have been moving toward even more expansive monetary policies, adding luster to the dollar and hurting returns of American companies with major overseas revenue streams.Given those realities, investors hungry for better returns and higher yields have been flocking to the American stock market, especially to high-dividend-paying, low-foreign-revenue utility and telecom stocks. Both sectors have risen more than 20 percent this year.The current interest rate and exchange rate alignment may well persist for a good while, but there are no guarantees. A recession, a surge in inflation, an unexpected rise in interest rates or a major political shock or natural disaster could wreak immediate damage. And interest rates and inflation have rarely remained at today\u2019s low levels for very long.Mr. Rosenberg therefore suggests that investors begin to hedge against these risks by diversifying with inflation-indexed bonds, gold and some reasonably priced stocks in sectors like railroads, automobiles, banking and construction.Mr. Moffett is certain that at some point, the usefulness of his kind of detailed stock analysis will be restored.\u201cMany of the valuations in the market don\u2019t make sense right now in isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk for investors is that if interest rates start to rise, stock prices could start to shift almost overnight. That may not happen soon, but eventually it will happen. And for a lot of people, that won\u2019t be a very pleasant moment.\u201dTwitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

On Twitter, French observers expressed a mixture of amusement and outrage.The work contract Mr. Benhamou signed with the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace was recently introduced as evidence in a French court as part of that case, and was obtained by Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9, which used it as the basis of its report.The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace confirmed the report, telling Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 that Mr. Benhamou started his days very early and that \u201che redoes the president\u2019s hair every morning and as much as needed, for each public statement.\u201dLilia Blaise and Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Villagers Pelt Premier With Eggs Over Missile Site", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s prime minister was pelted with eggs and water bottles by angry villagers on Friday as he paid a visit to the rural county chosen as the site of a planned United States missile defense system.The visit by Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn to Seongju, about 135 miles southeast of Seoul, the capital, was meant to defuse continuing opposition to the missile range. Instead, he was forced to retreat as thousands of residents who had gathered in front of Seongju\u2019s government headquarters shouted, \u201cGo away!\u201d according to television footage.Facing the crowd, Mr. Hwang said South Korea needed the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, to defend against North Korean missiles.Residents, many of them melon farmers, fear that the presence of the powerful radar system will threaten their health and their crops \u2014 fears that the government said were groundless. The government also promised economic aid to help assuage concerns that a new military base would undermine the local economy.None of these assurances appeased residents on Friday.Confronted with a barrage of eggs, water bottles and boos, Mr. Hwang was forced to duck behind shields and umbrellas raised by bodyguards and retreat into the government building. Some people threw salt, a practice that rural South Koreans believe helps dispel evil spirits.Later, protesters blocked a minibus carrying Mr. Hwang and his entourage when it tried to leave through a back gate. They also parked a large tractor in front of the minibus. Scuffles erupted during a standoff between the police and demonstrators that lasted for hours. No major injuries were reported.Some people also refused to send their children to school in protest.The rally came a day after President Park Geun-hye appealed for an end to an \u201cunnecessary debate\u201d over the planned deployment.Since Wednesday, activists have held small demonstrations in front of the Defense Ministry building in Seoul to protest or support the missile system.In a survey published on Friday by the polling company Gallup Korea, 50 percent of 1,004 respondents said they supported the deployment, while 32 percent said they opposed it.The American and South Korean militaries hope to install the Thaad battery in Seongju by late 2017.According to the poll, those who supported the deployment said it would help protect South Korea and American forces in the country from the North\u2019s ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. Those who opposed the plan said they doubted the effectiveness of Thaad as a defensive weapon or feared that it would only deepen the country\u2019s dependence on the American military and raise tensions with neighboring countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Hillary Should Fear Optimism", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionIf the last two weeks of our political life have seemed extra long, it is because we have gone through not two but four political conventions.Cleveland had two conventions. One featured Republicans who have decided to voice support for Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy without echoing any of his distinctive themes. That\u2019s the convention where Chris Christie made the standard Republican case that the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has been too timid and too unsettling to our allies, where Paul Ryan spoke once again about his party\u2019s commitment to limited government and where the typical speaker praised Mr. Trump as though he were a normal Republican nominee.The second convention in Cleveland featured Mr. Trump himself. Unlike the speakers at that first convention, he promised to spend money on infrastructure, shred trade agreements, cut back on immigration and get our allies to pay more for defense.The Democrats put on two shows in Philadelphia as well. Half of the convention was devoted to keeping Bernie Sanders\u2019s voters inside the tent. Some of these voters are hard to please. (\u201cThey\u2019re both center-right candidates,\u201d I overheard one protester saying outside the convention hall, and others held signs denouncing \u201cClintrump.\u201d) Senator Elizabeth Warren, former President Bill Clinton and Senator Sanders himself were among the politicians deployed to protect Hillary Clinton\u2019s left flank. Their message was neatly summarized by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio: \u201cShe\u2019s a progressive who gets things done.\u201dWhen the convention focused on party unification, it dwelt on abortion, immigration and gun control \u2014 in each case without a great deal of nuance to appeal to those who are moderate or conservative on these questions. But the later in the night and the later in the week it got, the more the convention shifted toward the bigger task of courting a broader audience.This was the convention of generals, of invocations of Ronald Reagan, of chants of \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d The old liberal fear of lapsing into jingoism appeared to have disappeared. Substitute country musicians for pop stars, and you would have thought you were at a Republican convention of old. The parties had in several respects traded places. Mr. Trump, more than Mrs. Clinton, portrayed American workers as victims of a rigged system. The Democrats, more than the Republicans, talked about faith, American history and national unity. Mrs. Clinton warned that besides Trump and Clinton, e pluribus unum is on the ballot.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., President Obama and the nominee herself all welcomed conservatives and moderates with misgivings about Mr. Trump to find a new home in the Democratic Party \u2014 or at least, as Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, urged, to stay long enough to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Michelle Obama\u2019s fine speech implicitly made the same argument.That argument was, inevitably, characterological rather than ideological. \u201cHe loses his cool at the slightest provocation,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Trump in what deserves to be the most quoted passage of her speech. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d Democrats characterized previous Republican nominees as too right-wing; not this time.Both parties had split personalities at their conventions because neither party has been enthusiastic about its candidate, to an unusual degree. That lack of enthusiasm manifested in different ways in each city. Republicans gamely ignored a party division they fervently hope is temporary. Democrats tried to portray Mrs. Clinton simultaneously as a true progressive and a nonpartisan unifier.Because each nominee has intraparty opponents, each nominee sees a chance to court the people who lost the other side\u2019s primary. While accepting the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump said that he would attract Sanders voters because of their shared opposition to decades of American trade policy. Democrats, whose politicians are more unified than the Republicans, pursued a more systematic strategy of peeling off anti-Trump Republicans.Part of what makes Mr. Trump\u2019s conquest of the Republican Party so impressive is that it came at the expense of several of its factions. But that also means that voters in several parts of the usual Republican coalition might be tempted to defect this year, or at least to sit this election out.Economic conservatives are unhappy about Mr. Trump\u2019s indifference to shrinking the size of the government and alarmed by his offhand reference to withdrawing from the World Trade Organization. Jennifer Pierotti Lim, a founder of Republican Women for Hillary who spoke on the last night in Philadelphia, works for the United States Chamber of Commerce.Many Republican foreign-policy intellectuals have come out against Mr. Trump, too, appalled by his stance on NATO, his friendliness to Vladimir V. Putin, his willingness to alienate Muslim allies and his ignorance of the world. Mr. Trump has worked hardest at cultivating his relationships with religious conservatives, and he has been fairly successful. Yet many of them still don\u2019t trust him to expend political capital for their causes, which do not engage him. He said nothing about abortion in his acceptance speech, breaking decades of precedent.As much as the Democrats of Philadelphia invited Republicans to join them, though, they did little to make themselves attractive to them. The Democrats insist on hurtling to the left on issue after issue.At the Democratic convention four years ago in Charlotte, N.C., Bill Clinton spoke about the federal government\u2019s long-term debt problem. That candor was absent in Philadelphia, where speakers, including Hillary Clinton, talked about expanding Social Security instead of fixing the shortfall it is already projected to have.Some middle-of-the-road voters who find Mr. Trump alarming nonetheless share some of his stated concerns about crime, the Islamic State and immigration. Democrats did little to reassure them that they shared those concerns. They ignored the preliminary evidence that the violent crime rate, while still well below its peak rates, has started to increase again. Mrs. Clinton affirmed our existing strategy against the Islamic State, but her remarks stood out at the convention, where the topic was rarely mentioned, especially by progressive favorites. The Democrats also made it clear that they viewed illegal immigration almost exclusively through the eyes of illegal immigrants themselves: If it has costs, or enforcement of the laws against it has benefits, they weren\u2019t mentioned. You don\u2019t have to think it wise to \u201cdeport them all\u201d to find this treatment of the issue cavalier.Mrs. Clinton said that she loved talking about her plans for public policy. But she did less of it than Democrats usually do, perhaps because the convention\u2019s dual political imperatives \u2014 reassuring both the left end of the party and the general public \u2014 made it impossible to make a coherent case for an agenda. One might have expected the Democrats to use center-left policies to attract white working-class voters who are unhappy with their lot and considering Mr. Trump. They didn\u2019t make this pitch very prominently, except for when Bill Clinton promised vaguely to take coal miners on a ride to the economy of the future. Making college free for the middle class was a repeated applause line in Philadelphia: \u201cBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!\u201d said Mrs. Clinton. But not all people are going to get a college degree. They got two sentences from her, and less from her allies.Instead of reasons for hope, the Democrats offered these voters bromides about optimism: America\u2019s best days are always ahead of it, etc., etc. These bromides came with a liberal spin, the genius of America being defined as its closer and closer approximation of egalitarian ideals. The idea that American patriotism consists of loyalty to a future country clearly speaks to many of our citizens. Will it be enough in an anxious era, when Americans are deeply dissatisfied with their politicians? And when Mr. Trump is offering a more pointed explanation of that dissatisfaction than the Democrats are?The Democrats\u2019 optimism about the country is tightly related to their optimism about their own political fortunes, which is based on demography. They represent growing demographic groups \u2014 including nonwhites and the unchurched \u2014 rather than shrinking groups like the white working class. But that optimism is unlikely to prove contagious among that group.And the Democrats\u2019 rhetorical optimism is vulnerable to events in a way Mr. Trump\u2019s is not. Terrorist attacks and high-profile crimes may not make Americans find new virtues in Mr. Trump, but they will validate his campaign message and make the Democrats\u2019 look na\u00efve or worse. Mrs. Clinton said in her speech: \u201cThere is no other Donald Trump. This is it.\u201d That\u2019s right: We know his campaign will focus on her alleged incompetence and crookedness. What we don\u2019t know is how well she will be able to adapt to Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual pursuit of the presidency.The fall campaign will feature two candidates whose parties have little faith in them and who in turn are to varying degrees uncomfortable with their parties\u2019 platforms. A more detailed discussion of the policy choices facing the country will have to wait for another presidential campaign, with more serious candidates than Mr. Trump and stronger candidates than either him or Mrs. Clinton.\u201cWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love,\u201d Broadway stars sang at the convention. The Hillary Clinton Democrats showcased an impressively broad coalition, stretching from those who have won military honors to those who have won Tony awards. But what the world doesn\u2019t need now \u2014 what won\u2019t prove sufficient to stave off Donald Trump \u2014 is a forced optimism.Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at National Review, a columnist for Bloomberg View and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shave Ice, Hawaii\u2019s Can\u2019t-Miss Treat (Just Ask the President)", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported by12 PhotosKAILUA, Hawaii \u2014 Only an academic could take the joy out of a cup of ice flakes soaked in fruit syrup.Her quest started with a simple desire to better understand the history of her home state. But as she sifted through old trade agreements between the United States and what was then the independent territory of Hawaii, she noticed reference after reference to ice.\u201cI couldn\u2019t quite imagine what would have compelled the U.S. to protect a commodity like ice,\u201d Ms. Hobart said. Her dissertation showed that ice was an essential element in the colonization of Hawaii, signifying status and offering comfort to settlers who preferred chilled drinks and ice cream over the sour, tepid foods that had long sustained the native population.Shave ice is iconic enough that images of President Obama eating the dessert regularly show up in news-media coverage during his winter vacations here.The shop also offers the Snowbama, a shave ice colored to look like a rainbow in a nod to the president\u2019s work on gay rights.Ms. Hobart spent her childhood frequenting Island Snow. It was more a matter of geography than quality.\u201cYou go to the shop as close as possible to where you go to the beach,\u201d she said.Ms. Hobart likes her shave ice straight up, without a scoop of ice cream buried under the dome of powdery ice, which some prefer. She also takes a pass on sweetened red azuki beans and the stream of sweetened condensed milk called a snowcap that people like drizzled over the top.Mr. Parker carries the brightly colored syrups old-timers and children demand, but he prefers the ones he makes himself from limes, lilikoi (passion fruit) and ginger, which a friend grows as a hobby.A good shave ice, Mr. Parker says, begins with a machine that has a sharp blade and a block of ice that has been tempered on the counter or in the refrigerator so it has a sheen from melting a bit.The goal is to create soft flakes that resemble fresh snow and can absorb generous pours of syrup. Pebbles of crushed ice, which make up the snow cones of countless American county fairs, are so hard that the syrup drains to the bottom of the cup.A skilled shaver must have the patience of a good barista, Mr. Parker says, catching the ice as it falls from the blade and gently packing the flakes into a dome firm enough to hold syrup, but still soft enough that it will yield easily to a spoon.\u201cYou got to convince it to stick together,\u201d he said.Although shave ice in high-end tourist haunts and a new wave of artisan stands has loftier prices, his large shave ice costs only $3. \u201cThis stuff is so cheap, I don\u2019t feel right charging more,\u201d he said.For her part, Ms. Hobart\u2019s academic work has left her in a conflicted relationship with shave ice.\u201cIf I look at it through one side of the prism, I see the tourist economy and militarization of Hawaii,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I look at another side, I\u2019m a kid in Hawaii walking from the beach to get my shave ice, which is this beautiful delicious thing.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mayor Fluent in Twitter Embodies a New Canadian Diversity", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileFor a Muslim man who broke ground when he was elected mayor of a major North American city in 2010, Mr. Nenshi has proved that very few Canadians have a problem with how His Worship actually worships. \u201cNobody cared,\u201d he said, recalling his first win, a success he repeated in 2013, with 74 percent of the vote.The son of ethnic South Asian immigrants from Tanzania and a professed public transit nerd, Mr. Nenshi has thrived in a city and country where personal attacks and cultural issues capture little of the political oxygen that has inflamed voters in the United States and Europe.The city\u2019s demographic shift is a microcosm of Canada\u2019s integration of immigrants, and Mr. Nenshi, who fasts during Ramadan and has led Calgary\u2019s gay pride parade, embodies the country\u2019s increasingly diverse population. Still, Mr. Nenshi is the first nonwhite mayor of Calgary and among the few in a nation that is 80 percent white, according to a 2011 government survey.Then there is Mr. Nenshi\u2019s fixation with purple. The color symbolizes his commitment to inclusive, nonideological government and dominates his professional wardrobe: lavender dress shirts, violet ties, purple shoelaces, loafers the color of grapes. A local rabbi gave him a purple skullcap, shipped from New York, inscribed with his name. In his office hallway, a framed illustration depicts the mayor as a caped superhero in purple spandex.Born in Toronto and raised in a Calgary neighborhood that was already a mix of cultures and languages, Mr. Nenshi grew up keenly aware of the need for civic participation. After obtaining a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Harvard, he worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company before returning to Calgary, where he eventually became a university professor, teaching nonprofit management and marketing.Mr. Nenshi\u2019s journey into government reads like a do-it-yourself guide to disrupting politics as usual. For years, he pursued his wonkish passions strictly from an academic distance, writing reports on how Canadian cities, including Calgary, could become more environmentally sustainable and economically competitive. A failed run for the City Council in 2004 confirmed his role as an outsider.But five years later, with elections for the Council and mayor looming in 2010, he began encouraging corporate chief executives, soccer moms and other Calgary residents to run. \u201cI struck out every time,\u201d he recalled.Then friends challenged him to run for mayor, an idea he initially rejected. \u201cI like research; I do the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the guy kissing the babies.\u201dBut the campaign proved a tempting chance for Mr. Nenshi to turn years of public policy recommendations into action. Along with a group of volunteers that encompassed Calgary\u2019s diverse population, the college professor created a grass-roots strategy aimed at harnessing social media\u2019s potential to engage the city\u2019s traditionally apathetic young and minority residents.More than 33 miles of bicycle paths have been installed across Calgary since 2011. Despite vocal opposition and a close City Council vote, Mr. Nenshi championed a downtown bike network pilot project that was built last year and is now favored by most residents.\u201cNenshi has always been the guy who can help people get motivated to bring about change,\u201d said James Boettcher, a Calgary gelato entrepreneur who pitched the idea of food trucks to the mayor in 2011.The mayor\u2019s popular personal style, which he says is perhaps too unscripted, comes with some risks. \u201cMy mouth still gets me into trouble once in a while,\u201d he said. Much of that public interaction occurs on Twitter, starting when he wakes up in the morning and continuing until lights out.\u201cNobody else has my password,\u201d he said, explaining his more than 47,000 Twitter messages as a vital means of addressing constituents\u2019 needs and improving municipal government. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know the answer sometimes, I Google it for them.\u201dMr. Nenshi is perhaps most famous beyond Calgary for his online \u201csmackdowns.\u201d These range from giving polite advice to a driver who demanded an end to parking tickets (\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe consider not breaking the law\u201d) to challenging personal insults. (\u201cYour casual racism can be fun, but you really need to stop before people actually notice.\u201d)Still, he is happy to inspire his critics to do more than just rant online, even if that means being voted out of office. As he told one Twitter user eager for his electoral defeat: \u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance in 2017! Better start organizing now, though.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Team Seeks a Balance: Celebrating Women Without Alienating Men", "Date": "2016-07-25", "News": "Supported byThe footage brought some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers to tears, but others asked a practical, and delicate, question: What might men be thinking?The result is what Democrats describe as a cautious mix, attaching the women\u2019s movement to issues like the economy and health care.Milestones in politics when women and minorities were first elected to federal, state and local government.There will be glossy videos and testimonials highlighting moments like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 1995 speech in Beijing, when she declared that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mother, Dorothy Rodham, who overcame a childhood of poverty and neglect, will be frequently mentioned. A video on Tuesday will underscore Mrs. Clinton\u2019s place in history, and her daughter, Chelsea, will introduce her on Thursday as a champion for women and girls.There will even be attention to women offscreen: The convention center will have lactation rooms set up by the Democratic Party.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell the story of Hillary Clinton and her public service without also telling an important part of the story of the modern women\u2019s movement,\u201d said Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and former aide to President Obama.But speakers will also try to make the most out of topics that are not specific to gender, like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s work on the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in the 1970s and her efforts as first lady to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program passed. Elected officials will frequently speak about the economy and national security.\u201cThis has been a long, drawn-out debate,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mrs. Clinton in 2008 and has been involved in discussions with her 2016 campaign about women\u2019s outreach.The debate inside the campaign about the focus on women during the convention was described by a person involved in the planning who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.The discussions date to the start of the campaign, when some advisers suggested she choose Seneca Falls, N.Y., the birthplace of the modern women\u2019s movement, to hold her kickoff rally. Others questioned whether she should visit the town at all. In the end, she started her campaign in New York City, and in April, her daughter organized a \u201cWomen for Hillary\u201d event in Seneca Falls in her mother\u2019s place.A campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, did not respond to questions on Sunday about the internal discussions, other than to say, \u201cIt will not be lost on anyone that she is a woman.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.In an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton said that when she accepts the nomination, \u201cI\u2019ll be thinking about all the women who came before, all the women who went to Seneca Falls and, for the first time in history, talked about women\u2019s equality and women\u2019s rights, the suffragists, the \u2014 the women who knocked their heads against all kinds of barriers and broke through in everything from, you know, space to politics.\u201cAnd I hope that it gives other women and girls the feeling that whatever their dreams might be, they can \u2014 they can achieve them in this country.\u201dThe convention speakers include an eclectic mix of prominent women, like the actresses Lena Dunham and Star Jones; activists like Sarah McBride, the first transgender woman to speak at a national convention; and Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood.The lineup is an implicit contrast to last week\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Other than the testimonial by Ivanka Trump, Donald J. Trump\u2019s daughter, about her father\u2019s support for women, Mr. Trump and the other speakers mostly focused on security and toughness.\u201cWith men, it\u2019s all chest-pounding about how great they are,\u201d said Susie Tompkins Buell, a friend of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s and a donor. Ms. Buell said that with a female nominee, she hoped the convention would be \u201ca love fest.\u201dStill, the Clinton campaign is aware that she is not running as strongly with men. A New York Times/CBS News poll this month showed her trailing Mr. Trump among men by 13 percentage points, while she leads among women by the same margin.And younger women who did not live through the eras of equal rights and women\u2019s liberation are not necessarily inspired by her history.\u201cShe drives me crazy with this woman thing,\u201d Misty Leach, 43, a high school teacher who voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary, said of Mrs. Clinton. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to be the first woman president\u2019 to me just feels like she\u2019s entitled.\u201dAfter the convention, Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, will focus on jobs and the economy during a three-day bus tour through the Rust Belt. They are scheduled to visit areas the Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012, places like Cambria County, Pa., which is 94 percent white and has a median household income of about $42,000.Some Democrats noted that in 2008 the convention did not spend much time on the fact that Barack Obama was the first African-American to accept a major party\u2019s nomination.\u201cThe historic nature of her candidacy will be self-evident every time she\u2019s on stage,\u201d said Ms. Dunn, the former Obama aide.An article on Monday about efforts by the Hillary Clinton campaign to celebrate women without alienating men misstated the year in which Mrs. Clinton gave a speech in Beijing declaring that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d It was 1995, not 1994.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Charisma, No Glamour: Michael Gove Makes His Case to Lead Britain", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byMr. Johnson, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign with Mr. Gove, has withdrawn his candidacy, making the home secretary, Theresa May, 59, the odds-on favorite. But Ms. May had quietly backed staying in the European Union, and Mr. Gove, the justice secretary, argued on Friday that he best represented the mood of the party and the country.Mr. Gove, 48, laid out his program in a long and slightly wandering speech in London, acknowledging that he possesses no glamour or charisma and that he \u201cdid almost everything not to be a candidate for the leadership of this party.\u201dHe said he was \u201cso very reluctant because I know my limitations.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever charisma is I don\u2019t have it, whatever glamour may be I don\u2019t think anyone could ever associate me with it.\u201dBut Mr. Gove, having betrayed Mr. Johnson, had to justify his decision. He listened to his heart, he said, and decided that running was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201dHe portrayed himself as a politician of conviction who broke with Prime Minister David Cameron, a friend, over a longstanding belief that Britain could not be truly sovereign inside the European Union, and with Mr. Johnson because \u201cI came to realize this week that, for all Boris\u2019s formidable talents, he was not the right person for the task.\u201dLike Ms. May, who spoke in a polished opening of her candidacy on Thursday, Mr. Gove said that he would not begin the formal process of leaving the European Union until next year and would not hold an early election.He also said that controlling immigration to Britain was a goal, which would almost surely prevent Britain from retaining access to the duty-free single market of the bloc. He promised to \u201cend free movement, introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration, and bring numbers down.\u201dMoney saved from leaving the European Union would be spent principally on the National Health Service, he said, pledging to spend 100 million pounds more a week, or about $133 million, by 2020.Mr. Gove argued that he was \u201cthe candidate for change,\u201d pointing to his experience as justice secretary and especially as education secretary, even though he became so unpopular in that post that Mr. Cameron moved him out of the job. That move was the source of great resentment from Mr. Gove and his wife, Sarah Vine, a journalist.Mr. Gove spoke of being an adopted child lucky to find loving parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, who instilled in him \u201ca belief in human potential.\u201d And Mr. Gove, through intelligence and hard work, rose to graduate from Oxford and join the nation\u2019s political elite.Only five Conservative members of Parliament were in the audience, and Mr. Gove will need more support than that to emerge as a plausible prime minister and a real competitor to Ms. May. She is considered a safe continuity candidate who is to the right of Mr. Cameron but slightly to the left of Mr. Gove.Ms. May is not a natural politician or a glad-hander, but she has concentrated on doing her work. She has been generally praised for her six years as home secretary, one of the country\u2019s most difficult jobs, in particular for standing up to the police unions and for pushing through antiterrorism legislation.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and a friend of Mr. Gove\u2019s, said in a speech of his own in Manchester on Friday that he would abandon his pledge to balance the budget by 2020, the end of this Parliament, because of the effect that the referendum would have on growth and the uncertainty surrounding it. \u201cWe will continue to be tough on the deficit, but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade,\u201d Mr. Osborne said.Few economists believed that Mr. Osborne would deliver a budget surplus so soon in any case, given the size of the deficit and the impolitic scale of the spending cuts or tax increases that would be required to achieve one.Mr. Carney said that he expected to order \u201csome monetary easing\u201d in the next few months to promote growth \u2014 in other words, a cut in interest rates.But the bank can only do so much. \u201cMonetary policy cannot immediately or fully offset the economic implications of a large, negative shock,\u201d he said.Had Mr. Cameron and the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign won the referendum, Mr. Osborne would have been seen as a potential successor for prime minister. Those hopes have evaporated, and there is speculation that he may support Mr. Gove. There are three other candidates: Stephen Crabb, a young lawmaker who is the work and pensions secretary; Liam Fox, a former defense secretary; and Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, a Leave campaigner who is fast picking up support.Advertisement"}

Music wafts from speakers, and the scent of sausages from S&M Sausage and Meat fills the air.As the day wears on, the scene will fill out, and coffee will give way to craft beer served from a bar fashioned out of a shipping container.For now, the Quartyard \u2014 conceived of and built by a Rad Lab, a student-led organization, and the community \u2014 is a beer garden, event space and dog park in the downtown East Village neighborhood of this city. Its projected transition from 25,000-square-foot vacant lot to urban park to housing is part of a larger plan to create an employment hub in the neighborhood\u2019s tech corridor.Planners want to expand on the existing identity of the neighborhood, defined by artists and artisans, and attract and retain a robust talent pool for the local innovation economy.Stacey Pennington, the master planner on the Makers Quarter project, described the vision for the neighborhood from a picnic table at Silo, an auto repair lot that has been turned into a community venue. It is currently a vacant lot that can be rented out for events, with 24 original murals by local artists.\u201cWe were not just going to jump into building buildings right away and just expect people to come and things magically come together,\u201d said Ms. Pennington, who founded the urban planning and design firm SLP Urban Planning. \u201cWe had this ongoing vision for how the neighborhood would develop and transform.\u201d\u201cFor several years we test ideas,\u201d Ms. Pennington said. \u201cThe ones that work shape the future. The ones that don\u2019t, we learn from.\u201dThe city government embraced the dynamic approach to planning. Todd Gloria, a member of City Council, joked, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a \u2018shipping container\u2019 portion of our development code\u201d to cover the repurposed containers that serve as seating for the beer garden at the Quartyard, designed by students at the nearby NewSchool of Architecture and Design.\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s grass-roots pressure saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want an empty lot,\u2019 combined with a business community concern to attract and retain high-quality employers. That says to City Hall: Get it done.\u201dIn the early stages, the team reached out to the community and planned public events in neighborhood spaces like Silo, the Quartyard, a community garden and a site at 1425 E Street, all of which have been or will be transformed and incorporated into the future Makers Quarter plan.\u201cWe clearly saw that there is an unmet demand for genuine connection in this urban neighborhood that we should embrace and promote,\u201d said Mr. Carlson, a senior vice president at CBRE.\u201cIt is a total shift from what is expected in my primary market space,\u201d said Sumner Lee, president of Fuse Integration. \u201cAs the colonels and captains come to my office, they say this place looks different.\u201dThe warehouse space has been built out but retains a raw quality, as well as most of the original murals commissioned for the Makers Quarter opening in 2013.\u201cWhen I bring people here, I get to tell the story of how design and creativity can have a positive impact,\u201d Mr. Lee said.Makers Quarter\u2019s location in the tech corridor of the East Village means it is ripe for employer-driven development. The East Village is east of the Gaslamp Quarter, a trendy entertainment district full of popular restaurants and boutique shopping, and south of Balboa Park, home to museums, theaters, the San Diego Zoo and hundreds of acres of open space.The East Village is downtown\u2019s largest neighborhood, with about 1.2 million square feet of office space, according to CBRE San Diego. Vacancy rates hover at about 4 percent, compared with about 15 percent for the rest of downtown.In the next phase of Makers Quarter\u2019s development, ground was broken in April for Broadstone Makers Quarter, a 265-unit mixed-use residential project on the former site of a Goodwill store. The community garden, in a lot around the corner from Moniker, has secured a new space in Makers Quarter to make way for 50,000 square feet of creative office space, which is scheduled to break ground this summer.And Quartyard\u2019s days are numbered. The Holland Partner Group, based in Vancouver, Wash., has submitted a design review for a 34-story, 427-unit residential tower on the city-owned parcel. Though the beer garden was always intended to be temporary, more than 2,800 have signed a petition to save or relocate it.Commercial tenants in the East Village cite the advantages of a changing neighborhood dotted with bars, restaurants and retail space, anchored by Petco Park, home of the Padres. The ballpark, about a mile from Makers Quarter, opened in 2004 and was part of a redevelopment plan for downtown.Underground Elephant, a technology company specializing in online customer service platforms, moved into an 83-year-old warehouse just blocks from the Quartyard three months ago that passers-by regularly mistake for a new restaurant.Jason Kulpa, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he had considered moving his 100-person operation to Brooklyn or San Francisco, but decided to remain in the area because of its quality of life and lower costs. The city\u2019s weather, easy beach access, public parks and dozens of craft breweries are also selling points to the millennial talent pool from which tech companies draw, he said.\u201cThis will be a tech center: Silicon Valley South,\u201d he said.Red Door Interactive, a marketing and advertising agency, has been in the East Village for 14 years and moved from an 11th-floor space to ground-floor Class A office space adjacent to Petco Park in 2013.\u201cI want our people to be inspired,\u201d said Red Door\u2019s chief executive, Reid Carr. \u201cWho knows who you\u2019re going to run into, what you\u2019re going to see, what new concept will inspire a new way of thinking. It\u2019s why we\u2019re down here and not up there anymore. It\u2019s amazing what a barrier an elevator is.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet page on July 27 about the Makers Quarter project in San Diego referred incorrectly to the genesis of Quartyard, a beer garden, event space and dog park in the downtown East Village neighborhood. It was designed and built by Rad Lab, a student-led organization, with help from the community; it was not designed by Stacey Pennington, who is the master designer for Makers Quarter.Advertisement"}

He calls today\u2019s Tea Party types \u201cpopulists,\u201d as if they were genuine populists like those in the 1890s. The Populist Party platform called for the nationalization of railroads, steamship lines and telephone and telegraph systems. The pseudo-populists, who include Donald Trump and Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party, attack the political rather than the economic elites.It\u2019s true that Farage criticized multinationals and big banks, but so did many na\u00efve Nazis in the Weimar Republic. They introduced a bill in 1930 to expropriate big banks and stock magnates. When Hitler heard this, he was furious and ordered them to withdraw their bill.

But a series can also have a long television tenure by taking backwoods stereotypes and turning them into a cudgel with which to pound maniacally on all manner of topical subjects. Yes, the squids are back.That last, by the way, is a compliment. If a \u201cSquidbillies\u201d segment isn\u2019t making your skin crawl, it\u2019s a failure.The show, which began in 2005, is about a family of anthropomorphic squid who live in the mountains of Georgia, interacting with the human and other populations there, and embodying every backwoods stereotype there is, including lack of education, fondness for motor sports and possible incest.The economy in their weird corner of Georgia, which centers on an outfit called Dan Halen Industries, is ever-changing, so, in the season premiere, it is no surprise to find the whole family working as test subjects at an \u201canimal research center.\u201d First it\u2019s cosmetics, but soon it\u2019s narcotics. And what those do to the squids, physically and intellectually, isn\u2019t pretty.\u201cWe can\u2019t make the maze any easier,\u201d a lab assistant says to the lead researcher as he watches the drugged-up Early flounder through a test. \u201cIf we take down the divider, it\u2019ll just be a room.\u201dThe deformations that take place in \u201cLipstick,\u201d though, are nothing compared with the ones in \u201cWing Nut,\u201d a splendidly appalling Season 3 episode that involved crossbreeding a chicken with Early\u2019s DNA to produce a fowl with 50 wings. The local sheriff, enjoying some of the resulting product at a barbecue joint, says, \u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t have this many tumors when I came in here.\u201dThat show, of course, involves a real family, the Robertsons, who live in Louisiana. Most of the men are heavily bearded and enjoy hunting and blowing things up, and they often describe their behavior as redneck, but they aren\u2019t rednecks at all. They\u2019re media-savvy manipulators who, in the early years, kept viewers of all demographics guessing as to whether the antics were real or staged. The effect was to use the backwoods stereotype to draw a vast audience into their family-friendly, Christian-based world, and for a time it made \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d one of the most watched shows on all of television.That juggernaut lost most of its steam in late 2013, when the patriarch, Phil Robertson, made some incendiary remarks about gay people, and since then, the show\u2019s viewership \u2014 almost 12 million before the debacle \u2014 has fallen precipitously. Wednesday\u2019s two-episode season premiere drew only about 1.3 million, according to TV by the Numbers, not that far ahead of a \u201cSquidbillies\u201d rerun.And the Robertsons have decidedly lost their subversive edge. In Wednesday\u2019s premiere, the central couple, Willie and Korie, were being given a 25th-anniversary party, though they realized midway through the episode that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 it was really only their 24th. In the show\u2019s early years, the family members might have sold the supposed misapprehension as genuine; at this point, though, no one is even trying to appear spontaneous, and the whole enterprise looks scripted.\u201cSquidbillies,\u201d in contrast, is still as caustic as ever.

Electricians installed security cameras on the redesigned plaza as carpenters put the finishing touches on a new cafe.Lex Horth, an amateur photographer from Gates Mills, an affluent village nearby, snapped photos and marveled at downtown\u2019s newest jewel. \u201cI haven\u2019t come down here in 25 or 30 years because it was so derelict,\u201d said Ms. Horth, 80, adding that she was blown away by \u201cwhat Cleveland has done.\u201dNow many of its homes are boarded up. The barber on Fleet Avenue has bullet fragments in his leg; rival gangs burst in last year and fired shots. Mr. Rajecki, missing teeth, cannot afford dentures. Mr. Smith calls the neighborhood \u201ca dive\u201d \u2014 \u201cyou don\u2019t even got a bowling alley anymore,\u201d he said \u2014 and Cleveland \u201ca broke city.\u201dAs Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump for president, and Democrats in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, the nation is in the thick of searing debates over terrorism, race and policing, gun violence and immigration. But the host cities, both in Rust Belt swing states, spotlight something Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton rarely discuss: the plight of urban America.Amid a widening gap between rich and poor, nothing screams income inequality louder than cities, including Cleveland and Philadelphia, case studies in renewal and gentrification, but also in crushing decline. And perhaps no Americans capture as well as those who live in and advocate for these cities the feeling that the nation\u2019s present cannot match its past.\u201cYou talk about third world countries? We\u2019re not that far behind here, with the circumstances that people have to live in,\u201d said Mr. Karakul, a former lawyer. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I don\u2019t see much coming out of any of the campaigns on what we can do for poverty.\u201dOnce symbols of American industrial might and prosperity, Cleveland and Philadelphia are among the poorest cities in the nation. In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the third-highest poverty rate (39.2 percent) among cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution.Like other World War II-era manufacturing hubs \u2014 Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Baltimore and even Boston and New York \u2014 Philadelphia and Cleveland hollowed out during the latter half of the 20th century, losing jobs and people.Today, both cities rely on \u201ceds and meds\u201d \u2014 educational and medical institutions \u2014 as engines for jobs and growth. But while Boston and New York had started to rebound in the 1990s, Philadelphia and especially Cleveland have had slower rebirths.In 1950, Philadelphia was the nation\u2019s third-largest city, with a population of nearly 2.1 million, and Cleveland was seventh, at about 915,000. By 2010, Philadelphia was down to about 1.5 million and Cleveland to fewer than 400,000.\u201cThe conventioneers will come here, and they won\u2019t get away from the stadium or the downtown \u2014 they\u2019ll think they are in a comeback city,\u201d said Ira Goldstein, who supervises research for Reinvestment Fund, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit investor in community development. But he said other neighborhoods \u201chave regressed over the last 10, 12 years.\u201dSitting on a park bench in Rittenhouse Square, Richard Kahr, a retired real estate developer from Manhattan, said Philadelphia had \u201cmassively changed\u201d since he arrived a decade ago. But he is troubled by \u201ctwo classes\u201d in the city, and the nation \u2014 \u201cthe people that like their life, and the people fighting for their life.\u201dMantua, a proud but downtrodden West Philadelphia neighborhood whose rich African-American history is chronicled in colorful murals, is where those two classes may one day meet.Mantua is part of a \u201cPromise Zone,\u201d an Obama administration initiative to help poor communities. Nearly two-thirds of Mantua households have incomes below $25,000; the typical home sells for between $10,000 and $15,000, Mr. Goldstein said. But Mantua also has a wealthy neighbor: Drexel University.Jimmy Allen, a retired teacher and 1960s street gang leader who functions as Mantua\u2019s de facto mayor, knows its ills: boarded-up houses, drug addiction, struggling schools. And he knows its strengths: leaders with deep community roots. But what Mr. Allen, 68, frets most over are its vacant lots.A former management consultant, Mr. Fry has worked hard to enlist neighborhood support; in 2014 Drexel opened a community center in a renovated mansion, with a computer lab and playground. Mr. Fry wants neighborhoods that surround Drexel to \u201cbecome stronger and better versions of themselves\u201d \u2014 a vision he says can coexist with his effort to \u201cposition Philadelphia as a place of enormous growth and development.\u201dMr. Allen is unconvinced. He worries that speculators will move in, destroying the neighborhood\u2019s character.\u201cDrexel has a law department; we can\u2019t afford a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how are you going fight the dragon? You can only duck and dodge, and hope you survive.\u201dThat tension over gentrification is the story of many old industrial cities; here in Cleveland it is playing out in Ohio City, where lively restaurants and boutiques are attracting hipsters and millennials. Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian vendors sell fruit and vegetables at the popular West Side Market there. \u201cI take master\u2019s degree in my country \u2014 now I sell fruit,\u201d said Chrestina Sedrak, a former psychology teacher who fled Cairo during the 2011 uprising.While Ms. Sedrak sees opportunity, Narrin Noud-Carberg, 52, who survived the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and arrived here in 1981, is less upbeat. The restaurants and shops are bringing in customers, but sales at her spice shop are flat; customers look but do not buy.Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself \u201cGuitar Man\u201d (\u201cI save Cleveland one song at a time\u201d), can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work.\u201cThis whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a nitty-gritty city, and not some posh resort,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said.Returning there one recent afternoon, he could not help but grow misty. The old neighborhood where he played on the railroad tracks \u2014 \u201cwe used to grease the tracks and watch the wheels spin like crazy\u201d \u2014 now resembles \u201cempty spaces between somebody\u2019s teeth.\u201dAbout 70,000 people lived in Slavic Village at its peak; the population is roughly 23,000 now. \u201cYou have a housing stock that\u2019s dysfunctional, a population that\u2019s migrated out and an economy that\u2019s flat,\u201d said Tony Brancatelli, a city councilman. \u201cThen you layer on the foreclosure crisis and it\u2019s the kiss of death.\u201dStill, there are bright spots. The local bank Third Federal Savings and Loan \u2014 whose owners, descendants of Polish immigrants, started the foundation Mr. Karakul runs \u2014 is helping to build and finance new homes that sell for as much as $130,000.On Fleet Avenue, a popcorn maker who sells his treats at the West Side Market is planning a new manufacturing plant. And on Broadway Avenue, in a long-shuttered butcher shop, a maker of cured meat and sausage is moving in.Mr. Brancatelli, who sees the foreclosure crisis and its fallout as the root of \u201csocial unrest,\u201d said the national conversation around \u201cold industrial cities\u201d like Cleveland had changed \u2014 for the worse.

{"Headline": "Escape His Caricature? Donald Trump Passes Up the Chance", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisCLEVELAND \u2014 It was Donald J. Trump\u2019s best chance to escape his own caricature.He did not.After 40 years in the public eye, Mr. Trump decided on Thursday night that he was not interested in revealing himself to America with disarming tales of his upbringing, hard-earned lessons from his tumultuous career or the inner struggles masked by his outward pomposity.To an electorate that remains anxious about his demeanor, his honesty and his character, Mr. Trump offered no acknowledgment, no rebuttal, no explanation.It was a speech that might be remembered, ultimately, as much for what it lacked as for what it contained \u2014 and for the message those absences seemed to convey: He is content with the angry voters he has won, who thunderously cheered him on here, and indifferent about wooing those he has not.For those grasping for new signs of humility, generosity and depth, Mr. Trump offered the thinnest of reeds.Inside the Quicken Loans Arena, a thicket of American flags behind him, he portrayed himself, over and over, as an almost messianic figure prepared to rescue the country from the ills of urban crime, illegal immigration and global terrorism.\u201cI alone,\u201d he said, \u201ccan fix it.\u201dBut Mr. Trump made no real case for his qualifications to lead the world\u2019s largest economy and strongest military. He is, he said, a very successful man who knows how to make it all better.Campaign speechwriters from both parties were stupefied.\u201cIt\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d said Matt Latimer, who wrote speeches for President George W. Bush. He said he had expected Mr. Trump to plumb his personal life and career for the kind of anecdotes that would turn him, in the eyes of his doubters, from a cartoon into a flesh-and-blood human being.How we analyzed the last night of the Republican National Convention, which featured Ivanka Trump, Peter Thiel, Donald J. Trump and more.\u201cA little humanity and self-reflection,\u201d Mr. Latimer said, \u201cis usually very powerful in a speech.\u201dAfter reading the speech, Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist and speechwriter, called the missing personal details \u201can enormous mistake.\u201d\u201cThe American people,\u201d he said, \u201cneed to know their president\u2019s mythic arc.\u201dBut Mr. Trump, even at 70, seems constitutionally incapable of, or stubbornly averse to, capturing and conveying the complexities of his existence.At every turn on Thursday night, he avoided turning a colorful and remarkable biography \u2014 populated by a volcanic father, a self-destructive brother, his own dizzying career highs and mortifying lows \u2014 into vivid, poignant storytelling.His childhood? He learned \u201cto respect the dignity of work,\u201d he said.His parents? His father liked the company of the carpenters and electricians he employed. His mother was a \u201cgreat judge of character.\u201d31 PhotosHis storied career? \u201cI have had a truly great life in business,\u201d he said. And that was that.His wife, Melania? \u201cLucky to have at my side,\u201d he said.The most powerful convention speeches have long relied on verbal Polaroids from the past, intimate glimpses into an unseen and unknowable personal journey.In 2012, Mitt Romney defied his reputation for stultifying oratory by extolling the romantic bond between his parents, recalling the rose his father, George, left on the pillow every morning for his wife, Lenore.\u201cThat\u2019s how she found out what happened on the day my father died,\u201d Mr. Romney recalled. \u201cShe went looking for him, because that morning, there was no rose.\u201dThe elder George Bush undertook an earnest examination of his best-known vulnerabilities, confronting his reputation for out-of-touch elitism and a lack of charisma and casting them as strengths.\u201cI am a quiet man,\u201d he said in 1988, \u201cbut I hear the quiet people others don\u2019t.\u201dRichard M. Nixon pleaded with voters who knew him as a bitter political outcast in 1968 to think of him instead as the boy who had grown up poor on a lemon ranch and dreamed \u201cof faraway places where he\u2019d like to go.\u201dMr. Trump, aides said, took inspiration from that famous Nixon speech. But he left out Nixon\u2019s uplifting message and sentimental tone, said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, including three Republicans.\u201cTrump puts forward the same iron fist as Nixon,\u201d Mr. Gergen said after the speech, \u201cbut Nixon clothed his in a velvet glove.\u201d\u201cTrump,\u201d he said, \u201cthrew away the glove.\u201dInstead, Mr. Trump projected unbending self-confidence, authority and strength. He lacerated his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, as thoroughly untrustworthy and unethical.He did not present an entirely unfeeling figure: He promised to give a voice to laid-off factory workers, \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country.\u201dAnd he offered compassion for the parents of people killed by undocumented immigrants \u2014 and outrage on their behalf.\u201cThese families have no special interests to represent them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.\u201d\u201cThese wounded American families have been alone,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they are alone no longer.\u201dHe had enlisted his children to make him three-dimensional, a task they carried out with just a handful of personal memories: of the encouraging notes he scribbled across their report cards, and of playing at the foot of his desk with Legos or Erector Sets while their father worked in concrete and steel.Of course, turning a polarizing candidate into a likable leader is not Mrs. Clinton\u2019s talent, either. For much of the past two years, she has emerged as an awkward and reluctant storyteller of her life, more comfortable with 10-point plans than with providing fresh glimpses into her formative years or candid accounts of her professional struggles.But Mrs. Clinton, whose convention next week will extensively mine her biography, has started to undertake the humbling repair work that many Republicans had hoped Mr. Trump would begin on Thursday.She has admitted some mistakes, conceded that many Americans do not trust her, and acknowledged her role in the partisan warfare that has alienated many voters.On Thursday night, Mr. Trump reveled in that warfare, made no concessions and admitted no mistakes.His America, he said, would be \u201cbigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\u201dJust like him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Think About Refinancing Your Mortgage (Again)", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsIt\u2019s a good time to check the rate on your home mortgage, because you might save money by refinancing. For that, American homeowners can thank British voters, central banks in Europe and Japan, and a global economy that just can\u2019t get out of first gear.There is even reason to think mortgage rates could fall further in the weeks ahead as banks start to pass more of the savings from low rates in the bond market through to customers \u2014 though would-be refinancers would have to be willing to bet that global markets won\u2019t reverse themselves in the interim. Bond yields rose Tuesday, which suggests that some reversal may have already begun.Using the rule of thumb that refinancing frequently makes sense when rates have fallen by a full percentage point, people who took out loans at the prevailing rate at various points in late 2013 and the first part of 2014 might see favorable economics for refinancing, as will those whose loan was first made anytime before mid-2010.People with narrower gaps between their interest rate and those that prevail now might also consider refinancing. That makes sense particularly if they expect to remain in their current home for many years, thus allowing time for even modest monthly savings to accumulate enough to justify the one-time expenses tied to refinancing a loan.Lower rates can make this a good time to refinance for people who want a different type of mortgage, like moving from a 30-year loan to a 15-year one to pay off the home faster.What no one can know is whether rates will pop back up or continue to drop. As much as mortgage rates have declined in 2016, and especially since Britain voted to leave the European Union on June 23, they actually haven\u2019t declined as much as the long-term interest rates that prevail on the global bond market.From the end of last year until Monday\u2019s close, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury bonds had fallen 0.84 percentage points, while the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was down only 0.41.Essentially, banks have been able to keep much of the savings of falling global rates for themselves \u2014 the gap between those numbers, reflecting strong demand for loans and limited competition.That gap between long-term rates on global markets and what banks charge their customers for a mortgage has spiked repeatedly in the last few years, as it has in the last month, but those spikes have inevitably been short-lived. Assuming the pattern holds, it would mean that mortgage rates will fall further in coming weeks, as competitive pressure takes hold and more banks pass along the low interest rates prevailing on the bond market to their customers.That said, there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen. Yes, there\u2019s reason to think that banks will lower the premium they are charging for mortgages. But with Treasury yields at record-low levels, the same technical forces that have driven rates downward in the last few months could reverse. That means that even small improvements in the global economic outlook could cause a rapid rise in rates.So if refinancing looks desirable now, you might save a little more on mortgage interest if you wait. But if you wait, your lucrative refinancing opportunity could evaporate. And if you have special powers to divine which direction rates are going next in this volatile year, every hedge fund manager on earth would pay handsomely if you would tell them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Trump and the G.O.P. Can Agree On: Tax Cuts for the Rich", "Date": "2016-07-10", "News": "Supported byLike Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republicans boast that most Americans will be able to file their taxes on a postcard.Like the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, they would eliminate deductions for interest payments for businesses and allow them to immediately write off all capital investments.Like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, they would no longer tax a company\u2019s foreign profits.But most significant, the blueprint, shepherded by Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, embraces a transformational shift promoted by both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, but not Mr. Trump: a move away from taxing income to a system that basically taxes consumption.Despite their conceptual differences, however, there is a crucial feature that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan and the House Republicans\u2019 plan share: The biggest tax cuts are reserved for the wealthiest.\u201cRelative to the current system, the plans are pulling in the same general direction, reducing taxation on capital gains and high-income households,\u201d said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H. W. Bush.Beyond sharply cutting income tax rates across the board, both Mr. Trump and the House Republicans would eliminate the estate tax (which currently applies to only about 5,300 of the richest families); end the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners\u2019 investment income, which helps pay for health coverage for lower-income Americans; and scrap the alternative minimum tax, which is aimed at making it harder for the affluent to take advantage of various tax breaks.But they reach those goals by different paths. While the Trump plan stays squarely within the traditional framework of an income tax, the Ryan plan takes a giant step toward taxing what people spend.Alan Viard, a tax expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a proponent of consumption taxes, explained the difference. The \u201cTrump plan has a bigger revenue loss and more harmful effects on the budget outlook,\u201d he said, while \u201cthe Ryan plan is more revolutionary from the standpoint of tax policy.\u201dThe best-known version of a consumption tax is the value added tax, or V.A.T., which functions like a national sales tax.Such taxes have long been popular among some economists, who argue that they encourage people to save for tomorrow, rather than spend today, and help foster more investment that leads to longer-term growth.But skeptics point out that unlike the rich, people on the lower end of the income ladder must spend most, if not all, of their earnings \u2014 on things like housing, food, cellphones, doctors, toothpaste, bus fare, jeans and haircuts \u2014 and have little left over to save. Taxing consumption means the burden inevitably falls more heavily on them.From this vantage point, a progressive income tax based on the ability to pay is the most practical way to ensure that the wealthy contribute their fair share to financing the government, particularly when wealth inequality has widened to the greatest levels since the Gilded Age.Supporters of a progressive income tax argue that it is fairer in another way because it taxes earnings from capital as well as labor (even if sometimes at a different rate). Workers who earn their money in the form of wages or salaries should not pay a larger share of their income, they say, than taxpayers who live off their investments and tend to be among the wealthiest Americans. Nearly 70 percent of capital gains benefits go to the top 1 percent.Those proponents also note that there is little evidence that lowering taxes on the wealthy leads to significantly stronger economic growth. There is no guarantee that the rich will not use their extra money to buy, say, a multimillion-dollar Picasso to hang in their living room or finance a company in China rather than plow the money into American businesses and their workers.Like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz, the House majority has tried \u2014 as the song advises \u2014 to accentuate the positives and eliminate the negatives, by mixing and matching elements of both approaches.Individuals would continue to pay taxes on their income at mildly progressive rates. Instead of imposing a regressive tax on consumers at the checkout counter, however, the government would collect that money after it was spent, from businesses.Businesses would then be allowed to deduct all their expenses and investments right away, rather than depreciating them over time. But it would mean an end to the deduction for interest paid on loans, which can often favor industries that depend heavily on debt financing \u2014 like real estate, Mr. Trump\u2019s own business.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of a consumption tax on the business side and an income tax,\u201d said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump have indicated a willingness to compromise on details, but as Mr. Ryan told C-Span, \u201cOn the critical aspects of this agenda, on the foundations of it and the basic principles, we are in agreement on these things.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign team did not respond to repeated requests for comment.With only sketchy details, predicting how either plan would affect the economy and the federal budget is difficult. Both Mr. Trump and House Republicans contend that explosive growth unleashed by their proposals would make up for revenue losses.And so while Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals strike a more populist note, claiming to eradicate sweetheart deals for the rich, in reality both Republican plans offer the wealthy even better breaks than they get now.Take, for example, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed elimination of what\u2019s known as the carried interest loophole, which has enabled private equity and hedge fund titans to save billions of dollars. They are allowed to classify what are essentially ordinary earnings \u2014 taxed at over 40 percent for the highest incomes \u2014 as investment profits, which are subject to a rate of 23.8 percent.But as Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center sees it, \u201cTrump is closing one carried interest loophole and opening another.\u201dMany of those money managers could end up paying less than they do now \u2014 just 15 percent \u2014 by simply reclassifying their earnings as income from pass-through businesses or partnerships.That loophole would also get bigger under the Ryan plan, because the tax rate on capital gains would be reduced.When it comes to companies parking their overseas profits outside the United States, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump seem to stake out conflicting positions. The Ryan plan eliminates taxes on foreign earnings altogether, and instead taxes businesses on the basis of where their goods and services were sold.By contrast, Mr. Trump has promised a crackdown, forcing multinationals to pay United States taxes every year.As it turns out, the get-tough approach would not necessarily matter much. Because Mr. Trump promises to cut the corporate rate and allow credits for foreign taxes paid, many multinationals could end up owing nothing.\u201cSuperficially, Trump is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the House Republicans\u201d on this issue, said Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut in practice, not that much.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTvideovideovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Irish-German-Chinese Perspective on \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byIt was fitting that the moment of clarity came at a border crossing.As I got in the immigration line at Beijing Capital International Airport, I glanced at the Irish passport in my hand and saw two familiar words, newly precious, in gold letters: \u201cEuropean Union\u201d in English, \u201cAn tAontas Eorpach\u201d in Irish.It was the day after news broke that Britain had voted to leave the European Union.Just two generations ago, two European families \u2014 one Anglo-Irish, one German-Swedish \u2014 were at war with each other, literally.As my father tells it, his father was the captain of a British Navy minesweeper in World War II, a job that required finding and blowing up mines laid by the navy of the Third Reich to disrupt shipments of war supplies from the United States to Britain. He survived.My other grandfather was part of Germany\u2019s industrial war effort, as the director of its biggest ball-bearings factory. His brother, my Onkel Egon, returned \u2014 alive \u2014 from the Battle of Stalingrad after driving a truck back to Germany with a small band of Wehrmacht survivors, one of them tied down, raving.When my sister, brother and I were children, Onkel Egon was a curiosity to us because his wife, Tante Erika, drove him everywhere. Later we found out he had refused to touch a steering wheel for the rest of his life.Add some French ancestry and there I was, a Pan-European like many others. As I looked at my passport in the line, I felt a surge of sadness that Britain might be leaving the \u201ccommunity of values\u201d \u2014 of tolerance, transparency and democracy \u2014 that German Chancellor Angela Merkel talks about.Born overseas and having lived most of my life in undemocratic or authoritarian societies, I see Europe as a place that contributes progressive social policies, excellent scholarship, the rule of law and, by and large, responsible political behavior to the world, qualities that people living in it perhaps don\u2019t value as much as people living outside it.As I made my way from Beijing to Munich to see my family, I talked with Europeans about \u201cBrexit.\u201d A flight attendant for a Swiss airline, an older German man returning from Portugal and a young German academic from Nuremberg expressed bewilderment. They said it was a pity.In Munich, my friends and relatives shared the surprise and disappointment. They were puzzled why so many in Britain would choose a harder path in life, outside the common market.If \u201cBrexit\u201d were to happen \u2014 several believed it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 they would miss Britain\u2019s quirky culture, its English-language presence in the bloc and its heft within the union as a (hitherto) rational ally for Germany in Brussels, they said.They hoped that Germany would not go the same route.Yet a taxi driver from the Steiermark (an Austrian state near Slovenia) who lives and works in Munich praised the vote, saying all European countries should do the same.Switzerland was the model for everyone, he said, complaining about \u201cforeigners\u201d who got the same rights as \u201cnatives.\u201d He wasn\u2019t referring to Syrians and others fleeing war or poverty who are arriving in Europe in large numbers \u2014 he meant people from other European nations.\u201cYou\u2019re Austrian,\u201d I said. \u201cAren\u2019t you a foreigner, too?\u201d He was silent.I asked why he disliked the European Union. \u201cThey have so many rules for everything,\u201d he said. An example? \u201cI can\u2019t think of any now,\u201d he admitted.In China, incomprehension has been a common reaction to the vote, as people mull why Britain would abandon such a deal and how a democracy might not deliver what is in a nation\u2019s best interests.If Britain leaves, Ireland and Malta will be the only two English-speaking nations in the bloc. Their numbers could swell a little, as some Britons with Irish ancestry apply for Irish passports, including students and parents at my son\u2019s British international school in Beijing.As I traveled back to China on Saturday, I looked at the passport in my hand and thought of my two grandfathers whose warring families became one peaceful one, and was glad for those gold letters spelling out \u201cEuropean Union.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fender Benders on Water? (See: Expanded Panama Canal)", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byIt is a section of Panama\u2019s newly expanded canal that has troubled veteran canal workers.To safely guide the new generation of massive ships through the two sets of locks, tugboat captains and ship pilots rely on an approach wall to properly align the vessels before escorting them into the first narrow chamber.The wall is an antidote to the currents and winds that push and pull ships into awkward angles, making tugboats wrestle the elements before achieving the proper position.Another container ship had experienced tense moments three weeks earlier as crew members responded to \u201ccountless\u201d instructions from a canal employee who was attempting to guide it into the same set of locks.Ultimately, that transit was successful. But the Xin Fei Zhou\u2019s mishap was not the canal\u2019s only setback. Other vessels have sheared or badly damaged up to 100 buffering fenders that are supposed to protect the lock walls and ship hulls should they come into contact, according to interviews with canal workers.Canal workers had expressed concern about whether the plastic fenders on the lock walls would be adequate and whether tugboat captains had received the proper training in how to guide the giant ships through the chambers \u2014 a procedure that differed from the one used in the original canal.On July 22, in response to complaints, the canal\u2019s administrator, Jorge Quijano, said the expanded canal was safe and was providing high-quality service. To back that up, he pointed to the 224 ships that had reserved future transit slots, in addition to the dozens that had already gone through.Canal officials called the Xin Fei Zhou\u2019s incident \u201cminor,\u201d saying it did not significantly damage the vessel, disrupt canal traffic or injure anyone. No official investigation occurred, Mr. Quijano said, \u201cbecause the shipowners/agent informed that they would not attend the investigation meeting.\u201dMr. Quijano also defended the utility of the canal\u2019s buffering system, insisting that the fenders are sturdy and effective. \u201cTo imply that fenders are falling off as a sign of something wrong or that something is not functioning appropriately is inaccurate,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBecause of its intended use, fenders will get damaged and sometimes do fall off the walls and subsequently are replaced.\u201dIf the fenders prove inadequate, he added, changes will be made. \u201cWe believe in continuous improvements.\u201dAllianz believes that the tugs will be sufficient, but identified training as the key to mitigating the risks. \u201cThis will be a challenge,\u201d the report stated.It is a challenge, tugboat captains say, made more difficult because so many of them have not been fully trained in the new system, said Iv\u00e1n de la Guardia, who heads the tugboat captains\u2019 union. After three weeks of operation, Mr. de la Guardia said, 60 percent of his members had yet to be trained.Mr. Quijano said that \u201cwhile we have an adequate amount of trained captains to cover our needs, the training is still being provided in order to satisfy the increased demand in the future.\u201dGiven that the expanded canal is new, shippers are closely monitoring its operations, especially since the Xin Fei Zhou accident.\u201cThis is not an accident that should be happening,\u201d said Basil Karatzas, a New York-based maritime adviser to shipping companies. He estimated that repairs to the Chinese ship could cost \u201ca few hundred thousand dollars.\u201dThe ship waited several days before resuming its journey. \u201cThe delays and costs entailed with repairing the damage easily negate any benefits from passing through the canal,\u201d Mr. Karatzas said.The Times obtained step-by-step accounts of the two ships experiencing difficulty as they attempted to enter the set of locks without the approach wall. Canal workers also provided pictures of the damaged ship and the damaged fenders.Computer images, apparently recorded in real time, show tugboats struggling to position the Xin Fei Zhou as it approached the chamber before striking the left corner of the lock wall.Five days after the canal opened, the operators of another container ship, the MOL Benefactor, recorded details of its roughly 12-hour transit through the expanded locks. It was uneventful until the ship reached the lock with no approach wall.The ship\u2019s ranking officer became concerned, records show, because of what he described as \u201cnumerous\u201d or \u201ccountless\u201d bow thruster orders in addition to helm and engine orders \u2014 all indicating a level of uncertainty on the pilot\u2019s part.Unlike the Chinese container ship, the MOL Benefactor eventually passed through the final set of locks without incident.Londor A. Rankin leads the union of canal pilots, who board transiting ships and direct them, along with the tugboats. Two days before the Xin Fei Zhou accident, in response to email questions, Mr. Rankin said pilots were indeed experiencing problems at the entrance without an approach wall.He also said that canal officials had said they were interested in designing and building some sort of structure to help pilots and that they had considered his union\u2019s proposal to buy floating fenders as a better way to ease ships into the chamber. But, he added, \u201cthey have mentioned the inconvenience of doing so while the warranty of the new set of locks is still in effect.\u201dAsked why no approach wall had been built at the one entrance, Mr. Quijano said the walls had been built where the topography allowed it. He also said similar-size locks elsewhere do not use approach walls. Panama, in fact, copied the concept of the Berendrecht lock in Antwerp, Belgium, but that chamber is significantly wider than those in Panama\u2019s new locks.Andrew Kinsey, a senior marine risk engineer for Allianz, said he eagerly awaited the results of the canal authority\u2019s investigation, which he said should be shared with all interested parties. The authority has said it is conducting only an internal review that will not be released publicly, rather than a formal investigation.Mr. Quijano said that \u201cjust at the moment the vessel was entering the lock, it was suddenly hit by heavy crosswinds and very dense rain.\u201dCosco Container Lines, which owns the ship, said in a statement: \u201cThis is a serious matter.\u201d\u201cIs it a serious marine incident?\u201d Mr. Kinsey asked. \u201cThat will depend on the findings and the extent of repairs. Is it a concern? Yes, there\u2019s a hole in the ship.\u201dWitnessing this historic transit, the officials said, were \u201c25,000 jubilant Panamanians,\u201d heads of state, shipping executives and nearly 1,000 journalists. Canal publicists asserted that the ship carried thousands of shipping containers, a load that would not have fit in the smaller, original canal.But the new canal\u2019s sparkling narrative omitted one important fact: Most, if not all, of the shipping containers were empty. And even with the lighter load, the ship awkwardly brushed against a canal wall, according to photos posted online by canal workers.Mr. Quijano said some containers had contained cargo. Besides, he said, cargo containers constitute cargo even when empty.On Tuesday, Mr. Quijano announced that the canal authority was contemplating a ban on cellphones during transits because they were a distraction.videoAdvertisement"}

At a nearby sweet shop, the counterman, Zuheir Taleb, no longer slips out of the back when a uniformed official walks in.And in the country\u2019s north, on scorching fields a few miles from the Syrian border, Badra Hadahed, a diabetic grandmother doing backbreaking work, no longer worries that she will be plucked from the cucumber fields and sent back to her home.Like many Syrians who fled their country\u2019s civil war, all three had been working illegally in Jordan. But under a shrewd, delicate experiment that grew out of Europe\u2019s desire to contain the influx of foreigners to its shores, Jordan has been persuaded to let these Syrians make an honest living \u2014 in return for potentially big financial rewards.In short, Western leaders are using their financial and political leverage to convince Jordan that it is worthwhile to help refugees improve their lot in this country so they do not cross the Mediterranean Sea in flimsy rafts in search of a better life in Europe. It is a stark shift for both donor countries and Jordan, which, after absorbing generations of refugees from wars across the Middle East, had tried to keep Syrians from establishing a permanent foothold.\u201cSome may say this is the one shot that the government has to extract a lot of money,\u201d Stefan Dercon, a professor at Oxford University and the chief economist at the British government\u2019s development aid agency, which supports the effort in Jordan. \u201cI would say it is also the only shot that it will have to really reform its economy and create jobs, with substantial international funding.\u201dJordan is not the only country trying to leverage Europe\u2019s anxiety about refugees and migrants. Turkey has negotiated a deal that involves taking back most of those who traveled across the Aegean Sea into Greece in exchange for $6.6 billion in European aid and a proposed waiver of visas for Turks entering Europe.Jordanian officials have taken pains to point out that Syrians are allowed to work mainly in low-end jobs in construction and agriculture that are unattractive to most Jordanians. They also point out that those holding work permits must be paid the minimum wage of about $270 a month, which helps blunt criticism that refugees drive down wages.The challenge for Jordan is to demonstrate that the new deal will revive its economy and create jobs that its citizens want.\u201cThis is a good opportunity for Jordan to attract new investment,\u201d said Raed Nimri, a Jordanian engineer turned aid worker with Mercy Corps, a group based in Oregon that assists people during crises. \u201cIn five years, 10 years, the Syrians are going to go home. The investment is going to stay.\u201dThere are still many uncertainties. Jordanian officials point out that they are waiting for much of the aid that has been promised and for the European Council to approve the trade concessions that Jordan hopes will draw foreign businesses. Refugees are often nervous that signing up for work permits may imperil other aid they get from the United Nations.One industry being targeted is garment manufacturing in factories in special export zones.One of those, the Al Hassan Industrial Zone, sits barely a half-hour drive from the Syrian border, near the city of Irbid in northern Jordan, now home to an estimated 300,000 Syrians. The factories there employ barely any Syrians or Jordanians. Instead, they employ thousands of women from poor countries under temporary contracts.Among them: Baby Hawladar, a mother of two from Bangladesh who defied her husband\u2019s orders to travel halfway around the world to hunch over a sewing machine 10 hours a day, six days a week.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Hawladar, 27, was stitching Under Armour yoga pants for export to the United States. She has been in the job two years, working for about $155 a month, plus overtime, and a room and meals. Her goal is to stay a bit longer to save enough money to build a house in her home village.Every week, her children call and ask when she is coming home. Every week, she says, \u201cSoon.\u201dNot far from the industrial zone, leaning over rows of cucumbers on a vast farm close to the Syrian border, were migrant workers from Egypt, Pakistan and Syria, plus a few Jordanians. In May, after the loosening of work rules, the farm\u2019s owner, Jamal Muhammad Zoabi, obtained permits for the 100 or so Syrians who used to work for him illegally.Ms. Hadahed, the grandmother, was one of them, having taken over the job from her son after he was picked up in a police raid last year for working without a permit. He was deported back to Hama, the Syrian province now partly controlled by the Islamic State.Exhausted, ailing, her head spinning some days in the heat, Ms. Hadahed supports herself, her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren on her $270 monthly wage. She does not have much of a choice. Every time she speaks to her son on the phone, he warns her: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t come back.\u201dMr. Zoabi, the farmer, knows something about the perils of life on the other side.Before the war, he grew watermelon in Syria. He went back last year to collect some money he was owed, only to be detained, he said, by Islamic State fighters at a checkpoint. Mr. Zoabi said they had held him for six hours. They made him watch as they beheaded an entire family and then threw the heads into an icebox.Mr. Zoabi said he had paid the fighters close to $3,000, before being allowed to leave. \u201cIt was the worst trip of my life,\u201d he recalled. \u201cImagine living there.\u201dRana F.

But extraordinary things have been happening lately, especially in bond markets. And because money still makes the world go \u2019round, attention must be paid to what the markets are trying to tell us.Some commentators blame the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, accusing them of engineering \u201cartificially low\u201d interest rates that encourage speculation and distort the economy. These are, by the way, largely the same people who used to predict that budget deficits would cause interest rates to soar. In any case, however, it\u2019s important to understand that they\u2019re not making sense.For what does \u201cartificially low\u201d mean in this context? Compared to what? Historically, the consequence of excessively easy money \u2014 the way you know that money is too easy \u2014 has been out-of-control inflation. That\u2019s not happening in America, where inflation is still below the Fed\u2019s target, and it\u2019s definitely not happening in Europe, where the central bank has been trying to raise inflation, without success.If anything, developments in the real economies of the advanced world are telling us that interest rates aren\u2019t low enough \u2014 that is, while low rates may be having their usual effects of boosting the housing sector and, to some extent, the stock market, those effects aren\u2019t big enough to produce a strong recovery. But why?So what\u2019s going on? I think of it as the Great Capitulation.Many people don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening, but raising rates in the face of weak economies would be an act of folly that might well push us back into recession.I know, deficit scolds would issue dire warnings about the evils of public debt. But they have been wrong about everything for at least the past eight years, and it\u2019s time to stop taking them seriously.They say that money talks; well, cheap money is speaking very clearly right now, and it\u2019s telling us to invest in our future.Advertisement"}

It takes place in a contemporary United States where the Civil War never happened, and slavery remains legal in four states, and it\u2019s narrated by a former slave who has paid a steep moral price for his freedom.\u201cI had reservations every day, up to the present day, because the subject is so fraught, and rightfully so,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if this is ancient history in this country.\u201dMr. Winters, 40, has pulled off high-wire acts before. As one of the early literary mash-up artists, he churned out zany best sellers like \u201cSense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters\u201d and \u201cAndroid Karenina.\u201d His best-selling trilogy, \u201cThe Last Policeman,\u201d is a genre-defying blend of crime writing and science fiction, starring a stoic police officer trying to solve crimes as the world braces for a catastrophic asteroid collision.But even for someone who brazenly flouts literary conventions, taking on slavery in the context of a sci-fi thriller seemed dicey.\u201cThe first impulse is to go, oh man, are you supposed to be writing about that, as a white American?\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to think of racism and slavery as something that\u2019s appropriate only for black artists to engage with, and there\u2019s something troubling and perverse about that.\u201dMr. Winters just sold two more books to Mulholland, including \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d a darkly magical legal thriller that deals with mental illness.Attica Locke, a mystery novelist and a writer for the television show \u201cEmpire,\u201d said she was taken aback at first when she picked up the book and saw the author photo.\u201cThe premise was just like, \u2018Wait, what now?\u2019\u201d Ms. Locke said. \u201cFor me, as a black writer, I have to be like, \u2018What\u2019s Ben trying to do here?\u2019\u201d Then she got sucked into the story and was \u201cblown away,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s always this chatter about who gets to tell which stories, and I\u2019m so grateful that he did not let his choice to have a black protagonist scare him away from the project, because this is everybody\u2019s history,\u201d she said.All of these novels wrestle with the ways that slavery has shaped the country. But Mr. Winters\u2019s approach takes the theme to a shocking conclusion.\u201cHe\u2019s taking a direct whack at one of the main critical things that\u2019s happening in this country right now,\u201d said Lev Grossman, a book critic and author of the fantasy series \u201cThe Magicians.\u201d \u201cThis is a white writer going after questions of what it\u2019s like to be black in America. It\u2019s a fearless thing to do.\u201dMr. Winters, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife and three children, stumbled into fiction writing by accident. He grew up in Maryland in a middle-class Jewish family and played bass in a punk band in his youth. After college, he wrote plays and musical comedies.To expand his modest income \u2014 \u201cfrom zero to something,\u201d he said wryly \u2014 he started writing parody books on commission for the Philadelphia publisher Quirk Books. One of his assignments was \u201cSense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters,\u201d which imported giant lobsters and man-eating jellyfish into Jane Austen\u2019s Regency romance. Though it was clearly a spoof, Mr. Winters took the job seriously, and closely studied Austen\u2019s plotting and character development.With the \u201cLast Policeman\u201d trilogy, Mr. Winters carved out an unusual niche for himself: writing intricately plotted, high-concept thrillers with heady philosophical undercurrents. The story started as a high-stakes mystery, but morphed into an existential meditation on people\u2019s resilience in the face of certain death. The series drew both science-fiction fans and mystery readers, and books in the series won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America and the Philip K. Dick Award for distinguished science fiction.In the fall of 2013, Mr. Winters started casting around for his next project. He kept thinking about Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was fatally shot in Florida by George Zimmerman, and incidents of police violence against African-Americans.\u201cOur country is still dealing with the legacy of slavery,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cAs I researched the subject, I realized I wanted to take this figurative idea that slavery is still with us, and make it literal.\u201dMr. Winters tried to ground the narrative in research to make the wild premise plausible. He read academic books like \u201cThe Political Economy of Slavery,\u201d and speculative histories like Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Plot Against America\u201d and Philip K. Dick\u2019s \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d He read and reread literary classics by Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin and Zora Neale Hurston.He realized that changing a few key historical events could have a cascading effect on American culture, economics and politics. He mapped out a timeline in which Lincoln was shot in 1861, before his inauguration, and slavery was permanently enshrined in the Constitution.The story cracked open when he came up with Victor, who seems like a classic character from hard-boiled detective fiction: a prickly, cynical loner with a dark past. Early on, it emerges that Victor used to be a \u201cpeeb,\u201d or a Person Bound to Labor. His tenuous freedom is granted to him by Mr. Bridge, a shadowy figure with the federal marshals, who has hired him to track escaped slaves. Victor \u2014 who excels at his work and has captured more than 200 people \u2014 infiltrates an abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines, and is forced to confront his own complicity.Mr. Winters said writing in the first person felt most natural because it fit with the noir mystery tradition.\u201cNo one tried to talk me out of it, but my wife at one point said, \u2018Boy, it would be better if you were black,\u2019\u201d Mr. Winters recalled. \u201cMy agent might have said something similar, that the reception of the book would go down easier if it was an African-American author.\u201dAt least one publisher passed on the book, arguing that it might be too controversial in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, Mr. Winters said. But Joshua Kendall, an editor at Mulholland, thought that the story\u2019s provocative political message was its central strength and bought it based on the first 80 pages.It remains to be seen whether most readers and critics will agree that Mr. Winters has pulled it off. But he feels that it was worth trying.\u201cThe whole art form is about empathy,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cNo, I will never know what it\u2019s really like to be black, but I can, through as much imagination as I can bring to it, create this individual. That\u2019s my job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s President Is Confronted by Scandal Over Inflated Government Wages", "Date": "2016-07-17", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 Less than a year before new elections, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is confronting a major scandal involving inflated salaries for the managers and executives of state-run companies.In recent weeks, the Iranian news media have been publishing payment slips showing many top managers of state-run companies earning what for Iran are astronomical bonuses and salaries, often hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.Mr. Rouhani was elected in 2013 promising to end corruption in government and revive the economy by completing a nuclear deal and ending sanctions. With sanctions still largely in place, however, the economy remains moribund.Now, having cleaned house after supplanting the corruption-riddled administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and putting his own people at the top rungs of state-run enterprises, Mr. Rouhani finds himself increasingly vulnerable as the disclosures of inflated salaries multiply.\u201cMr. Rouhani\u2019s friends are his enemies,\u201d said Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, the head of the Tehran office of the World Trade Center organization. \u201cThey are cronies.\u201dIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has harshly criticized the inflated salaries, which far exceed the legal cap of $2,353 a month for government employees. Mr. Rouhani, who has kept a low profile since the scandal broke, has ordered an investigation. Several ministers have apologized to the nation, and managers have been forced to resign.The disclosures first emerged in conservative news outlets that oppose the president, and have since mushroomed beyond his inner circle to managers and executives from all political factions.They started in May, when Mizan, the news agency belonging to Iran\u2019s judiciary, published the payment slips of eight managers of the state-owned Central Insurance Company, who had each received yearly bonuses of over $50,000.The news agency added that the financial rewards had to be judged against a backdrop of seven million laborers who earn just $200 a month.The chief executive of the company, Mohammad Ebrahim Amin, resigned over the affair.In June, a hard-line website, Ensafnews, published the paycheck stubs of the top managers of the state-owned Tejarat Bank. Its chief executive, appointed after Mr. Rouhani was elected in 2013, made $208,115 over 21 months, the documents showed. He had also been given an interest-free loan of $289,000.Since then, the wages of doctors, auto executives and others have been disclosed in the news media, as hard-line and moderate publications have competed to see which can more severely embarrass the other. Managers in health care have topped the charts with monthly wages over $200,000.\u201cThis government has drastically increased wages and bonuses,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. \u201cNow we are seeing the results.\u201dNo official announcements of salary increases are made, but Mr. Taraghi, who is usually well informed about government matters, said 285 state managers now made more than $6,000 a month.Official salaries have always been capped \u2014 in theory, at least \u2014 in keeping with the official policy of frugality and soberness that forms the Islamic Republic\u2019s ideological base.But Mr. Taraghi acknowledged that those caps were often unrealistically low, and that, while unpopular, higher salaries were needed to attract talented managers.\u201cLets face it,\u201d he said. \u201cEverywhere in the world, managers make a lot of money.\u201dPro-government figures have accused some generals in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Office of the Supreme Leader of receiving similar wages.A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards denied the charges but refused to divulge the salaries of military commanders, saying they were \u201cstate secrets.\u201d\u201cWhat is emerging is a mechanism similar to that in the former Soviet Union,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. \u201cThe elites are rewarded with money and privileges in return for their loyalties.\u201dCorruption has always been endemic in Iran, with billions of dollars in oil revenue being distributed by the government.Under the two four-year terms of Mr. Ahmadinejad, corruption grew to extraordinary levels.The banking system was left with huge debts because some with the right connections were granted enormous loans that often were not repaid, even as most of Iran\u2019s young adults and private businesses were shut out of credit markets.Perhaps the most damaging revelations for Mr. Rouhani have involved those closest to him.His brother, Mr. Fereydoun, has been accused by Raja News, a conservative outlet, of using his influence to place a friend, Ali Sedighi, in charge of the Refah bank.The head of Iran\u2019s General Inspection Office, Naser Seraj, complained that Mr. Sedighi had been appointed after \u201cinsisting and lobbying by a government official.\u201dThe vice president, Mr. Jahangiri, who is leading the official investigation into the salary scandal, was awarded a bonus of around $200,000 from a state-run cement factory where he is a member of the board, Kayhan, a hard-line newspaper, reported.Frustration with the steady stream of accusations is widespread, though Iranians are accustomed to an entrenched culture of corruption, and few expressed surprise.\u201cI need to work morning to night in order to prevent bankruptcy,\u201d said Mostafa Zandvakili, a distributor of mineral water, working the hot summer streets of the capital. \u201cLook what they are getting. For what? Unfortunately, this scandal is not surprising at all, because there is so much corruption.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Debt Collectors\u2019 Abuses Prompt Consumer Agency to Propose New Rules", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byFor the first time in nearly 40 years, federal regulators are preparing to significantly strengthen the rules that govern debt collection in an effort to clamp down on collectors who hound consumers for debts they may not even owe.Under the proposed regulations, which will undergo a lengthy review process, debt collection companies will have to more fully document the debt they are trying to collect, make it clear how a consumer can dispute the debt, and observe state statutes of limitations that bar them from legally pursuing older debts \u2014 all safeguards that are frequently flouted, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency that plans to put forth the new rules on Thursday.The regulations also take aim at the stereotype of the harassing debt agency: Collectors would be barred from trying to contact people more than six times in a week. And, after a debtor dies, the collectors would have to wait 30 days before contacting family members about paying up.\u201cThis is about bringing better accuracy and accountability to a market that desperately needs it,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.But this time, the industry response has been muted \u2014 and even cautiously supportive.The bureau began laying the groundwork for these new rules three years ago, and several trade group leaders said the process had been thoughtful and methodical.Susan Macharia, 39, an administrative worker who lives in Buena Park, Calif., said she was blindsided in January when she got a call from a collector saying that her wages would be garnished unless she paid off a $10,000 credit card debt that she allegedly ran up in 2003.A debt so old would normally be beyond the statute of limitations, and legally uncollectable, but the company had a copy of a 2006 default judgment that was entered against her when she failed to respond to a collection lawsuit.While Ms. Macharia tried to figure out how to contest the debt, the collector began garnishing nearly $800 a month from her paychecks.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, and I lost so much weight because I couldn\u2019t eat,\u201d said Ms. Macharia, a mother with two children. \u201cThere was so much financial stress, and emotional stress \u2014 I had never dealt with anything like this before. And I knew I hadn\u2019t done it! If I had ever used a credit card back then, I probably would have been like, \u2018Whatever, I guess I owe this,\u2019 but I knew there was no way.\u201dLeigh E. Ferrin, the head of the group\u2019s consumer law unit, said that most collection firms \u201cdon\u2019t want to litigate, because they know the documentation isn\u2019t sufficient.\u201dThe proposed regulations are aimed at making it much harder for debt collectors to pursue people like Ms. Macharia.Several states \u2014 most notably, New York and California \u2014 have adopted stricter rules about the documentation required to collect on a debt, which consumer advocates say have helped curb some abuses.In 2008, nearly 300,000 debt collection lawsuits were filed in New York City\u2019s civil courts. Last year, after new state regulations took effect, that number fell to 55,000.The Federal Trade Commission has long been the main federal regulator of debt collection tactics through its enforcement of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the 1977 law that governs how companies can pursue those who owe them money. But the consumer bureau \u2014 which has broad powers to make rules on its own \u2014 says that it, too, can take action under a provision in its charter that allows it to ban \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive acts.\u201dThe bureau also struck multimillion-dollar settlements with JPMorgan Chase and Citibank over their sales of inaccurately documented debts to collectors.The cases sent a clear warning to the industry about the standards companies would be expected to conform to, even though no new rules had yet been enacted.Many debt collectors have voluntarily taken steps to clean up their act, industry representatives say. Ms. Stieger, of DBA International, cited new certification rules her group adopted this year that mandate strict compliance with requirements similar to those the consumer bureau is considering.Encore Capital said that it welcomed new national rules, and believed that it already adhered to most or all of the proposed requirements.\u201cWe believe that the rule-making will provide important clarity around key issues for our industry,\u201d the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Revive the Promise of the European Union", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Supported byEditorialMs. Le Pen and her ilk have found a receptive audience for their nativist and isolationist views because many people have lost faith that the E.U. and its officials can deliver the stability and prosperity that was the purpose of the European project. In recent years, the failure to find a unified response to the flow of refugees from Syria, Africa and elsewhere has further damaged the E.U.\u2019s reputation. Whether or not Britain ultimately leaves the union, it is now up to leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy to reform the E.U. or watch its credibility and effectiveness drain away further.One of the most basic critiques of the union is that it is not democratic. This is an exaggeration, but it includes a kernel of truth. Of the E.U.\u2019s three main institutions, the most powerful is the European Council, which is made up of 28 national governments. Its decisions, which are subject to political compromise, rarely reflect the pure preferences of the people of any of its member nations.Reforms to this opaque structure could include making the Parliament more central in decision-making. Another improvement would be to let Europeans directly elect the president of the commission, which would make that office more accountable to the union\u2019s citizens.Though nationalists are sure to rail against greater European unity, addressing Europe\u2019s big challenges \u2014 like the refugee crisis \u2014 will require just that. The E.U.\u2019s current leadership made that crisis worse by leaving Italy and Greece to handle it on their own with little assistance. And the E.U. policy requiring refugees to seek asylum in the country where they first arrive has created further disruptions by encouraging people to travel across the continent in an effort to get to the country of their choice.The E.U. could strengthen the European economy by restructuring the debt of weaker countries. It could increase public spending to stimulate private investment and boost consumer demand. Another important idea, creating a European deposit insurance system to protect savers, was proposed years ago but has not yet happened.From its earliest days, European integration was built on the idea that it would guarantee peace and, with a single market, ensure greater prosperity across the continent. In many ways, it has achieved those goals. But it is alarming that Brexit and its fallout have emboldened those who seek to dissolve this union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Bush,\u2019 a Biography as Scathing Indictment", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesFor George W. Bush, the summer already looks unbearable. The party he gave his life to will repudiate him by nominating a bombastic serial insulter who makes the famously brash former president look like a museum docent by comparison. And a renowned presidential biographer is weighing in with a judgment that makes Mr. Bush\u2019s gentleman\u2019s Cs at Yale look like the honor roll.If Mr. Bush eventually gets a more sympathetic hearing by history, as he hopes, it will not start with Jean Edward Smith\u2019s \u201cBush,\u201d a comprehensive and compelling narrative punctuated by searing verdicts of all the places where the author thinks the 43rd president went off track. Mr. Smith\u2019s indictment does not track Donald J. Trump\u2019s, but the cumulative effect is to leave Mr. Bush with few defenders in this season of his discontent.While not a fresh portrait, it is one worth debating at a time when the political class is struggling to understand the meaning of Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. Mr. Trump\u2019s name appears nowhere in \u201cBush,\u201d but it is clear the populist revolt that propelled him to the verge of the Republican nomination had its roots in Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency, so much so that he easily overcame the former president\u2019s brother Jeb. Mr. Trump rejects much of what George W. Bush stood for, from the war in Iraq and more forgiving immigration policies to free trade and the very notion of compassionate conservatism.As a biographer, Mr. Smith makes no comparisons with today\u2019s Republican leader, but he sides unmistakably with those who see Mr. Bush\u2019s presidency in the darkest shades, if often for radically different reasons. (Mr. Smith abhors waterboarding terror suspects, for example; Mr. Trump wants it resumed.)Mr. Smith leaves no mystery where he stands on Mr. Bush\u2019s place in history. The first sentence of his book: \u201cRarely in the history of the United States has the nation been so ill-served as during the presidency of George W. Bush.\u201dThe last: \u201cWhether George W. Bush was the worst president in American history will be long debated, but his decision to invade Iraq is easily the worst foreign policy decision ever made by an American president.\u201dIn between are more than 650 pages of fast-paced if harsh biography. In this telling, Mr. Bush\u2019s religious piety took on messianic fervor leading him to turn democracy promotion into a mission from God. He didn\u2019t listen to the generals and diplomats. He badly bungled the response to Hurricane Katrina. He presided over the diminution of American values by authorizing torture and bugging.\u201cBelieving he was the agent of God\u2019s will, and acting with divine guidance, George W. Bush would lead the nation into two disastrous wars of aggression,\u201d Mr. Smith writes. \u201cBush\u2019s personalization of the war on terror combined with his macho assertiveness as the nation\u2019s commander in chief,\u201d he adds later, \u201cwere a recipe for disaster.\u201dThe value of Mr. Smith\u2019s account is not original reporting but a thorough assimilation of the existing record. Mr. Bush declined to speak with him, as he has with other authors since leaving office. Mr. Smith spoke with both Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, but for the most part relies on the existing body of literature, for a complete history of Mr. Bush\u2019s life.\u201cMuch of the rest of the meal was devoted to my explaining how Eisenhower had put the affair behind him and successfully run for president in 1952,\u201d Mr. Smith reports. He adds that he asked Mr. Petraeus whether the Obama administration had taken advantage of his affair to rid itself of him. \u201cHe smiled, but did not reply,\u201d Mr. Smith writes.He presents a president who, for all his flaws, was usually gracious and warmhearted, who disdained the sort of divisive bashing that Mr. Trump favors and who went out of his way to make Barack Obama\u2019s transition successful. He rejects the caricature of a president who simply did what his vice president told him to.Mr. Smith\u2019s fundamental critique is his belief that Mr. Bush overreacted to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. \u201cThe events of 9/11 were tragic, but scarcely catastrophic,\u201d he writes. That led Mr. Bush, in his view, to advance policies that were not justified by the actual danger.The Patriot Act, he writes, \u201cmay be the most ill-conceived piece of domestic legislation since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798.\u201d In labeling Iran, Iraq and North Korea an \u201caxis of evil,\u201d Mr. Bush \u201chad spoken without weighing the consequences.\u201d Mr. Bush\u2019s refusal to face up to the fact that Iraq had no unconventional weapons \u201csuggests a willfulness that borders on psychosis.\u201d His second-term Inaugural Address making democracy promotion his major goal \u201cmust rank as one of the most ill-considered of all time.\u201dMr. Smith takes this indictment further than others by criticizing even the decision to go to war in Afghanistan, suggesting that it was a mistake to conflate the Taliban with Al Qaeda. He, of course, has the benefit of hindsight. Even if he is right, few if any leaders in either party at the time argued against the invasion. And what is often overlooked is how Mr. Bush evolved over time and modified his approach to the point that Mr. Obama kept many of his national security policies after taking office.But if Mr. Bush feels bruised by Mr. Smith\u2019s evaluation, he can commiserate at Kennebunkport, Me., this summer with his father. In 1992, Mr. Smith published \u201cGeorge Bush\u2019s War,\u201d castigating the first President Bush for Operation Desert Storm\u2019s expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.He scorned the 41st president for personalizing world politics, accused him of dissembling and screening out expert opinion and going to war against Iraq mainly because he wanted a fight \u2014 all themes that repeat in \u201cBush.\u201dUltimately, the elder Mr. Bush\u2019s reputation has grown with time despite this assessment \u2014 to his chagrin, partly because of comparisons with his son. The younger Mr. Bush now has to hope for the same \u2014 and may be able to count on comparisons with Mr. Trump to make him look better with time.Peter Baker, a longtime White House correspondent for The New York Times, is the author of \u201cDays of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House.\u201dBushBy Jean Edward SmithIllustrated. 808 pages.

{"Headline": "Already Shaky, U.S. Profits Shudder After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byTo the growing list of problems brought about by June\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, you can add corporate profits in the United States.The pace of earnings growth for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has been declining since the third quarter of 2014, and it officially turned negative a year ago. Because stock prices tend to follow the general path of profits, this helps to explain why the broad stock market may have been generally flat over the last two years.But many market strategists had been predicting an end to the earnings drought in the second half of 2016 because of rebounding oil and commodity prices \u2014 a sign the global economy was finding its footing. That is, until Britain chose to leave the European Union in a surprising vote last month, raising a whole new set of risks.\u201cIf companies were looking for a built-in excuse for an earnings disappointment, they\u2019ve found it,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.By raising concerns over the British and European economies, the Brexit vote has spooked investors who had parked their cash in the pound and euro, leading to a stronger dollar, Mr. Ablin said. And that hurts the fortunes of American companies that generate a sizable portion of their revenue abroad.Before Brexit, the dollar had fallen slightly against a basket of foreign currencies this year, after gaining more than 20 percent in 2014 and 2015. A weakening dollar not only reduces the cost of goods made in the United States and sold in foreign markets, it also increases international profits for American firms when they convert their overseas earnings back into dollars.Since the Brexit vote on June 23, though, the dollar has risen in strength.This trend shouldn\u2019t have an impact on second-quarter profits, because the British vote took place at the very end of that period. Wall Street analysts continue to look for a profit decline of about 5.5 percent versus the same period a year earlier.That would actually represent an improvement from the 6.8 percent decline in the first quarter and would end a streak of seven consecutive quarters of declining growth rates.\u201cOur call for U.S. corporate profits to bounce back in the second quarter is still valid,\u201d said Olga Bitel, an economist and portfolio manager at the asset manager William Blair.\u201cLooking forward, however, there\u2019s a considerable amount of ambiguity,\u201d she said.Market strategists had been expecting profit growth for the S.&P. 500 to turn positive in the third quarter, followed by a rise in earnings of nearly 8 percent in the fourth, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence. Such a bounce would have bolstered the argument of the optimists on Wall Street, who believe the seven-year-old bull market can keep running despite being older than average.Such lofty profit projections aren\u2019t easy to make now.\u201cI have a difficult time thinking how large-cap profit growth will rebound significantly this year,\u201d said Mr. Ablin at BMO.Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at Westwood Holdings Group, said that in addition to a potentially stronger dollar, \u201cBrexit calls into question projections for global growth, and that\u2019s an additional headwind for the markets,\u201d he said.So are rising wages.Throughout this long but shallow economic recovery, wage growth had been weighed down by several factors, including cost-cutting efforts and lackluster productivity growth.But wage growth has finally started to pick up. \u201cFor the last 12 months, wages have grown about 2.5 percent, inflation has been at 1 percent, and productivity growth has been zero,\u201d said Ben Inker, co-head of the asset allocation team at the asset management firm GMO. \u201cThat\u2019s a 1.5 percent increase in unit labor costs. That\u2019s the reverse of what\u2019s been happening on profits.\u201dMr. Inker argues that in the long run, this could be a positive for the broad economy. \u201cYou could view this as a healing process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long time when wages grew so much less than productivity. But if labor income is improving, that\u2019s more money going into the household sector, and households will probably spend it.\u201dIn the short run, however, rising wages will put pressure on near-term corporate profits.Investors should not overreact, said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.Mr. White noted that so far, the profit drought has been concentrated in just a handful of the 10 sectors of the market. For instance, in the second quarter, energy sector profits are expected to be down 82 percent. And profits for basic materials companies, which are tied to commodities, and financial stocks are forecast to drop 7 and 9 percent.Yet other sectors of the market haven\u2019t been affected nearly as much. \u201cWe continue to see decent earnings growth in areas such as the consumer discretionary sector,\u201d he said. Companies that deliver goods and services that aren\u2019t necessities but that households want \u2014 appliances, cars and entertainment \u2014 are expected to see a 9 percent increase in their profits in the second quarter and a 13 percent rise in 2016.John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, also likes consumer discretionary stocks, including automakers, in addition to industrial companies that are benefiting from low commodity prices.An added benefit is that companies in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors tend to have modest exposure to foreign economies. Only 26 percent of the revenue for consumer discretionary companies and 38 percent of sales for industrial firms in the S.&P. 500 are generated abroad, according to FactSet. By contrast, nearly 60 percent of information technology company sales are foreign.Why is this important? Because domestically oriented companies have been sheltered from many of the negative effects of the strong dollar.FactSet, for instance, points out that while profits for companies that generate most of their sales abroad are expected to fall 9.9 percent in the second quarter, domestically focused firms are bracing for a more modest 2.8 percent decline.Besides sticking with domestically oriented businesses, investors should also focus on industry leaders, whose dominant positions in their industries are likely to produce steadier earnings growth.\u201cWe think the benefit of being with the dominant, No. 1 player has increased over time in this economy,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management.Even in the energy sector, where earnings growth is hard to come by, Mr. Osterweis said he has been adding to his position in industry leaders like Halliburton.\u201cIf oil prices recover, the dominant player wins,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if oil prices were to stay low for longer, more and more of Halliburton\u2019s competitors might go out of business, so it would gain market share.\u201dHe adds: \u201cPeople often get spooked and discouraged when the market is under pressure. But that can give you an opportunity to swoop in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving the Economy the Help It Needs", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe economy added 287,000 new jobs last month, compared with 11,000 in May. Large month-to-month swings indicate statistical noise and one-off distortions, in this case, a strike by Verizon workers in May that was resolved by June. But the big picture is basically unchanged.On average, the economy added 147,000 new jobs in each of the past three months, a slowdown from an average of 196,000 new jobs a month in the first quarter of this year and 282,000 in the last quarter of 2015. Slowing job growth means tepid wage growth. A slight rise in average hourly earnings last month brought the increase in pay to 2.6 percent over the year, which by historical standards is subdued. Worse, the increase, such as it is, overstates the raises of most workers because it includes the large gains of executives and managers.The Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates low in light of the jobs data and other economic headwinds, especially the coming consequences of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Holding rates steady is the right, if defensive, move to keep the economy from backsliding. But on their own, low interest rates cannot propel the economy forward.The question is when, if ever, Congress will capitalize on the prolonged low interest rates by borrowing to invest in large (and overdue) productivity-enhancing projects, including rebuilding and modernizing roads, bridges, ports, rail, parks, school buildings, electrical grids and other infrastructure.Congress\u2019s squandered chance to authorize such spending during this recovery is born of partisanship, as congressional Republicans have sought to thwart attempts by President Obama and congressional Democrats to use fiscal policy to bolster the economy. Making matters worse, many Democrats faltered, embracing the misguided austerity policies championed by their political opponents, for fear of looking weak.Election season is upon us, which means Congress is unlikely to have a change of heart. But it also means that people will have a chance to choose leaders who recognize that aggressive fiscal policy can help ensure a full recovery from the ravages of the Great Recession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stress Tests Find Some Big European Banks Wanting", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 European regulators announced on Friday that new stress tests found that a handful of the region\u2019s biggest banks would struggle in a severe economic downturn or in the next financial crisis.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest bank, was the worst performer in this year\u2019s stress tests, as an important measure of its capital fell to a negative in a crisis situation modeled by the European Banking Authority, which regulates lenders in the European Union.Just before the results were announced, Monte dei Paschi said that it would raise 5 billion euros, or about $5.5 billion, in new capital and shed more than \u20ac9 billion in nonperforming loans.Allied Irish Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland were among the other banks with so-called Tier 1 capital ratios that declined sharply in the tests. And among the region\u2019s larger banks, the Tier 1 capital ratios of the Italian lender UniCredit, Barclays of Britain and Deutsche Bank of Germany would all fall below 8 percent in the hypothetical crisis.The tests, by the European Banking Authority, were conducted at a pivotal time for the region\u2019s lenders.Financial markets, and bank stocks in particular, have been rattled at times in recent weeks by the uncertainty stemming from Britain\u2019s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union.The European Union said on Friday that the growth in the economy in the eurozone slowed in the second quarter, an unwelcome sign for banks that are already grappling with a decline in trading revenue.Concern is growing about the ability of Italy\u2019s banks to deal with hundreds of billions of euros in problem loans.And one of Europe\u2019s largest banks, Deutsche Bank, has been under pressure from investors as its chief executive, John Cryan, tries to turn it around.The latest tests examined the balance sheets of 51 European banks, representing about 70 percent of the region\u2019s banking industry.Unlike tests in previous years, this round did not have a minimum capital threshold that lenders had to meet to pass. As a result, no bank could actually fail, or pass, the examination. But the higher the capital ratio, the stronger the bank.Local banking supervisors like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will use the results to determine whether banks need to take additional action, such as raising capital.\u201cWhile we recognize the extensive capital-raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health,\u201d said Andrea Enria, the chairman of the European Banking Authority. \u201cThere remains work to do, which supervisors will undertake.\u201dUnder this year\u2019s examination, bank balance sheets were tested against the impact of a macroeconomic downturn over three years, in which real gross domestic product would decline by 1.2 percent in the European Union in 2016, fall by a further 1.3 percent in 2017 and recover slightly in 2018.The banks examined this year had an average capital ratio of 13.2 percent as of the end of December 2015.The ratio declined to 9.4 percent by 2018, the third year of the hypothetical crisis.By comparison, European banks in the European Banking Authority\u2019s last stress test two years ago had a Tier 1 ratio of 11.1 percent at the end of 2013.The biggest impact came from credit losses; banks across the region suffered cumulative losses of \u20ac349 billion. The results also forecast market risk losses of \u20ac148 billion and a cumulative loss of \u20ac105 billion from so-called conduct risk.The examination also found that the average return on regulatory capital for banks in the test sample was 6.5 percent at the end of 2015, which is below the cost of equity and return on equity that banks consider sustainable long term, the regulator said.In 2014, the regulator examined the balance sheets of 123 of the region\u2019s lenders, identifying 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and that would need additional buffers to be prepared for an economic downturn.This year\u2019s tests involved a much smaller number of lenders, though the regulator said it covered 70 percent of the banking sector in Europe.No banks from Greece or Portugal were included, and many of Italy\u2019s smaller lenders were spared.The stocks of Monte dei Paschi and other Italian banks have been under pressure in recent months over concerns about the sheer size of nonperforming loans on their books, some \u20ac360 billion.According to the Bank of Italy, about \u20ac210 billion of those loans are held by insolvent borrowers, and an additional \u20ac150 billion are loans that are considered unlikely to be repaid, past due or in breach of an overdraft ceiling. Some of those loans could ultimately be repaid.After write-downs, the amount of bad loans falls to \u20ac87 billion. Some \u20ac50 billion of those are backed by assets with a value estimated at \u20ac85 billion, the central bank said.New European rules, adopted after the financial crisis, have made it harder for the government to step in and devise a solution.Those rules require bondholders to shoulder much of the losses before a government-backed bailout can be put in place, a process known as a bail-in. That could have a major impact on the confidence of investors in Italy, as many small investors there hold bank bonds.This year, Italy\u2019s government helped orchestrate the creation of Atlante, a private fund intended to help shore up the capital in Italy\u2019s banks and buy nonperforming loans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the European Union Could Break if It Does Not Learn to Bend", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byDisunionDid the European Union break itself?Its critics say that it has not been sufficiently responsive \u2014 and that this is one of the main reasons Britain voted to leave. One way to see if that\u2019s true is to look at immigration, the issue that sat at the heart of the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign.Citizens of one European Union country can move to and work in any other country of the union. Britain, in part because its economy has been performing strongly, has attracted higher levels of immigration in recent years.Look at the numbers. From 1970 till 1999, there was an average annual inflow of 243,000 long-term immigrants, according to British government statistics. This more than doubled to an average of 552,000 from 2000 through the end of 2014. Currently, around half the immigrants are from the European Union, roughly half of those from eastern European countries like Poland and Romania.These arguments hold some water. The United States, a nation of immigrants, has controls on immigration. And at times, the European Union has allowed countries to place \u201ctransitional controls\u201d on immigration. Why didn\u2019t it do so for Britain? Was this a classic case of a system not flexible enough to adapt?Europe\u2019s leaders see things very differently. All political entities, including democratic ones, have principles that they consider nonnegotiable. For the European Union, free movement of people and workers is one. Just as Florida does not bar migration from New York, the Netherlands cannot say no to migration from Spain.Still, this is a sobering moment for leaders of the European Union. Brexit has revealed the gap between the governed and the government of Europe.A well-functioning system of government can usually deal with competing forces in such a way that they don\u2019t lead to drastic outcomes. Even when voters are mad, they don\u2019t go for extreme solutions if they think their representatives will one day deliver. If enough people believe that the system is sufficiently responsive, it will probably survive.One of the European Union\u2019s biggest flaws is that it sets grand plans in motion \u2014 like the euro and the free movement of people \u2014 and then fails to come up with adequate responses when those ambitions backfire in some way. The euro\u2019s survival is not guaranteed as long as Europe\u2019s economy stays sluggish and unemployment remains at stratospheric levels in some countries. Immigration may rise to unpopular levels in countries other than Britain.No, the European Union did not break itself. But it still has time, and opportunities, to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Debt Relief Law Stirs Colonial Resentment", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 They shouted angrily about \u201ccolonialism\u201d and called for a Prexit, or Puerto Rican exit, from the United States. They denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.Late Thursday afternoon, even Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla seemed to be joining in the protest, declaring a moratorium on paying the island\u2019s debts just one day before a big payment was due \u2014 even as President Obama was signing a new law that precludes the governor from making such a move.But beneath the defiant rhetoric \u2014 on the Puerto Rican talk shows, at labor rallies and at an \u201cOccupy\u201d vigil at the federal courthouse here \u2014 there was also resignation: an awareness that Puerto Rico\u2019s own elected officials had let the island slip into a death spiral, and that the passage by the United States Senate on Wednesday of a bill meant to assert federal authority was really the only available solution.\u201cWe feel bad, because we can no longer make our own decisions,\u201d she added, speaking in an interview at her group\u2019s offices on Wednesday, after the Senate vote. \u201cBut it was our own decisions that got us here.\u201dEveryone seems to have strong feelings \u2014 many of them conflicting \u2014 about their shared predicament: a passionate love of Borik\u00e9n, the widely used pre-Columbian name for their island; a sense of shock that their government amassed a $72 billion debt; a bitter resentment of Washington \u2014 and yet a begrudging appreciation of the benefits that American citizenship and the United States safety net can bring.\u201cMost of the people are against the junta, but maybe it\u2019s what we deserve after all those years of corruption,\u201d said Kamille Camacho Monclova, interviewed with Ms. Negr\u00f3n as they made sandwiches and coffee to deliver to homeless people.Most of Iniciativa Comunitaria\u2019s funding comes from the Puerto Rican government, and the group\u2019s budget has been cut by about 40 percent in the last three years as the island\u2019s troubles have mounted.\u201cMaybe these things had to happen so we would get a wake-up call,\u201d Ms. Camacho said, referring to Washington\u2019s decision to establish a seven-member control board known here as the \u201cjunta.\u201d The word simply means \u201cboard\u201d in Spanish, despite its dictatorial connotations in English. The law itself goes by the acronym \u201cPromesa,\u201d which means \u201cpromise\u201d in Spanish.The need to pay the island\u2019s $72 billion debt, including a $1.9 billion payment due Friday on which there will be a default, has crowded out other governmental spending in Puerto Rico, leaving a wake of devastation: closed schools, fewer hospital beds, homeless people squatting in abandoned houses. The many symptoms of social breakdown lie just out of sight of the luxury resorts where compatriots from the mainland still flock to swim, golf and relax.The government has already scared off some tourists by talking up the Zika virus threat; this week officials also warned that they would stop testing the water supply, to save money.At the same time, expensive restaurants here still bustle with diners, Cartier and Tiffany\u2019s are open for business, and last month more than 1,400 shoppers stood in line for hours to attend the grand opening of an H&M store in San Juan.In addition to imposing federal control, the Promesa legislation gives Puerto Rico the power to unilaterally reduce its debts, something that a debtor can normally do only in bankruptcy. Federal law explicitly bars all branches of the Puerto Rican government from entering bankruptcy, the way many mainland cities and counties could if they were in the island\u2019s position \u2014 and here, that exclusion is seen as a slap in the face.\u201cIt shows what complete imperial power there is in America,\u201d said Camila S\u00e1nchez, a fine arts student at the University of Puerto Rico who was helping the Occupy movement in front of the United States District Court. The protesters, who are pressing for Puerto Rican independence, set up an encampment near the end of an avenue named for Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos y de Bonilla, an early advocate of this cause.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.The American flag fluttered above the courthouse and its massive parking garage. Just outside a fence and a guard post, the protesters had pitched tents, raised a small Puerto Rico flag and hung banners saying, \u201cThe problem is not the junta, it\u2019s the colony.\u201dMs. S\u00e1nchez said protesters had converged on the spot at 6 p.m. Wednesday, as soon as they heard that Promesa had passed the Senate. She said she was angry, among other things, about a provision to lower the minimum wage here to $4.25 an hour for young workers, and at the government\u2019s announcement about not testing the water supply.\u201cWe\u2019re looking, basically, at the next Flint,\u201d she said, referring to the struggling city in Michigan where high levels of lead have been found in the drinking water. Flint\u2019s deeply troubled finances are controlled by a state-appointed emergency manager, in an arrangement similar to what is expected now for Puerto Rico.As if to embody the emotional churn here, the governor, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, flipped his allegiance on the issue of federal intervention, doing a 180-degree turn at the very last minute. An outspoken opponent of federal oversight, in early June he became the first sitting governor in Puerto Rican history to travel to Cuba, where he attended a Caribbean summit as an observer, spoke with President Ra\u00fal Castro and laid groundwork for a commercial office in Havana.The move stunned policy makers in Washington, who had been pushing the sensitive Promesa package forward for months and expected the governor to join them in the final lobbying offensive on Capitol Hill.This week, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla turned up in Washington, where he dutifully accompanied the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, to lobby for the bill.Although Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla is not running for re-election, his party, the Popular Democrats, has for decades promoted Puerto Rico\u2019s continued status as a United States territory. But no one here uses that term. Here, Puerto Rico is said to be a \u201cfree associated state\u201d of the United States, and the word \u201cterritory\u201d is considered pejorative. \u201cFree associated state\u201d is not defined in the relevant laws and seems to mean whatever anyone wants it to mean.In Washington, lawmakers have said they had power to enact the Promesa under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution, and that renewed the debate here about whether Puerto Rico should be a state, a territory, a sovereign nation \u2014 or just what. Perhaps the most forceful voice in the Senate against the passage of Promesa was Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who has been running for president as a Democrat, who said that the \u201cjunta\u201d would be akin to \u201ca colonial master\u201d for the island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Grim Economic Forecasts, Cubans Fear a Return to Darker Times", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 During the economic turmoil of the early 1990s, power cuts in Havana were so routine that residents called the few hours of daily electricity \u201clightouts.\u201dAddressing members of Parliament last week, Cuba\u2019s economy minister, Marino Murillo, said the country would have to cut fuel consumption by nearly a third during the second half of the year and reduce state investments and imports. His comments, to a closed session, were published on Saturday by the state news media.Cuba\u2019s economy grew by just 1 percent in the first half of the year, compared with 4 percent last year, as export income and fuel supply to the island dropped, said Mr. Murillo.\u201cThis has placed us in a tense economic situation,\u201d he said.Those fears grew last week after Mr. Murillo warned of blackouts and state workers were asked to cut their hours and sharply reduce energy use.\u201cWe all know that it\u2019s Venezuelan oil that keeps the lights on,\u201d said Regina Coyula, a blogger who worked for several years for Cuban state security. \u201cPeople are convinced that if Maduro falls, there will be blackouts here.\u201dPresident Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba acknowledged those fears on Friday but said they were unfounded.\u201cWe don\u2019t deny that there may be ill effects,\u201d he added, \u201cbut we are in better conditions than we were then to face them.\u201dBesides, he said, Cuba has \u201cthis phenomenal social and political capacity to absorb critical changes.\u201dStill, some are perturbed at the prospect of power cuts. None of the Havana residents interviewed over the weekend had experienced power failures in their neighborhoods.In an unusually blunt speech to journalists this month, Karina Marr\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez, a deputy director of Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper in Cuba, warned of the risk of protests like those of August 1994, when hundreds of angry Cubans took to the streets of Havana for several hours.Contradiction is more than just a sign of a changing Cuba \u2014 it is a fundamental characteristic of it.Herbert Delgado-Rodr\u00edguez, 29, an art student, remembered his mother cooking with charcoal in the 1990s.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will get to the point where there will be protests in the street,\u201d he said. However, he added, Cubans \u201cwon\u2019t tolerate the extreme hardships we faced in the \u201990s.\u201dOne worker at a bank said employees had been told to use air-conditioning for two hours each day and work a half-day. Fuel for office cars had been cut by half, she said. A university professor said she had been given a fan for her office and told to work at home when possible.Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1les, who owns a small cafeteria in downtown Havana, was more sanguine.\u201cRa\u00fal is simply urging us to cut back on unnecessary consumption, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said, adding that talk of another special period was \u201cjust a lot of speculation.\u201dNot all offices or companies have been affected, and Mr. Murillo said the idea was to ration energy in some users so that others \u2014 homes, tourist facilities and companies \u2014 could use as much as they need.In all, he said, the government aimed to cut electricity usage by 6 percent and fuel by 28 percent in the second half of the year.Under an agreement signed in 2000, Venezuela supplies Cuba with about 80,000 barrels of oil per day, a deal worth about $1.3 billion, said Jorge Pi\u00f1on, an energy expert at the University of Texas. In return, Cuba sends thousands of medical and other specialists to Venezuela.On Friday, Mr. Castro said there had been a \u201ccertain contraction\u201d of that oil supply.Cuba\u2019s energy problems may also be a product of growing demand on the electricity grid, he said. Electricity consumption has risen significantly over the past 10 years as Cubans who receive remittances from abroad kept air-conditioners whirring and private restaurants, bars and bed-and-breakfasts added refrigerators and heated food in toaster ovens.If Venezuela did halt oil exports to Cuba, it would not necessarily precipitate a political crisis, experts and bloggers said.The United States may offer help in order to prevent instability or a mass exodus of desperate Cubans. The Cuban government might speed reforms and open the door wider to foreign investment, Mr. Entwistle said.\u201cTo extrapolate some dire political consequence is unwise,\u201d said Mr. Entwistle, adding, \u201cThere are so many levers that they have to push and pull.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen contributed reporting from Havana.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Trade and Workers", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported byOf course, that\u2019s what they all say. But Trumponomics goes beyond the usual Republican assertions that cutting taxes on corporations and the rich, ending environmental regulation and so on will conjure up the magic of the marketplace and make everyone prosper. It also involves posing as a populist, claiming that getting tough on foreigners and ripping up our trade agreements will bring back the well-paying jobs America has lost.But America is a big place, and total employment exceeds 140 million. Shifting two million workers back into manufacturing would raise that sector\u2019s share of employment back from around 10 percent to around 11.5 percent. To get some perspective: in 1979, on the eve of the great surge in inequality, manufacturing accounted for more than 20 percent of employment. In the 1960s it was more than 25 percent. I\u2019m not sure when, exactly, Mr. Trump thinks America was great, but Trumponomics wouldn\u2019t come close to bringing the old days back.In any case, falling manufacturing employment is only one factor in the decline of the middle class. As Mr. Mishel says, there have been \u201cmany other intentional policies\u201d driving wages down even as top incomes soar: union-bashing, the failure to raise the minimum wage with inflation, austerity, financial deregulation, the tax-cut obsession.And Mr. Trump buys fully into the ideology that has driven these wage-destroying policies.As Mr. Mishel wrote, \u201cif is he so keen to help working people, why does he then steer the discussion back toward the traditional corporate agenda of tax cuts for corporations and the rich?\u201d I think we know the answer.But never mind Mr. Trump\u2019s motivations.

{"Headline": "What You Think You Know About Money, but Don\u2019t, Can Hurt You", "Date": "2016-07-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesAmericans have grown more confident about their financial acumen since the market meltdown that ended in 2009. Yet they seem to know less about the subject than they did then.And most people didn\u2019t even know much about it in 2009.In fact, they suggest that misplaced self-confidence is putting millions of people at risk. They are vulnerable to major missteps \u2014 and to exploitation by industry pros who may not have their best interests at heart.Five of the questions have been on the quiz for years, making statistical comparisons possible. The trend is not encouraging. Only 37 percent of the people who took the quiz were able to get four of these five questions right in 2015. That compares with 39 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2009.The worst performance was on a question about how bond prices respond to rising interest rates. Only 28 percent of people in 2015 got that one right.This isn\u2019t just academic. It\u2019s the core explanation for why bond mutual funds, on average, returned 2.6 percent in the second quarter of this year, a very handsome performance and one that was better than that of stock mutual funds, which gained 2.2 percent, according to Morningstar. Falling interest rates drove bond prices higher.What\u2019s more, it\u2019s critical to understanding the effects of one of the more important and puzzling phenomena of current markets: the proliferation of negative interest rates. The rate-bond seesaw is why negative interest rates \u2014 which have been spreading as central banks seek to stimulate a still sluggish global economy \u2014 can produce positive returns, when rates are still dropping further. Should you buy a bond with negative interest rates? Certainly not if you don\u2019t understand bond basics.The new question in the quiz focuses on a problem that lands many people in trouble when they pay only the minimum amount each month on their credit card balances: compound interest.\u201cSuppose you owe $1,000 on a loan and the interest rate you are charged is 20 percent per year compounded annually,\u201d the quiz asks. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t pay anything off, at this interest rate, how many years would it take for the amount you owe to double?\u201dThe correct answer is two to four years (actually, it is about 3.6 years, but it\u2019s a multiple-choice quiz). Most people thought it took much longer than that, grossly underestimating the impact of interest charges. As the study points out, this lack of knowledge hurts now and could become lethal: When interest rates rise, if you ignore compound interest, you can drown in debt.An alarming aspect of the study is that although most people knew very little, they felt great about what they knew \u2014 or thought they knew. \u201cAmericans tend to have positively biased self-perceptions of their financial knowledge,\u201d the study said. And the positive bias has been increasing.The study found that 76 percent gave themselves a \u201cvery high\u201d rating on financial knowledge in 2015, compared with 73 percent in 2012 and 67 percent in 2009. And while 81 percent of Americans rated their own financial behavior positively, the study found a \u201cpotential disconnect between perceptions and actions in day-to-day financial matters.\u201dLarge numbers of people, for example, said they were running up late fees and interest payments on credit cards, overdrawing bank accounts and borrowing money from costly nonbank sources.The good news is that many households are in better financial shape than they were in 2009 \u2014 but then, they ought to be, because financial conditions are much better. In 2009, the prices of homes and most other assets had fallen sharply, foreclosures were rife and unemployment was soaring. People had been taking financial risks, and they paid for it. In that period, as an example, only 24 percent of home buyers paid more than than 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment. By 2015, people were behaving more conservatively: a third managed to make that big a down payment. And in 2015, fewer people were having trouble paying their bills and more people said they were comfortable with their financial condition.Still, the survey found that significant hardships continued, \u201cLarge segments of society continue to face financial difficulties, particularly minority populations and those without a college education.\u201dMost Americans are still worried that they won\u2019t have enough money to retire, but only 39 percent have ever tried to figure out how much they will need. When financial conditions worsen \u2014 and whenever the next recession hits, they certainly will \u2014 indicators of financial well-being will certainly decline. But unless the state of financial literacy improves radically by then, vast numbers of people won\u2019t be equipped to deal with these problems.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hershey Rejects Mondelez\u2019s $23 Billion Takeover Offer", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byFor more than a century, Hershey \u2014 an American candy icon so well known it gave its name to its Pennsylvania hometown \u2014 has stood independent, rebuffing numerous attempts to buy the maker of Kisses and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.Now, it faces one of its biggest challenges yet, in the form of a fellow chocolate giant eager to strike a big takeover deal.In rebuffing a $23 billion offer from Mondelez International, whose own products run from Oreo cookies to Cadbury chocolate, Hershey is betting that it can stay on its own, or at least fetch a substantially higher price.But flatly rejecting Mondelez\u2019s offer will be a major test of Hershey\u2019s historically impregnable defense: the charitable trust that effectively wields control.The offer, made in a letter on June 23 after months of on-and-off discussions between the two companies, would make a blockbuster merger in a year that has been sorely lacking in hugely prominent deals. Moreover, it is a bold move by Mondelez at a time when other would-be deal makers have grown more cautious in the face of uncertain winds in the marketplace and the economy.Mondelez\u2019s move has also raised questions about whether other food companies will seek to make their own run at Hershey \u2014 or whether Mondelez itself may be put into play. After the activist investor William A. Ackman took a big stake in Mondelez nearly a year ago, speculation emerged that he would push for a sale, possibly to Kraft Heinz.Mondelez, cleaved from what once was Kraft, has offered $107 a share in cash and stock, a 10 percent premium to Hershey\u2019s closing stock price on Wednesday. Hershey, however, said on Thursday that its board had \u201crejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company.\u201dMondelez declined to comment.Hershey would represent the biggest takeover by Mondelez since its former parent bought Cadbury of Britain in a $19 billion deal more than six years ago. That transaction, too, took time, and Cadbury initially rebuffed the American food behemoth\u2019s advances.Pursuing Hershey is a different matter. A trust holds about 8.4 percent of the candy maker\u2019s shares, but has about 81 percent of the company\u2019s voting power. The shares of the company \u2014 both the common and the special Class B shares \u2014 are owned by the Milton Hershey School Trust, but are voted on by the Hershey Trust. The Milton Hershey School was founded in 1909 for underprivileged children by the company\u2019s founder and his wife.The trust has flexed its muscle several times over in the last two decades. When the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company wanted to buy Hershey at a 42 percent premium in 2002, the trust called off the sale at the last minute.When the trust became unhappy with Hershey\u2019s performance and deal talks with Cadbury in 2007, it asked for the resignation of six directors.And when Hershey wanted to challenge Kraft for Cadbury in 2010, a rift between the company and the trust forced the Pennsylvania chocolatier to bow out.The trust has already retained advisers separate from the Hershey Company itself as it weighs its own options.To make matters even more complicated, Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, who oversees charitable trusts in the state, has raised concerns over the Hershey trust\u2019s administration of its funds and called for an overhaul of its board. Any turnover could alter the dynamics of the percolating takeover contest.Mondelez has been mindful of winning over the trust. In its letter last week, it promised to maintain jobs and relocate the combined company\u2019s chocolate operations to Hershey, Pa. Mondelez even offered to erase its name \u2014 reportedly born from a Kraft employee\u2019s contribution to a rebranding effort \u2014 in favor of the better-recognized Hershey name.Putting the two together would yield a powerful force in the business of sweets. Mondelez, which was spun off from Kraft in 2012, is the world\u2019s second-largest confectionery company \u2014 but it has very little business in the United States. Hershey, on the other hand, has more than four-fifths of its sales in North America.\u201cIt\u2019s a surprising move, but it does make sense for Mondelez,\u201d said Jack Skelly, a food analyst with Euromonitor.Additionally, Hershey owns the rights to make and market Cadbury chocolate \u2014 but not other candies \u2014 in America, and it took legal action to stop imports of Cadbury chocolates made abroad.(At the same time, Hershey manufactures KitKat bars, one of the most popular brands around, under a license from Nestl\u00e9. Should Mondelez prevail, it is unclear whether that agreement would change.)Both companies have improved profitability in the last several years and moved into sexier corners of the food business. Hershey, for instance, bought Krave and got into the increasingly popular jerky business.Mondelez bought Enjoy Life Foods, testing the market for gluten-free products. But the company has come under pressure from activist investors in recent years, including the billionaire Nelson Peltz, as well as Mr. Ackman.Rising cocoa prices have made the chocolate business less profitable, and it\u2019s hard to raise sales of chocolate in the United States, the world\u2019s largest consumer of chocolate.\u201cAlso, it\u2019s difficult to generate sales because people are starting to think of chocolate as an unhealthy product,\u201d noted Mr. Skelly of Euromonitor.Mars, which is privately held, is the world\u2019s largest confectionery company, followed by Mondelez. The others in the top five are Nestl\u00e9, the Ferrero Group and Hershey.As of Wednesday\u2019s close, before word of Mondelez\u2019s bid emerged, Hershey\u2019s market value was about $21 billion, while Mondelez\u2019s stood at $69 billion.Shares of Hershey climbed over 16 percent, to $113.49. Shares of Mondelez rose nearly 6 percent, to $45.51.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Soccer Teams Brace for the Impact of \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-05", "News": "Supported byThe full consequences of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union will take years to sort out, but sports teams are starting to prepare for a potentially rocky transition that could make it harder for them to acquire international players from elsewhere on the continent and potentially raise the cost of signing them.In the worst case, if the free passage of citizens between European Union nations is curtailed, British soccer, rugby and cricket teams will have difficulty acquiring athletes from the other 27 European Union countries, particularly younger players that many teams recruit to their academies and youth teams. This could provide an opening for British athletes who have not been able to win roster spots, but it could also dilute the international appeal of England\u2019s Premier League.\u201cThe Premier League is the biggest and most successful soccer league in the world, and the reason for that is the entertainment value,\u201d said Gary Mellor, the managing director of Beswicks, a British sports management firm. \u201cIt\u2019s probably more competitive than other leagues, but at the same time, you have a fairly decent standard of players. But if it moves back to being primarily British in player makeup, it will lose some of its appeal to a worldwide audience. That will impact television deals and sponsorships.\u201dInterest from wealthy foreigners wanting to buy British teams could also sag if the British economy slows, or if the quality of play suffers. A steep decline in the value of the pound might make it cheaper to buy teams, but it could also hurt the value of the clubs.\u201cThere would be discount for going into the E.P.L., but then, theoretically, profits and revenues are devalued, too,\u201d said Rob Tilliss, who founded Inner Circle Sports, a sports advisory firm. \u201cBut the product is so good now that they\u2019ll figure out how to make it work.\u201dDespite the potential for turmoil, little may happen in the coming season because Britain has not yet formally applied to leave the European Union, and it will have two years to work out the details of its exit once an application is filed. Some British politicians already have suggested that they might seek a more limited departure from the European Union.The Premier League and other sports associations, as well as broadcasters and others with a vested interest in British sports, might also lobby for exemptions so that the current visa-free passage between Britain and the European Union \u2014 which supporters of Britain\u2019s exit opposed \u2014 could continue for athletes.\u201cThey are a very powerful league, and they have lots of supporters in high places,\u201d said John Williams, the director of the Center for the Sociology of Sport at the University of Leicester.Williams expects exemptions to be made for athletes and other workers with unique skills.\u201cThey speak the same language as the global TV partners, and they want to project themselves as global partners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me the Premier League is bombproof.\u201dRules, of course, can be changed: Norway and Switzerland adjusted their work-permit rules to gain access to the European common market. But given the anti-European rhetoric in Britain and the ambition of the Football Association, soccer\u2019s governing body in England, to promote more English players, it is unclear what compromises can be made.Those rules were intended to help English players by making it harder for European Union players who are 18 or younger to join British clubs. The regulations also require even established players to appear in up to 75 percent of their home country\u2019s national team games, with a sliding scale based on FIFA world rankings. The rules were largely toothless when they were enacted because, according to the European Union charter, no member nation can discriminate on the basis of national origin.But if Britain leaves the European Union, its citizens will give up the right to move freely within the union and vice versa, giving the stiffer permit rules a real bite.Clubs would also be prohibited from importing European Union players 18 and under, who were previously considered \u201chomegrown\u201d because of a FIFA exemption allowing 16- to 18-year-olds to play professionally for European clubs. That exemption would also vanish if Britain left the European Union.There are now more than 70 such players ages 16 to 18 from the European Union, not including Britain, with Premier League youth teams, an important (and inexpensive) pipeline for talent. If those British work-permit rules had been in place years ago \u2014 or if the FIFA exemption had not \u2014 the Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo would probably never have suited up for Manchester United when he was 18.\u201cThere could be a major systemic issue if the E.U. rules for 16- to 18-year-olds go away,\u201d said Steven Gans, who specializes in corporate and sports law at Prince Lobel. \u201cYou could see a problem over time, though I don\u2019t see anything happening immediately.\u201dSome of the most powerful English teams \u2014 notably Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United \u2014 have a significant number of international players who would not be eligible for work permits to play in England. Chelsea has 19 players from the European Union, of which 13 appear unqualified under a strict interpretation of the rules; Liverpool has 17 players, only four of whom would earn a permit.Some of the affected players are boldface names: Manchester United\u2019s Anthony Martial and David de Gea, Chelsea\u2019s Branislav Ivanovic, and Liverpool\u2019s Mario Balotelli are among an estimated 135 first-team players in the Premier League who might not meet the new standards if they went into effect today.This shift could lead to more slots for homegrown English talent, something the Football Association contends would strengthen England\u2019s national team. But the top clubs are global brands, in part, because of their many international stars, so any decline in their ability to attract top players could affect their team values.This may distort the economics of signing players. Premier League teams could aggressively bid for international players now, before the stricter visa requirements went into effect. At the same time, talented British players could command higher premiums at home as British clubs, less free to shop in Europe, competed with one another for top talent, overheating an already frothy market.\u201cI think the clubs will clearly want to keep a totally free market,\u201d Greg Dyke, the Football Association\u2019s chairman, said after the vote. \u201cWhether that is possible, we won\u2019t know for probably two years.\u201dRugby and cricket could also be affected. British rugby teams employ many players from South Africa and the Pacific islands under a European Court of Justice ruling known as the Kolpak decision. Players from these countries do not count against the cap of two foreign players per team. The current Rugby Union champions, London Saracens, have 14 players, including the American wing Chris Wyles, who could be affected. In county cricket, only 6 percent of players fall under the Kolpak rule, but it is enough to concern the England and Wales Cricket Board.Rugby and cricket, though, are not nearly as popular or as powerful as soccer, which is why experts predicted that in the end, Britain would ultimately tinker as little as possible with its national sport.\u201cI am virtually certain that because of the E.P.L.\u2019s market power, there will be all sorts of exceptions negotiated,\u201d said Andrei S. Markovits, who has written widely on politics and sports at the University of Michigan. \u201cNext to the Beatles and Rolling Stones, the E.P.L. is the most successful English cultural export.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China Stealing Jobs? It May Be Losing Them, Instead", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump has claimed that China is stealing American manufacturing jobs.In today\u2019s China, however, workers face a more troubled outlook than Mr. Trump suggests. They are losing their jobs because of a slowing domestic economy, rising costs and stiffer foreign competition \u2014 including from the United States.Presidential candidates \u201care screaming about yesterday\u2019s problems,\u201d said Jim McGregor, chairman of the consulting firm APCO Worldwide\u2019s Greater China operations. \u201cManufacturing for export is getting harder and harder\u201d in China.China\u2019s labor market has changed sharply in recent years.As its economy has expanded, creating opportunities in many sectors, assembly line jobs are not as attractive as they once were. That has caused managers to raise wages to attract workers. At the same time, local governments in Shenzhen, a coastal trading hub that abuts Hong Kong, and other industrial centers have steadily increased the mandated minimum wage to improve the welfare of working families and pressure companies to produce more expensive, high-value products.That combination has pushed wages for Chinese factory workers higher. Their monthly pay now averages $424, 29 percent more than just three years ago, the Japan External Trade Organization has estimated. Labor costs in China are now significantly higher than in many other emerging economies. Factory workers in Vietnam earn less than half the salary of a Chinese worker, while those in Bangladesh get paid under a quarter as much.Rising costs have also significantly altered China\u2019s competitive position compared with the United States.In a 2015 study, the Boston Consulting Group said the costs of manufacturing in China\u2019s major export-producing zone were now almost the same as in the United States, after taking into account wages, worker productivity, energy costs and other factors.\u201cIt just makes economic sense,\u201d said Hal Sirkin, a senior partner at BCG. \u201cThe U.S. right now is in a very favorable position.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.That means more jobs for American factory workers. Half of the respondents in the BCG survey said they expected the number of manufacturing workers they employed in the United States to increase over the next five years.Many of the factories moving away make the products often found on the shelves of American retailers.Stella International, a footwear manufacturer headquartered in Hong Kong that makes shoes for Michael Kors, Rockport and other major brands, closed one of its factories in China in February and shifted some of that production to plants in Vietnam and Indonesia. TAL, another Hong Kong-based manufacturer that makes clothing for American brands including Dockers and Brooks Brothers, plans to close one of its Chinese factories this year and move that work to new facilities in Vietnam and Ethiopia.Other companies with an extensive presence in China may not be closing factories, but are targeting new investments elsewhere.Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, best known for making Apple iPhones in Chinese factories, is planning to build as many as 12 new assembly plants in India, creating around one million new jobs there. A pilot operation in the western Indian state of Maharashtra will start churning out mobile phones later this year.\u201cIt\u2019s not like China is an attractive location for all low-cost jobs,\u201d said James Zimmerman, the American Chamber\u2019s chairman in Beijing. \u201cChina is moving up the value chain, which will mean an adjustment.\u201dChinese workers are also facing job losses because of the country\u2019s stumbling economy.Some economists, however, believe the employment situation is not as rosy as official statistics suggest. A June report from Fathom Consulting, based in London, estimates that unemployment and underemployment in China will reach 12.9 percent this year \u2014 triple the level in 2012.Leland Miller, the chief executive of China Beige Book International, a research firm, says the job market hit a critical inflection point late last year, as the weakening economy finally started to bite. His figures show hiring began to plunge in the fourth quarter of 2015, and though the situation stabilized in recent months, probably because of greater government stimulus, Mr. Miller believes the improvement is not sustainable.Factory workers in China, already suffering, may face even tougher times ahead.Many industrial companies are burdened by excess capacity, and downsizing may be unavoidable. In February, China\u2019s minister for human resources and social security estimated that 1.8 million workers could lose their jobs in the steel and coal sectors alone.\u201cIf anyone is claiming that China is still enjoying a healthy or robust jobs market,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cthey have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In central Harare, scores of police officers in riot gear were guarding Africa Unity Square, a popular gathering place, and other strategic spots. But much of the business district remained deserted, with most stores and banks choosing to close for the day.On Wednesday, many civil servants, who have not been paid their June salaries, reported to work after being threatened with dismissal. But most public school teachers and government health care workers, who began striking a day earlier, did not show up for work.Police officers, members of the military and prison workers are the only government employees who have collected their June salaries. But in an indication of the government\u2019s strained finances, they received their paychecks two weeks late.Mr. Mugabe and his highest-ranking officials met on Wednesday to discuss a response, though some officials played down the protest\u2019s significance in public comments or on social media.Still, access to social media like WhatsApp and Twitter was cut off for several hours on Wednesday morning. The government agency that oversees the country\u2019s cellphone providers issued a warning against what it described as \u201cgross irresponsible use of social media and telecommunication services.\u201dWhile not addressing the disruption in service on Wednesday, the agency said that those using social media to spread \u201csubversive\u201d messages would be disconnected and arrested.Supa Mandiwanzira, the minister for information, communication, and technology and courier services, denied that the government had interfered with the social media platforms.\u201cWe cannot shut down social media in complicity with those calling for the shutdown of the country,\u201d Mr. Mandiwanzira said in an interview.Leaders of the protest, including members of civil society organizations and business groups, have used social media to organize.Linda Masarira, the leader of the Zimbabwe Activist Alliance, an umbrella group that recently occupied Africa Unity Square in central Harare for several days and helped organize Wednesday\u2019s protest, said: \u201cWhat is happening now shows clearly that people here are tired of Mugabe\u2019s rule, and that is why they heeded calls to stay away from work. That is why you see market stalls across the city here virtually empty.\u201dViolent protests took place near Zimbabwe\u2019s border with South Africa after Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government issued restrictions on the import of certain foreign goods in a bid to stimulate the domestic economy. The move angered traders and many Zimbabweans living in South Africa who ship food and other goods to relatives back home.Other protesters have targeted one of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s vice presidents, Phelekezela Mphoko, for staying at a luxury hotel for more than a year at a cost of more than $1 million. Mr. Mphoko has refused to move into a government-appointed residence because, according to the local news media, it is not to his taste.Government officials described the protesters on Wednesday as criminals and said they were backed by opposition parties.Opposition parties, and even some of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s former allies, have expressed support or sympathy for the protesters, who do not appear to have political links.Christopher Mutsvangwa, chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, who was dismissed as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s minister of war veterans in March, said he understood the protesters\u2019 motivation.\u201cPeople are frustrated and angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see no prospect for prosperity.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.

{"Headline": "Emerging Markets, Even in Turmoil, Have a Place in a Portfolio", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byOver the last five years, investors in emerging-markets mutual funds have paid plenty and gotten little in return.Emerging-markets funds lost an annualized average of 3.19 percent over the last five years, Morningstar said. Yet they are far more expensive, on average, than actively managed domestic large-cap funds, which returned about 10 percent a year annualized for the same period. Expense ratios for actively managed emerging-market funds were 1.55 percent, compared with 1.15 percent for domestic large-caps.Investors have responded by fleeing emerging markets; money is churning out of the sector\u2019s funds and E.T.F.s. Total net outflows hit a new high in 2015, when nearly $75 billion exited, according to EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass. Through June this year, $7 billion more has been withdrawn.The exodus is understandable, given both the returns and the worrisome headlines streaming in from around the globe. Just last month, the British referendum to leave the European Union roiled markets worldwide. MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Index fell as much as the British-focused FTSE 100 in the days just after the ballots were counted. The vote was an additional bedevilment for emerging markets already made skittish by slower growth in China \u2014 some commentators fret about a real estate bubble and banking crisis there \u2014 and a political crisis in Brazil. On top of that, low prices for commodities, especially oil, sapped stock markets in places dependent on natural resources, like Russia, South America and the Middle East.The turmoil is a turnabout from just a few years ago. Then the acronym \u201cBRIC\u201d \u2014 for Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 was bandied about in investment circles as shorthand for the rise of a brash new bunch of economic powers. Lately, BRIC has become a four-letter epithet.The reaction of emerging markets to the British vote has also underscored a new reality for investors: Emerging markets no longer provide the diversification benefit they once did, said Roger A. Aliaga-D\u00edaz, senior economist with Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cCorrelations have increased since the 2000s between emerging markets and developed ones,\u201d Mr. Aliaga-D\u00edaz said.During the surge of the 2000s, one of the attractions of emerging markets was that they tended to zig when the developed world zagged. They could buffer the ups and downs of developed markets in a diversified portfolio. To a greater extent these days, developing and developed markets have tended to move together.Portfolio managers of emerging-markets funds say today\u2019s worries, like yesterday\u2019s euphoria, may be exaggerated.Even so, many emerging countries remain healthier than developed ones, with higher growth rates and lower debt levels, she said. And many of them have young, growing populations striving to join the world\u2019s middle class.That slowdown has caused worldwide commodity prices to sag. When China was investing heavily in infrastructure and industrialization, commodity producers thrived; now they\u2019re pinched.The emerging-markets sector is split by the debate over active management versus indexing just as every sector is.For the most part, the higher costs for active management haven\u2019t translated into better performance, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. Based on trailing returns, two-thirds of emerging markets funds underperformed S.&P.\u2019s emerging-markets index over the one, three and five years ending in December 2015, he said. \u201cOn the positive side, that means one out of three did outperform,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s some value to active management, but the cheaper your actively managed fund can be, the better,\u201d he said.Costs aside, Patricia Oey, a senior analyst for Morningstar, said that active funds aren\u2019t locked into the country allocations required by index funds. Both the Vanguard and iShares funds, for example, allocate about a quarter of their assets to Chinese stocks. That amount could grow in coming years, because China\u2019s domestic A-share market is opening to foreign investors, she said. Given the heft of China\u2019s economy \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest, after the United States \u2014 index providers might opt to include more Chinese companies.A way in which some emerging-markets managers avoid overexposure to any particular country is by also investing in developed-world multinationals that sell into the emerging world.\u201cIn my view, those aren\u2019t run for shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re run for the state,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather invest in an A. O. Smith, a U.S. company that makes water heaters. About a third of their revenue is from emerging markets, particularly India and China.\u201dJust as portfolio managers damp risk by diversifying, individual investors can do the same with their personal portfolios. Ms. Oey of Morningstar said holding 10 percent of a stock portfolio, mirroring the proportion of emerging markets in the world\u2019s stock market capitalization, would make sense for a long-term investor. A person with 60 percent of her money in stocks would then put 6 percent in emerging markets.Whatever else investors do, they should guard against the tendency to dump their holdings based on recent discouraging news or weak returns, Professor Harvey said. \u201cThe biggest mistake retail investors make is selling stocks if they go down and buying the ones that have gone up,\u201d he said.\u201cThis holds true for asset classes, too,\u201d he added. \u201cJust because emerging-markets equity has had low returns recently does not mean you should sell. One-third of world G.D.P. is being driven by emerging-market economies, and it makes sense that a globally diversified portfolio should have exposure to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He plays snooker and drinks pints at the Working Men\u2019s Club across the road from his red brick rowhouse, and at every election that he can remember, he has voted, like his father before him, for the Labour Party.The governing Conservative Party, which last won a parliamentary election in Wigan in 1910, is \u201cfor rich sods and second raters on the make,\u201d he explained.On June 23, however, Mr. Hewlett broke with the habits of a lifetime and bucked the Labour Party line. Ignoring its stand that the European Union is good for Britain, he voted to bolt from the European bloc, along with 64 percent of the population in a town that, according to Will Patterson, a local Green Party activist, would normally \u201cvote for a cow if Labour put one up for election.\u201dThe overwhelming vote here in favor of \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 much higher than the 52 percent who voted to leave nationwide \u2014 delivered a stinging rebuke not only to the Labour Party leadership in London but also to the party\u2019s local politicians. They hold 65 of the 75 seats on the Borough Council and campaigned, albeit with little zeal, for the Remain camp.The Conservative Party, whose leader, Prime Minister David Cameron, also campaigned for Britain to stay in Europe, got kicked in the teeth, too, as did President Obama and legions of other prominent figures in Britain and abroad who urged voters like Mr. Hewlett not to rock the boat.But rocking the boat, no matter what the risks, was precisely what he and millions of other Britons \u2014 who, regardless of their real economic situation, see themselves as members of a downtrodden \u201cworking class\u201d \u2014 wanted to do. To them, it was a last, desperate effort to restore a lost world of secure jobs and communities that was far harsher in reality than it is in recollection.Their votes were stark evidence of how working-class resentments, driven by feelings of being ignored and left unmoored in a rapidly changing world, are feeding nationalism and other efforts to reclaim a sense of identity, upending ideological assumptions and straining ties to political parties and other institutions.This disconnect between the jobs people hold and their class allegiance is a phenomenon that the researchers called \u201cworking class of the mind.\u201d It helps explain that while only a small minority of Britons share the real insecurity and poverty of workers like Mr. Hewlett, many others feel they are getting a raw deal \u2014 and want to stick it to those in power, whether in Brussels or London.\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot will change. But we have to give it a chance,\u201d said Mr. Hewlett, 61, sitting next to his wife, who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in a cluttered front room, its faded walls plastered with photographs of their six children and 14 grandchildren. Life, he said, has \u201cgone to the dogs,\u201d and meddling from outside is to blame. \u201cI don\u2019t like people telling us what to do from miles away.\u201dIn just three years, Mr. Hewlett explained, his take-home pay had crashed from more than $665 a week to just $318. Worse, he added, is that his previously secure full-time employment contract has morphed into a \u201czero hours contract,\u201d under which his employer decides how much he works and how much it pays him depending on what it needs on any particular day.\u201cIt is basically slave labor,\u201d Mr. Hewlett said. He complained that an influx of eager workers from poorer, formerly communist parts of the European Union meant that employers now had no incentive to offer a fixed contract or more than the minimum wage for menial work.The real number of immigrants living and working in Wigan is tiny, with only 2.9 percent of the population born outside Britain, compared with a nationwide figure of 11.5 percent, the Office of National Statistics says. Only 1.7 percent of those living in Wigan were born in European Union countries other than Britain. The unemployment rate, the local council says, is only 5 percent, slightly below the national level and half the rate in European countries that use the euro.But this has not stopped even some of Wigan\u2019s immigrants from complaining about there being too many foreigners, particularly Poles, in the area.Abdul Rao, a longtime immigrant from Pakistan with three children born in Wigan, said he had voted for Brexit because he did not want new immigrants spoiling his children\u2019s job prospects.Justyna Kolenda, a Polish immigrant who works in a clothing store, complained that too many Poles and other newcomers did not speak English and mixed only with one another. \u201cThere should be more controls,\u201d she said, strolling with her English boyfriend down a pretty shopping street bedecked with British flags in memory of the bloody 1916 Battle of the Somme.Free-market advocates hail so-called labor flexibility, ensured by zero hour contracts and other devices, as one of the main reasons for Britain\u2019s robust economy compared with the sluggish or shrinking economies of the Continent. Yet, for workers like Mr. Hewlett, who has no special skills and is not in a position to acquire any, this flexibility is a curse \u2014 and one of the reasons that poorer, less-educated Britons voted heavily to quit the European Union.That the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels played no role in shaping Britain\u2019s labor market \u2014 that was done by elected policy makers in London as Britain fought to retain its competitiveness amid the pressures of globalization \u2014 did nothing to dent a widespread view here in Wigan: that leaving the European Union might somehow jolt the country onto another track, preferably one that recovers the lost security and sense of belonging of the past.Mr. Patterson, the Green Party activist, recalled how he had struggled in vain during the referendum campaign to convince Wigan voters that their interests were aligned with those of \u201cworkers in Stuttgart and Gdansk,\u201d and that they needed to make common cause with them against right-wing governments across Europe pushing austerity and pro-business labor policies.When he put this argument forward at a debate in Wigan, he recalled, a woman jumped to her feet and shouted: \u201cI am not interested in Stuttgart. I am only interested in Wigan.\u201dBritain\u2019s feeling of remoteness from Europe is often attributed to its self-image as what Shakespeare called \u201cthis sceptered isle.\u201d But the country is not just one island \u2014 or two when Northern Ireland is included \u2014 but a host of largely self-contained islets, each with its own history, its own accent and its own proud sense of splendid isolation.\u201cWigan is a very insular society. When the chips are down, the population here is very loyal to itself,\u201d said David Molyneux, the Labour Party\u2019s deputy leader of the Borough Council. After years of deep cuts in funding from London, which has slashed the local budget by 40 percent since 2010, Wigan voted not so much to grab decision-making power back from Brussels, but from London.Yet, in many ways, Britain\u2019s referendum result was less a revolt against the European Union than against political and economic forces that are blurring not only boundaries between countries but also smaller, narrower frontiers that once clearly defined who was and was not \u201clocal,\u201d and who belongs where in that most enduring feature of British life, the class hierarchy.Mark Bradley, the leader of the Wigan branch of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, the driving force behind the Brexit campaign, complained that the area\u2019s Labour Party member of Parliament, Lisa Nandy, was out of touch with her constituents and their desire to leave Europe because she \u201cis not even from Wigan.\u201d She grew up in Bury, a town barely 15 miles away.\u201cShe is definitely not local,\u201d Mr. Bradley said.When Orwell visited Wigan, however, the working class existed as a clear socioeconomic category defined by backbreaking work for near-starvation wages in coal mines and factories. Today, the mines and cotton mills are all gone, extinguished by forces set in motion long before Britain joined the European Economic Community, the predecessor to the European Union, in 1973, or reaffirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum.Mr. Molyneux, the deputy council chief, said the area had changed markedly for the better since 1975, with large areas of slums and derelict factories cleared away. But, he added, \u201cmemories are clouded of what life was really like,\u201d and many people hark back to a lost, albeit mostly imaginary, era of secure, tightknit communities built around coal mines and manufacturing.Mr. Bradley, of UKIP, lamented the decline of locally owned pubs, shops and other businesses in the face of competition from corporate chains. \u201cThere is a longing for a better time,\u201d he said.Like a phantom limb, the lost era still twitches, with fading, rose-tinted memories kept alive in places like the Leigh Miners Welfare Institute, a bar and social club on the edge of the borough.Taking a break from a game of bowls on the club\u2019s manicured bowling green, Raymond Gorton, an 81-year-old former coal miner, showed off a mangled finger smashed by a mine accident in the 1950s and recalled how he had almost been killed in a 1965 accident that shattered his neck. All the same, he had fond memories of the camaraderie of a lost world that revolved around the pit.Forced to give up mining decades ago because of his injuries, Mr. Gorton said he still wakes each morning at 5, a routine left from his time on the early shift at the Wood End Pit. \u201cIt is very hard to break old habits,\u201d he said.He, too, voted to leave the European Union, not because it had interfered with his life in any concrete way but because he did not like the idea of \u201ctaking orders from outsiders.\u201d He had also been impressed by the claim \u2014 entirely false \u2014 put forward by Brexit campaigners that leaving would save Britain 350 million pounds a week that could be better spent on the National Health Service.He volunteered that he did not mind immigrants, noting that he got on well with two Polish families living on his street, but nonetheless thought that \u201cwe need to start thinking more about our own people.\u201dClinching the argument for Brexit was the memory of his father, who he said had served with the Royal Air Force and been killed by the Germans in 1940. Britain, he said, should not be part of a European bloc dominated by Germany.But it is not just German power that bothers him. He is more uneasy over a local imbalance of power that has left his own hometown, Leigh, controlled by the Borough Council in Wigan after the merging of several districts in 1974. That amalgamation, which had nothing to do with Brussels, has left many in Leigh resentful of Wigan, which is only five miles away but which they see as an alien and bullying force.\u201cWe feel pushed around,\u201d Mr. Gorton said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a Polish immigrant who works in a Wigan clothing store. She is Justyna Kolenda, not Justyana.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Remote Pacific Nation, Threatened by Rising Seas", "Date": "2016-07-02", "News": "Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of the people of tiny Kiribati, and even the island nation\u2019s existence. The government is making plans for the island\u2019s demise.Supported byTARAWA, Kiribati \u2014 One clear bright day last winter, a tidal surge swept over an ocean embankment here in the remote, low-lying island country of Kiribati, smashing through the doors and windows of Betio Hospital and spewing sand and debris across its maternity ward.Beero Hosea, 37, a handyman, cut the power and helped carry frightened mothers through the rubble and water to a nearby school.\u201cIf the next one is combined with a storm and stronger winds, that\u2019s the end of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cover this whole island.\u201dFor years, scientists have been predicting that much of Kiribati may become uninhabitable within decades because of an onslaught of environmental problems linked to climate change. And for just as long, many here have paid little heed. But while scientists are reluctant to attribute any specific weather or tidal event to rising sea levels, the tidal surge last winter, known as a king tide, was a chilling wake-up call.\u201cIt shocked us,\u201d said Tean Rube, a pastor with the Kiribati Uniting Church. \u201cWe realized, O.K., maybe climate change is real.\u201dEven before that, scientists and development experts say, rising sea levels are likely to worsen erosion, create groundwater shortages and increase the intrusion of salt water into freshwater supplies.In response, Kiribati (pronounced KEE-ree-bas in the local language) has essentially been drawing up plans for its demise. The government has promoted \u201cmigration with dignity,\u201d urging residents to consider moving abroad with employable skills. It bought nearly 6,000 acres in Fiji, an island nation more than 1,000 miles away, as a potential refuge. Fiji\u2019s higher elevation and more stable shoreline make it less vulnerable.Anote Tong, a former president who pushed through the Fiji purchase, said it was also intended as a cry for attention from the world. \u201cThe issue of climate change is real, serious, and we\u2019d like to do something about it if they\u2019re going to take their time about it,\u201d he said in a recent interview.But packing up an entire country is not easy, and may not be possible. And many Kiribati residents remain skeptical of the need to prepare for an eventuality that may be decades away.The skeptics include the rural and less educated residents of the outer islands who doubt they could obtain the skills needed to survive overseas, and Christians who put more faith in God\u2019s protection than in climate models. \u201cAccording to their biblical belief, we\u2019re not going to sink because God is the only person who decides the fate of any country,\u201d said Rikamati Naare, the news editor at Radio Kiribati, the state-run broadcaster.As President Tong became a climate-change celebrity, invited to speak at conferences around the world, opponents accused him of ignoring problems back home, such as high unemployment and infant mortality. They derided the Fiji purchase, for nearly $7 million, as a boondoggle; dismissed his \u201cmigration with dignity\u201d as a contradiction in terms; and called his talk of rising sea levels alarmist and an affront to divine will.Mr. Tong, having served three terms, was not allowed to run for re-election this year, but in March elections the opposition defeated his party. The new president, Taneti Maamau, said he planned to shift priorities.\u201cMost of our resources are now diverted to climate-change-related development, but in fact there are also bigger issues, like population, the health of the people, the education of the people,\u201d he said during an interview at Parliament, which sits on reclaimed land at the edge of a turquoise lagoon.\u201cClimate change is a serious issue, but you can\u2019t do very much about it, especially if a big hurricane comes,\u201d he added with a hearty laugh.The Fiji purchase was not the first effort to address Kiribati\u2019s perilous future. The World Bank-led Kiribati Adaptation Program, begun in 2003, developed water-management plans, built coastal sea walls, planted mangroves and installed rainwater-harvesting systems. The bank says the project, which cost $17.7 million, has conserved fresh water in Tarawa and protected about one mile of Kiribati\u2019s 710 miles of coastline.\u201cAdaptation is just this long, ugly, hard slog,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Simon Donner, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cThe idea that an outside organization can just come in with money, expertise and ideas and implement something easily is na\u00efve. What you need is consistent, long-term funding \u2014 the type of stuff that\u2019s hard to pull off with development aid.\u201dDenis Jean-Jacques Jordy, a senior environmental specialist at the World Bank, acknowledged that \u201cwe had some issues\u201d with the first sea walls but said subsequent ones made of rock were better designed.There is no shortage of ideas to avert Kiribati\u2019s environmental fate. China\u2019s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea shows the promise of sophisticated island-engineering technology, experts say. Mr. Tong commissioned a study on raising Kiribati\u2019s coastline.But such measures are financially unrealistic for a resource-poor, aid-dependent country like Kiribati. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the place going underwater,\u201d Professor Donner said, noting that some of Kiribati\u2019s islands had actually grown in recent years because of land reclamation or natural coastal dynamics. \u201cIt\u2019s about it becoming prohibitively expensive to live in. That\u2019s the real challenge for Kiribati.\u201dThe parallel freshwater crisis is also fixable, at a cost. Clean drinking water is already scarce on several islands, and saltwater from high ocean tides has infiltrated some wells. Many residents of South Tarawa, home to half the country\u2019s people, now get their drinking water exclusively from rainwater tanks. Experts worry that as sea levels rise, Kiribati\u2019s fragile groundwater supply will face even greater risks, while the next drought could quickly exhaust the municipal supply and household rainwater tanks. Kiribati could invest in desalinization equipment or ship in drinking water, but this is a country with only one paved road.\u201cIt\u2019s all doable,\u201d said Doug Ramsay, the Pacific Rim manager at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a very expensive exercise.\u201dAnother novel response gaining attention lately is the idea of applying international refugee law \u2014 largely drafted after World War II to protect people fleeing political, religious or racial persecution \u2014 to those forced from their homes because of climate change.In 2012, a migrant worker from Kiribati, Ioane Teitiota, applied for asylum in New Zealand, arguing that he was unable to grow food or find potable water in Kiribati because of saltwater intrusion. His lawyer, Michael Kidd, said the distinction between environmental and political refugees was arbitrary. \u201cYou\u2019re either a refugee or you\u2019re not,\u201d he said in an interview.The courts rejected the argument, and Mr. Teitiota was deported from New Zealand last year. Mr. Kidd said he had appealed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Still, migration may become increasingly important. Mr. Tong said he hoped to prepare his people to move with job-training programs that would meet standards recognized in Australia and New Zealand.\u201cThe science of climate change is not 100 percent precise,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut we know without any argument that, in time, our people will have to relocate unless there are very, very significant resources committed to maintain the integrity of the land.\u201dCoastal threats are increasingly clear to residents of Buariki, an oceanside village of thatched-roof huts and towering coconut palms on the island of North Tarawa. Erosion along the beach has already toppled dozens of coconut trees. The World Bank estimates that 18 to 80 percent of the village, which sits on a peninsula not more than a few hundred feet wide, may be underwater by 2050.Some villagers said they were resigned to leaving. \u201cOur government already has land in Fiji for the Kiribati people, so if there are more high tides here, they\u2019ll bring people to live there,\u201d said Kourabi Ngauea, 29. \u201cBut it depends on the government, and if they can support us.\u201dOthers see no need to leave. \u201cThis is where I belong,\u201d Aroita Tokamaen, 76, said as she peeled a coconut on her patio. \u201cI would rather stay.\u201dThe tide that damaged the hospital here last winter was an exceptionally strong king tide, a surge that occurs twice a year when the moon is closest to the Earth. The waves also flooded the thatched-roofed outdoor meeting space of the local branch of the Kiribati Uniting Church.While some people were alarmed, the pastor, Ms. Rube, said she refused to accept the idea that Kiribati could disappear.\u201cWe are Christians,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t believe that God could have given us this world and then take it away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenges of Getting a Product Made in the U.S.A.", "Date": "2016-07-27", "News": "Supported byMany manufacturers perform a cost-benefit analysis when deciding whether to move production abroad. Others, however, are determined to make their products in the United States, even when the costs are higher.\u201cThey had to be beautiful,\u201d Mr. Holmes said of his products. \u201cGood art is a beautiful product that is functional.\u201dTo make the high-quality cases he set out to sell, Mr. Holmes needed a bookbindery that could stitch together the protective wood and soft leather he wanted to use. But he found out that in the digital era, bookbinding is a dying industry. He searched overseas and found a vendor in China, but was unimpressed with the results.Reshoring is more suited to the luxury goods market, according to Jeffrey Silberman, the chairman of the textile development and marketing department at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.\u201cReshoring will happen, but not in the way people expect it to,\u201d Professor Silberman said. \u201cIt will happen in a smaller way. It\u2019s a high-priced, luxury niche market, at this point at least.\u201dThat aspect of tradition carries over to Pad & Quill\u2019s suppliers. Trendex has nearly a century of bookbinding experience, according to Jeff Polacek, the company\u2019s president, who took over the business in 1985 with his brother Tom. But it was facing a shrinking industry, and the company had to move into packaging materials to remain stable.\u201cWhen I got into the business, every paper was stored in file cabinets or ring binders,\u201d Mr. Polacek said. \u201cInformation was stored that way; now, information is electronic.\u201dWith a bindery in place, Mr. Holmes was able to build the rest of his supply chain. To do so, he borrowed from skills he learned while working for a medical start-up.He kept a lean staff of himself and three others, which meant he outsourced jobs like customer service and accounting to consulting companies in the United States.But even with a trusted supplier in place, it took a while to get the product right.\u201cOur first iPad cases were total bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo huge, so ugly.\u201dSo he rethought the design and began looking for better materials that would provide a longer life span for his products. And despite his efforts, he realized that some production facilities he wanted to use could only be found in other countries.Seventy percent of Pad & Quill products are made in the United States, Mr. Holmes said, and reaching even that level was not easy. \u201cManufacturing is getting harder and harder in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you plan well, you can make products in the United States.\u201dAs the quality of his products improved, so did sales. But his business was outgrowing his cash flow, and he needed investors. So he reached out to his business partners at Trendex.\u201cI wanted an investor in the supply chain because they would be vested in my success, not an angel investor,\u201d Mr. Holmes said.Mr. Holmes negotiated in 2011 to sell the Polacek brothers a 35 percent stake in Pad & Quill. In return, he was able to get a line of credit and pay off some old debts.The deal was a good growth opportunity, Jeff Polacek said, adding that it was the first time that Trendex had taken a minority stake in another company.\u201cI think it\u2019s been a good match; he is very quality-conscious,\u201d Mr. Polacek said of Mr. Holmes. \u201cHe knows what his customers are buying and why his customers are buying, and he\u2019s good at filling their needs.\u201dMr. Holmes said it was important that he found investors who shared the same ideals. \u201cYou have to look into them and find out as much as you can, because you are married, and divorces are ugly,\u201d he said.Pad & Quill struggled in the beginning, but became profitable in 2011, Mr. Holmes said. The next year, sales of the leather and wood cases shot up, and revenue grew 50 percent over the previous year, he said. This year, he said, the company is projected to bring in $2.5 million in revenue.Mr. Holmes acknowledged that his company might have been profitable sooner if he had moved manufacturing overseas. But \u201cwe learned so much about manufacturing by working with American companies\u201d that it made better sense to keep it in the United States, he said.The next step for Pad & Quill is to enter the retail mass market. Mr. Holmes said he was considering approaching Best Buy, which is based in Richfield, Minn., because it carried some luxury goods already and would be a good fit for his cases.But moving into the wholesale market is \u201cfraught with risk,\u201d he said, and comes with added expenses, like maintaining a larger inventory and paying a distributor.Before undertaking such an expansion, Mr. Holmes said he was looking for another round of investment. Another alternative would be to sell the company outright \u2014 an option Mr. Holmes would consider only if he found the right buyer.\u201cI would want a good buyout because my investors took risks,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would want a good fit.\u201dPad & Quill was established as a quality brand, Mr. Holmes said, but it\u2019s also part of his identity, so it would be important to find a buyer with values similar to his own.\u201cI think a lot of entrepreneurs are narcissists,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s normal to have an inflated view of yourself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blaming Trade and Voting Trump in the Rust Belt", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyIt\u2019s only pushing things a bit to say that the fate of our country rests on the regulars of Dukey\u2019s, an ancient bar and restaurant in an industrial section of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Walter Terpak, known as Fuzzy, has been coming here for more than 55 years, he says, starting back when he was only 5 and would visit his second cousin, Dukey, who commanded the bar. Fuzzy has moved homes several times over the decades, but each place has been within 200 yards of Dukey\u2019s. Which means he has personally witnessed the near-collapse of this once-thriving manufacturing center.\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was all hardworking families,\u201d he added, gesturing around the neighborhood. \u201cThey worked in the shoe factory next door. The brewery. Garment factories.\u201d He listed the factories that used to employ people in Wilkes-Barre, companies like Pressed Steel and American Chain and Cable. Billy, another regular sitting next to Fuzzy, helped with the list. \u201cHazard Iron,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was the big one in Pittston?\u201d This time, Fuzzy had the answer: \u201cOwens-Illinois. Gone overseas.\u201dBased on the share of votes received by Donald Trump in contested Republican primaries, Wilkes-Barre and surrounding Luzerne County may be one of the presumed nominee\u2019s strongest bases in the country. Compared with the United States as a whole, the county is extremely white (more than 90 percent), relatively old and far less educated. More than three-quarters of Republicans here voted for Trump in the Pennsylvania primary.In my conversations at Dukey\u2019s, patrons couched their support for Trump as entirely about two interrelated issues: trade and immigration. Trump recently gave his most significant economic-policy speech to date in the state, saying, \u201cMany Pennsylvania towns, once thriving and humming, are now in a state of despair.\u201d And he placed the blame on trade, promising to force a renegotiation of the Nafta agreement with Canada and Mexico or, barring that, to nullify it. This echoes his website, which says he will, if elected president, \u201ccut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.\u201d He also promises to make the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants in America leave and, famously, to build a wall along the Mexico-United States border.These positions have received near-unanimous derision from economists, who see them as crude and costly tools that would do little to increase the number of American manufacturing jobs or revitalize cities like Wilkes-Barre. But if opinion polls are to be believed, these views are extraordinarily popular \u2014 and they sure are popular at Dukey\u2019s. Trump will win this one bar in a landslide. Fuzzy, a lifelong Democrat, said he might lean toward Clinton, but on economic issues, he thinks that Trump has the best ideas.While in town, I wrote down a list of every factory that once operated in the area and tried to learn why it closed. After coal mining disappeared in the 1950s, the region never had one dominant industry: There was shoemaking, dress making, some iron work, a small cluster of television manufacturing and a host of other businesses. They were, generally, industries with low capital investment and little requirement for skilled workers. And this turned out to be very bad news for the region, because businesses like that can close up shop and move elsewhere with minimal cost. For this reason, Luzerne County\u2019s manufacturing base began dying long before Nafta was ratified in 1994. I found a report from 1983 that chronicled the disappearance of more than half of Pennsylvania\u2019s shoemaking jobs over the previous 15 years. Several factories closed because of the relatively mild recession of 1991.Was pre-Nafta trade the culprit? On balance, no. The history of one of the area\u2019s most important factories is particularly telling. Beginning in 1968, Owens-\u00adIllinois had a plant in Pittston, a city adjacent to Wilkes-Barre, that made glass panels for cathode-ray tubes used in televisions; at its peak, the factory employed 2,000 workers. By the late 1980s, it was clear that Americans wanted big TVs \u2014 27-inch or larger \u2014 a size that would require the factory to install a much larger furnace and acquire complex new machinery.Owens declined to make the investment, but despite this shortsighted decision, the plant wound up prospering for well over a decade \u2014 because of trade. A Japanese company, Nippon Electric Glass, entered into a joint venture with Owens in 1988 and bankrolled the investment that Owens\u2019s own executives wouldn\u2019t; by 1993, N.E.G. owned the factory outright, and it was thriving. And when the plant did finally close, in 2004, the jobs didn\u2019t go to Mexico or China. They disappeared entirely, because nobody wanted cathode-ray tube televisions anymore.Thomas Baldino, who teaches political science at Wilkes University, across town from Dukey\u2019s, has a blunt assessment of Luzerne County\u2019s economic history. The country hasn\u2019t lost jobs to overseas competition, he says; instead, it has lost them in large part because of Pennsylvania\u2019s unusual commonwealth status, in which local governments enjoy a great deal of autonomy, making it nearly impossible to coordinate development efforts in the way that other regions have: to foster particular industries, for example, by creating partnerships between local schools, corporations and regional business groups. (In places where this model has worked, like Dayton, Ohio, and Greenville, S.C., the results have been fairly successful.)Despite all this, Luzerne County is actually not a deeply depressed area. Its economy has grown moderately over the past decade. Luzerne\u2019s fastest-growing industry, one in which it ranks 13th in the country, is warehousing and storage \u2014 an industry driven largely by trade, as the flow of overseas imports has created a need to temporarily store them.Wilkes-Barre even has a modest high-tech scene. Pepperjam, a surprisingly successful digital-marketing firm, is based here, employing 160 people \u2014 nearly all of them young graduates of local schools who most likely would have left town if not for this firm. Its office is the centerpiece of the Innovation Center at Wilkes-Barre, a technology-startup accelerator in which another 60 or so young, educated people work for a dozen newer start-ups: Mobiniti, which helps companies market through text messaging; Vitrius Glass, which makes energy-efficient windows; and several others.The problem for displaced workers in the demographic I met at Dukey\u2019s \u2014 the same demographic that disproportionately supports Trump \u2014 is that none of these jobs are available to them. Pepperjam employs creative, college-educated people, while the growing warehousing field needs young workers with strong backs and few other options. The warehouses are disproportionately filled with newly arrived Latino workers, not the older local residents. But those immigrants aren\u2019t to blame; the displaced older workers couldn\u2019t do those jobs even if they wanted to. Nor are Nafta or China to blame. The economy has simply shifted, and older, less-educated workers are less in demand. If reducing trade did somehow bring new factories, they would \u2014 like nearly all American manufacturing facilities \u2014 rely heavily on machines, and what workers they did employ would need advanced technical training. The truth is that nobody, especially not Donald Trump, has a serious plan to help the older, less-educated workers who are flocking to support him.The people at Dukey\u2019s are leaning his way, though they are not particularly enthusiastic about him. Everybody laughed about some of his more ridiculous statements; they agreed that he was awful on women and foreign policy.

{"Headline": "Trade and Jobs: A Note", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Maybe the best way to explain all of this is to start by talking about how I would do this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact, the way I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing it on the backs of various envelopes over the years. I would begin by posing a counterfactual: what would U.S. employment look like if we had pursued policies such as Trump tariffs that prevented the large trade deficits in manufacturing we actually have?How much manufacturing did that deficit displace? It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all come out of manufacturing value added, because a fair bit of a dollar spent on manufactured goods eventually shows up in purchases of non-manufactured imports. I need to do this more carefully (on deadline right now), but a rough number would be 60 percent for manufactured content; so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about $360 billion.Then, employment: value added per worker in manufacturing is approximately $175,000. So this should translate into a bit over 2 million jobs. OK, what about the effect on overall employment? In general, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer that with a similar computation, because it all depends on offsetting policies. If monetary and fiscal policy are used to achieve a target level of employment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as they generally were prior to the 2008 crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then a first cut at the impact on overall employment is zero. That is, trade deficits meant 2 million fewer manufacturing jobs and 2 million more in the service sector.Since 2008, of course, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in a liquidity trap, with the Fed either unable or unwilling to hit its targets and fiscal policy paralyzed by ideology, so trade deficits are in practice a major drag on overall employment. But this is a bit different from the usual \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrade costs jobs\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument.So, how big a deal is displacement of 2 million manufacturing jobs? Not trivial, to say the least. But if you want to place it in the context of deindustrialization: we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about 1.5 percent of the work force. So absent the trade deficit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, again, imagining some policy that prevents deficits from emerging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we would have roughly 11.5 percent of the work force in manufacturing, rather than the actual 10. Compare this with the realities of the past: more than 20 percent in manufacturing in the late 1970s, more than 25 percent in the 1960s.OK, now for Autor and various co-authors, who do something very different: a bottom-up approach. They start with an empirical analysis, using cross-section data, of the impact of the China shock on employment, wages, and so on at the regional level \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is perfectly fine, and in fact beautiful work. But what they do next is to apply the implied coefficient from this analysis to the aggregate effects of the China shock. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more dubious \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially when, in the second paper, they purport to estimate the effects on overall employment. In general, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that: applying estimates of partial regional effects to the overall aggregate exposes you to huge possible fallacies of composition. And in this case the crucial issue is monetary and fiscal response. Up through 2007 we basically had a Fed which raised rates whenever it thought the economy was overheating; in the absence of the China shock it would have raised rates sooner and faster, so you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use the results of the cross-section regression \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect monetary policy, which was the same for everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to predict how things would have turned out.Now, it so happens that my alternative procedure yields results for manufacturing alone that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too much out of line with those papers. But this should be seen as jobs shifted out of manufacturing to other sectors, not total job loss, at least pre-crisis.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Word for \u2018Illegal Alien\u2019 at the Library of Congress: Contentious", "Date": "2016-07-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Melissa Padilla was doing research on immigration in her university library at Dartmouth College when she noticed the term \u201cillegal aliens\u201d popping up again and again. The more she saw it, the angrier she became.\u201cThis term, and the way people used it to criminalize the choices our parents made in order to provide us with better lives, completely detracts from the brave choices and obstacles we overcame in order to survive,\u201d said Ms. Padilla, 26, who was an undocumented immigrant for 15 years after her parents brought her to the United States from Mexico when she was 7. \u201cI\u2019m not illegal. I\u2019m a survivor that continues to work toward a better future.\u201dMs. Padilla joined with Dartmouth students at the Coalition for Immigration Reform, Equality and Dreamers, and they have spent more than two years petitioning the Library of Congress to remove \u201cillegal alien\u201d from its subject headings.In March, the library said it would make the change, after agreeing with Ms. Padilla\u2019s argument \u2014 bolstered by an American Library Association resolution \u2014 that \u201calien\u201d and \u201cillegal alien\u201d are pejorative terms. The library, which is now taking public comments on the change, has said it will replace the term with \u201cnoncitizens\u201d and \u201cunauthorized immigration,\u201d setting a precedent that may be followed by other libraries on a global scale.But that decision \u2014 at a time when immigration has become a big topic in the presidential campaign and at the Supreme Court \u2014 has ignited an angry response from conservative lawmakers who accuse the library of abandoning the letter of the law to pander to immigrant rights\u2019 advocates.Gayle Osterberg, the communications director of the Library of Congress, said this was the first time Congress has intervened with the routine relabeling, which the library does every year to keep thousands of catalogs current. Ms. Osterberg noted that there was no legislative opposition, for example, when \u201cNegro\u201d and \u201cretard\u201d were removed from subject headings.Ms. Padilla, who became a permanent resident in 2012 after her father became a naturalized citizen, said she believes that \u201cillegal alien\u201d is used to demean Mexican immigrants specifically, regardless of legal status. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, agreed with her.\u201cWhen ugly, belittling names are used to describe groups of people, those terms can make discrimination seem O.K.,\u201d Mr. Castro said on the House floor on June 9, in an effort to stop the provision from being included in the bill.\u201cEven if they aren\u2019t American citizens, they are still human beings and should be respected as human beings,\u201d Mr. Castro said in an interview after the provision was approved. \u201cAlien\u201d is an inaccurate term, he said, because it does not fairly describe hard-working people who contribute to the national economy.But Mr. Culberson said that any term other than \u201calien\u201d would be legally inaccurate and that the Library of Congress was obligated to disseminate accurate information.\u201cSuch an action is beneath the dignity of the Library of Congress,\u201d the Republican lawmakers wrote in their letter to Mr. Mao. \u201cRather than engage in revisionist history, the library should base its decisions on sound judgment, taking actual history, present facts and future research efforts into account.\u201dMr. Culberson said in an interview that those who oppose the provision have no basis in federal law. \u201cLongstanding federal law mandates and it is clear that if you have entered illegally or legally you are an illegal alien or a legal alien,\u201d he said.Many news media companies have made changes similar to the library\u2019s. The Associated Press, which publishes a stylebook that guides hundreds of news outlets across the country, decided in 2013 to stop using \u201cillegal\u201d to describe a person, arguing that only actions are illegal. The New York Times does not use \u201calien,\u201d but will use \u201cillegal\u201d to refer to immigrants without legal status as well as \u201cundocumented\u201d and \u201cunauthorized.\u201d The Times also seeks to use language that directly describes the specific circumstances of a person.Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes any benefits or amnesty for immigrants here illegally, said that \u201cundocumented,\u201d \u201cunauthorized\u201d and \u201cnoncitizen\u201d were all inaccurate terms.\u201cAt any point in time, people have developed terms to shape political discourse,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Library of Congress bends its terminology for political reasons.\u201dHe said that using anything other than \u201calien\u201d belittles immigration law, and he urged the Library of Congress to come up with a term that would not delegitimize federal regulations.While the debate continues, Ms. Padilla is enjoying her citizenship status, but she says she never feels far removed from the difficulty of life when she did not have legal status.When anyone challenges her opinion on terminology, she said, she quotes Elie Wiesel: \u201cNo human being is illegal.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the status of a plan by the Library of Congress to remove the term \u201cillegal alien\u201d as a subject heading. The relabeling process has not begun, because a public comment period was extended. This change came to light after the article was published.Advertisement"}

The service in most places is arguably too good \u2014 and so attentive it borders on annoying. Waiters will grab a plate from under your fork. If you step away from the table to take a quick call, they will whisk away your drink.\u201cWe believe good service is attentive service,\u201d said a waiter in the upscale Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City.Behind him, 30 servers searched for someone to serve among the restaurant\u2019s 15 diners.To be fair, for people living on tips and meager salaries, proving one\u2019s work ethic and appearing busy are essential.

{"Headline": "What Babies Know About Physics and Foreign Languages", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionParents and policy makers have become obsessed with getting young children to learn more, faster. But the picture of early learning that drives them is exactly the opposite of the one that emerges from developmental science.In the last 30 years, the United States has completed its transformation to an information economy. Knowledge is as important in the 21st century as capital was in the 19th, or land in the 18th. In the same 30 years, scientists have discovered that even very young children learn more than we once thought possible. Put those together and our preoccupation with making children learn is no surprise.The trouble is that most people think learning is the sort of thing we do in school, and that parents should act like teachers \u2014 they should direct special lessons at children to produce particular kinds of knowledge or skill, with the help of how-to books and \u201cparenting\u201d apps. Studies prove that high-quality preschool helps children thrive. But policy makers and educators are still under pressure to justify their investments in early childhood education. They\u2019ve reacted by replacing pretend corners and playground time with \u201cschool readiness\u201d tests.But in fact, schools are a very recent invention. Young children were learning thousands of years before we had ever even thought of schools. Children in foraging cultures learned by watching what the people around them did every day, and by playing with the tools they used. New studies show that even the youngest children\u2019s brains are designed to learn from this simple observation and play in a remarkably sensitive way.Young children today continue to learn best by watching the everyday things that grown-ups do, from cleaning the house to fixing a car. My grandson Augie, like most 4-year-olds, loves to watch me cook, and tries manfully to copy what I do. But how does he decide whether to just push the egg whites around the bowl, or to try to reproduce exactly the peculiar wristy beating action I learned from my own mother? How does he know that he should transfer the egg yolks to the flour bowl without accidentally dropping them in the whites, as Grandmom often does? How did he decide that green peas would be a good addition to a strawberry souffl\u00e9? (He was right, by the way.)In other words, babies don\u2019t copy mindlessly \u2014 they take note of who you are and why you act.The actions followed a pattern: Some of them were necessary to make the machine go and some were superfluous. For example, the children might see that the toy lit up only when the experimenter shook the tab and turned over the toy, no matter what else she did.Then she asked the child to make the music play. The children analyzed the pattern of events, figured out which actions actually made the toy go, and immediately produced just those actions. They would just pull the tab and turn over the toy. They used their observations to create an intelligent new solution to the problem.We take it for granted that young children \u201cget into everything.\u201d But new studies of \u201cactive learning\u201d show that when children play with toys they are acting a lot like scientists doing experiments. Preschoolers prefer to play with the toys that will teach them the most, and they play with those toys in just the way that will give them the most information about how the world works.Then the researchers gave the babies toys to play with. The babies who had seen the ball vanish through the wall banged it; those who\u2019d seen the car hovering in thin air kept dropping it. It was as if they were testing to see if the ball really was solid, or if the toy car really did defy gravity.It\u2019s not just that young children don\u2019t need to be taught in order to learn. In fact, studies show that explicit instruction, the sort of teaching that goes with school and \u201cparenting,\u201d can be limiting. When children think they are being taught, they are much more likely to simply reproduce what the adult does, instead of creating something new.My lab tried a different version of the experiment with the complicated toy. This time, though, the experimenter acted like a teacher. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to show you how my toy works,\u201d instead of \u201cI wonder how this toy works.\u201d The children imitated exactly what she did, and didn\u2019t come up with their own solutions.The children seem to work out, quite rationally, that if a teacher shows them one particular way to do something, that must be the right technique, and there\u2019s no point in trying something new. But as a result, the kind of teaching that comes with schools and \u201cparenting\u201d pushes children toward imitation and away from innovation.There is a deep irony here. Parents and policy makers care about teaching because they recognize that learning is increasingly important in an information age. But the new information economy, as opposed to the older industrial one, demands more innovation and less imitation, more creativity and less conformity.In fact, children\u2019s naturally evolved learning techniques are better suited to that sort of challenge than the teaching methods of the past two centuries.New research tells us scientifically what most preschool teachers have always known intuitively. If we want to encourage learning, innovation and creativity we should love our young children, take care of them, talk to them, let them play and let them watch what we do as we go about our everyday lives.We don\u2019t have to make children learn, we just have to let them learn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Cheating Husbands Fuel an Industry of \u2018Mistress Dispellers\u2019", "Date": "2016-07-29", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 When Ms. Wang, a 39-year-old from Shanghai, discovered texts on her husband\u2019s phone that suggested he was having an affair with one of his employees, she was distraught. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep at night and couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very hurt.\u201dShe decided to take action, though perhaps not in the expected way. Rather than confronting her husband, she searched online for a \u201cmistress dispeller.\u2019\u2019Mistress-dispelling services, increasingly common in China\u2019s larger cities, specialize in ending affairs between married men and their extramarital lovers.Typically hired by a scorned wife, they coach women on how to save their marriages, while inducing the mistress to disappear. For a fee that can start in the tens of thousands of dollars, they will subtly infiltrate the mistress\u2019s life, winning her friendship and trust in an attempt to break up the affair. The services have emerged as China\u2019s economy has opened up in recent decades, and as extramarital affairs grew more common.With greater opportunities and incentives to be unfaithful \u2014 not a few businessmen and officials signal status by maintaining fetching young women \u2014 new businesses to combat the cheating have apparently flourished.The personal accounts from people who say they have used them are difficult to independently confirm, and there are no exact figures for the number of mistress dispellers in China. But a search on Baidu, a Chinese search engine, yields pages of ads and blogs that link back to mistress-dispelling companies based in cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou.Weiqing eventually ended the affair, she said, by persuading the other woman to take a higher-paying job in another city. \u201cI don\u2019t care how that woman is living now,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Wang said. \u201cI just feel relieved that my husband is back.\u2019\u2019Ms. Wang, who was recommended by Weiqing to be interviewed for this article, declined to give her full name, saying she wanted to protect her family\u2019s privacy. She would not say how much she paid, except that it was enough that she asked her parents for help.Weiqing said it started helping clients like Ms. Wang in 2001 in Shanghai, and has since expanded to 59 cities.Mistress dispelling typically begins with research on the targeted woman, said Shu Xin, Weiqing\u2019s director. An investigation team \u2014 often including a psychotherapist and, to keep on the safe side, a lawyer \u2014 analyzes her family, friends, education and job before sending in an employee whom Weiqing calls a counselor.\u201cOnce we figure out what type of mistress she is \u2014 in it for money, love or sex \u2014 we draw up a plan,\u201d Mr. Shu said.The counselor might move into the mistress\u2019s apartment building or start working out at her gym, getting to know her, becoming her confidante and eventually turning her feelings against her partner. Sometimes, the counselor finds her a new lover, a job opening in another city or otherwise persuades her to leave the married man. Weiqing and other agencies said their counselors were prohibited from becoming intimately involved with the mistresses or from using or threatening violence.While the counselor goes to work, the mistress-dispelling service advises the wife on how to make herself more attractive to her husband.\u201cWe want to disrupt conventional ways of thinking,\u201d Mr. Kang said. \u201cChinese women think that if you treat men well, they\u2019ll love you more. But often, we men love the people who hurt us the most.\u201dOne response to marital infidelity is divorce. But divorce can be costly, especially for women. Aside from the social stigma that falls more heavily on women, family property and finances in China tend to be registered in the husband\u2019s name. A divorced woman can find herself homeless, adding to the pressure of taking measures to save the marriage.And the wives, unwilling to undergo a difficult divorce, he said, \u201cwould rather turn to a mistress dispeller behind their husbands\u2019 back.\u2019\u2019 Ideally, the husband never finds out why his mistress left him.The services are not cheap. Mr. Kang charges a base fee of 300,000 renminbi, about $45,000, but he said that costs can mount if counselors need to rent expensive apartments or cars to endear themselves to the mistresses. Clients usually pay half the fee in advance and the balance once the case is successfully concluded. Mr. Kang said the balance is waived if the mistress is not dispelled, but he put his success rate at 90 percent, in part because he only takes on cases he thinks can be solved.Recently, however, mistress-dispelling services have faced new challenges.Mistress dispellers are also viewed unfavorably by many traditional marriage counselors.Still, the companies say they are growing.Last year, Weiqing said it had 10,000 clients, up from 8,000 the year before, while Mr. Kang, of the Reunion Company, said he received about 175 inquiries a day, up from 96 a day in 2015. These numbers could not be independently confirmed.Some mistress dispellers have begun to expand their operations overseas, mainly serving ethnic Chinese women living abroad. But Mr. Kang said he was preparing to start English-language services for non-Chinese clients in Europe and North America by opening a call center based in the Philippines or Malaysia.\u201cWe began by servicing Chinese,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kang said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve discovered in the course of our work that it\u2019s not just our own people who have these problems. Everyone does.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The tech overlords keep clear of writers who are not on their payrolls or at least in their thrall. Many in the valley feel that bringing the digital future to the masses is God\u2019s work. Question this, and they tend to get touchy. Anger them, and they might seek revenge. The billionaire investor Peter Thiel, outed by the local arm of the Gawker media empire, secretly financed a lawsuit to destroy it. Silicon Valley did not rise en masse and say this was seriously beyond the pale. No surprise, then, that there are so few books investigating what it really takes to succeed in tech (duplicity often trumps innovation) or that critically examine such omnipresent, comforting fables as \u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money.\u201dThere are other barriers to literature. A start-up is less a physical reality than the hype that surrounds it. (It\u2019s not lying if you believe it.) Boasts, threats, secret deals, betrayals are the coin of the realm, but lawsuits and news releases are the only things put in writing. Nailing this slippery culture would take an unholy combination of David Mamet and Tom Wolfe in their primes, but they would also have to be lucky enough to find a subject who did not realize he was a great subject and start censoring himself for fear he would never be hired again. Good luck with that.In the meantime, we have the next best thing: Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s \u201cChaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,\u201d a book whose bland all-purpose title belies the fact that this is a valley account like no other. The first hint that something is different here comes with the dedication: \u201cTo all my enemies: I could not have done it without you.\u201d This is autobiography as revenge, naming names and sparing few, certainly not the author. \u201cI was wholly devoid of most human boundaries or morality,\u201d he notes in passing. In other words, he was a start-up chief executive.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez came to the valley in 2008 from Goldman Sachs, where he was a pricing quant who modeled credit derivatives. In the valley, he tried to do the same with chunks of human attention, which meant inventing digital ad systems. He started at a flailing firm named \u00adAdchemy; quit with two engineers to found a start-up; sold the start-up to Twitter but went himself to work for Facebook, where he lasted two years.Flatly summarized, it is not a very interesting career. The start-up, named AdGrok, was a company mostly in name; it was three guys in a dumpy room trying to hustle themselves in a world full of hustlers. The answer to the problem plaguing Facebook during Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s stint there \u2014 how can we use digital advertising to make some serious money? \u2014 was not solved by the author.No matter. Michael Lewis was never a top Wall Street bond salesman, but in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d he captured an era. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d aims to do the same for Silicon Valley, and bracingly succeeds. Nothing I\u2019ve ever read conveys better what it actually is like to be in the engine room of the start-up economy. There were moments I laughed out loud, something I never recall doing while reading about Steve Jobs. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez shows how a start-up is less about making a product that actually does something than desperately demonstrating you are worthy of being hired by Google, Twitter or Facebook. He describes the way the big companies resemble life in Cuba or Communist China circa 1965, with \u201cendless toil motivated by lapidary ideals handed down by a revered and unquestioned leader,\u201d not to mention the posters on the wall proclaiming, \u201cProceed and Be Bold!\u201d This is a place, he points out, where people take their laptops into a toilet stall and keep typing as they do what they came to do. If that strikes you as unseemly or unnecessary, you\u2019ll never make it in Palo Alto.The heart of the book is the period Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez spent at his start-up, which was intended to allow small businesses to efficiently advertise on Google. It was an auspicious moment. While the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the recession, the office parks of the valley were full of aggressive young men who had made pots of money by being early employees of Google. To prove they were not merely lucky, they needed to score again. Everyone was terrified of missing the next Facebook or, a little later, the next Airbnb or Uber. Smart entrepreneurs capitalized on these fears.Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez\u2019s big break was hyping his way into Y Combinator, in effect the valley\u2019s finishing school for innovators. He labels the YC entrepreneur profile as \u201cbomb-throwing anarchist subversive mixed with coldblooded execution mixed with irreverent whimsy, a sort of \u00adtechnology-enabled 12-year-old boy.\u201d He fit right in.Graduation from Y Combinator conveys the same prestige that a degree from Harvard does back East, and comes complete with an old boy \u2014 well, young men \u2014 network that is handy in all sorts of ways. \u201cAnyone who claims the valley is meritocratic is someone who has profited vastly from it via nonmeritocratic means like happenstance, membership in a privileged cohort or some concealed act of absolute skulduggery,\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez observes. All three helped AdGrok; at one point the author manipulated the numbers for his investors, \u201ccooking the books in the worst form. But it was either that or give up now, and surrender was unthinkable.\u201dThere are a few problems with \u201cChaos Monkeys.\u201d Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez likes footnotes way too much (on one page there are four) and the epigraphs to each chapter are numbingly heavy-handed, although the Latin American proverb about how for every beautiful woman there\u2019s a man tired of making love to her sums up nicely his feelings about leaving the Kingdom of Facebook. More problematically, there is much more about digital ad technology here than most readers could possibly want. The implications of the technology, on the other hand, are somewhat scanted.\u201cImagine that every time you go to CNN.com, it\u2019s as though a new sell order for one share in your brain is transmitted to a stock exchange,\u201d he writes. \u201cPicture it: Individual quanta of human attention sold, bit by bit, like so many million shares of General Motors stock, billions of times a day.\u201d That was the world Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was doing his best to create. For all his criticism of the valley\u2019s way of doing things, he never stops to wonder about ethics.But then, he\u2019s got a full plate. Early in the narrative Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez conceives a daughter with a woman a mere two weeks after they meet. \u201cIf you jump into the abyss, jump headlong,\u201d he observes. Eighteen months or so later, during breakup sex, a son is conceived. AdGrok officially opens for business on his daughter\u2019s first birthday, which he skipped. \u201cSuccess,\u201d he writes, \u201cforgives all sins.\u201dIn the end, though, his success as an entrepreneur was only middling. \u201cSuch is the greased pole of Silicon Valley fame and power; anyone can try to ascend, but nothing will arrest your fall,\u201d he writes. First prize in Silicon Valley is enough money so your family and descendants will never have to work again until the sun goes cold. Second prize is a whole heaping pile of money. Third prize is you\u2019re fired, which is often pretty sweet too. Three years after being escorted out of Facebook, Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez is living on a 40-foot sailboat on San Francisco Bay.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times.

{"Headline": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Accord Explained", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byQ. and A.The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history, would set new terms for trade and business investment among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations \u2014 a far-flung group with an annual gross domestic product of nearly $28 trillion that represents roughly 40 percent of global G.D.P. and one-third of world trade.But the agreement, which requires the approval of Congress, has become a flashpoint in the United States presidential campaign, opposed by the nominees of both major parties as a symbol of failed globalism and the loss of United States jobs overseas.Many Democrats in Congress have voiced skepticism over the benefits. And opposition to the pact became a popular rallying cry in stump speeches by both Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, who has promised to tear up the deal, and Bernie Sanders, who argued during the Democratic presidential primaries that it would lead to a loss of jobs and competitive wages.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, supported the emerging Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state, but during the primary race, soon after the accord was concluded, she said it did not sufficiently protect American jobs.The pact is seen as a means of addressing a number of festering issues that have become stumbling blocks as global trade has soared, including e-commerce, financial services and cross-border internet communications.There are also traditional trade issues involved. The United States is eager to establish formal trade agreements with five of the nations involved \u2014 Japan, Malaysia, Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam \u2014 and to strengthen Nafta, its current agreement with Canada and Mexico.Moreover, as efforts at global trade deals have faltered (such as the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha round), the Trans-Pacific Partnership is billed as an \u201copen architecture\u201d document written to ease adoption by additional Asian nations, and to provide a potential template to other initiatives underway, like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.Today, the United States and most developed countries have few tariffs, but some remain. The United States, for example, protects the domestic sugar market from lower-priced global suppliers and imposes tariffs on imported shoes, while Japan has steep surcharges on agricultural products including rice, beef and dairy. The pact is an effort to create a Pacific Rim free-trade zone.China has viewed the pact with concern, seeing a potential threat as the United States tries to tighten its relationship with Asian trading partners. But senior Chinese officials have hinted that they might want to take part at some point. At the same time, the deal provides China some cover as it pursues its own trade agreements in the region, such as the Silk Road initiative in Central Asia.United States officials, while making clear that they see the pact as part of an effort to counter China\u2019s influence in the region, say they are hopeful that the pact\u2019s \u201copen architecture\u201d eventually prompts China to join, along with other important economic powers like South Korea.Nafta, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, helped lead to a boom in trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada. All three countries exported more goods and services to the other two, cross-border investments grew, and the United States economy has added millions of jobs since then. But of course not all those trends were attributable to Nafta, and the benefits were not equal: The United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico when the pact was signed, but that quickly became a trade deficit that has widened to more than $50 billion a year.Critics of Nafta also point out that job growth in the United States does not account for the loss of jobs to Mexico or Canada; the A.F.L.-C.I.O. contends about 700,000 United States jobs have been lost or displaced because of Nafta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Anti-Growth Sentiment, Reflected in Zoning Laws, Thwarts Equality", "Date": "2016-07-03", "News": "Supported byBOULDER, Colo. \u2014 The small city of Boulder, home to the University of Colorado\u2019s flagship campus, has a booming local economy and a pleasantly compact downtown with mountain views. Not surprisingly, a lot of people want to move here.Something else is also not surprising: Many of the people who already live in Boulder would prefer that the newcomers settle somewhere else.\u201cThe quality of the experience of being in Boulder, part of it has to do with being able to go to this meadow and it isn\u2019t just littered with human beings,\u201d said Steve Pomerance, a former city councilman who moved here from Connecticut in the 1960s.All of Boulder\u2019s charms are under threat, Mr. Pomerance said as he concluded an hourlong tour. Rush-hour traffic has become horrendous. Quaint, two-story storefronts are being dwarfed by glass and steel. Cars park along the road to the meadow.These days, you can find a Steve Pomerance in cities across the country \u2014 people who moved somewhere before it exploded and now worry that growth is killing the place they love.But a growing body of economic literature suggests that anti-growth sentiment, when multiplied across countless unheralded local development battles, is a major factor in creating a stagnant and less equal American economy.One reason they\u2019re not migrating to places with better job prospects is that rich cities like San Francisco and Seattle have gotten so expensive that working-class people cannot afford to move there. Even if they could, there would not be much point, since whatever they gained in pay would be swallowed up by rent.In Boulder, for instance, the median home price has risen 60 percent over the last five years, to $648,200. Today, someone who makes the typical Boulder salary would have to put about 40 percent their monthly income toward payments on a new mortgage or about half toward rent, according to Zillow.\u201cWe\u2019ve switched from a world where everybody educated and uneducated was moving from poorer parts of the country to the richer parts of the country,\u201d said Professor Shoag, \u201cto a world where the higher-educated people move to San Francisco and lower educated people move to Vegas.\u201dZoning restrictions have been around for decades but really took off during the 1960s, when the combination of inner-city race riots and \u201cwhite flight\u201d from cities led to heavily zoned suburbs.They have gotten more restrictive over time, contributing to a jump in home prices that has been a bonanza for anyone who bought early in places like Boulder, San Francisco and New York City. But for latecomers, the cost of renting an apartment or buying a home has become prohibitive.In response, a group of politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown of California and President Obama, are joining with developers in trying to get cities to streamline many of the local zoning laws that, they say, make homes more expensive and hold too many newcomers at bay.To most people, zoning and land-use regulations might conjure up little more than images of late-night City Council meetings full of gadflies and minutiae. But these laws go a long way toward determining some fundamental aspects of life: what American neighborhoods look like, who gets to live where and what schools their children attend.And when zoning laws get out of hand, economists say, the damage to the American economy and society can be profound. Studies have shown that laws aimed at things like \u201cmaintaining neighborhood character\u201d or limiting how many unrelated people can live together in the same house contribute to racial segregation and deeper class disparities. They also exacerbate inequality by restricting the housing supply in places where demand is greatest.\u201cYou don\u2019t want rules made entirely for people that have something, at the expense of people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.So far, the biggest solution offered comes out of California, where Governor Brown has proposed a law to speed up housing development by making it harder for cities to saddle developers with open-ended design, permit and environmental reviews. The Massachusetts State Senate passed similar reforms. And President Obama has taken a more soft-touch approach, proposing $300 million in grants to prod local governments to simplify their building regulations.Mr. Brown\u2019s proposal has inflamed local politicians, environmentalists and community groups, who see it as state overreach into how they regulate development. But it has drawn broad support from developers, not surprisingly, as well as a number of business leaders, including many from the technology industry.To understand how a bunch of little growth laws make their way into existence, consider how well Boulder is doing \u2014 and why it has made people wary of promoting local growth.The city, about a 45-minute drive from Denver, is surrounded by postcard views of the Rockies. The list of yuppie-friendly amenities includes streets full of bike lanes and a walkable downtown full of bars, restaurants and marijuana shops. It has the charms of a resort town with the bonus that, unlike a resort town, it has more than ski lift and bartending jobs.The result is a virtuous economic cycle in which the university churns out smart people, the smart people attract employers, and the amenities make everyone want to stay. Twitter is expanding its offices downtown. A few miles away, a big hole full of construction equipment marks a new Google campus that will allow the company to expand its Boulder work force to 1,500 from 400.Looking to slow the pace of development, last year a citizens\u2019 group called Livable Boulder \u2014 Mr. Pomerance was involved in the effort \u2014 pushed a pair of local ballot measures that would have increased fees on new development and given neighborhood groups a vote on zoning changes in their area.Will Toor, Boulder\u2019s former mayor, who worked for the \u201cno\u201d campaign, said, \u201cYou would never build affordable housing, you would never build community facilities like homeless shelters \u2014 those things would just never happen if you had all veto power at the neighborhood level.\u201dVoters shot the measures down, but development is almost certain to remain the city\u2019s most contentious issue.\u201cWe don\u2019t need one more job in Boulder,\u201d Mr. Pomerance said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to grow anymore. Go somewhere else where they need you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Can Save the G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-07-08", "News": "OpinionConservatives should thank him for exposing the party\u2019s real problems.Supported byAS the Republican National Convention nears, there is growing talk of a palace \u2014 or party \u2014 coup to wrest the nomination from Donald J. Trump, or at least stage a public protest against him.These Republicans are in denial, and so are the conservative writers and activists egging them on. Their insurrection is likely to fizzle. It also ignores the true problem, and conservatives should thank Mr. Trump for exposing it.For many years \u2014 in fact, for much of its modern history \u2014 the G.O.P. has made a fetish of ideological rectitude at the expense of meeting the needs of voters. It is Mr. Trump who is finally addressing their real economic concerns.Mr. Trump may be an interloper, but he didn\u2019t luck into victory. He obliterated 16 rivals, some of them rising Republican stars, on the way to winning 37 states and building a coalition broad enough to include secular moderates in Massachusetts as well as evangelicals in Mississippi.The reasons for his success are unmistakable. Consider Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in Scotland following the Brexit vote. He has been ridiculed, as usual, for his slip-ups, but he also grasped the underlying symbolism of the referendum: its prideful call for national sovereignty and identity, heightened by the pressures of the global economy. \u201cPeople want to see borders,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don\u2019t know who they are and where they come from.\u201dThus did Mr. Trump \u2014 the unapologetic nationalist and occasional xenophobe who has said, \u201cAmerica First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration\u201d \u2014 emerge as a global explainer of the angry populist protests sweeping through many Western democracies.The sentiments themselves may be disturbing, but they demand attention. Yet few Republicans seem to acknowledge this. A party with a long history of cultural populism \u2014 hatred of elites combined with direct appeals to \u201cthe forgotten man,\u201d \u201cthe silent majority\u201d and \u201cthe moral majority\u201d \u2014 has grown curiously deaf to the authentic distress still troubling millions who have been struggling in the Obama years. Rather than proposing concrete programs to help the middle class and the poor, the Republicans\u2019 own elite continues to insist that the gravest threat to our economic security comes from government itself.\u201cWhen politicians start talking about a brewing \u2018crisis\u2019 in the land, most Americans rightly reach for their wallets,\u201d Eric Cantor asserted in \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d the campaign manifesto he wrote with Paul D. Ryan and Kevin McCarthy in 2010. These three House leaders criticized Republicans who would \u201cspend the taxpayers\u2019 money like teenagers with their parents\u2019 credit card\u201d as well as Democrats who \u201cnever pass up an opportunity to make government bigger and more intrusive.\u201d Legislators in both parties were ignoring the imperatives of \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d and \u201climited government.\u201d But what concrete good did these abstractions offer not long after job losses reached almost nine million?Similar talking points were a staple of the current Republican presidential campaign, with its emphasis on American exceptionalism \u2014 such as when Marco Rubio said, over and over, \u201cBarack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.\u201d The truth, which Mr. Trump, for all his many shortcomings, squarely recognizes, is that America is already like other Western countries, buffeted by globalization and the aftershocks of the Great Recession.That was the argument he made recently in western Pennsylvania, when he said free-trade policies were \u201cmoving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas,\u201d and unless steps are taken \u201cthe inner cities will remain poor, the factories will remain closed,\u201d while \u201cthe special interests will remain firmly in control.\u201dBernie Sanders has made the same case, of course, and Mr. Trump\u2019s pitch to Sanders supporters may offend some conservatives. But a left-right fusion of that kind could help emancipate our stalemated government by giving both parties room for give and take.That was the route chosen by two former Republican presidents who were also distrusted by conservatives but nonetheless governed effectively from the center. In the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 also, like Mr. Trump, a nonpolitician \u2014 epitomized what was then called \u201cme-tooism\u201d by forming a partnership with the Democratic Congress and two ardent New Dealers: the Senate majority leader, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the House speaker, Sam Rayburn. Together the three accomplished a good deal because they placed results above ideology and partisanship. \u201cThe assumption was that the electorate would no longer support a party whose prime goal was negative,\u201d Russell Baker wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1962. Out of this came the Civil Rights Act of 1957.After Eisenhower, some Republicans pushed the party to the right and toward doctrinal purity. At the party\u2019s nominating convention in 1960, the leader of the conservative faction, Senator Barry Goldwater, suggested doing away with the traditional party platform and replacing it with a \u201cdeclaration of principles.\u201d Ultimately, Goldwater won that argument, but not immediately.When Eisenhower\u2019s understudy, Richard M. Nixon, took office in 1969, he oversaw increases in Social Security and Medicare benefits along with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and tighter regulation of the economy. Voters approved, and Nixon converted a narrow victory in 1968 into a historic landslide in 1972.Later Republican presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also made compromises with Democratic Congresses. Yet conservatives pushed the party to the right. Goldwater\u2019s vision came to fruition in the 1990s, with the advent of an ideologically disciplined Republican Party, centered in Congress, that has kept its troops in line ever since. But the party has also struggled in presidential elections, capturing the popular vote only once since 1988.This is the cycle Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination could potentially break. And this threat largely explains the antipathy toward him coming from many establishment Republicans and their intellectual allies. To be fair, some conservatives have objected to genuinely troubling aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s character and his campaign \u2014 in particular, his bigoted remarks about immigrants, Mexicans and Muslims.These are serious cause for concern, but not, historically, for conservatives, who for many years have exploited racial and ethnic divisions for political gain. Goldwater\u2019s own national campaigns were built on courting Southern segregationists, which he began to do as early as 1961. Ronald Reagan crudely caricatured welfare recipients. Ted Cruz has called for patrolling \u201cMuslim neighborhoods.\u201dThe actual conservative brief against Mr. Trump reflects something else \u2014 his rejection, or ignorance, of ideological boilerplate. \u201cHe basically never says \u2018freedom\u2019 or \u2018liberty.\u2019 He gives no indication of caring about the Constitution,\u201d the editor of National Review, Rich Lowry, and a senior editor at the magazine, Ramesh Ponnuru, wrote last October, when it was becoming clear that Mr. Trump was making a strong presidential run. \u201cHe has, in short, ignored central and longstanding conservative tenets that seemed to have become only more important in the Tea Party era.\u201dTrue enough. But those certitudes don\u2019t begin to address the concerns of the large base of voters who have yet to feel the benefits of the economic recovery. When Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump \u201ca big-government liberal, just like Barack Obama and just like Hillary Clinton,\u201d he actually touched on a prime cause of Mr. Trump\u2019s wide appeal. He has accurately read the mood of restive voters. The loudest anti-government rhetoric often muffles the urgent cry for more, not less, government. As early as 2010, surveys showed that Tea Party supporters who said they favored smaller government were loath to give up giant programs like Social Security and Medicare.The challenge for Mr. Trump will be convincing voters that he really does mean to improve conditions for working-class and middle-class Americans and not just play to their grievances. If he does, and brings the party along with him, he could be a formidable foe to Mrs. Clinton, especially if the email controversy continues to dog her. But even in crushing defeat, he could be a kind of reverse Goldwater who shifts the party closer to the center. Trumpism, if not Mr. Trump himself, might return the party to the pragmatic conservatism of presidents like Eisenhower and Nixon.Indeed, Nixon could provide the best template. Like Mr. Trump, he ran a polarizing campaign. Its \u201claw and order\u201d message appealed to blue-collar whites who felt menaced on all sides \u2014 by civil-rights demonstrators, anti-Vietnam War protesters and liberal intellectuals who seemed disdainful of traditional American values. But Nixon was not an ideologue. He recruited Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to rethink urban policy. Nixon also guided the nation out of Vietnam, normalized relations with the Soviet Union and opened talks with China.Might a President Trump show the same flexibility and appetite for pragmatic maneuver? One hopeful sign is something that alarms conservatives: Mr. Trump\u2019s friendly past relations with Democrats. A second is his indifference to hot-button social and cultural issues like transgender bathrooms.But there is also the Mr. Trump who seems to float in a bubble of self-regard, the intemperate and blustering bully, the counter-wonk who seems unversed in the most basic policy debates, the rabble-rouser who was slow to disown racists. That Donald Trump might give us an administration all too similar to Trump University and the Trump Institute, a destructive exercise in branding.Years of fossilized ideology on the right created this choice, and some conservatives admit it, though it has not made them happy. Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination will mean the demise of \u201ca conservative party as a constant presence in U.S. politics,\u201d the columnist George F. Will warned in December. (Mr. Will has since announced he will quit the G.O.P. and seek asylum among the \u201cunaffiliated.\u201d)Whatever the outcome in November, this reckoning may be exactly what the party needs. Mr. Trump seemed to say as much in May, as he was closing in on the nomination. \u201cThis is called the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not called the Conservative Party.\u201dSam Tanenhaus is a former editor of The New York Times Book Review and the author of \u201cThe Death of Conservatism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Pull No Punches on Trade Policy", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byIn March, Mr. Donohue got a little more blunt. \u201cDonald Trump has very little idea about what trade really is,\u201d he told Bloomberg television.And recently, the gloves came off completely.As the presumptive Republican nominee gave a speech, threatening to rip up trade accords and put tariffs on goods from China, the chamber live-tweeted its jabs and counterpunches. \u201cUnder Trump\u2019s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,\u201d read one tweet.Another tweet warned that the chamber\u2019s analysis shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs \u201cwould strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs.\u201dFor the chamber, the bastion of free enterprise and free trade whose roots date back more than 100 years, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to upend trade agreements, to tax goods from important countries and even invite a trade war is tantamount to rolling tanks up to its doors. The acrimonious relationship between the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee is highly unusual: Historically, the two have been as close as peanut butter and jelly.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure at this point, Trump is just dug in on immigration and trade and the chamber is just going to have to go past him, basically, try to make sure good policy gets recognized by members of the House and Senate,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the chief economist for John McCain\u2019s presidential bid in 2008.Indeed, much of the chamber\u2019s political push is now focused on Congress. The goal is to help Republican candidates who share its principles hold crucial congressional seats, no matter who wins the presidential race.The growing divide between Mr. Trump and myriad bulwarks of the conservative Republican Party comes as the party races toward its convention in Cleveland next week. The convention is typically the time when the party rallies behind its candidate and develops a set of common policy goals and proposals. \u201cWhat are they going to do with the Republican platform? I have no idea,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential run.Mr. Trump, with his swaggering, shoot-from-the-hip campaign style, has shown time and again a willingness \u2014 nay, an eagerness \u2014 to thumb his nose at the hoity-toity members of the Republican establishment, whether big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cThey\u2019re a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have,\u201d Mr. Trump said to cheers at a packed rally in Bangor, Me., the day after his trade speech. The chamber, he added, was \u201ccontrolled totally by various groups of people that don\u2019t care about you whatsoever.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s isolationist trade policies play well to individuals who perceive the Republican establishment and their ilk have gotten rich from existing trade policies while their own jobs have moved to lower-wage countries like Mexico or China.\u201cHe\u2019s running as a populist anti-Washington-establishment candidate and there\u2019s hardly a more important organization on the right side of Washington politics than the Chamber of Commerce,\u201d said Richard L. Hall, a professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Chamber of Commerce is going to sit silent when Trump is taking positions that run against some of their main themes.\u201dOn its website, the chamber has started to post dire predictions of what a Trump presidency might mean. \u201cRepublican front-runner Donald Trump has promised to \u2018make America great again,\u2019\u201d began an article posted on the chamber\u2019s website in April. \u201cDoes a recession sound \u2018great\u2019 to you? Do 7 million lost jobs sound like \u2018winning\u2019?\u201dFor much of its existence, the chamber acted as a trade association for American businesses, typically adopting pro-business stances on deregulation of various industries, corporate tax rates and trade agreements.That changed when Mr. Donohue took over as the chamber president in 1997. The former chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, with his shock of white hair and hard-charging demeanor, Mr. Donohue, 77, morphed the chamber into a political lobbying machine with revenue topping $200 million, according to its 2014 tax filings.The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections, and that is mostly true. The Center for Responsive Politics shows relatively small donations given to Republican presidential candidates over the years.In 2012, Mr. Romney was the largest recipient, taking in $36,900, according to data compiled by the center.A spokeswoman for the chamber said any donations to presidential candidates came from individuals in the chamber, rather than the chamber itself. A spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics said its data typically includes donations from company executives because they have the resources to donate and usually do so for business reasons.While the vast majority of the chamber\u2019s huge cash stockpile goes to its lobbying efforts \u2014 $124 million in 2014 \u2014 another sizable slice goes to outside advertising. In the midterm elections in 2014, the chamber spent $35 million, overwhelmingly supporting Republican candidates. So far this year, it has spent nearly $14 million, none in support of Democrats.But to Mr. Trump\u2019s point, the chamber does not publicly describe how it makes decisions regarding what policies or politicians to support. Inside the chamber is a bit murky. Its board is a mix of small-business leaders, trade associations and executives from large corporations, including IBM, Caterpillar, Phillips 66, Dow Chemical Company and Allstate Insurance. But over all, the chamber does not make its membership public.A search of tax records for donations to the chamber shows that while it has received significant donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the foundation set up by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, some of its biggest contributions have come from the types of conservative political action committees that Mr. Trump likes to target. Crossroads GPS, the PAC founded by Karl Rove, gave $5.2 million to the chamber while Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the PAC founded by the Koch brothers, gave $2 million, according to 2014 tax filings, the most recent that were available.In an email, a spokeswoman for the chamber responded to a query by noting that the chamber has a \u201c$250 million operation that represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country.\u201dWhen not tackling Mr. Trump on trade, the chamber is throwing its considerable political muscle and money behind Republican candidates in critical congressional races who share its ideology on free trade. Those candidates include Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting for re-election in the battleground state of Ohio. Before he entered the Senate, Mr. Portman was the United States trade representative for former President George W. Bush, where he supported the Central American Free Trade Agreement.Yet Republican strategists are curious how the gap between Mr. Trump and traditional conservatives over trade and other major themes will play out in the coming months.\u201cBasically, Trump has a position on trade that no one who has ever been a nominee of any party has ever had \u2014 a 45 percent tariff on goods,\u201d Mr. Stevens, the Romney strategist, said. \u201cHow is that going to work where you have joint efforts between the presidential campaign and the state parties with candidates who want free trade? Are you going to have half the phone bank calling for a 45 percent tariff, and the other half calling for reasonable trade policies?\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growing Unease as British Mutual Funds Block the Exit Doors", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byAs one British mutual fund after another bars its doors to fleeing investors, traders and regulators alike are asking the same question: What does it mean for nervous global markets?So far, the numbers are small enough. Of the 35 billion pounds, or $45 billion, invested in these funds, just under \u00a320 billion has been affected.Yet to see, in real time, fund companies turning away investors because they cannot quickly unload assets that are hard to sell brings to life a nightmare situation that has long kept central bankers and large investment managers awake at night.\u201cThe market has gotten crowded,\u201d said Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yield bonds for Amundi Smith Breeden, a global investment company that manages $1 trillion. \u201cAt some point you have to wonder what happens if all these investors decide to go home.\u201dPerhaps the purest principle of investing in such funds is the understanding that an investor who wants to get out of the fund, or redeem shares, will immediately receive his or her money back.For that to happen, the portfolio manager must either have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell enough stocks or bonds quickly enough to satisfy investors on the run.What the recent developments in Britain clearly show, however, is that British fund companies are less beholden to this principle than their American counterparts.A close reading of their prospectuses reveals blunt language that gives the investment manager every right to halt redemptions under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to protect the interests of investors with a longer-term investment horizon.British fund companies, more so than their American counterparts, are also ready to take drastic steps, beyond just blocking the door, to prevent investors from leaving their funds.Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the largest fund managers in Britain, has marked down the value of the assets in its property fund (as well as its related feeder fund) by 17 percent, a bold move that in effect tells investors: Go ahead and take your money out if you want, but you will pay a price to do so at this time.Hedge funds routinely have rules that lock up investors\u2019 money for a period of time. But American mutual funds are granted such restrictions by the Securities and Exchange Commission only in the most extreme circumstances \u2014 as was the case with Third Avenue.What the moves by these British fund managers have also highlighted is the extent to which fund companies around the world are willing to take risks to satisfy rising investor demand for high-yielding returns when interest rates hover near zero.The yields on these funds can approach 4 percent \u2014 quite attractive when compared with the miserly returns that banks and government securities were offering.In Britain, this push for yield has played out in the booming market for commercial real estate in London and beyond. The Bank of England, in its report, said that property funds issued by British investment companies had exploded to \u00a335 billion from \u00a35 billion since 2009.When it comes to \u201clonger dated and potentially illiquid assets,\u201d as the Bank of England describes these investments, few fit the bill more precisely than the commercial properties to which British fund companies like Aberdeen, Henderson and Columbia Threadneedle offer maximum exposure through their mutual funds.These could range from a row of retail shops in Slough, a town west of London, where the British version of \u201cThe Office\u201d was set, to a prime office development in London. Because skyscrapers and office parks do not trade as securities on an exchange, they are hard to value and sell.And that, experts say, is what makes them a risky proposition for open-ended funds that promise to deliver cash to investors when they ask for it.The contrast with real estate mutual funds in the United States is stark.While large fund companies like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity have open-ended real estate funds that are of a similar size to their British counterparts, they invest a majority of their assets in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which in most cases trade on public exchanges, making them easier to value and sell.Take for example the \u00a34 billion British property fund managed by Henderson, which was one of the funds that prevented investors from pulling out this week. In its annual report for last year, the company said 76 percent of its portfolio was invested in 128 commercial properties, with the rest in cash or real estate investments sold on exchanges.Aberdeen had a similarly constructed portfolio for its \u00a34 billion property fund.By any measure, these are very large portfolio allocations to investments that do not trade on an exchange.For now, investors in London and abroad seem to have taken the British fund moves in stride. While they reflect broader uncertainty about the British real estate market and economy after the referendum, there has not yet been a broad wave of investors looking to exit high-risk, high-return mutual funds around the globe.The words of caution from the Bank of England were jarring nonetheless.\u201cThese funds offer short-term redemptions to investors while in some cases investing in longer-dated and potentially illiquid assets,\u201d the report concluded, warning that a frantic selling spree by investors in the funds could overwhelm securities markets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "N.B.A. to Move All-Star Game From North Carolina", "Date": "2016-07-21", "News": "Supported byThe move was among the most prominent consequences since the law, which also bars transgender people from using bathrooms in public buildings that do not correspond with their birth gender, was passed in March.The league, which has become increasingly involved in social issues, said that both it and the Hornets, the N.B.A. team based in Charlotte, had been talking to state officials about changing the law but that time had run out because of the long lead time needed to stage the game. The N.B.A. said it hoped the game could be played in Charlotte in 2019, with the clear implication that the law would have to be changed before then.\u201cWhile we recognize that the N.B.A. cannot choose the law in every city, state and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law,\u201d a statement by the league said.Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina issued a blistering statement soon after the announcement by the N.B.A. He said \u201cthe sports and entertainment elite,\u201d among others, had \u201cmisrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present.\u201dMr. McCrory did not specifically refer to the N.B.A. in his statement, but he said that \u201cAmerican families should be on notice that the selective corporate elite are imposing their political will on communities in which they do business, thus bypassing the democratic and legal process.\u201dOthers weighed in in support of the N.B.A.\u2019s move, including two of its broadcast partners \u2014 Turner Sports and ESPN.In taking the action it did, the N.B.A. is following the path already taken by others. A number of musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr and Itzhak Perlman, canceled concerts in North Carolina to protest the law, and there have been calls for repeal of the legislation by a number of businesses, some of which have canceled plans to create new jobs in the state.All-Star weekend is one of the flashiest and most lucrative events on the league\u2019s annual schedule. In addition to the game, the league arranges three days full of activities for fans. There is a separate game for the league\u2019s rising stars, a dunk contest and a 3-point contest.Now all of that will be held elsewhere next February, with the N.B.A. to announce a new site for the game in the next few weeks.The decision by the N.B.A. comes after its commissioner, Adam Silver, had strongly hinted that such a move might be coming and again thrusts the league into the middle of social issues now gripping the nation, setting the league apart, at least for now, from Major League Baseball, the National Football League and other sports entities.In recent weeks, a number of the N.B.A.\u2019s top players have spoken out in dismay as they reacted to shootings around the country that have left police officers dead in two cities and the police accused of deadly recklessness in several other cases.And last December, the N.B.A. participated in a series of television advertisements denouncing gun violence that aired during its long Christmas Day schedule of games.Players in the N.B.A.\u2019s sister league \u2014 the W.N.B.A. \u2014 have also become vocal. In recent weeks, players on several W.N.B.A. teams wore T-shirts during warm-ups before games that addressed the recent shootings.A number of W.N.B.A. players stated their unhappiness with the fines and they drew support from the Knicks\u2019 Carmelo Anthony, who has been one of the most outspoken N.B.A. players this past month. He said Thursday that he saw no reason for \u201canybody to get fined.\u201dThe action by the N.B.A. is also certain to inject new fervor into the debate about North Carolina\u2019s law, which many people still refer to as House Bill 2.Before its adjournment this month, and in defiance of pleas from public officials and corporate executives in Charlotte, the General Assembly resisted demands that it back away from some of the most contentious elements of the law, which supporters have argued is about public safety, not discrimination.The fate of the law, which the United States Justice Department has challenged as a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, will most likely be settled in court. A federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., will hear arguments next month about whether to block the law while the litigation is pending.Even before the N.B.A.\u2019s action on Thursday, Republicans in North Carolina had signaled repeatedly that the league\u2019s misgivings about the law were unlikely to persuade its supporters.\u201cOur values are not shaped by the N.B.A. or Bruce Springsteen or some opinion poll,\u201d state Representative Phil Shepard, a Republican and a Baptist minister, declared at a rally in April. \u201cWe\u2019re standing strong.\u201dBut it was also in April that Mr. Silver was spelling out how problematic the N.B.A. thought the law was. He noted at the time that the league had a \u201clong record of speaking out where we see discrimination.\u2019\u2019Last week, Mr. Silver weighed in again, saying of North Carolina\u2019s legislators: \u201cWe were frankly hoping that they would make some steps toward modifying the legislation and frankly I was disappointed that they didn\u2019t.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether any other major sports organization may take action in connection with the North Carolina law. Notably, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament has first- and second-round games scheduled for North Carolina in 2017 and 2018, but has given no indication that it might move them elsewhere.However, Mike Krzyzewski, the coach at Duke, which is in Durham, N.C., and has long been one of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s most prominent basketball teams, has been sharply critical of the North Carolina law.He has been in Las Vegas this week coaching the men\u2019s national basketball team as it trains for next month\u2019s Summer Olympics, and Thursday he said North Carolina had \u201clost a lot\u201d because of the legislation.He had previously described the law as \u201cembarrassing.\u201dChris Sgro, the executive director of Equality North Carolina and the only openly gay member of the state\u2019s General Assembly, said in a telephone interview Thursday that the N.B.A. was making a strong statement by removing one of its marquee events from Charlotte.\u201cThe state of North Carolina grossly overreached by passing the worst anti-L.G.B.T. bill in the nation, and they have cost us the N.B.A. All-Star Game,\u201d Mr. Sgro said. \u201cThe blame for $100 million in economic loss and the impact that it has on the city of Charlotte and the entire state is squarely at the feet of the McCrory machine.\u201dState legislators are not scheduled to reconvene until January.\u201cI could very well see a special session to deal with this issue,\u201d Mr. Sgro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to sustain incredible economic harm if we don\u2019t repeal House Bill 2.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steinway\u2019s Grand Ambitions for Its Pianos in China", "Date": "2016-07-09", "News": "Supported byNINGBO, China \u2014 Dozens of girls in tiaras and boys in tuxedos who dreamed of becoming China\u2019s next musical sensation stared at the beast onstage. At nine feet long and nearly 1,000 pounds, with a steely black sheen and a price of more than $200,000, the Steinway & Sons D-274 concert grand piano seemed designed to intimidate.There were whispers that the piano had come from far away, in Germany; that it could kill you in an instant if it rolled off the stage; that it had the power to turn even the sloppiest of scales into material primed for Carnegie Hall.\u201cIt\u2019s flawless, exquisite, with a special sound,\u201d said Li Wei, the mother of an 11-year-old boy who had come to the theater to take part in the final round of the Steinway & Sons International Youth Piano Competition in China last winter.\u201cEveryone wants a Steinway,\u201d said Xiao Yunchu, a quiet 13-year-old who favored the pyrotechnics of the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt. \u201cBut none of us can afford it.\u201dSteinway, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious musical instrument brands, is looking to China to breathe new life into lackluster sales. To succeed, the company will need more than smart marketing. It will need to fine-tune a cultural mind-set in a country that once dismissed pianos as bourgeois luxuries.Steinway dealers have to convince their wealthier clientele that the instruments make good investments, avoiding the overly aggressive sales tactics that tripped up some early efforts. They have to educate parents about the potential payoff of buying a piano that can cost as much as an apartment. And they need to woo music students who are increasingly turning to lower-cost keyboards and so-called smart pianos, which use lights, iPads and other technical tools to teach basic skills.The company, known for its painstaking craftsmanship, has grudgingly entered the digital game. The new Steinway Spirio is a high-tech take on the jazz-era player piano, loaded with standard classical fare as well as Chinese tunes, including local pop hits like \u201cThe Moon Represents My Heart\u201d and compositions like \u201cThe Yellow River\u201d Piano Concerto, a piece that dates to the Cultural Revolution.In China, Steinway sees potential in what it calls the \u201ctiger mom\u201d phenomenon, middle-class parents willing to spend small fortunes to produce high-achieving children with musical talent. By some estimates, the country has as many as 40 million piano students, compared with six million in the United States.\u201cIn America, you\u2019ve already had the piano for hundreds of years,\u201d said Lang Lang, a classical pianist with a rock star flair who is one of China\u2019s most prominent musicians. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s fresher, it\u2019s newer. Everyone wants to play.\u201dSteinway has pitched its pianos both as durable instruments and luxurious artifacts. It has recruited celebrities like Mr. Lang to offer endorsements, which carry special force in the crowded Chinese marketplace. And it has infused its messaging with themes of success and ambition.As China\u2019s middle class swells to some 200 million people, many Western brands like Steinway have arrived in search of a new generation to offset slowing sales at home. Mattel, the toymaker, has entered the market with products like Violin Soloist Barbie. La Perla, an Italian lingerie maker founded in 1954, has 11 stores in mainland China, its fastest-growing market.For Steinway, China has proved to be a shot in the arm. Sales increased more than 15 percent a year over the last decade, far outpacing the single-digit growth of the United States and Europe. China is now Steinway\u2019s largest market for pianos outside the United States, representing about one-third of global sales. In a sign of China\u2019s importance, the company next year will unveil a 60,000-square-foot headquarters for Asia in Shanghai, complete with a recital hall.The youth piano competition in Ningbo from Dec. 10 to 13, the seventh of its kind on the mainland, was the marquee event of the year, a chance to imprint the Steinway lore into the minds of thousands of students, parents and teachers. Students ages 6 to 16 came from across China to Ningbo, a Silk Road trading port three hours south of Shanghai, to compete for an opportunity to perform overseas in Hamburg, the birthplace of Brahms and one of Steinway\u2019s main hubs.Over lunch at a downtown hotel, Steinway executives celebrated the success of the competition, which attracted more than 15,000 applicants, a record. Steinway executives said they dreamed of a day when the company\u2019s pianos filled living rooms across China and the company name was as well known in the country as Gucci. But they acknowledged that if Steinway were to thrive in China, it would need a cultural shift in a country where low-end pianos have dominated the market for decades.As the competition kicked off in Ningbo and children took to the stage to perform Mozart, Brahms and Gershwin, the president of Steinway\u2019s Asia division, Werner Husmann, said the piano maker would need to establish a new audience in China to survive.\u201cThese people are our customers of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep piano playing popular.\u201dWherever Mr. Husmann went during a trip to China for Steinway in the late 1990s, he saw what he began referring to as P.S.O.s, or piano-shaped objects \u2014 instruments that had long ago lost their music-making abilities. Some had uneven legs and drifted toward the audience during performances. Others sat on street corners, rain or shine.Even so, Mr. Husmann came away with a sense that there was a love of Western music in Chinese society, and there would soon be a market for high-quality instruments. When he returned to Hamburg to sell his colleagues on the idea, they laughed.\u201cThe first reaction was more or less that I should see a doctor to do a mental check,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018What the hell can you do in China?\u2019\u201dSteinway had been selling its artisanal pianos, each consisting of more than 12,000 parts, to China since 1880. But many employees were wary of establishing a permanent outpost in a place where cheap manufactured goods were king.Fans liked to say Steinway invented the modern grand piano. The company has 127 patents. Unlike its competitors, Steinway refused to churn out hundreds of pianos each day by machine. And it kept factories in its two main bases in Queens and Hamburg, even as other instrument makers like Yamaha moved manufacturing operations from the United States to low-cost Asian countries.When Steinway opened an office in Shanghai in 2004, most of its sales in China were to music conservatories. It was not until the global financial crisis struck four years later that the importance of the Chinese market became clear.As the world economy weakened, piano sales in the United States and Europe, already in decline, fell sharply. In 1909, 364,000 pianos were sold annually in the United States; by 2009, that number had slumped to 30,000, according to the National Association of Music Merchants. Doomsday scenarios predicted the extinction of pianos.Despite Steinway\u2019s devout following \u2014 the company says it is the instrument of choice for 98 percent of the world\u2019s performing pianists, including Billy Joel and the Argentine musician Martha Argerich \u2014 it was not immune to the slowdown. Shipments of Steinway pianos dropped substantially in 2009, and the company was forced to lay off workers at its factory in Queens.While sales revived somewhat, the downturn exposed the limits of Steinway\u2019s traditional markets. As they looked to the future, Steinway\u2019s leaders decided to take the company private, away from the short-term glare of public shareholders focused on quarterly earnings.In 2013, Steinway was sold for $512 million to Mr. Paulson, and musicians worried he would interfere with Steinway\u2019s painstaking production process to increase revenue. Steinway was making only about 2,000 pianos a year in New York and Hamburg.But Mr. Paulson, an amateur pianist with four Steinway pianos, did not change the company\u2019s methods, which he believed were crucial to dominating the high-end market. He urged the company to move more aggressively in emerging countries, where a growing middle class was spending heavily on education. Steinway drew up plans for a hybrid acoustic-digital instrument and broadly ramped up production of traditional pianos to meet demand.When officials from Chongqing, a metropolis in southwest China, held a concert in 2011 to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, they invited Steinway to take part. Li Yundi, a prominent pianist and endorser of Steinway, played a program of traditional Chinese songs. Onstage sat a nine-foot concert grand painted solid red, China\u2019s national color. A Steinway & Sons logo was displayed prominently on its side. Thousands gathered in the sweltering heat to watch the performance, and many lined up afterward to snap pictures with the piano.His father was skeptical. His mother worried he would drive the family business into turmoil.But Nick Liu, a 26-year-old heir to a large musical instrument company in eastern China, was determined. He would open a store focused exclusively on selling the brand of pianos he had worshiped during his days as a budding concert pianist.Mr. Liu\u2019s father had tried selling Steinway pianos a decade earlier with limited success. The concept of a high-end instrument is unfamiliar in a country where the average income for an urban middle-class worker was about $12,000, according to a report last year by Goldman Sachs. Most people won\u2019t spend more than $1,000 on a piano.Mr. Liu, who studied piano and finance at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, sensed an opportunity. He believed that China\u2019s nouveaux riches were in the market for new symbols of wealth. \u201cI knew rich people wanted something more subtle to show their taste and sophistication,\u201d he said.Shortly after New Year\u2019s Day last year, in a sleepy business complex in Ningbo that housed a fine-wine store and an art gallery, Mr. Liu opened a Steinway dealership, the latest addition to his family\u2019s business empire, Tianmu Music.Mr. Liu found the space with the help of Wang Zhaochun, a technology executive and one of Steinway\u2019s most enthusiastic Chinese customers, who owned the building.Mr. Wang was an avid fan of sports cars and watches. But his latest obsession was a red Steinway concert grand piano valued at more than $300,000, which he showed off to friends in a private salon decorated with fur rugs and bottles of Royal Salute whisky on the building\u2019s ninth floor.\u201cI wanted to buy something special,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like a Rolls-Royce.\u201dIn his store on the ground floor, Mr. Liu arranged dozens of pianos, polishing them with cloths made of chicken skin to make each look as seductive as possible. He turned an empty wall into a timeline of Steinway history, beginning with a portrait of Henry E. Steinway, the company\u2019s founder, wearing a top hat and holding a cane. He created a mock living room, complete with Steinway-branded teacups and tissue boxes, to help customers visualize high-end pianos in their own homes.Yet Mr. Liu struggled to make a sale. \u201cIt was hell,\u201d he said. \u201cNo customers, just three employees in the store and me.\u201dHis sales team, accustomed to using a pushy manner to peddle far cheaper products, had difficulty connecting with elite customers. Mr. Liu, a classically trained pianist, felt more comfortable speaking about the musical aspects of the instruments than investment value.Selling a Steinway in China is a particularly trying task. Unlike sports cars or watches, pianos are not easy to show off. Many older people in China never developed a talent for playing the piano. The instrument was shunned during the Cultural Revolution, and widespread poverty in the ensuing decades made it inaccessible to many Chinese families.Steinway has depended on salesmen in more than 25 cities to educate and excite its customers. The company has instructed them to play up the potential return on investment of a Steinway \u2014 a message that resonates strongly with frugal Chinese families \u2014 and to speak at length about the company\u2019s history.Mr. Liu thought back to his days as an intern in China selling English lessons to working-class families. He remembered the time he had sold more than $6,000 worth of lessons to a woman who made only $460 a month.\u201cThat was an achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like \u2018The Wolf of Wall Street.\u2019 You have to figure out their motivations and their pressure point.\u201dMr. Liu invited families in for concerts. He began courting music teachers and local performers. He recruited a Bentley salesman to help market the pianos to affluent customers.\u201cWe had to convince them that pianos should be a noble good, not something people buy from the grocery store,\u201d he said.By March, Mr. Liu had made his first sale, and he was beginning to learn to accommodate the peculiar requests of his clients. A customer called one morning to say she wanted to buy a grand piano costing more than $20,000. But there was a catch: She demanded that it be delivered at 8 p.m. that same day, on the advice of her spiritual master, who had said that time would accord with the laws of feng shui.Mr. Liu scrambled to make it happen.By December, Mr. Liu had sold 50 pianos at his store in Ningbo. In his office, he kept a supply of single-malt whiskey he sometimes used to celebrate milestones. At the end of his first year, it had begun to run low.In a sleek office tower in the heart of Beijing\u2019s high-tech hub, 60 engineers and 20 musicians work day and night to perfect a product they hope will one day compete with traditional instruments from makers like Steinway.The device is a smart piano known as the One, and it uses synchronized lights and video games to show children how to play the piano \u2014 no teacher required. With a compact design and a price starting around $600, it has proved to be popular among Chinese parents; the company sold 85,000 units in two years.Founded by an engineer with no background in music, the company that produces the One, Xiaoyezi Technology, has not been shy about its ambitions. \u201cWitness the rebirth of the classical piano,\u201d reads one advertisement.There are now some 300,000 digital pianos in China, about the same number as acoustic pianos. Some forecasts say the total could reach one million within five years.For generations, Steinway has thrived by ignoring competitors claiming to have reinvented the piano. But the surging popularity of digital pianos like the One, as well as concerns that a slowing Chinese economy could hurt demand, has prompted the company to reconsider.In Beijing this month, Steinway unveiled a product that executives heralded as one of the most significant innovations in the company\u2019s 163-year history: Spirio, an acoustic piano equipped with a digital brain so that it can play without human intervention.Spirio, which starts at about $147,000 in China, traces its roots to a generation of player pianos that filled homes across America in the early 1900s, the golden age of pianos. It was a time when jazz and ragtime flew off the keys, and Steinway was producing more than 6,000 pianos a year, triple what it makes today.Steinway sees China as the best shot at rekindling the fervor of that era. Indeed, for two months last year, the company sold more grand pianos in China than in the United States.In a somewhat frustrating sign of the company\u2019s growing popularity in China, imitators have begun cropping up, including small piano shops that have repurposed Steinway\u2019s lyre logo. One company even usurped the name to sell water heaters for showers with built-in televisions.But Steinway executives face a persistent worry. No matter how much money the company spends promoting its craftsmanship, no matter how many performers endorse its pianos, China\u2019s middle class might ultimately be unwilling to make the leap to high-end instruments.\u201cWhen you rule the piano world for 160 years, you can get complacent,\u201d said Mr. Husmann, the company executive. \u201cIt can lead to a mentality of, \u2018Everyone needs a Steinway anyway.\u2019 Steinway has to be a fighting hero \u2014 we have to fight every day for our business.\u201dDu Ruizhe, a 15-year-old piano student in Beijing, was the model of a next-generation Steinway customer. She grew up revering the Steinway name, associating it with great pianists like Arthur Rubinstein. She practiced five hours a day \u2014 six on weekends \u2014 and was ecstatic when she learned she had qualified for the Steinway piano competition in Ningbo.But at home, she played on a grand piano made by Kawai, a low-cost Japanese maker. Steinway pianos, she said, were simply too expensive.\u201cIt feels like Steinway is getting famous,\u201d said the teenager, who plans to become a piano teacher. \u201cBut in many people\u2019s eyes it\u2019s still a luxury, and until that changes, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll be rushing to get it.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Sarah Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Introducing The Upshot\u2019s Presidential Prediction Model", "Date": "2016-07-19", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceFor now, at least, Hillary Clinton has a 76 percent chance of defeating Donald Trump to become president of the United States.Our model suggests Mrs. Clinton is a strong favorite in 14 states and the District of Columbia, enough to give her 186 of the 270 electoral votes she needs to win the White House. Add to this eight more states that polls currently show are leaning Democratic \u2014 including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton would have 275 electoral votes and the presidency.But, with 16 weeks remaining in the campaign, a lot can change. Using the same model, we would have said that Bill Clinton had less than a 20 percent chance to win the presidency with roughly four months to go in 1992. It was only after Ross Perot left the race and the Democrats rallied around Mr. Clinton after the Democratic convention that his polls improved. And they improved sharply. One month later, he was an 84 percent favorite.This kind of polling volatility should be expected, particularly with party conventions at hand. It is one reason that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s probability of victory is not higher. Current polling averages suggest a four-point victory in the national popular vote for Mrs. Clinton, if nothing changes. But we expect changes between now and Election Day.The Upshot is not the only news organization trying to forecast election results. We believe each model provides useful glimpses of possible futures, so we are compiling forecasts from a variety of them into one easy-to-digest table.Viewed side by side, the differences among the models become clearer. Arizona, for example, is rated as a tossup by FiveThirtyEight, while our model has not yet seen enough polling evidence to revise its assessment of Arizona\u2019s recent history as a Republican-leaning state. Similarly, while the betting markets rate New Mexico as almost a sure thing in the Democratic column, our model is not as certain, giving Mr. Trump a 21 percent chance to upset Mrs. Clinton there.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.Our model is slow to move.This is by design. Our model starts with a weighted average of polls in each state, giving polls conducted more recently and polls with a larger sample size a greater weight in the average. At this point in the election cycle, it uses a longer time window to calculate these averages. This steadiness means it is more stable and less inclined to chase after the most recent poll. But it also means it is slower to react to developing trends, such as recent polling that may indicate a tightening race. This can be a feature or a bug, depending on your perspective. Preconvention polls are informative, but history suggests that it is a mistake to place too much emphasis on a week\u2019s worth of polling.Let\u2019s say you want to forecast the average margin of national polls for the next month. Would you rather take the average of the polls from the previous two weeks or average every poll from the previous two months? More often than not, you\u2019d be better off taking the average of the longer period. This informs the approach taken by our model.That said, we expect the simulations in our model to converge rapidly over the next month or two, as the conventions end and polling becomes more predictive of the final outcome.Distributions are more interesting than averages.This is illustrated best by seeing our electoral distributions side by side: The FiveThirtyEight histogram is wider and flatter than ours. It assigns a greater chance that something highly unusual will happen, while ours thinks that the course of this election will look pretty much like the ones that have come before it. For example, we think there is only about a 1 percent chance that Mrs. Clinton will get fewer than 160 electoral votes. The FiveThirtyEight model assigns that prospect an 8 percent chance.Fundamentals say it\u2019s a good year for Mr. Trump, but we don\u2019t rely much on fundamentals. Although our model uses how states voted in previous presidential elections as a starting point, it is almost entirely a polls-based model.Our model is well calibrated.One of the differences between a model and a simpler polling average is that the model knows how wrong it has been in the past. So when we say that we think Mrs. Clinton has a 14 percent chance of winning North Dakota, we mean that, judging from how the polling averages have moved in previous election cycles, candidates in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s position have won in one in seven similar situations in past elections.Of course, there is no guarantee that this election will turn out the way that elections have in the past, a flaw that is common to any forecasting model. These numbers are our best guesses using the information we have.Expect shifts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Object Lessons: The New Museum Explores Why We Keep Things", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Curators at the New Museum have created an exhibit with over 4,000 objects that examines the various ways we collect and own items.Supported byWe live in a sharing economy of collaborative consumption \u2014 services, not stuff. Crowdsourcing, peer-to-peer rentals like Airbnb: An interest, exemplified by millennials, in a temporary ownership of goods.Apps, not objects.With over 4,000 objects representing more than two dozen collectors, including contemporary artists making art conceived by collecting, Massimiliano Gioni, the museum\u2019s artistic director, and his team of curators have mounted a remarkable series of object lessons about what it means to \u201ckeep,\u201d the relationship of possession to loss, the madness inherent in love, and the undeniable importance of the individual\u2019s voice in recording and interpreting history and its sweep.\u201cThe Keeper\u201d is its own cultural crowdsourcing, including Korbinian Aigner\u2019s postcard-size still lifes of fruit, painted by Mr. Aigner, a German Catholic priest, while interred in the Dachau concentration camp, where he cultivated apples until his escape. Also on view are 3,000 photographs of people with their teddy bears, assembled by Ydessa Hendeles, a contemporary Canadian artist.Mr. Aigner\u2019s pomological studies were most likely an act of survival, focusing on the reassuring rationality of record-making during the irrational decimation by the Reich. And, like much of \u201cThe Keeper,\u201d Ms. Hendeles\u2019s \u201cPartners (The Teddy Bear Project)\u201d is a kind of unexpected infiltration into ordinary lives, a backstage look at the familiar spectacle of the 20th century as we think we know it.\u201cI don\u2019t want to flatten it by saying it\u2019s a show about collections,\u201d Mr. Gioni said, sitting in the museum recently, concerned that many people associate objects with \u201cluxury objects,\u201d especially in the art world. Mr. Gioni explained that part of his intention for \u201cThe Keeper\u201d was to look at ways of collecting and owning things.\u201cIt\u2019s not the economic value that makes the value of the object,\u201d he said. \u201cNotions of values are more complicated than keeping score at auction.\u201dThere are no masterpieces in the exhibition, as one would expect of a major museum show.\u201cThere\u2019s no hierarchy,\u201d Lisa Phillips, the New Museum\u2019s director, said. \u201cEach has its integrity as a project.\u201dYet every piece is a masterwork in its right. The exhibition includes the photographed interiors of \u201cSociological Record\u201d by Zofia Rydet. In 1978, at 67, she took up photography with the purpose of documenting every household in Poland, as a way to reveal people through the things they lived with. Harry Smith, an American filmmaker and ethnomusicologist, collected string figures, also in the show, made by indigenous peoples around the world. In an interview in 1969, Mr. Smith said, \u201cAs far as I know, the string figures are the only universal thing other than singing.\u201d\u201cEvery good artist is some sort of an outsider,\u201d Mr. Gioni said.Every collector is some sort of outsider, too, looking in, trying to understand the experience of being here.Ultimately, even what we choose not to keep defines us. The declutter gurus, yard sales and online exchanges \u2014 the arcades of unwanted waste \u2014 are powerful cultural forces, too.Why do we keep? Beyond preservation \u2014 insuring the safety of a thing \u2014 keeping can be an act of self-preservation.\u201cIt is about what brings us together as people,\u201d said Ms. Hendeles, who archived images of people posing with teddy bears. Her intention was to create a portrait of the century, much like the photographer August Sander\u2019s documentary project \u201cFace of Our Time\u201d in 1929.The cuddly teddy bear, sometimes ratty with affection, turned out to be an icon of the first order, appearing like a totemic ghost in thousands of images. In one, a Nazi wearing an arm sling holds a bear on his knee. Another shows children who later died in the Holocaust. The toys were considered totems of protection and sympathy in grief, such as the black bear produced in 1912 to memorialize the Titanic\u2019s victims.Ms. Hendeles\u2019s project is displayed in a two-story architectural setting meant to resemble an academic library with steel mezzanines and polished wood vitrines.\u201cIt questions the authority of the museum, the past, and what we think we know,\u201d she said, an intention shared by Mr. Gioni\u2019s show.Ms. Hendeles is the only child of two survivors of Auschwitz.\u201cI was touching on unconscious needs that I had, because I didn\u2019t have any family photographs,\u201d she said of the genesis of the project. \u201cI\u2019m keeping other people\u2019s memories.\u201d One might call \u201cPartners\u201d a family album of man.We keep to tell, too. In a small pocket of the exhibition are objects from the National Museum of Beirut, rescued by Maurice Chehab, its director general of antiquities until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. Mr. Chehab saved artifacts by encasing them in concrete.But as the surviving objects bear witness, preservation can be a sadly poetic concept. They are disfigured and transformed by conflict, melted by hate.Shinro Ohtake\u2019s scrapbooks are more recent records. Mr. Ohtake, an artist and musician, began in 1977 a series of book-based assemblages that gather the urban residue of his own daily life: clippings from magazines, matchbooks, ticket stubs \u2014 the cheeky garbage of an active mind.In its devotional richness, each of Mr. Ohtake\u2019s books has the quality of a contemporary Book of Hours.In an email, he explained that he thought of them as communicating \u201cthe potential of the streets of the time, as a site where people lived their lives.\u201d Mr. Ohtake, living in London in 1977, moved frequently and wanted a medium of expression, like a diary, that would be easy to carry and work on.\u201cTraveling is like a collage of everyday time,\u201d he wrote. Speaking as a musician \u2014 Mr. Ohtake has led two noise-rock bands \u2014 he said that he thought \u201cthe most extreme noise is silence.\u201dObjects, then, would be the loudest things you could live with.A video, \u201cThe Last Silent Movie,\u201d by Susan Hiller, provides a lilting, unsettling musical air to the fourth floor of \u201cThe Keeper.\u201d Ms. Hiller, an anthropologist who became an artist, compiled audio samples of endangered and extinct languages, playing them in a video on a black screen with transcribed subtitles. The singsong and staccato of the work gives voice to the recognition that collecting can be a requiem.More optimistically in the same exhibition space is a thoughtful conversation: Ms. Bove\u2019s installation of sculptures with works by Mr. Scarpa, known for his modern redesigns of museums. \u201cWhen I first saw his work, I felt shocked \u2014 the strategies that he produced for historical work,\u201d Ms. Bove said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s counter to our traditions of museum design, to be neutral.\u201d Ms. Bove created spatial juxtapositions and interactions that gave the group an intelligent integrity that is a hallmark of a collection greater than the sum of its parts.By its nature, collecting is subjective, even at its most encyclopedic. When collecting strives to become objective, the eccentricity veers into obsession.Oliver Croy, an Austrian artist who discovered 387 homemade building models in a bric-a-brac shop in Vienna in 1993, bought them, lived with them in a 131-square-foot apartment for several years and is no longer collecting, having skirted its edges.\u201cI did therapy, so I gave up on that,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. The models, built in the 1950s and \u201960s by an insurance clerk, Peter Fritz, were given to the Wien Museum in Vienna.In another project, a keeper and the subject of his collection have forged a bond, with a rare self-knowledge on each end. For 62 years, Ye Jinglu sat for an annual studio portrait, the first in 1901. The photographs, shifting imperceptibly in background, costume and the real-time register of Mr. Ye\u2019s advancing age, are a virtuosic portrait of a man\u2019s life. In the last photograph, the confident-looking dandy of the initial one has softly disappeared, and the world has irrevocably changed.The collection was discovered by Tong Bingxue, a photography collector, in 2007. In his mind, Mr. Tong chased Mr. Ye back into the past. \u201cI repeatedly perused the album,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cthe man patiently telling me his stories by his appearance.\u201d Mr. Tong contacted anyone who might have known Mr. Ye, including immediate family.\u201cI leafed gingerly through the album again, the leaps from the Qing dynasty, to the Republic of China, and then, to the new China.\u201d As he contemplated Mr. Ye\u2019s life, he was able to contemplate his own. He called his relationship to this man \u201cuncuttable.\u201dMr. Gioni, the curator, writes in his catalog essay that the desperate need to be extraordinary lies \u201cat the root of human nature.\u201d Most overtly it lies within the heart of collectors. But he concludes with the realization, \u201charsh and comforting,\u201d that we are, in fact, just like everybody else.One of Mr. Gioni\u2019s keepers might not agree. Wilson Bentley, born to a family of farmers in Vermont in 1865, was fascinated from childhood by the weather. He attached a microscope to a bellows camera and captured on film the intricate pattern of a single snowflake.As is now generally undisputed, each is unique. And so perhaps, as collectors \u2014 despite all that we \u201cshare\u201d \u2014 are we all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Afghans Go to Syria to Fight for Its Government, and Anguish Results", "Date": "2016-07-28", "News": "Supported byHERAT, Afghanistan \u2014 One woman here in the western Afghan city of Herat said she had begged her son not to go fight in the Syrian war, but he charged off anyway, leaving a wife and three children behind. A man overhearing her story came over to say that his son had left two months ago, and since then the family has been desperate for news about him.Another woman, Khadija, whose son Hassan had joined Afghan brigades fighting alongside the Syrian government, said he had been pulled into the vicious conflict for the same reasons most of the young men in the neighborhood had decided to go: \u201cHe could not find work,\u201d she said.A teenager standing on the edge of the group, listening to the parents, said those were hardly isolated stories among the Afghan Shiites of Herat. The neighborhood, he said, \u201cis full of them.\u201dAfghanistan has been hollowed out as its citizens have fled poverty and war, many seeking work in Pakistan, Iran or Persian Gulf nations, or risking the perilous trail to Europe. But this specific emigration pattern \u2014 of thousands of young men flowing into neighboring Iran and then on to fight alongside the Syrian government and its allies \u2014 has provoked extraordinary anguish for families here and for Afghanistan\u2019s government, particularly over the past year.Leaving a country racked by decades of war, the young Afghans who choose the path to Syria then fall into peril on the bloody front lines of Aleppo, Homs or other battlegrounds. Iranian state news media and some Afghan officials suggest that hundreds have been killed in battles over the past year.The promise of urgently needed salaries \u2014 or at least compensation for hardship or death, often paid by the Iranian government \u2014 has done little to comfort the families left behind, or to ease their regret at the misery that forced their sons to flee in the first place.In Khadija\u2019s case, her son Hassan\u2019s decision to go to Syria came after her husband, who is disabled, lost his land. But she insisted that she and her husband had urged Hassan not to go.Though the Afghan men who leave for Syria soon face the miseries of another incessant war, they have one advantage over some other Afghan migrants: They are less likely to be deported and forced to return to Afghanistan. At the border crossing with Iran, a 90-minute drive from Herat, at least 30 buses arrive several times a week, filled with Afghans deported from Iran. Some carry families who have lived illegally in Iran for years.But most of the deported Afghans were young men \u2014 some as young as 10, according to aid workers with the International Organization for Migration \u2014 who stole across the border desperate to find work. Many said they would return to Iran as soon as they could.Some of the Afghan fighters head to Syria for religious reasons, seeing the battle as a war against Sunni extremists or choosing to defend Shiite holy sites in Syria alongside other Shiite militiamen from Lebanon or Iraq. Others were coerced or duped into fighting, say human rights groups. But most were enticed by financial benefits, including the promise of legal residence for the fighters and their families in Iran, said Abdul Rahim Ghulami. He is a local official in Herat who said his brother-in-law was a commander of an Afghan unit fighting in Aleppo.Iran\u2019s government provides a few weeks of training and flies the men to Syria, where they join one of the Afghan brigades. Those units are sometimes viewed with suspicion by their own allies: In interviews in Syria, some of the other fighters from pro-government militias disparaged the Afghans as too young and poorly trained.A shop owner in Damascus named Ahmed who works near the Sayyida Zainab mosque, a revered site for Shiites, said the numbers of Afghan fighters guarding the mosque had increased in the last six months. They were a sorrowful lot who complained about their lives in Iran or Afghanistan when he talked with them, he said, but said they faced little choice if they wanted to support their families. At least if the men die, they die as martyrs in a holy war, he added, giving only his first name because he did not want to be punished.Casualties among the Afghan fighters were high, said Mr. Ghulami, who lived in Iran for 24 years. He said he visited the Iranian town of Mashhad two months ago and saw that its Afghan quarter was blanketed with black banners that signaled a house in mourning.The size of the outflow from Afghanistan itself has been harder to tally, because the government\u2019s disapproval has led families to stay quiet. Mr. Ghulami, who serves as a local mayor in Jebrail, a Hazara district of Herat with roughly 100,000 residents, estimated that 20 percent of the families there had someone serving in Syria. There was no way to confirm that number: no funerals of Afghan fighters, and no black banners to honor the dead.But in Jebrail, along with another Hazara neighborhood of Herat, called Khatim al-Anbiya, it is easy to find the relatives or friends the Afghan fighters had left behind.At the cigarette kiosk where he worked in Jebrail, a boy named Sayed Ali remembered his neighbor and classmate, Habibullah, 20, who ran off to Syria a few years ago, when he was still a teenager. This year, word came back that Habibullah had been killed in the war. His family packed up the house and moved to Iran, granted legal residence there because of the boy\u2019s death, Sayed Ali said.Another high school student, named Jawad, disappeared from his home in Khatim al-Anbiya two winters ago, leaving his family to assume he had gone to Iran to find work, according to his uncle, Mohamed Ibrahim.When his parents last heard from Jawad, he said he was in Syria, and told his father he was preparing to come home. Then, eight or nine months ago, a man brought the news that Jawad had been shot in the head and killed.Mr. Ibrahim said he was not sure what took Jawad to Syria \u2014 \u201cNo one can read anyone\u2019s heart,\u201d he said \u2014 but said he thought the boy was just looking for work. \u201cThey go there because of poverty,\u201d he said. Jawad\u2019s family left for Iran after he was killed, leaving behind their one-story house and their cow, their most valuable possession, Mr. Ibrahim said.Yazdanbeg Yazdani, a 50-year-old resident of Jebrail with family in Iran, said that a year ago, he received a call from Iran telling him his younger brother, named Yunus, had joined the war as an officer and was killed in a suicide bombing attack.Mr. Yazdani was unsure why his brother, who was 48, felt compelled to fight \u2014 whether he supported the Syrian government, or had been forced into battle, or simply needed the money. The brothers had been separated decades ago, when Yunus moved to Syria \u2014 their family fractured by migration, like so many in Afghanistan. Mr. Yazdani could not attend his brother\u2019s funeral, which was held in Iran. But his family there sent him pictures of the service.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting from Herat; Zahra Nader from Kabul, Afghanistan; and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister", "Date": "2016-07-11", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Theresa May emerged on Monday as Britain\u2019s next prime minister, becoming the second woman, after Margaret Thatcher, to hold that post. She faces multiple challenges as soon as she takes office, from negotiating the nation\u2019s departure from the European Union to addressing deep social and political divisions to reviving a wounded economy.Her victory came on another day of rapid developments in British politics and set in motion a process that officials said would put her in 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night, succeeding David Cameron.A Conservative like Mrs. Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990, Ms. May, 59, has won a reputation for steeliness in her tenure as home secretary. She has pledged to negotiate a deal to leave the European Union that would reassert Britain\u2019s ability to control immigration, a central issue in the referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the bloc.Yet unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. May is seen as a relative moderate and on Monday she promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts.Ms. May said that she was \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the \u201cprivileged few,\u201d but for all.The British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday.Mr. Cameron\u2019s statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May\u2019s rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed.Ms. Leadsom had already faced accusations \u2014 which she denied \u2014 of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not.Surrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dThe turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party\u2019s rank-and-file members.Last week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a \u201cbloody difficult woman,\u201d noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher.Far from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc.\u201cKen Clarke might have found me to be a \u2018bloody difficult woman.\u2019 The next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker,\u201d she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive, ITV reported.But in a speech on Monday, Ms. May outlined an economic agenda unlike that of Mrs. Thatcher, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes.Ms. May has also been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany who, like Ms. May, is the daughter of a clergyman and is known for her no-nonsense, methodical and pragmatic approach.The post-referendum turmoil in Britain has also gripped the opposition Labour Party, prompting a challenge against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough against a British withdrawal from Europe. There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute.Nevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May\u2019s democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election.Her top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain.On Monday, Ms. May insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d as she sought to reassure right-wingers that she was committed to the policy, adding that \u201cthere will be no attempt to remain inside the E.U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum.\u201dBut, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation.Ms. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of non-Europeans, which the government had the power to curb.Ms. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain\u2019s position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe\u2019s single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers.One important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a two-year deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe\u2019s leaders to act more quickly.On Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many pro-Brexit voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England.\u201cThere is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,\u201d she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of \u201cone nation\u201d Conservatism.Speaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: \u201cWhether you\u2019re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on July 12 about the emergence of Theresa May as Britain\u2019s new prime minister referred incorrectly in some editions to her place in British history. She is the second woman to serve as Britain\u2019s prime minister, not the \u201csecond woman after Margaret Thatcher\u201d to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Funds That Find Speedsters, Even in a Slow Economy", "Date": "2016-07-15", "News": "Supported byIf the company\u2019s profit starts to grow as expected, they increase the stake to a \u201ccrop\u201d position. The crops are 30 to 35 stocks that account for 70 percent to 75 percent of the fund\u2019s assets, he said. They are typically about 3 percent of assets each. Once the company\u2019s growth falters or the managers find something they like better, they \u201charvest\u201d by selling. \u201cA careful capital allocation strategy is our risk control.\u201dThe Artisan managers are patient with their plantings. The LKQ Corporation, for example, has been a holding since 2004, Mr. Cepukenas said. The company distributes auto parts to body shops, especially parts recycled from wrecked cars throughout North America. \u201cRecently, they\u2019ve made acquisitions in Europe and are replicating the model abroad,\u201d he said.Another longer-term bet is Guidewire Software, which serves the property and casualty insurance industry. Many of these insurers rely on aging, custom-built software, Mr. Cepukenas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on them to make their systems more efficient \u2014 consumers are demanding better access via the internet and mobile,\u201d he said. Guidewire\u2019s software replaces the old systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge addressable market.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Artisan fund, with an expense ratio of 1.02 percent, returned 8.85 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.46 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\u201cIt\u2019s the same investment process for each, and we can have some overlap of the holdings, \u201d said Tom M. Brakel, a senior portfolio manager.Each member of the team has a sector specialty and decides which stocks in that field the funds will own. Mr. Brakel, who trained as a physician in his native Netherlands, oversees pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. He said he continues to find promising prospects, even though the broader business headlines, such as those about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, can overshadow good news in his sector.\u201cWith the macronoise about \u2018Brexit\u2019 and the U.S. elections, we forget that we\u2019re in the middle of a golden age of drug innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by new science \u2014 personalized medicine and the human genome.\u201dConsider Genmab, a Danish company developing drugs for cancer and other illnesses. It was among Federated Kaufmann\u2019s top 10 holdings on May 31, the most recent data available. Mr. Brakel said its treatment for multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, received early approval from the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cAt the recent annual meeting of the oncologists, people were talking about it having unprecedented efficacy,\u201d he said.A tenet of the growth team\u2019s approach is that they should visit as many companies as possible, Mr. Brakel said. \u201cWhen you ask questions of management, one on one, you get an immediate sense of whether they know what they\u2019re talking about and whether they really know their sector,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick that up from a press release or a PowerPoint presentation. You pick it up when you\u2019re sitting opposite a C.E.O.\u201dThe visits help the eight portfolio managers develop broad networks of contacts in their industries that can lead them to investments.Such knowledge helped Federated Kaufmann decide to invest in Tesaro, a Waltham, Mass., biotech company. Leon O. Moulder, the chief executive, \u201cis a serial entrepreneur,\u201d and the company has reported promising data recently on its ovarian cancer therapy, Mr. Brakel said.The A shares of Federated Kaufmann, with an expense ratio of 1.95 percent, returned 7.5 percent in the second quarter, while the institutional shares of Federated Kaufmann Small Cap, with an expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 7.81 percent.Mr. Bichelmeyer took over his fund a year ago and has rejiggered it. He has halved its number of holdings, from about 100 to 50. \u201cThe average position size has gone up, so now you\u2019ve got a portfolio where every name can make a difference,\u201d he said.As he concentrated the portfolio, Mr. Bichelmeyer also reduced the number of pharmaceutical, semiconductor and information technology hardware companies while adding those that concentrate on software and information technology services. He said he especially likes software-as-a-service companies, such as SPS Commerce, which has prospered as retail distribution has grown more complex.\u201cIf you want to be a supplier to Walmart or another large retailer, they\u2019re going to send you a huge rule book you have to follow,\u201d he said. \u201cEstablishing and maintaining compliance with these rules isn\u2019t easy. SPS Commerce\u2019s online software codifies each retailer\u2019s rule book, which allows suppliers to keep up with the constant changes.\u201dOne of the benefits of investing in the smallest software-as-a-service companies is that they can exploit niches that are initially too tiny to make much difference for a Microsoft or Oracle, Mr. Bichelmeyer said. \u201cIn a growth-starved world, these companies offer very attractive long-term growth rates,\u201d he said.The Ivy fund, with an expense ratio of 1.69 percent, returned 11.14 percent in the second quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Want of a Coffeepot, Your Flight Is Delayed", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byItinerariesThe captain is at the controls, the tray tables are stowed, and nobody is smoking in the lavatories. We\u2019ll be taking off shortly.But wait, what about the coffee machines \u2014 are the coffee machines ready for departure?Airlines blame flight delays on many things \u2014 missing paperwork, storms in faraway states, planes stacked up at La Guardia \u2014 but one explanation in particular trips up some travelers. It\u2019s the broken coffee maker in the airplane galley. \u201cNot sure why an @AmericanAir flight has to go back to the gate because of a freakin coffee maker...... that baffles me,\u201d wrote Ryan Fahey on Twitter in February.The miracle of human flight with onboard snacks is one of humanity\u2019s great achievements. How is it, then, that a balky coffeepot can bring a jumbo jet to a dead halt?In the competitive airline industry, even small flight delays matter. They can cascade across the nation, affecting \u201chundreds, if not thousands, of passengers,\u201d Mr. Isom said in an interview. It\u2019s not just about the coffee, he said, it\u2019s \u201cthe most financially sound way to run an airline.\u201dMr. Isom came to American in its 2013 merger with US Airways, where he helped to achieve one of the industry\u2019s best on-time departure records, which means taking off within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. American could use help on that score. At 83 percent for the first three months of the year, American ranked between two of its main rivals, Delta Air Lines (86 percent) and United Airlines (81 percent), according to the Department of Transportation.Mr. Isom declined to say precisely how many of American\u2019s delays are caused by broken coffee makers. The Department of Transportation, which tracks delays, said it couldn\u2019t provide that level of detail.In his quest to get American\u2019s planes off the ground on time, Mr. Isom is looking not only at coffee makers but also at other seemingly mundane delay-causing problems, such as spills on seats. Spills on cloth upholstery can delay a flight because the crew must remove the seat cushion and replace it with a dry one. Economy travelers can expect to see more \u201csynthetic leather\u201d seat covers, which have superior wipeability.Onboard coffee machines are trickier. They cost anywhere from $7,000 to $20,000 apiece. And they are electrical, so if one isn\u2019t working, the ground crew needs to make sure there\u2019s not a problem with the circuitry that could cause a fire or other hazard.\u201cYou can\u2019t just put Mr. Coffee in an airline,\u201d said Jeff Lowe, president of Aviation Fabricators, a certified airplane repair station in Clinton, Mo. \u201cYou have to do all kinds of engineering and analysis and provide test results to the F.A.A. to get approval.\u201dThe Federal Aviation Administration requires coffee makers to have safety features like circuit breakers and wiring insulation to protect against onboard fires. So when a coffee machine misbehaves, maintenance crews must inspect it to ensure there is no risk.Other special features include latches to ensure that the coffeepot does not shake loose during turbulence. These elaborately engineered details mean there is more that can go wrong.Airplane safety rules try to anticipate problems because if something goes wrong midflight, there\u2019s little room for error. For instance, even though smoking cigarettes has been banned since the 1990s, planes still must have ashtrays in the lavatories. Because if someone does smoke in there, they have a place to put the cigarette other than the trash bin, which is full of flammable paper.When a coffee machine breaks down, often it can simply be replaced by spares kept on hand for that purpose. If that\u2019s not possible, the plane can still take off, but only after mechanics disable the coffee machine by turning the water off and cutting the power.Reached by phone, Mr. Swearingen added this thought: \u201cAnd why would you wait until I\u2019m on the plane to announce that? I would have gone to Starbucks.\u201dEven the water is complicated in an airliner and can contribute to breakdowns. Marcos Jimenez, an engineer at Zodiac Aerospace who has developed patented coffee-maker technology, said there were two main types of machines: those that use water from an airplane\u2019s water reservoir, and those that require a flight attendant to pour filtered, bottled water into the machine.Most commercial airlines use machines hooked up to a water tank. \u201cBecause it\u2019s in a tank, they have to take particular care to make sure the water is not growing bacteria and whatnot. So they treat it with chemicals, kind of like a pool,\u201d he said.These chemicals, along with minerals in the water, can cause residue to build up in the machinery. Clogs can cause the machine to break down, particularly if maintenance crews don\u2019t clean them often enough, Mr. Jimenez said. \u201cI don\u2019t drink the coffee unless I know the water\u2019s coming from a bottle.\u201dDelta and United acknowledge that coffee makers can cause trouble, though they do not seem as focused on it as American is. \u201cWe do have some delays due to coffee maker problems from time to time, but it\u2019s not a prevalent cause,\u201d said Jonathan Guerin, a United spokesman. He noted, however, that United\u2019s maintenance crews recently increased the frequency of checks on coffee makers specifically to reduce delays.American is working with B/E Aerospace, a manufacturer of aircraft cabin products, to replace malfunctioning coffee makers on many of its planes, at thousands of dollars each. American\u2019s Boeing 737s, which make up about a third of its fleet, typically have four of the machines on board. Larger planes like the Boeing 777, which usually flies international routes, may have more than a dozen coffee makers.If the overhaul is effective, it might cut down on the number of complaints from passengers like Darren McGrady.Mr. McGrady, a personal chef based in Dallas according to his Twitter bio, boarded a 6:45 a.m. flight in April, only to find his departure delayed by a broken coffee maker. He complained about that on Twitter, and American\u2019s corporate account replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll get the coffee maker up and running so we can have you on your way!\u201dA few minutes later, Mr. McGrady tweeted again, this time with a photo of an empty galley \u2014 no mechanics in sight. \u201cI can see technicians swarming around the coffee machine trying to fix it,\u201d he wrote.American followed up: \u201cIt\u2019s all set now! You\u2019ll be wheels up soon.\u201d\u201cYou can sit and wait on an airplane for the dumbest things,\u201d said Mr. Lowe at Aviation Fabricators. But he takes a philosophical view.\u201cThey have to wait for some guy in maintenance to say, \u2018It\u2019s O.K.,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Lowe said. \u201cAnd frankly, that\u2019s probably the way it ought to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back-Stabbing and Threats of a \u2018Suicide Parachute\u2019 at Hershey", "Date": "2016-07-30", "News": "Supported byHERSHEY, Pa. \u2014 One toasty afternoon in mid-July, four 10-year-old boys gave a tour of their home at the Milton Hershey School, a boarding school for at-risk children and one of many gifts bequeathed by the chocolate magnate to the community that bears his name.In the kitchen, a plate of brownies sat unattended. The boys yearned and stared \u2014 but kept their hands to themselves. This seemed so improbable that someone asked, Why aren\u2019t you guys grabbing dessert?\u201cWe\u2019re mature enough not to take stuff without asking,\u201d said Jayce, a blond-haired boy with a dimpled chin. \u201cBut if we were to ask,\u201d he added, raising a hopeful forefinger, \u201cwe would ask like this: \u2018May I please take a brownie?\u2019\u201dThanks to a historic gift by M.H.S.\u2019s founder, the Hershey Trust Company has an endowment of $12.3 billion and an ownership stake in Hershey Company, giving it control of the candy dynasty behind Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s and Hershey\u2019s Kisses, to name a few.With Hershey now the subject of a $23 billion takeover bid, the trust is enduring one of its periodic turns in the klieg lights, and the timing is hardly ideal. A leaked internal memo has revealed back-stabbing, allegations of insider trading and the threat of something called a \u201csuicide parachute.\u201dAll of this is happening as a dubious deal to buy a golf course continues to reverberate and as critics charge that members of the trust\u2019s board are more interested in earning hundreds of thousands of dollars on Hershey-related boards than in helping needy children.In the last 12 months the trust has spent more than $4 million on lawyers to investigate charges of misconduct that board members have lodged against one another. In one instance, Robert F. Cavanaugh, then the board\u2019s chairman, was accused of improperly securing a summer job for his son with JKMilne Asset Management, one of the trust\u2019s outside investment companies.In a sharp escalation, Mr. Cavanaugh, an M.H.S. alumnus who worked in real estate finance, accused two board members of trading Hershey stock on privileged information, which is basically the corporate version of crying \u201cMurder!\u201dAfter a small fortune in billable hours, all three board members were given a clean bill of ethical health. But this group operated in what was apparently a toxic atmosphere. Four board members have quit since late 2015, one after serving a mere three months.The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General sent a letter to the trust in February that gave the board until July 31 to adopt some changes or face possible legal action. On Friday, the attorney general announced a deal with the trust, unveiling an agreement that establishes term limits for board members and sets base compensation at $110,000 a year, before add-ons. Three trustees who have already served more than a decade will step down by the end of December. Two other long-timers, including the chairwoman, Velma A. Redmond, will stick around through 2017 to provide institutional memory.To the board\u2019s detractors \u2014 and there are many, in academia and in an alumni group called Protect the Hersheys\u2019 Children \u2014 the agreement is only the latest attempt at a tummy tuck for an institution that, they say, needs a heart transplant.Perhaps it is na\u00efve to expect that a treasure as immense as $12.3 billion could sit anywhere without producing at least some acrimony and intrigue. In a way, this is a tale about human nature, and how great gobs of cash evince both the best and worst of it. While the money is earmarked explicitly for disadvantaged children, its fate is decided by grown-ups. And while they may care deeply about the school, at the same time some are being enriched financially, and others \u2014 mostly elected officials \u2014 have shown motivations more political and economic than scholastic.During a recent interview at the Hershey Trust office, which operates out of the 22-room home that was once Mr. Hershey\u2019s, Ms. Redmond played down the internal squabbles. She and her colleagues were devoted to the school, she said, and ready to embrace change.\u201cThis is a new day,\u201d she said, as negotiations over the deal announced on Friday were unfolding. \u201cWe do have a heightened sensitivity to issues that have been brought up in the past, in terms of compensation, in terms of board collaboration. We are committed to a future in which we are more transparent and no longer carrying the baggage of the past.\u201dThis is precisely the kind of reset that has been promised for years, said Frederic Fouad, an M.H.S. alumnus and a Protect the Hershey\u2019s Children co-founder. He said the agreement changed nothing of substance and failed to address the systemic issues that have long plagued the trust.He and Pablo Eisenberg, a senior fellow at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown, contend that it\u2019s absurd that board members are paid at all, other than to cover expenses. They say the school is more interested in bricks-and-mortar projects that help local vendors and the economy \u2014 more than $1 billion has been spent on upgrades and new construction in the last 20 years \u2014 than in expanding the student population.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a greater nonprofit scandal in the last 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Mr. Eisenberg, who has studied the trust and found its leadership and structure wanting. \u201cThe whole board needs to be replaced.\u201dThe warm, avuncular face of Milton Hershey beams from photographs hung just about everywhere here, the kind of ubiquity once associated mainly with communist nations and their maximum leaders. But Mr. Hershey, as everyone here calls him, more than 70 years after his death, is a kind of anti-Mao. The presence of his image seems like a token of heartfelt gratitude from locals who understand that the \u201csweetest place on earth,\u201d as it bills itself, would not exist without this mustachioed man and his chocolate fortune.He and his wife, Catherine, never had children of their own. In 1909 they founded the school, originally open only to white orphaned boys. Over the years, the criteria for students expanded and the student body now includes girls as well as children of all races, as long as they come from families at or near the poverty level.Lately, though, some of the biggest beneficiaries of the school are the members of its board. This stems from the odd structure that results when a nonprofit entity (the school) owns for-profit companies (the Hershey Trust Company, which is the source of the board members\u2019 salaries; the Hershey Company; and the Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, which operates Hersheypark and other attractions).For years, three members of the trust board have sat on the board of the Hershey Company and one member has sat on the board of Hershey Entertainment. This makes a seat on the trust, which has paid about $100,000, a ticket to a perch on more lucrative boards: A Hershey Company board member is paid about $250,000.Trust watchers say the rancor may have originated with the extended tenure of people like Mr. Cavanaugh, who has served on the trust\u2019s board since 2003 and landed one of the trust\u2019s three Hershey Company board seats the same year. According to Hershey\u2019s most recent annual report to shareholders, Mr. Cavanaugh currently has $3.6 million in a deferred compensation account with the company.Historically, tenure on a board seat has had an informal 10-year limit. A few members elected in the early 2000s, including Mr. Cavanaugh, have stayed longer.When Mr. Cavanaugh learned last September that board members had apparently been conspiring behind his back, he expressed outrage, according to an internal memo that leaked to the news media.The memo, dated Sept. 30, 2015, and written by the former chief compliance officer of the trust, Marc Woolley, described a phone conversation in which Mr. Cavanaugh told Mr. Woolley he wanted to \u201ctake out\u201d members of the board who had run a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him. Mr. Cavanaugh also told Mr. Woolley that he was aware of a letter sent by four board members to every other member except for him.If that sounds high school, the tone of the conversation then took a dark turn. Mr. Cavanaugh threatened to deploy something he called a \u201csuicide parachute,\u201d though exactly what he meant is unclear. He also told Mr. Woolley, according to the memo, that he had \u201ca timeline mapped out\u201d of trades in Hershey stock by two board members, Joan Steel and James Nevels, implying that they were made improperly.\u201cHe stated,\u201d wrote Mr. Woolley in his memo, \u201cthat if I thought that the investigation into his dealings with J. K. Milne were long and expensive,\u201d that \u201cI had not seen anything yet.\u201dMr. Cavanaugh, in a statement, disputed Mr. Woolley\u2019s recounting of the conversation. \u201cI believe Mr. Woolley\u2019s memo contained a number of errors, misstatements and omissions that were self-serving and significantly changed the context of the conversation,\u201d he said. He said he had called Mr. Woolley to discuss matters involving board members and personnel, \u201cand to inform Mr. Woolley of my continued dissatisfaction with his job performance.\u201dIn the conversation, Mr. Cavanaugh also articulated his theory that a trust employee named John Estey was responsible for the friction on the board. Why he thought that, Mr. Cavanaugh did not say, but he told Mr. Woolley that \u201cJohn had better just continue to do work for the board.\u201dAs it happens, Mr. Estey\u2019s work for the board would soon end, though for reasons that had nothing to do with Hershey. A former state lobbyist, Mr. Estey had been caught in his former job in a 2011 sting by F.B.I. agents who were posing as favor-seeking executives of a fictional company. The \u201cexecutives\u201d provided Mr. Estey with $20,000 to give to lawmakers, a violation of state laws barring lobbyists from acting as conduits for corporate donations.But Mr. Estey handed over $7,000 to state politicians. The rest he kept. In May, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud. At that time, he was earning a salary from the trust of more than $900,000 a year.Mr. Woolley did not last at the trust much longer. In June, he was put on administrative leave. A few weeks ago, according to a spokesman for the trust, he was fired.The reason? \u201cThe trust considered Woolley a \u2018disgruntled employee,\u2019\u201d said a spokesman, Kent Jarrell, in an email. As evidence, Mr. Jarrell pointed to a letter, which Mr. Woolley helped write in November, in which he supposedly complained about the board.Reached by phone last week, Mr. Woolley said, \u201cI am anything but disgruntled. I\u2019m disappointed about the board and their issues, but I\u2019m passionate about the kids and the mission.\u201dA former farm boy, Mr. Hershey made chores a part of daily life for his orphans. Later, M.H.S. became known as one of the country\u2019s finest blue-collar vocational schools, with training in auto-body repair, carpentry, construction, printing and more. In an era without child welfare, it was a vast improvement over the alternative, which was destitution.Even during Mr. Hershey\u2019s time, money from the trust was used to develop the town\u2019s infrastructure and attractions. Usually these deals cause few ripples. But a 2006 purchase became a public relations disaster.The trust also spent $5 million on a Scottish-inspired restaurant and bar on the premises.After a torrent of negative publicity, the trust said that it had always planned to build student housing on the property as part of a school expansion. The original purchase announcement, though \u2014 issued well before the P.R. fiasco \u2014 stated that the acquisition \u201censures the long-term future of the championship-caliber course.\u201dGround is now being broken, according to the trust spokesman, for student homes on what was formerly known as Hershey Links.In 2010, Tom Corbett, then the attorney general, opened an investigation of the golf course deal. That inquiry was ultimately closed by the current attorney general, Kathleen G. Kane, soon after she took office in 2013. She found no criminal conduct and stated there was no evidence that Mr. Lenny participated in the trust\u2019s decision to buy the golf course. But she demanded reforms that were intended to curb pay, increase vigilance about conflicts of interest and hasten the recruitment of new members with backgrounds in at-risk children.Critics said there were no teeth in the agreement struck with the trust in 2013, which is why a do-over was required on Friday.Ms. Kane believes that the agreement simply needed an update. \u201cI would have been pleased if we didn\u2019t have to revisit the agreement,\u201d she said in a recent interview in her office, overlooking the State Capitol in Harrisburg. \u201cI thought at the time that what we signed in 2013 was a step forward, but times change, directors change, and you have to go back and make improvements.\u201dWhat, if anything, the recent agreement and the coming turnover of members mean for the Mondelez bid is unclear. Mondelez \u2014 the maker of Oreos, Ritz crackers and an assortment of gums, chocolates and mints \u2014 has not announced that it is giving up its pursuit of the company.On paper, the union makes a lot of strategic sense, according to Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar. Mondelez does not sell chocolate in the United States, and Hershey has never had a strong presence overseas.\u201cMondelez has vast geographic reach,\u201d Ms. Lash said. \u201cOnly 20 percent of its sales are in the U.S. Thirty-five percent are in Europe and the rest are in emerging markets, like Brazil, China, Russia and India.\u201dStill, for Mondelez to succeed, it would need to mount one of the greatest charm offensives in corporate history. To understand why, consider what happened in 2002, when board members of the school decided that the trust\u2019s portfolio was dangerously overweighted in Hershey stock. The group announced it was looking to sell Hershey, preferably to a company that could pay cash.It was a bold power play, possible only because it was supported by many of the people of Hershey and the Dauphin County Orphans\u2019 Court, which has jurisdiction over the trust.The plan was soon abandoned. Ten board members resigned.For good measure, the state legislature passed a law that year mandating that Hershey cannot be sold without the approval of the attorney general. While arguably a boon for the community, the law, according to Robert H. Sitkoff, a professor at Harvard Law School, was also indefensible.\u201cImagine if the legislature of New Jersey passed a bill that said Princeton had to invest more than half of its endowment in one local company?\u201d Mr. Sitkoff said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Pennsylvania Legislature did in 2002. It\u2019s outrageous. The trust is supposed to be rescuing needy kids.\u201dMondelez seems attuned to the obstacle course it would need to navigate to win Hershey. Already, the company has reportedly promised to relocate its global chocolate headquarters to Hershey, protect local jobs and take Hershey as its name.That\u2019s a start, said Mr. Fernandez, author of \u201cThe Chocolate Trust.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a great share price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about absolutely boosting the local economy, which is what the trust has been doing for years.\u201dMondelez, he said, might try to sway opponents of any deal by promising to add chocolate-making capacity in Hershey, or by naming trust board members to the Mondelez board.\u201cBasically, it will have to convince politicians in Harrisburg that it won\u2019t walk away in five years,\u201d he said.Whether a deal would be good for M.H.S. depends largely on whether the trustees properly manage the windfall. There are skeptics, such as Mr. Fouad of Protect the Hersheys\u2019 Children, who say the current members lack the kind of self-restraint demonstrated by those 10-year-old boys with that plate of brownies. But Mr. Fouad wants to see the sale anyway.\u201cThe board is incompetent,\u201d he maintains. \u201cBut it\u2019s far better to get the billions and then let the right people pressure them to reform. Failing to would be just another triumph of local interests and jobs over needy kids. And five decades of that is enough.\u201dAn article on July 31, about strife in the Hershey Trust Company, which controls Hershey, the candy dynasty, omitted a response from Robert F. Cavanaugh, the trust\u2019s former chairman, to an internal memorandum written by the trust\u2019s former chief compliance officer, Marc Woolley. In the memo, Mr. Woolley recounted a phone conversation in which Mr. Cavanaugh accused board members of running a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him. Mr. Cavanaugh\u2019s response disputed that memo, saying it contained \u201ca number of errors, misstatements and omissions that were self-serving and significantly changed the context of the conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Brexit is a bracing reminder, the two said, of how different London is from the rest of the country \u2014 how it can feel like a world apart, a place unto itself.\u201cBeing here shows that you\u2019re no different to each other,\u201d said Ms. Bahia, 31, an accountant whose parents are Indian, by way of Malaysia. \u201cBut when you come from the regions, sometimes you haven\u2019t been exposed to what it\u2019s like to work with and have friends from different cultures.\u201dAround them, the park was almost a caricature of multicultural London in the summer: a cacophony of people, a riot of accents, all existing harmoniously under the occasional burst of chilling rain.At Speakers\u2019 Corner, the spot near Marble Arch where people have gone for generations to declaim and debate, the topics included Jesus, Muhammad, Scottish nationalism, our sins, our DNA, why we are compelled to go to work and the government plot to \u201cchemistrate the airwaves.\u201d The discussions were good-tempered, if not always fully coherent.\u201cLondon has always been a dream of mine,\u201d said Bilyana Georgieva, 25, who was having a picnic in the park with a friend. She moved to the city from Bulgaria a year ago, she said, and within two days she had found an apartment and a job, as a chef in a vegetarian restaurant.\u201cI have never felt pushed away,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s very welcoming.\u201dBut she and many other Londoners are feeling very odd and alienated these days, as the reality of the vote sinks in and they wonder what will happen to their city if the divorce from the European Union goes through. Much of the Leave vote turned on a desire to limit immigration and restore \u201cBritish values,\u201d while London prides itself on its ability to attract and absorb outsiders.\u201cLondon is like the capital of Europe, and it\u2019s the biggest financial capital in the world,\u201d said Alexandra Lewis, 19, a college student in Bristol. Her London high school had students from all over, she recalled, and the British-born were in the minority.London, she said, \u201cneeds the connections with Europe much more than the rest of the country.\u201d\u201cIf Scotland gets to make its own laws to reflect its own unique politics, why not the capital?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe all know \u2014 and the referendum made clear \u2014 that London has very different politics to the rest of the country.\u201dThe mayor, Mr. Khan, agrees. Many of the city\u2019s affairs are still controlled by the national government, and he has limited authority compared with the mayor of, say, New York. Mr. Khan said he would begin pressing for the same sort of devolved powers that the national government has granted to Scotland and Wales.He also moved to reassure nervous and angry residents that London is at heart an international city. He and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, issued a statement saying they would \u201cbuild far stronger alliances between cities across Europe and around the world.\u201dBut just as the vote has set city against country, it has set neighbor against neighbor within the city. There are really many Londons. One is rich, cosmopolitan London, the London of the financial district, of wealthy areas like Mayfair, Hampstead and Kensington, of people who can afford to travel across Britain, Europe and the rest of the world, of immigrants who have prospered.Another is the London of longtime residents like Charmaine Williams, 55, a government social worker. Ms. Williams said she had not seen any advantages to European Union membership, only more people coming from Eastern Europe and using London\u2019s already stretched public services. So she voted yes to Brexit.\u201cThey should fix things at home before they try to fix everyone else,\u201d Ms. Williams said.A series of devastating budget cuts in recent years under the government\u2019s austerity plans has taken a toll on her work, she said.The Brexit question is complicated, said Ms. Lewis, the college student. To denounce those who voted to leave as ignorant and shortsighted, she said, is to think you are smarter and more enlightened, to pit the city not just against the rest of Britain but also, in a way, against itself.She does not want to feel that way, yet she cannot shake the sense that London \u2014 or, at least, her London \u2014 is truly different from everywhere else.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be seen as superior, or trying to lecture them about what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that I\u2019m apart from the rest of the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China\u2019s Economic Growth Figures Mean", "Date": "2016-07-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China on Friday reported its second-quarter economic growth figures. The numbers are among the world\u2019s most closely watched because the country has been a major driver of global economic growth. But data from China are notoriously questionable. This is what you should take away from Friday\u2019s results.China\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product rose 6.7 percent compared with a year ago. Friday\u2019s figure suggests there\u2019s no reason to panic. China\u2019s economy is slowing but at a reasonable, steady pace well in line with Beijing\u2019s expectations. It also matches the first-quarter number, and still came in at a pace that other countries envy.Looking a bit closer, it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s slowdown is uneven. Some sectors, like mining and manufacturing, are being clobbered. Others, like e-commerce and nontraditional finance, are relative bright spots, while the housing market in some big cities is downright frothy.China\u2019s property investment in the first six months of the year rose 6.1 percent from a year ago, compared with 7 percent in the January-to-May period. That slight slowdown in June offers a reminder that new strength from China\u2019s property sector has been pretty uneven.To be sure, the rebound in the property market is helping to prop up growth across the country. Roughly one-quarter of China\u2019s economic activity is related to property. Last year a drop in the market hit China\u2019s growth results, as investors worried about an oversupply of unsold homes, especially in smaller cities, and put their money into stocks instead.Those worries appear to have been swept aside. Land purchases by developers have recovered as builders turn more optimistic. That is also good for local governments, which rely on revenue from land sales to fund a huge portion of their spending. New home sales and construction starts by developers are also rebounding strongly.The question is how sustainable this property recovery might be. Home prices in rich metropolises like Shenzhen and Shanghai are rising at rates reminiscent of dot-com stocks of another era. If the property market becomes just another Chinese bubble, it may not help offset the sharp slowdown among China\u2019s factories.China\u2019s June industrial production rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier, compared with 6 percent in May. Many traditional smokestack industries in China are still struggling, and that is dragging down the broader economy. Despite the slight rise in the June figure, industrial production data indicates that the manufacturing deceleration that China has seen for the last six years shows few signs of bottoming out.China\u2019s zombie factories \u2014 many state owned or state supported \u2014 continue to churn out goods that nobody buys. Weak overseas demand is another problem, and exports have continued to contract this year.There could be some light at the end of the tunnel. Factories would get a big lift if they could regain pricing power. Data on factory pricing shows that deflation appears to be easing at last after four tough years.But the bigger hope is that consumer demand can replace traditional industry as the main driver of China\u2019s economy.China\u2019s June retail sales rose 10.6 percent from a year ago. At first glance, Chinese consumers do appear to be stepping up their game, as June\u2019s figure was an improvement from May\u2019s. But May\u2019s figure was the weakest rate since the 2003 outbreak of SARS, once seasonal distortions like holidays are factored out.China bulls often point to the blistering pace of expansion of e-commerce as one of the country\u2019s brightest growth spots. Online sales of goods rose 27 percent in the first six months, data released Friday showed. Still, that is down sharply from their growth rate a year ago China bears would argue that online shopping platforms are just cannibalizing sales from traditional department stores.China has seen a dramatic falloff in investment by the private sector, previously China\u2019s biggest engine of investment growth. That could have been hugely destabilizing for employment, wages and the economy as a whole. But the government has stepped in with gusto, ramping up investment by the state.There are signs that Beijing is getting less bang for its buck, however, as new infrastructure works and other projects fail to generate the same economic returns that they did in years past. What\u2019s more, this investment surge is being bankrolled by an expanding credit binge. New bank lending has been growing gangbusters this year, raising the risk that China will face a painful day of reckoning further down the road.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Competition in Tatters, the Rip of Inequality Widens", "Date": "2016-07-12", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe Justice Department is expected to rule soon on the biggest beer merger ever: a $100 billion-plus combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller into a colossus that will reap some $3 out of every $10 spent on beer around the world.The stakes are higher than whether you will be able to find your favorite Belgian-style lambic at the corner store. The new merger amounts to another step in the long decline of competition in many American industries.It is a decline that stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers\u2019 mobility and slows productivity growth. Slowing this trend has emerged as a tempting new avenue to address the plight of a beleaguered working class. Reviving flagging American competition might even help stop America\u2019s ever-widening inequality.Monopoly rents \u2014 the excess returns a company reaps when it does not have to deal with pesky competitors keeping prices down \u2014 could worsen inequality in a variety of ways. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate from Columbia University who served as top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, has asserted that exorbitant corporate profits are being run up through oligopolies and passed along to stockholders, raising the share of national income accruing to the rich.This may not fit snugly with the data, though. Notably, the rising share of income going to the top 1 percent is not driven mainly by overstuffed returns on investment but by the growing inequality in wages. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag suggest a different mechanism to fit this trend: Companies that reap monopoly rents are paying their workers more, sharing some of their rents with them. While that might sound a bit more egalitarian, it could be equally insidious.There is plenty of evidence that corporate concentration is on the rise. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag report that between 1997 and 2007 the market share of the 50 largest companies increased in three-fourths of the broad industry sectors followed by the census.In 1985 the top 10 banks had under 20 percent of banking assets. By 2010 they had more than half. Big Pharma too has become bigger, buying niche laboratories. So have hospitals: Between 2010 and 2014 there were 457 mergers in the hospital sector.Studies have found increased concentration in agricultural businesses and wireless communications as well. And as Senator Warren observed, critical technology markets are often controlled by a single player. Among airlines, there are only four major United States carriers left.Martin Gaynor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist at the Federal Trade Commission, noted that competition policy was about increasing the economy\u2019s efficiency, not changing the distribution of the spoils. \u201cI don\u2019t think antitrust is a major tool for addressing inequality,\u201d he told me.Still, it would seem foolhardy to ignore the growing footprint of dominant companies, strutting their stuff across the broader economy.The existence of Facebook might provide an incentive for some kid in a garage to design a cool new app for the social media giant. But Facebook might also have an interest in squelching innovations that do not fit its business model.Market power can throw sand in the economy\u2019s cogs in several ways. For one, it will make more sense for dominant companies to focus on protecting their rents than to risk money investing in new ventures. New entrepreneurs will think twice before trying to challenge a dominant firm.How did the American economy get so concentrated? Technology surely helped. Tech giants like Google and Facebook benefit from economies of scale and network effects. It costs nothing to serve an additional search. Consumers will be drawn to the social media platforms that already have more users.Government watchdogs also messed up. Concerned only about local competition between bank branches, they allowed a huge nationwide concentration. \u201cAntitrusters stood by and sucked their thumbs while these mergers got through,\u201d Professor Scherer told me. Conditions imposed on troublesome mergers \u2014 like orders to sell assets or to refrain from certain behaviors \u2014 were mostly ineffective, Professor Kwoka said.How to fix it? Professor Kwoka suggests that when a given industry is already fairly concentrated, any future merger should be presumed to be anticompetitive, taking the burden of proof off the regulator\u2019s shoulders and putting the onus on the merging companies to prove it is not. Regulations also offer a promising tool: How about demanding that the Food and Drug Administration approve generic drugs more quickly?But what might help most is not some narrow change in the procedures to examine business combinations but a broadening of the objectives of competition policy. Antitrust economists might hate this idea, but perhaps it\u2019s time to broaden the discussion beyond how a decline in competition may hurt consumers, and to consider things other than narrow economic efficiency. That would include the way market concentration affects the distribution of the fruits of economic growth. It\u2019s not just about the price of beer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Pence: On the Same Ticket, but Not on the Same Page", "Date": "2016-07-18", "News": "Supported byDealBookIf there is one thing consistent about the business views of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana \u2014 better known as Donald J. Trump\u2019s running mate \u2014 it is that they are often at odds with the views of Mr. Trump, who has campaigned on his business expertise.Among the bills that Mr. Pence opposed while he was a congressman were those that turned out to have the biggest repercussions on Wall Street and American industry: the $700 billion bailout of the financial industry \u2014 called the Troubled Asset Relief Program \u2014 and the rescue of the auto industry.On the flip side, Mr. Pence voted in favor of amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget, and cutting taxes on the wealthy and on corporations.Mr. Trump\u2019s views on these subjects are not on the record in the same way as Mr. Pence\u2019s votes in Congress, but the signals that the presumptive Republican nominee has given in media appearances would suggest that the two are far from in lock step. Not that this probably matters to Mr. Trump: When asked on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about Mr. Pence\u2019s vote in favor of the Iraq war \u2014 a vote for which he has been torching Hillary Clinton \u2014 he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dThe various differences between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have been well documented over the last several days. But even a cursory examination of Mr. Pence\u2019s stances on business and his relationship with industry shows that the presidential and vice-presidential candidates may be out of step.Most of Mr. Pence\u2019s donors over the years have been far from Mr. Trump\u2019s friends. Indeed, Mr. Pence\u2019s biggest donor has been the Club for Growth, a political action committee focused on economic growth that has long supported Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Mr. Pence has also long been supported by the billionaire Koch brothers. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has thus far been unable to persuade the family to support him, at one point saying of Charles Koch, \u201cYou have a lot of people that need him, and I don\u2019t need him at all.\u201d Mr. Koch, a longtime Republican donor who has expressed dismay by Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, has said that \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d Mrs. Clinton would be a better candidate. (The Kochs are unlikely to support the Trump candidacy even with Mr. Pence on the ticket.)As governor of Indiana, Mr. Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that was widely seen as anti-gay because it effectively gave businesses the right to turn away customers based on their religion, and, in turn, their sexual orientation. An outcry from the business community \u2014 particularly in Silicon Valley, including Apple \u2014 followed. Mr. Pence later watered the law down.Mr. Trump has long argued that he is a \u201cfriend to the gays,\u201d at one point suggesting that a North Carolina law passed earlier this year that prevented transgender people from using bathrooms of their gender identity \u2014 a law that was also heavily criticized by the business community \u2014 was wrong. \u201cYou leave it the way it is,\u201d he said. In the same interview, he said Caitlyn Jenner could choose whatever bathroom she wanted in Trump Tower. (She took him up on his offer.) Still, Mr. Trump is against gay marriage.That\u2019s not to say that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence disagree on everything when it comes to business. They both want to undo the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law, for instance, and they want to lower individual and corporate taxes. (While both of them have argued for lower individual and corporate taxes, at times Mr. Trump has suggested he might raise taxes on the wealthy.)In the end, oddly enough, Mr. Pence\u2019s addition to the ticket may make it harder for Mr. Trump to raise money from the business community \u2014 not because of policy positions, but because of fund-raising rules. Because Mr. Pence is a sitting governor, donations from Wall Street fall under an obscure Securities and Exchange Commission law meant to prevent pay-for-play efforts for state pension funds, according to OpenSecrets.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angry Tweets Won\u2019t Help African Lions", "Date": "2016-07-01", "News": "Supported byOpinionMore than one million people signed a petition demanding \u201cjustice for Cecil,\u201d and three major American airlines announced that they would no longer transport hunting trophies. A few months later, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed lions from West and Central Africa and also India as endangered, shutting down the major markets for trophies from that region. Australia, France and the Netherlands banned lion trophy imports outright.Unfortunately, the furor did almost nothing to slow the catastrophic decline in lion populations, down 43 percent over the past two decades. That\u2019s because trophy hunting was never really the main problem. Lions are disappearing in Africa for a reason far more complicated and less susceptible to either moral grandstanding or easy solutions: Impoverished Africans are eating the lions\u2019 prey and killing the lions themselves \u2014 at a rate estimated at five to 10 times the take from trophy hunting.In West and Central Africa in particular, the killing now takes place almost entirely within national parks and other ostensibly protected areas. Poachers and bushmeat hunters have already stripped wildlife from the remaining unprotected habitat, leaving empty forests. Now many protected areas have also lost the buffalo, antelope and other large animals that lions would normally feed on, according to Philipp Henschel, a lion specialist with the cat conservation group Panthera. In many habitats, only warthogs and baboons survive, because of Muslim rules against eating them. Herders also capture and kill lions, using leghold traps made from old car springs. They do this not just to protect livestock, but also to sell lion bones to the Asian traditional medicine trade.Forests and other natural habitats produce oxygen, help prevent both drought and flooding, refill aquifers and serve as a living gene bank for agricultural improvement, among many other benefits. They can become the basis for jobs in tourism economies and provide essential resources, including a sustainable harvest of firewood, medicine and even meat for nearby communities \u2014 but only if somebody is protecting the habitat from the heedless human urge to consume everything right now.And that\u2019s not happening. For example, Zambia\u2019s Kafue National Park, an area the size of Massachusetts, loses much of its wildlife to snaring \u2014 and generates just $2.3 million a year from tourism. With adequate anti-poaching patrols and upgraded facilities, a recent analysis by conservation and development consultant Rowan Martin suggests, the park could be making $39 million a year instead, along with jobs and benefits for its neighbors \u2014 and support four times as many lions.The \u201cBeyond Cecil\u201d report argues that, moving past the disproportionate focus on trophy hunting after Cecil\u2019s death, the single most important step in securing the future of the lion in Africa \u201cis mobilizing massive support\u201d for Africa\u2019s parks and protected areas. That is, we should be lobbying the United Nations, the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development, the European Union, the International Development Bank and other international bodies to take on the park management shortfall, estimated at $700 million to $3 billion a year.This money needs to go to anti-poaching patrols in protected areas, but with the transparency and policing to insure it does not dwindle like past funding efforts under the guidance of Western consultants and corrupt African governments.Some of that money should also go to develop alternatives to bushmeat, to reduce conflict with wildlife (for instance, by building better nighttime corrals) and to compensate livestock herders for the burden of living with lions and other dangerous animals. In one area, outside a national park in Niger, where per capita income is under $500, the loss of livestock to lions costs $138 per person every year \u2014 hardly a recipe for tolerance. People living around protected areas need to see practical benefits to living with wildlife.This ought to be a campaign that unites animal rights activists and trophy hunters alike. Both have a material and emotional interest when, as the \u201cBeyond Cecil\u201d report notes, more than 1,400 prey animals have suffered slow, painful deaths in snares and been left to rot in just one Zimbabwe conservancy. Their scent attracts lions and other predators, which also end up snared, to be \u201cchoked, succumb to injuries, or die of thirst.\u201dIn truth, it is a campaign that ought to unite all of us who want some vestige of wild Africa \u2014 one with lions, elephants, rhinos \u2014 to survive beyond our meager lifetimes. Never mind Walter Palmer\u2019s soul. If we do nothing but point fingers, it is our own souls we should be worrying about.An earlier version of this article misstated the projected decline of lion populations in Africa. Populations are expected to drop by half across most of the continent over the next two decades, not one.Richard Conniff is the author of \u201cHouse of Lost Worlds: Dinosaurs, Dynasties, and the Story of Life on Earth\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian Navy Recovers Ship Containing at Least 300 Migrants\u2019 Bodies", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byOnly 28 migrants survived the shipwreck in April 2015; after the disaster, 169 bodies were retrieved. But the rest of the bodies \u2014 hundreds more \u2014 have remained trapped in the hull of the vessel for 14 months. With the ship now taken to shore, those remains will be removed for examination and identification by forensic experts, the Italian Navy said.The recovery project cost 9.5 million euros (about $10.5 million), took two months, and involved robots and remotely operated underwater vehicles. The effort was repeatedly interrupted because of adverse seas and weather, and the technical difficulties of extracting a wooden vessel from a depth of about 1,210 feet. Officials said the effort was important, not only to provide closure to relatives of the dead but also to draw attention to the horrific effects of human trafficking.\u201cI ordered the navy to recover the wreck to bury those brothers and sisters of ours who otherwise would have remained at the sea bottom forever,\u201d Mr. Renzi said. \u201cI did it because we Italians know the value of the word \u2018civilization.\u2019 \u201dThe dead migrants have a \u201cright to be remembered,\u201d he said.Italian firefighters were given the grim task of extracting the bodies from the vessel\u2019s hull and placing them in a refrigerated tent erected on the dock of a Sicilian military base.There, teams of forensic experts will work in shifts to inspect the remains, collecting items that the migrants might have carried and entering photographs and DNA samples into a database, where families may be able to confirm that their loved ones drowned.If the bodies are not claimed, they will be buried in Italy.On Thursday, even as the recovered vessel with hundreds of bodies was being towed toward Sicily, Italy\u2019s coast guard was carrying to shore those of 10 migrants from the waters near Libya. The migrants, all women, had died from either suffocation or being crushed during the sinking of a rubber boat, from which an additional 107 people were rescued.The coast guard also rescued yet another group of desperate people \u2014 116 migrants on a rubber dinghy \u2014 in roughly the same area on Thursday.Almost 70,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, slightly fewer than at this point last year, but with the milder summer weather, the number of arrivals is expected to increase.On Thursday, Italy\u2019s government repeated its call for Europe to increase efforts to save lives.Mr. Renzi has long advocated more financial help for Africa to tackle the issue at the source. Italy\u2019s government has proposed the issuance of \u201ceuro bonds,\u201d backed by the countries of the eurozone. These would finance the management of the migration crisis in countries that have been affected the most, like Italy and Greece, and encourage African countries to develop their economies, lessening the desperation that pushes migrants to risk their lives by fleeing.However, the economic terms of his proposal have so far been opposed by eurozone countries like Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does NATO Still Exist?", "Date": "2016-07-07", "News": "Supported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Treaties are made to turn a will into an obligation. But what happens when this will changes? British voters have just given one example \u2014 however ill-informed \u2014 by dismissing the idea that European Union treaties deliver value to their country. Discomforting as it may be, there\u2019s reason to take a critical look at an even older accord that binds the nations of the West: the NATO treaty.Signed 67 years ago, the treaty holds the promise that an attack on one of the organization\u2019s member states will be regarded as an attack on all. This solidarity clause, Article 5, was written by politicians of another generation, one with harsher experiences in a much simpler world order. Of course, you can never know until it is tested, but it\u2019s worth asking: Is the thought that keeps the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alive already dead?Sure, it was only a drill. But when Poland called on its NATO allies last month to help fight off hypothetical invaders who poured into the country from the east, Germany was, well, annoyed. The exercise, called Anakonda \u2014 with 25,000 troops from more than 20 countries, the biggest since the end of the Cold War \u2014 was intended as a message to Moscow, a show of force ahead of the alliance\u2019s summit this week in Warsaw. Berlin sent a message of its own to Poland, contributing a total of 400 soldiers, none of them combat troops.On top of Berlin\u2019s modest commitment, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, attacked the latest NATO exercise in Eastern Europe as \u201cloud saber-rattling and war cries.\u201d The alliance, Mr. Steinmeier said, would be well advised \u201cnot to deliver up any excuses for a new, old confrontation.\u201dThis is a logic you would expect to hear from the Russian, rather than German, foreign minister. Mr. Steinmeier also said that Germany wasn\u2019t shirking its responsibility and that no one could regard the envisaged deployment of four additional battalions to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as a threat to Russia. But even so, his statement was, at best, ambivalent.Ambivalence can cause major damage to an alliance whose deterrence value rests solely in its credibility. Germany is not the only European country to blur the line between deterrence and warmongering. France, NATO sources tell me, officially didn\u2019t want to call Anakonda a NATO exercise, for fear of displeasing the Russian government \u2014 as if the Kremlin had not greatly expanded Russia\u2019s military budget in the past 15 years regardless of outside provocation.If exercises can create splits in the Atlantic alliance, the Russian president needs little imagination to realize how to give NATO its ultimate test: use hybrid warfare to plunge the United States and Europeans into doubt over what military action is necessary and what diplomacy is possible. President Vladimir V. Putin could, for instance, stir up separatist feelings among ethnic Russians in Lithuania and provide weapons to the hotheads among them. Then all he would have to do is lean back and watch the most powerful military alliance in history disintegrate as it squabbles over how to react.It\u2019s easy to imagine how the scenario would play out: Poland and the Baltic countries would call for a strong response to pre-empt another annexation like that of Crimea. The Germans and French would call for negotiations with Moscow, doubting that Article 5 would be invoked. The Greeks, Italians and Spanish would make clear that their economies had already suffered enough from the sanctions on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. And much of the public across Europe, manipulated by Russian propaganda, would ask if the Russians weren\u2019t somehow right in trying to support their fellows in the Baltic States. Wasn\u2019t it actually the imperial United States who set all this up, some would argue, just like Washington\u2019s agents were behind the coup in Kiev?The authors of the NATO treaty in 1949 could rightly bank on something one could call Western patriotism. At least this sentiment existed at the government level. But today it has given way to relativism and self-doubt. What used to be rock-solid foreign policy principles are now bargaining chips in election campaigns, of both left and right.NATO was always a marriage of convenience, but not one without any affection. But with all these doubts wracking the alliance \u2014 its political cohesion, its cracked cause-effect chains and disputes over the costs of security \u2014 it is hard to imagine that Europe and the United States would, if they had the chance in 2016, write another Article 5 at all.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Interrupts U.S. Air Missions Against ISIS at Major Base", "Date": "2016-07-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Turkish authorities on Saturday halted, at least temporarily, all American-led strike missions against the Islamic State that had been flying from the Incirlik air base \u2014 the first major impact of the attempted coup on the broader allied campaign against the terrorist group, United States officials said.\u201cThe Turkish government has closed its airspace to military aircraft, and as a result air operations at Incirlik Air Base have been halted at this time,\u201d Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Cook said United States officials were \u201cworking with the Turks to resume air operations there as soon as possible.\u201dIn the meantime, he said, the American military\u2019s Central Command will alter flight operations in an effort \u201cto minimize any effects on the campaign\u201d against the Islamic State.Pentagon officials had said late Friday that the unfolding coup had not affected the bombing and surveillance missions from Incirlik. The opening of that base to the allies has enabled commanders to accelerate and intensify airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.The potential loss of Incirlik as a staging area and major base, even if temporary, comes at a challenging time for the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Local security forces in Iraq and militias in Syria, both supported by the United States, have finally started to gain significant momentum in their air and ground fights against the militants, aided largely by the access to Incirlik.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, in particular, had criticized Turkey over the past year for not taking aggressive enough action to tighten its borders and combat the Islamic State. But many of those criticisms from Mr. Carter and other American officials had begun to fade as the campaign against the militants in Iraq and Syria picked up momentum.On Saturday, President Obama received a briefing on the situation in Turkey from senior aides. A White House statement said Mr. Obama \u201cunderscored the shared challenges that will require continued Turkish cooperation, including our joint efforts against terrorism.\u201dAt Incirlik, the United States has based A-10 attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, including armed drones. The Air Force has said American refueling aircraft at Incirlik handle roughly one-third of refueling operations for the air war over Iraq and Syria.Use of the base increased the length of time that American and other allied warplanes could remain over Iraq and Syria. The manned and unmanned strike missions, as well as surveillance missions, from Incirlik \u2014 all hours closer to the fight than aircraft in the Persian Gulf \u2014 have made a big difference. Losing that advantage would significantly hamper operations, American commanders say.At Diyarbakir, another Turkish base, the Air Force began staging small numbers of American troops last fall to recover any downed pilots or flight crews. The Pentagon\u2019s plans to place a mobile rocket system known as Himars, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, somewhere in Turkey to support United States operations in Syria could also be in jeopardy.The Turkish military, which sees itself as the guardian of the secular state, has overthrown or forced out four elected governments since 1960. Turks have long been fascinated by what they call \u201cthe deep state\u201d: a murky group of operatives, linked to the military, thought to have battled perceived enemies of the state since the Cold War.\u201cThey\u2019re going to be focused on rooting out coup plotters, and that\u2019s going to preoccupy all the national security services; and everything else, including going after ISIL, will be secondary,\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, a former United States ambassador to Turkey and top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt may affect their ability to protect themselves from ISIL blowback in Turkey.\u201dOne big concern expressed by officials and analysts is that Mr. Erdogan will freeze the cooperation against the Islamic State while he sorts out who in the military supported and carried out the coup attempt. If the Turkish military fractures further \u2014 whether through arrests, forced retirements or other actions \u2014 it could become a weakened partner in the fight against the Islamic State.\u201cThis could really effectively eat into the institutional durability of NATO\u2019s second-largest military,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.He said simmering frustration among some within the officer class, chief among them the coup\u2019s suspected mastermind, Col. Muharrem Kose, had finally boiled over.But others cautioned that the bloodiness of the coup, including the targeting of civilians, was outside the traditional methods of the Gulen movement, which has typically used the news media, the judiciary and the police to damage opponents.\u201cThis will do wonders for Erdogan\u2019s cult of personality,\u201d said Mr. Rodrik, whose father-in-law, a retired general in Turkey, was accused of leading a plot to overthrow the government before being freed from prison and acquitted. \u201cIt makes Erdogan\u2019s quest for an authoritarian presidency virtually unstoppable. I fear I will not see a democratic Turkey in my lifetime.\u201dWhatever happens, veteran Turkey watchers said they were flabbergasted by the coup attempt, given that Mr. Erdogan appeared to have a near-monopoly on power. Only two months ago, Mr. Erdemir said, he wrote an article declaring that the era of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Turkey was over.\u201cIt is extremely surprising,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause no one would\u2019ve believed there was a group of officers with the audacity to try and take on Erdogan.\u201dEric Schmitt reported from Washington, and Dan Bilefsky from London.Advertisement"}

Britain Is Special.", "Date": "2016-07-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsEurope\u2019s centrist politicians are right to be nervous about the long-term consequences of a Brexit for Europe\u2019s economy and political stability. But a Frexit, Dexit or Auxit should not be their top concern. Britain is not, and never has been, a typical member of the European Union, and in no country but Britain do populists and other Euroskeptic forces have the 51 percent of votes needed to pull their countries from the union.And Europe didn\u2019t always welcome Britain with open arms, either. As Britain\u2019s postwar recovery remained sluggish, Britons looked at West Germany and France\u2019s booming economies and thought it might be time to reconsider. But when Britain applied to join the European Economic Community \u2014 first in 1961 and again in 1967 \u2014 it was denied. France\u2019s president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain\u2019s membership, accusing Britain of wanting to join only for selfish economic reasons while being unwilling to commit to the necessary economic transformation required by the common market.Perhaps because of this, Britons have long been more nationalistic than other Europeans. In 2015, 64 percent of British citizens said they would identify as British over European, compared with only 36 percent of Frenchmen, 26 percent of the Dutch and 25 percent of Germans, according to the Eurobarometer, the European Commission\u2019s public opinion survey. Unlike Britons, in Continental Europe, the majority of citizens see themselves, at least partly, as Europeans. Polls carried out over the last decade by the Pew Research Center show similar trends. With the exception of Greece (where a Grexit vote failed), Britain was the only country where a majority wanted to see some powers returned to the national governments from the European Union, according to Pew.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union is undoubtedly a major setback for the European project. But it is also another episode in the island\u2019s long-running love-hate relationship with the rest of the Continent. While Europeans are not happy with the European Union\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis or economic stagnation, Europe\u2019s leaders should not misread this discontent as a popular desire for Brexit-style referendums. Rather, they should call out far-right populists\u2019 political opportunism and use this moment of collective soul-searching about the future of the European Union to create policies that address the people\u2019s concerns.Alina Polyakova is deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center and the author of \u201cThe Dark Side of European Integration.\u201d Neil Fligstein is a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of \u201cEuroclash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco Considers Tax on Tech Companies to Pay for Boom\u2019s Downside", "Date": "2016-07-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Maria Poblet, who leads an organization that assists Latino families facing eviction in San Francisco, says she appreciates the philanthropy that the city\u2019s technology companies do in far-flung places to address global poverty and the environment. But what she really wants to see them do is pay more taxes to help with homelessness and lower-cost housing in San Francisco.\u201cYou have a C.E.O. who cares about kids in Ghana one week or dolphins the next week. Those are important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the people impacted by displacement in San Francisco are a worthy cause, too.\u201dMs. Poblet is part of a group of activists behind an initiative by three city legislators to impose a payroll tax that would apply only to technology companies, which have been the engine of a booming economy that now appears to be slowing.Eric Mar, a member of the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors, announced the proposal last week for a 1.5 percent payroll tax that would serve as a form of indemnification for what he described as the downside of the technology boom.Tech companies have been \u201ca tremendous benefit to the city in many ways,\u201d Mr. Mar said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been paying their fair share.\u201dThe proposal for what has become known as the tech tax comes as officials struggle to fill growing gaps in the city budget. Money from the tech tax would go toward paying for programs for the homeless and the housing \u201caffordability crisis,\u201d Mr. Mar said.\u201cBillions of dollars of venture capital have poured into the city and pushed our people out,\u201d said Ms. Poblet, the executive director of Causa Justa/Just Cause, a nonprofit organization that, among other activities, helps San Francisco residents threatened with eviction.She and other supporters of the tax say the proposal sends a message to tech companies that they should be paying more to mitigate the repercussions of the boom in their sector, especially the precipitous rise in housing costs brought on partly by the influx of their employees, whose average salary is around $150,000 to $200,000, according to Ted Egan, the chief economist of San Francisco.Technology companies have remained silent on the matter. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Natalie Miyake, said the company had decided not to comment on the tax.San Francisco\u2019s budget, which, at $9.6 billion, is larger than a number of state budgets, is around 7 percent higher than last year\u2019s, Mr. Egan said.The office of Mayor Edwin M. Lee, which faced an unusually large deficit projection of $250 million over the next two years, is counting on voters to pass a sales tax increase in November to help pay for transit and homelessness projects and to help balance the budget, which is required by law.Making ends meet, however, will be a struggle. One significant source of revenue, real estate transfer taxes, is expected to fall sharply.The budget projects $235 million in property transfer taxes, down 14 percent from last year, a decline that Benjamin Rosenfield, the city controller, attributed to a drop in large commercial real estate transactions.\u201cYou can see signs of cooling,\u201d Mr. Rosenfield said about San Francisco\u2019s economy. \u201cThe question is: When will things turn south?\u201dFrom 13 percent growth in hiring last year, tech companies are increasing staff size at a rate of just under 3 percent this year, Mr. Egan said. The median price of a home in San Francisco fell 13.3 percent from April to May, to a little over $1.1 million, according to the research firm CoreLogic. On an annual basis, prices have declined 2 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a slowdown,\u201d Mr. Egan said.But it seems unlikely that the tax will be enacted. The proposal, which would need the support of six of the 11 members of the Board of Supervisors to be placed on the ballot in November, has the public support of just three. Even if the board approves the measure, it would require the approval of two-thirds of voters in November to take effect.Skeptics say it is difficult to define what a tech company is, and they criticize the measure for singling out companies based in the city while the giants of Silicon Valley are not affected \u2014 even though thousands of their employees live in the city and have contributed to the income inequality and high housing costs.\u201cThis tax on technology jobs will not help our housing crisis,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a member of the Board of Supervisors who opposes the measure. \u201cIt won\u2019t make housing less expensive. It won\u2019t reduce the number of homeless people. What it will do is chase away good-paying jobs and erode our tax base.\u201dTensions over tax revenue are likely to increase if the slowdown in the technology sector persists or worsens. San Francisco\u2019s economy is still growing, but at a significantly slower pace than at the height of the boom, which is now in its sixth year.Melissa Whitehouse, the acting budget director, cautions that the city must plan for higher-than-expected retirement contributions for 30,800 employees and other long-term costs. The city\u2019s five-year budget plan predicts steadily increasing shortfalls. If the sales tax increase is not approved by voters, the city will be forced to make cuts.\u201cI talked to the mayor a lot about how we didn\u2019t have as much money this year,\u201d Ms. Whitehouse said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C.", "Date": "2016-07-26", "News": "Supported byBut intelligence officials have cautioned that they are uncertain whether the electronic break-in at the committee\u2019s computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage \u2014 of the kind the United States also conducts around the world \u2014 or as part of an effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.The emails were released by WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the presidency. It is unclear how the documents made their way to the group. But a large sampling was published before the WikiLeaks release by several news organizations and someone who called himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d who investigators now believe was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence service.Such a public accusation could result in a further deterioration of the already icy relationship between Washington and Moscow, at a moment when the administration is trying to reach an accord with Mr. Putin on a cease-fire in Syria and on other issues. It could also doom any effort to reach some kind of agreement about acceptable behavior in cyberspace, of the kind the United States has been discussing with China.He noted that \u201con a regular basis, they try to influence elections in Europe.\u201dStealing information about another country\u2019s political infighting is hardly new, and the United States has conducted covert collection from allies like Germany and adversaries like Russia for decades. Publishing the documents \u2014 what some have called \u201cweaponizing\u201d them \u2014 is a different issue. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has suggested that Mr. Putin was trying to even the score after the former secretary of state denounced a 2011 Russian election as filled with fraud.\u201cThe first thing that the secretary of state did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers,\u201d Mr. Putin said at the time. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d Mr. Putin continued. \u201cThey heard the signal and, with the support of the U.S. State Department, began active work.\u201dCampaign officials have also suggested that Mr. Putin could be trying to tilt the election to Donald J. Trump. But they acknowledge that they have no evidence.How U.S. intelligence officials have connected the Russian government to an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.Asked on Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia whether \u201cthere\u2019s more to the Trump/Russian relationship that hasn\u2019t come out,\u201d John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, said, \u201cWell, he certainly has a bromance with Mr. Putin, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Podesta said that while Russia had a \u201chistory\u201d of interfering in democratic elections in Europe, it would be \u201cunprecedented in the United States.\u201dOn Twitter Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that in order to deflect \u201cthe horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster,\u201d Democrats were saying: \u201cRussia is dealing with Trump. Crazy!\u201d\u201cFor the record,\u201d he said, \u201cI have ZERO investments in Russia.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry raised the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Vientiane, Laos. Mr. Lavrov dismissed the idea that Russia was involved, telling reporters who asked about the charges: \u201cI don\u2019t want to use four-letter words.\u201dMr. Kerry made no accusations, saying he had to allow the F.B.I. to \u201cdo its work\u201d before he drew \u201cany conclusions in terms of what happened or who\u2019s behind it.\u201dThe federal investigation, involving the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April.Preliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale \u201cmetadata\u201d left on documents that were released before WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., entered the committee\u2019s networks last summer.The G.R.U., a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival. Investigators believe it is the G.R.U. that has played a bigger role in releasing the emails.Mr. Assange\u2019s threat to release documents, she wrote, \u201cmeans, put simply, that actors outside the U.S. are using criminal means to influence the outcome of a US election. That\u2019s a problem.\u201dBut American intelligence agencies have their doubts that the Russian intention, at least initially, was to sway the American election. The intrusion began just shortly after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. At the time, his chances looked minuscule. One senior official noted that while the cyberattack might have been intended to embarrass Mrs. Clinton, who was the presumptive nominee, it could not have been aimed at bolstering Mr. Trump.It is far from clear that Mr. Obama or the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, would ever name Russia as the origin of the hack. Mr. Obama has only once accused a country of attacking an American organization, when he said North Korea was the source of the 2014 attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the United States has no relationship with North Korea, and there was little to lose from identifying it.In the case of Russia and China \u2014 countries with which the United States has complex relationships \u2014 Mr. Obama has in the past made the opposite decision. He never named the Russian intelligence agencies as the perpetrators of hacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.While the administration has called out the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China for stealing intellectual property \u2014 even indicting officers of its now-inactive Unit 61398 \u2014 it never publicly accused the Chinese intelligence services of stealing the security-clearance files on more than 21 million Americans who held or applied for clearances.By happenstance, the intelligence report on the Democratic National Committee hacking was circulating here the day that Mr. Obama issued a new policy, long in development, to organize the government\u2019s response to major cyberattacks and to set up a six-point \u201cgrading system\u201d to assess the severity of strikes against American companies, government agencies and organizations.The action against the Democratic committee, they said, would qualify as a \u201csignificant cyber incident,\u201d which was defined as one that causes \u201cdemonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or public health and safety of the American people.\u201dBut the ranking system does not mandate what kind of response the president would authorize. And it was designed before many in Washington imagined the use of cyberattacks to release information in the midst of a dizzying, and volatile, presidential campaign.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Eric Schmitt from Colorado Springs. Amy Chozick contributed reporting from Philadelphia.Advertisement"}

He also noticed tents set up by protesters who had been staging sit-ins and hunger strikes to demand higher pay. But he quickly learned that the dispute went beyond labor, with tensions dating to the late 19th century, when the French first colonized Tunisia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a question of the economy and social movement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the beginning this village was nothing. It was just desert, rocks and mountains. There was no water, no agriculture, no civilization. And people came just to work in the mines during French occupation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The problem, he says, is that the French brought workers from Algeria, Morocco and Libya, but kept them divided in order to maintain control. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey created conflict in the community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a benefit for the French occupation to not have that union because if there was a union of workers, for sure they would fight for their rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAccording to Mr. Ben Romdhane, the division is still apparent more than a century later. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the only place in Tunisia where we have this kind of tribal conflict,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand where it came from.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile labor tensions are a running theme, Mr. Ben Romdhane also found moments of levity: He photographed a crack in a government wall to show what he describes as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark humor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so fragile, that everything is made by hand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He also photographed a young boy playing in a costume made of cardboard boxes, and explained that residents, especially the young, find creative ways to fill their time.  He says he thinks his own feelings about the government may have influenced how he approached the project, as he tends to side with the laborers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that the Tunisian government is first responsible for these economic and social problems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think when we will have participant democracy and a transparent government, we can start thinking and cooperate with the people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
