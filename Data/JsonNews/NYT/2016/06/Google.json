{"Headline": "A FanDuel-DraftKings Merger Might Be Worth a Chance", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThere would be some logic to uniting the two big daily fantasy-sports sites, an idea that is being discussed, according to news reports. Prominent backers that might include Alphabet\u2019s Google, KKR and the Dallas Cowboys could perhaps improve the odds on their collective $700 million investment in the two start-ups. State lawmakers, however, can throttle one big site as easily as two.There would be some obvious savings from putting FanDuel and DraftKings together. Any football fan who sat through the onslaught of TV commercials from the two companies last fall knows that the ad budget could be slashed. Together, FanDuel and DraftKings accounted for a whopping 59 percent of third-quarter United States television advertising growth, according to Bernstein Research. In September alone, the two sites spent more than $100 million, MoffettNathanson analysts estimate.The legal defense synergies are also appealing. Several states have shut down FanDuel and DraftKings, and combining the two lobbying budgets might add a little muscle, as legislators continue to question the credibility of the nascent $4 billion industry. Of course, a merger also might open up a new legal battleground: antitrust. Together, the two companies would control 95 percent of their narrowly defined market.In New York, FanDuel and DraftKings agreed to go dark earlier this year after sparring with Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. An appeals hearing is scheduled for September, and local lawmakers are considering new proposals. Other states have initiated investigations into fantasy sports, as Illinois and Nevada push to classify the business as a gambling activity rather than one of skill, as the fantasy-site operators argue.With so much opposition to overcome, merging FanDuel and DraftKings might be worth a chance. The odds for a sustainable and successful business model, however, would remain long.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What You Need to Know About Apple\u2019s Software Upgrades", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple customers have a lot to digest this summer.Technology enthusiasts and gear heads are usually excited about big upgrades, but for average consumers, the changes can be overwhelming. Will devices get better or worse? Will the software change so much that it will disrupt the tools we use for work?Thankfully, Apple\u2019s four upgraded operating systems \u2014 iOS, tvOS, MacOS and WatchOS \u2014 are due out in the fall, so there is plenty of time to research and prepare.\u201cAt Apple, we believe that technology should lift humanity and should enrich people\u2019s lives in all the ways they want to experience it \u2014 whether it\u2019s on their wrist, in the living room, on the desk, in the palm of their hand,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during Monday\u2019s keynote presentation.Here is a guide to how your devices will change if you install the software upgrades in a few months.Apple\u2019s next version of its mobile operating system, called iOS 10, will have an impact on how you communicate and potentially reduce the amount of time you spend fiddling with the phone.Among them, the Messages app that iPhone and iPad users primarily rely on for sending text messages will get a major overhaul. In the app, you will soon be able to draw sketches and hand-write notes to others, as well as attach animations, like confetti or fireworks. Apple is also letting third-party software developers offer modifications to the Messages app, meaning you might be able to add special messages, like stickers, special emoji or animated GIFs.Another significant change is the evolution of Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. Third-party app developers can take advantage of voice commands, so you should be able to use voice commands to summon an Uber car, send a message through WhatsApp or map a jog with a fitness app, among other tricks.Other changes will not require a significant reset. With iOS 10, the iPhone screen will wake up when you raise it up \u2014 no need to press a button anymore. Apple also redesigned its music app with new colors and navigation features. Its default maps app will let outside developers integrate their services into the mapping app, so you might be able to book a restaurant table by tapping on a restaurant inside the map, for example. Apple is also adding the ability to search for nearby points of interest, like gas stations and coffee shops, similar to Google\u2019s Waze app.Sierra will also have tighter integration with other Apple devices. If you are wearing an Apple Watch, you can log into a Mac computer without typing in a password. When shopping on the web, you can use an iPhone to pay with Apple Pay, the company\u2019s mobile wallet service, by taking out the iPhone and registering your fingerprint to complete the purchase.Apple is now trying to address this problem with WatchOS, the next version of the operating system for Apple Watch. The company says third-party apps will open instantly with the new update.Another important change is coming to the fitness portion of Apple Watch. With the update, you will be able to see the fitness activity of other friends wearing Apple Watch, like the number of hours they have stood up and calories they have burned. Apple also added some new watch faces, letting you tailor the look to your liking.The next version of tvOS, the Apple TV\u2019s software system, caters largely to sports fans. A new feature called Live Tune In will let you immediately access a live broadcast. Speaking a command like \u201cWatch ESPN2\u201d can load a live sports game.Apple also expanded its Apple TV remote-control app that it offers for iPhones. Basically, the remote app will gain the same capabilities as the physical remote for the Apple TV, which includes a button for accessing Siri. So in the event that your remote control vanishes between your couch cushions, you can launch the remote app on your iPhone and use Siri to find something to watch, or swipe around on the phone screen to select an app.When the upgrades are released this fall, consumers would benefit from a somewhat cautious approach. Often with big software upgrades, bugs creep into earlier versions, so it\u2019s wise to wait at least a few weeks to assess whether the coast is clear before jumping in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dawn of the Virtual Assistant", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byCirca NowYou don\u2019t hear many people bellyaching about the servant problem these days.In 1904, when Saki wrote, \u201cThe cook was a good cook, as cooks go, and as cooks go, she went,\u201d this lapidary witticism would have fallen on kind ears. The bourgeoisie of that era talked about the unreliability of hired help with the same willed petulance that we reserve today for conversations about how it takes three remotes to turn on our TV.Indeed, in today\u2019s world, it seems as if you\u2019d be less likely to hear about a domestic walking out than you would someone falling in love with his virtual assistant.I recently used a virtual assistant named Amy for 10 days. We did not fall in love, but I should point out that Amy is underage because she is still in beta. (\u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s about a teenager now,\u201d Amy\u2019s representative told me. \u201cWhich means occasionally moody and incorrigible.\u201d)My relationship with Amy was less Lord Grantham/the housemaid Jane than the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice/his bucket.Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Now and Cortana have helped many people navigate their lives, but the next wave of helpers is likely to have more agency.Winningly, Amy is (for now) free. Once her users sign up on the x.ai website, they need tangle with neither hardware nor app.The best part of having a virtual assistant is telling your friends you have a virtual assistant; I felt as if I\u2019d discovered a third buttock.Additionally, I loved that Amy sent me copies of all her correspondence for the first three meetings she set up for me. It was reassuring that Amy did not not deploy the locutions \u201cNo problem\u201d or its hideous offspring \u201cN.P.\u201dBut the more I used Amy, the more I saw that she can be relied on for finding a mutually convenient time between parties, but not much more.When I told one friend to meet me at the Starbuck\u2019s near Bond Street, Amy provided the address for the wrong Starbuck\u2019s; one afternoon when I invited my boyfriend, Greg, to the admittedly vague location \u201cthe beach\u201d in August, I came home that night to six emails from Amy.Stranger yet, when Amy sends confirmation of a meeting, her list of the meeting\u2019s attendees includes herself, so apparently Amy will join Greg and I at the beach. Hawt.It also intrigued me that I maintained decorum with Amy (lots of \u201cThanks\u201d and \u201cGreat\u201d) even though I didn\u2019t have to. As one fellow x.ai user put it: \u201cIt would actually take more energy to stop myself from being civil. There\u2019s an energetic cost to being rude or neutral or bleh.\u201dI wanted to test Amy with some of the vagaries that sometimes befall get-togethers. My own friends and colleagues are, of course, far, far too drenched in integrity and follow-through ever to exhibit even the tiniest glimmer of unreliability or waffling, so I created an email account for someone I called Tania.I imagined Tania to be an impulsive, scatterbrained entertainer for children. When Amy extended to Tania an invitation for coffee at Starbucks, I had Tania write back to Amy: \u201cI can do 3:00 on Monday, unless I only get 3 hours of sleep that night and look smeary and indistinct and have trouble following the thread of conversations. In which case Thursday or Friday are much better.\u201dAmy blithely set the appointment for Monday at 3:00, not telling me about Tania\u2019s pre-emptive waffle. Oops.Next, on the morning of the coffee date, I had Tania write Amy, \u201cI\u2019m working a kids birthday party directly after I meet Henry. Do you think it will be O.K. if I bring a suitcase full of baby animals to Starbucks?\u201dAmy forwarded me the email, saying she didn\u2019t think she could answer it, and then told Tania she had done so, encouraging Tania to get in touch with me directly if Tania didn\u2019t hear from me. Well done.Finally, 16 minutes before Tania\u2019s and my supposed appointment, I had Tania write Amy to say that she was running 15 minutes late: \u201cA bottle of moisturizer has exploded and I am beset with goo.\u201d Amy nimbly forwarded the message to me minutes later. Nice.The one person in my life whom I was loath to sic Amy on was my former part-time assistant Ryan, whom I had to let go a few months ago because of budgetary downsizing.Without using Amy, I asked Ryan to meet me for lunch at a cafe in the West Village, where I unbosomed the sordid news that I had taken on a virtual assistant. Ryan let out a mock gasp and tucked into his steamed vegetables.I said, \u201cI brought you to a restaurant to tell you this so you wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d He thanked me for my sensitivity. I added, \u201cI know how hard a time this is in the arts, job wise, for straight white boys.\u201d He readdressed his vegetables. I paid for lunch to assuage my guilt.The strangest moment I\u2019ve had with Amy, though, came when I had her set up an appointment for a phone interview with an x.ai employee who also uses the company\u2019s virtual assistant \u2014 in this case, Andrew \u2014 for making appointments.After Amy and Andrew had set up the appointment, I asked Amy why I didn\u2019t see the appointment on my calendar; strangely, she wrote back as Andrew. I thought, not only is my assistant invisible, unpredictable, occasionally moody, and incorrigible \u2014 she is also trans.In the end, working with Amy has made me think about assistantship. Besides the nuts-and-bolts of completing tasks efficiently, what are we looking for in our helpers? Reassurance? A second opinion? All our best qualities narcissistically reflected back at us?I want all of these, as well as someone who will smile or laugh the fifth time I refer to vegans as \u201cvegsbians,\u201d not to mention someone who can tell me whether or not the kids are still wearing bonnets in Williamsburg, and whether you\u2019re meant to store your Skrillex alongside your hammer and your pliers, or alongside your vibrator and your lubricant.All of these skills elude my simple Amy. But Amy has one thing going for her that you\u2019re unlikely to see from any of her living, breathing counterparts: on Monday morning, Amy sends me a summary of my meetings for the week. But when I say \u201cMonday morning,\u201d I don\u2019t mean at 8:23 a.m., as she\u2019s groggily lumbering onto the L train at the Bedford stop. I mean at 3:47 a.m.It was hugely consoling to learn that my helper was thoroughly invested in my schedule at an hour when my bladder is making a lot of troubling decisions for me. Indeed, reading the time code \u201c3.47 a.m.\u201d made me feel as if I was looking at one of those webby holographic depictions of tissue being regenerated on the Bionic Man\u2019s body.In her present state, Amy may not be able to do much beyond reduce the number of emails that lie between you and the awkward meeting at the Doppio Hut where you and your regional buyer ask each other if you\u2019re taking any vacation days this summer. But we have the technology. We can rebuild her.Henry Alford is the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That? A Modern Guide to Manners.\u201d Circa Now appears monthly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lord of the Lies", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEarlier this month, the world\u2019s most battle-scarred cable news network did something extraordinary in this year of vaporous political contrails. While Donald Trump was delivering one of his easily debunked lies, CNN fact-checked him \u2014 in near real time at the bottom of the screen.\u201cTrump: I never said Japan should have nukes (he did).\u201d Thus read the chyron that shook the television world \u2014 maybe.Given the scale of Trump\u2019s mendacity and the stakes for the free world, it\u2019s time that we go into the fall debates with a new rule \u2014 an instant fact-check on statements made by the candidates onstage. The Presidential Debate Commission should do what any first-grader with Google access can do, and call out lies before the words hit the floor.Setting up a truth referee is not difficult. And while doing such a thing is unlikely to ensure that the debates would be substantive, it could at least guarantee a reality foundation at a time when fact-free speech is the language of the political class.How can we discuss the economy when Trump suggests that the unemployment rate, just under 5 percent, is actually 42 percent? Or debate the Paris climate accord, when Trump falsely claims it \u201cgives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land\u201d? Or deal with terrorism, after Trump said he knows \u201cmore about ISIS than the generals.\u201d The debates are meaningless without a neutral party screening the garbage.The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker has dinged Trump with 30 of its Four Pinocchio ratings \u2014 lying 70 percent of the time. Trump cares so little about the truth that when the Fact Checker reaches out to him for an explanation, he never responds, the paper noted.Trump got his start on the national political stage as a liar, playing to the birther fantasies of Barack Obama\u2019s worst haters. One of the questions he might be asked in the three fall debates is what, exactly, he discovered when he claimed his investigators \u201ccannot believe what they\u2019re finding\u201d in Hawaii five years ago.With Trump University, he created a business model built on a house of lies. An executive called it \u201ca total lie,\u201d and a sales manager said it was a \u201cfraudulent scheme\u201d designed to bilk vulnerable clients, according to court testimony. It was that class-action lawsuit that got Trump into his present caldron of lies \u2014 calling the Indiana-born judge in the case a \u201cMexican.\u201d By that standard, Trump is a German, with a grandfather from Kallstadt.For a while, I tried to chart the days of his lies, and just got overwhelmed. He said the suicide of the former Clinton aide Vince Foster was \u201cvery fishy,\u201d when five separate investigations found it to be a sad self-killing and nothing more. He could have looked at the United States Drought Monitor before saying \u201cthere is no drought\u201d at the very California site that is now in its fifth year of an epic arid spell.He even lies about his lies. He claimed he wanted to keep a personal donation to veterans private, when in fact he\u2019d boasted in January of a $1 million gift, which wasn\u2019t sent out until the press began questioning him on it months later.Sadly, a lot of voters don\u2019t care if a candidate is a pathological liar. But most of us should. It\u2019s up to the debate commission, as they set the rules for the fall, to ensure that truth has a place on the stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Incubators on a Mission of Diversity", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipCHICAGO \u2014 Many tech start-ups are in the business of making themselves successful. But some entrepreneurs have set up businesses with the express mission of training others to be successful in the tech sector.Several of those start-ups have dedicated themselves to creating programs, incubators or accelerators to train blacks and Hispanics for tech jobs.Their efforts are coming at a time when Silicon Valley has increasingly been scrutinized for its lack of diversity. But instead of leaving it to the tech giants to solve the problem alone, some see their own connections as a way to address the issue.Founders of these start-ups say tech companies have to try new ways of seeking out talent. With the guiding hand of these programs, many alumni have gone on to secure tech internships and jobs or form their own start-ups.Angela Benton, founder of NewME, an accelerator for entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, said she faced skepticism about whether her business model was possible. Instead, Silicon Valley influencers encouraged her to scour elite institutions to find minority entrepreneurs to help.Ms. Benton said she discovered that some of the most talented entrepreneurs weren\u2019t aiming to create the next billion-dollar start-up. Rather, the entrepreneurs of color were content to begin a company worth a few million dollars.Over five years, the NewME accelerator has helped businesses raise more than $20 million in venture capital funding. It offers one-week programs and has more than 20,000 members so far.Many established accelerators and start-up incubators tend to be in regions and cities dominated by existing tech or business firms. For the new entrepreneurs, a key to success is setting up in underserved areas.Emile Cambry Jr., the founder of the nonprofit tech incubator Blue1647, chose to open its first location in Chicago\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood, a primarily Hispanic neighborhood southwest of the city\u2019s bustling downtown.The classes are not for dabblers. The company developed its curriculum to train students in Java, Ruby and other computer languages. It also provides a shared work space for entrepreneurs and connects students with internships, jobs and networking opportunities.Since its founding in 2013, the nonprofit has expanded to Chicago\u2019s Roseland neighborhood, as well as St. Louis and Compton, Calif. A low-income area of Austin, Tex., is next.Some alumni have interned at Google, Answers.com and other tech companies, while others have started their own businesses or landed tech jobs, Mr. Cambry said.Even with tech backing, many of these ventures initially faced hurdles, like raising money or finding the best way to publicize community outreach.Kenneth Watkins, chief strategy officer at Blue1647, said he noticed that the Hispanic girls shone the most at the group\u2019s internship accelerator programs, but there weren\u2019t enough organizations catering to their specific needs, like bilingual skills. So in 2014, he started Latina Girls Code, which also offers training in 3-D printing and creating wearable tech. The program has only trained 83 Latinas, most of whom are third-generation, in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other programming languages.But working with overlooked communities comes with unexpected challenges. For example, Mr. Watkins noticed that Chicago workshop locations discouraged some students and their families from participating because some feared being targeted by immigration officials or the police while traveling to the city.\u201cWe now have to do an Aurora thing and a Joliet thing \u2014 we have to do two different events, because they just can\u2019t travel but so far,\u201d he said.To expand, the founders of such ventures realize that collaborating with investors and tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google brings in more resources for their programs.Doing so takes networking in tech circles and reaching out to companies who aim to diversify their staff and directly asking for their support, Mr. Watkins said. For him, it meant going to meet-ups and emphasizing to tech giants that supporting his organization could help close the diversity gap.\u201cA lot of people like what you do until you start asking for money. Then it becomes quiet,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cYou really have to have people in those positions who can really be advocates.\u201dSome of the most successful graduates of the start-ups would never have considered careers in technology. Nehemiah Bishop, a Chicago South Side native who earned his accounting degree at the University of Illinois-Chicago, \u201cslept in hotels and lived in vans at one point\u201d in his life, but he received help from his brother and others to finish college.An accounting internship made him realize that it wasn\u2019t the field he wanted to pursue. He enrolled in Blue1647\u2019s HTML, CSS and JavaScript class and a Ruby on Rails class, which helped him land a Google internship. He was hired as an industrial engineer at UPS in May.\u201cAt Blue1647, when you come in to take a basic coding class, to get help with a start-up or to just come in for help with your homework, you come in to a family environment,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. The incubator provides \u201cthat extra help of guidance from individuals that look like you, individuals that care for you as much as your parents care for you and who believe in you without a doubt.\u201dMany of these ventures say that to really make a difference, more collaborations with established tech companies are necessary.\u201cThere\u2019s enough out there for everybody to eat,\u201d Mr. Liddell said. \u201cIf we stay in our neighborhoods instead of moving out, we get the jobs and go back and hire from our neighborhoods and train from our neighborhoods, then we have a better outlook over all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Photography\u2019s Shifting Identity in an Insta-World", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byArt ReviewIn its 2014 Triennial, the center made a serious move toward embracing digital media, and now it has fully done so. Photography no longer means pictures printed and framed. It also means images, infinite in number, flowing in real-time data streams and captured on webcams, video blogs, Twitter and Instagram. This institutional shift in emphasis from hard objects to the broad field of visual culture will make old-style connoisseurs crazy, but it is in line with the center\u2019s history.It was founded in 1974 largely as a showcase for street photography, war photography and other socially committed and essentially journalistic genres: Content was as important as form. The inclusion of digital media maintains that interest, with the internet now functioning as both boulevard and battlefield, and \u2014 this really is new \u2014 where photographers were once a distinctive and specialized crew, now almost everyone is armed, for better and worse, with picture-taking devices and the means to distribute images.Ms. Bookchin\u2019s editing is inventive and revealing. Every time a word or phrase common to all the diaries occurs, all the heads say it in unison, interrupting film\u2019s otherwise random-seeming this-speaker-then-that-speaker flow. The overall effect is twofold: You get a sense of the existence of a digitally connected community of suffering, one with a shared vocabulary and set of emotions. You also begin to wonder, as you do when you overhear public cellphone conversations: How is it possible that so many people are living such clich\u00e9d lives?In one way or another, much of the show \u2014 assembled by Charlotte Cotton, the center\u2019s first curator in residence, working with Pauline Vermare, associate curator, and Marina Chao, assistant curator \u2014 is built around the basic elements of Mr. Rickard\u2019s work: surveillance crossing into voyeurism, visual fiction standing in for truth. But then, hasn\u2019t photography always had a predatory streak, an eye for existential dirt, an impulse to lie if that will grab attention? Sure, and there are plenty of predigital demonstrations of that here.These are images of violation. There are others, several associated with celebrity culture. In a 1971 photograph we see Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dashing across a lawn in Central Park, apparently fleeing the photographer, Ron Galella, who had been stalking her for years. Two internet-savvy contemporary artists, Ann Hirsch and Marisa Olson, turn the humiliation of losing highly visible competitions \u2014 a reality dating show, an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d audition \u2014 into triumphs of self-engineered failure. And in a flawless win-win power move, the media star Kim Kardashian assumes the role of auto-stalker, publishing a book consisting entirely of her own selfies.Ms. Syms\u2019s ambitious work, dated 2014-16, brings us again into the digital realm, which can be uneven ground to visit. A set of flat screens streaming real-time data from Twitter and other social media sources keeps the show in the 24/7 now, where it should be. And the information, organized by Mark Ghuneim, an internet entrepreneur, and students from the center\u2019s New Media Narratives program and sometimes presented in the form of online addresses, gives a good sense of the pervasive influence of digital technology on daily life, whether in police surveillance or assignment of pop star status. At the same time, the piece offers few visual rewards, and demands smartphone finger work to access its information.The visual content of this piece is a far cry from the museum quality images usually associated with the center as a collecting institution. And the exhibition itself, with its mirrored walls and jumble of unalike works, has a looseness that most museums, intent on writing clear narratives, would clean up. At this point, though, visual culture \u2014 digital production, including photography \u2014 is so abundant and changing so fast that no clear narrative is possible. Photography fans hoping that the return of the center will mean a return of its vintage collection may have to wait awhile. This institution, so often ahead of the curve, has other, challenging ideas on its mind, and the less it acts like a museum the better.\u201cPublic, Private, Secret\u201d runs through January at the International Center of Photography (I.C.P.), 250 Bowery, Manhattan; icp.org.

Google also announced plans to introduce a messaging service with similar capabilities.\u201cA lot of the messaging apps are moving toward this,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with Gartner who attended the event. \u201cIf Apple hadn\u2019t announced developer access to messages, I would have been really surprised.\u201dDevelopers were also pleased to get access to Siri so they could incorporate voice commands into their own apps. Until now, Siri has mostly been limited to Apple services and has been used for tasks like conducting searches, getting directions or asking the virtual assistant to make a call.Faizan Buzdar, chief executive of Convo, a business collaboration software maker, said his company had already been using Siri to a limited extent so that customers could bookmark items that pop up in the Convo app.\u201cBut my vision would be to say, \u2018What\u2019s our revenue this week?\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Siri would then open Convo, which would pull in data from its app and partner apps, and provide the answer. \u201cThat kind of natural language can really push the barriers of business.\u201dInitially, Siri will only be available for certain categories of apps like those providing ride-hailing, messaging and photo-search services.Apple has been a leader on mobile devices since the introduction of the iPhone a decade ago. But in some critical respects, it is now playing catch-up.For example, Google, whose Android smartphone software is more popular than Apple\u2019s globally, uses sophisticated facial recognition technology to organize a user\u2019s photos, and Google\u2019s mapping service works closely with other apps to identify important locations and automatically provide directions to appointments.Apple said on Monday that it would offer similar features in the next version of its iPhone software, iOS 10, which will be released in the fall with a new crop of iPhones.Similarly, Apple\u2019s integration of other services into iMessage mirrors what Facebook has done with Messenger and what Tencent, a major Apple rival in China, has done with WeChat messaging.Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on uploading a user\u2019s data to the cloud, Apple said the new features will keep data on the phone to protect user privacy.\u201cIn some ways the star of the show wasn\u2019t a particular product but Apple\u2019s refutation of accusations that it can\u2019t compete with Google and Facebook in artificial intelligence and deep learning,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, in an email after the presentation.Apple is a clear leader in some areas, particularly the nascent field of smartwatches. Announcing improvements to its year-old Watch platform, Apple said that the new version of the watch\u2019s operating system would start apps instantly. Users will also be able to scribble responses to messages one letter at time, instead of relying on the canned responses that are currently available.The Watch remains tethered to the iPhone for most uses, and the company seems to be repositioning it as a healthy-living accessory, offering improved activity tracking and sharing. There is even a new deep-breathing app.In an attempt to persuade customers to buy more Apple products, the company also introduced a host of planned features to share data between devices. The documents on the desktop of a Mac, for example, will be accessible on iPads and iPhones. Photos taken with the iPhone can be viewed on the Apple TV.Apple signaled its desire to be a player in global e-commerce, where sales are expected to total $2 trillion this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.Apple said that retailers\u2019 websites would soon be able to use Apple Pay as a checkout method, and customers could authorize a purchase with their fingerprint on their iPhone. Currently, the digital payment service is restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response.A few days before the conference, Apple made two other major announcements affecting developers. It will begin testing paid search ads in the App Store, which will allow developers to buy a slot at the top of the search results when a user looks for an app. Apple also said it would reduce the cut it took from subscriptions in apps to 15 percent, from 30 percent, after the first year.Whether Apple\u2019s improvements will be enough to keep developers happily writing apps for the iPhone and other Apple products remains to be seen.Creating an iPhone app typically costs $50,000 to $200,000, and some cost as much as $1 million, according to an eMarketer report last June. A website is cheaper, and while it lacks some convenience of an app, there are techniques to make a site easy for web users to find.\u201cDevelopers are asking, \u2018What is the additional revenue I can get from an app?\u2019\u201d Ms. Boyle said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Testing the Clean-Energy Logic of a Tesla-SolarCity Merger", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byImagine a world in which every home and building is a miniature power plant, with solar panels on the roofs and electric vehicles and stationary battery banks in the garages.Meters and software would manage the flow of power, allowing homeowners and businesses to seamlessly buy and sell electricity at the best prices, simultaneously lowering their costs and raising the amount of green energy on the grid.That\u2019s the long-term vision behind the plan that Elon Musk described late Tuesday, explaining the rationale for Tesla to acquire SolarCity and create the \u201cworld\u2019s only vertically integrated energy company.\u2019\u2019And it may very well become reality, whether in years or decades, and whether Mr. Musk\u2019s version of the vision is one that proves viable.Still, if Mr. Musk and his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, can trounce the competition and surmount their financial woes \u2014 and those are very big ifs \u2014 the integrated company they are trying to assemble could be in a position to dominate.\u201cThis is an effort to build the Apple of clean energy,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat really is part of the new wave of companies that could make this decarbonization addressing climate change really work.\u201dWall Street, at least for the moment, is not on board.SolarCity\u2019s stock, which has been trading at roughly a quarter of its peak value in recent months, rose after the announcement. But Tesla\u2019s has tumbled. Several analysts and investors have questioned the wisdom of adding to both companies\u2019 financial pressures \u2014 between them the companies lost more than $1.6 billion last year \u2014 and potentially distracting Tesla from building its enormous battery factory in Nevada and bringing its first moderately priced car to market next year.Even some energy analysts say the proposed acquisition is at least as much about helping Mr. Musk\u2019s personal investments as furthering his green agenda. But, some energy experts and investors say, there is logic in combining Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, and SolarCity, where he is chairman.Describing Tesla automobiles as \u201cbatteries wrapped in a car,\u201d Shawn Kravetz, founder of the solar power investment company Esplanade Capital, said that the energy storage business was likely to become colossal. \u201cAnd so you can see,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018how the electricity to power those batteries can be an essential part of this.\u201dThe two companies have been moving toward a closer partnership for some time. SolarCity began installing Tesla batteries in pilot projects for residential and commercial customers about four years ago. Last year, Tesla announced its move to market rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that could mount to a home garage wall, as well as battery blocks large enough to power commercial and industrial customers and serve in utility-scale installations to smooth out fluctuations in the grid.At the same time, SolarCity, after years of challenging the utility industry to innovate or die, started acting more like a utility itself. It began a program aimed at cities, remote communities, campuses and military bases to design and operate small, independent power networks called microgrids. At the time, Peter Rive, one of the company\u2019s founders and its chief technical officer, called the system \u201ca template that can be scaled up to basically be the next-generation grid.\u201dAs the leading rooftop solar provider in the country, SolarCity is thought to have the largest collection of data on how solar customers use energy at every minute of the day. With that data \u2014 especially if combined with information from electric cars, chargers and stationary batteries \u2014 the combined company could be well suited to creating products and services based on customer needs.\u201cThey deeply understand what the customer\u2019s usage patterns are,\u201d said Swapnil Shah, chief executive of FirstFuel Software, which provides energy management services to buildings. He compared the potential to Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt and customize online shopping to buyer\u2019s behavior.\u201cThey\u2019re creating unique personalized profiles of your habits,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shah said, \u201cand they use that to identify what is the next click for the next product.\u201dAnd yet, while SolarCity was building the infrastructure for a new, decentralized approach to power production known as distributed generation, while earning a reputation for aggressive attacks on the old-school utility industry, Mr. Musk was turning Tesla into \u201cthe brand that everyone wants to buy,\u201d Mr. Kammen said. That brand burnishing is something that could benefit SolarCity, he said.But a big challenge for Tesla, said Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which focuses on clean energy industries, is that it is not the only company with such a grand vision. Utility industry stalwarts like Edison International and Con Edison are developing energy services and consulting divisions, while technology giants like General Electric, Oracle, Google and even Apple are getting into the business of providing or managing power.Of course, the merger plan may not go through, if other investors balk and because of the corporate governance and other issues arising from Mr. Musk\u2019s roles in both companies. He also owns more than 20 percent of each. But maybe a merger isn\u2019t necessary to achieve the larger goals.\u201cDo you have to own things in order to leverage or even to a certain extent control them?\u201d Mr. Kravetz of Esplanade Capital asked. \u201cI think the answer is no. You don\u2019t have to own the cow to get the milk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Snobs and Me", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byI GRADUATED from Princeton in 1991, and my debut novel was published almost exactly 10 years later, in May 2001. When that first box of hardcovers arrived, I sent copies to a few of my famous professors, then spent the next month acting out my fantasy about my work\u2019s reception.\u201c \u2018Good in Bed\u2019?\u201d I would say, furrowing my brow as I envisioned Toni Morrison or Joyce Carol Oates checking out the cover, with its larger-than-average naked female legs and a slice of cheesecake. I\u2019d pause for effect, frowning, then shake my head and deliver the punch line: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember her at all!\u201dSomewhere between my birth and my novel\u2019s publication, I\u2019d gotten the message that there were books that mattered and books that did not; writers whom an Ivy League institution would be proud to claim, and those who would be asked for donations, but not invited back to speak.I didn\u2019t pull this attitude out of thin air. From a 1999 New York magazine story that offered qualified praise for the genre just starting to be known as \u201cchick lit\u201d to the 2006 publication of \u201cThis Is Not Chick Lit,\u201d an anthology that described itself as stories by \u201cAmerica\u2019s best women writers,\u201d from scornful editors to sneering literary novelists, public sentiment toward books like mine went from bad to worse, even as the books continued to sell.Princeton didn\u2019t help. Jeffrey Eugenides, a creative writing professor there, scoffed that he didn\u2019t know what the popular writer Jodi Picoult was \u201cbellyaching\u201d about when she pointed to the disparity in review praise. A Huffington Post book critic (and recent Princeton graduate) sarcastically suggested, in response to an article I wrote on fiction read by women, that asking literary critics to cover popular fiction would be like asking food critics to cover Hot Pockets. My alma mater felt like one of the haters.For years \u2014 specifically, reunion years like 2006 and 2011 \u2014 I imagined that if I dared to show my face at Princeton, I\u2019d be scorned or possibly pelted with microwaveable snack foods.Is it human nature to feel less-than, especially at a gut-check moment like a college reunion? Do envy and insecurity serve any purpose, other than prompting some extremely creative excuses about why you\u2019re staying home?Envy is a \u201cbrilliant, incredible emotion\u201d \u2014 and an important one, Josh Gressel, a psychologist and the author of \u201cEmbracing Envy: Finding the Spiritual Treasure in Our Most Shameful Emotion,\u201d told me. Basically, envy is a signal, showing us not that there\u2019s something wrong with us, but that there\u2019s something that we deserve that we aren\u2019t claiming.For me, there\u2019s something standing between the knowledge that people enjoy my work and the belief that their enjoyment matters.I doubled down on therapy, and I beat back the dread long enough to sign up for my 25-year reunion last month. I wanted to show my daughters the campus. I wanted to show off my new husband. I wanted to reclaim my college experience, to feel, or at least act, as if I belonged there, too.So I sent in my check, and I rolled my eyes at the pre-reunion announcements, especially the one describing our class jacket\u2019s fit as akin to \u201cRalph Lauren Polo\u201d blazer for the men, or Brooks Brothers for women. Not my brands. I forwarded the jacket note to friends, asking, now do you see why I am dreading this?The overall pleasant evening has led me to the painful realization that I\u2019ve spent 15 years insisting that books like mine deserve a place on the shelf, and maybe I don\u2019t entirely believe it myself. Why else was I so willing to give credence to the naysayers and have trouble hearing the readers who said my books gave them comfort, kept them entertained, made them feel less alone?It made me think about numbers, and how I can tell you, with nary a Google, that only 9 percent of the top-grossing films released last year were directed by women; or that women hold only 19 percent of the seats in Congress; or how in 2015 The New Yorker had 232 female bylines, and 453 from men.On Sunday morning of the reunion weekend, my 8-year-old daughter, Phoebe, and I strolled from our dorm rooms to the class of 1991 headquarters. In spite of the haze of booze in the air, and the beer-spongy lawns, the school had never looked grander.Phoebe and I sat down with our muffins and juice. One of my classmates approached, almost shyly, as if she was the one who was scared, or had reason to be ashamed of how she made her living.Jennifer Weiner is the author, most recently, of the forthcoming memoir \u201cHungry Heart,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the same message that voters want Mr. Trump to deliver to the Washington establishment if he is elected president.DANIEL ROBINOWITZDallasTo the Editor:It is quite obvious that Donald Trump does not understand the role of the media in a democracy: to be the eyes and ears for all citizens by reporting as honestly and fairly as possible about events and individuals. They are our watchdogs.It increasingly seems to be the policy of politicians (and others) to shoot the messenger who delivers \u201cbad\u201d messages.

But for years commentators \u2014 from Alexander Hamilton to reporters covering the Arab Spring \u2014 have warned against too much power for the street mob.Violence, intolerance, mass delusions \u2014 all are the result of unfettered energy emanating from the unruly street. That The Times should now report on the fear of fascism\u2019s rise is too little too late. The dangers seen in the rantings of Donald Trump, and the violent response of some of his followers, are part of a pattern as old as history.Call it what you will, what we are seeing today is how ancient fears can be spread through the electronic media, and how, in the hands of a master showman, these common prejudices can be made to serve as a political platform.The worst is yet to come.MARC REUBENLanghorne, Pa.To the Editor:Perhaps a constant reminder that a vote for Mr. Trump is a vote for the worst side of the American psyche will help bring home to decent people everywhere how vital it is to defeat Mr. Trump and his hordes promoting hatred.HILL GRIMMETTFort Collins, Colo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thomas J. Perkins, Pioneering Venture Capitalist in Silicon Valley, Dies at 84", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byThomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valley\u2019s venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84.His longtime assistant, Kathy Daly, said Mr. Perkins died after a prolonged illness, which she did not specify.Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins \u2014 and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. \u2014 became a destination for other venture capitalists.Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.The firm\u2019s success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world.Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.\u2019s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled \u201cMine\u2019s Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the World\u2019s Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It\u201d (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkins\u2019s \u201clegacy won\u2019t be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed,\u201d though he was a \u201cseminal figure\u201d for Silicon Valley.In a statement on Thursday, two other Kleiner Perkins co-founders, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had \u201cdefined what we know of today as entrepreneurial venture capital by going beyond just funding to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions with operating expertise.\u201dThat lifestyle was the backdrop to one of several books he wrote, a novel titled \u201cSex and the Single Zillionaire\u201d (2006), which featured a yacht on its cover. For the book, Mr. Perkins had guidance from the romance novelist Danielle Steel, whom he married in 1998; the marriage ended in divorce. He dedicated the novel to her.Thomas James Perkins was born on Jan. 7, 1932, and grew up in White Plains in modest circumstances, attending White Plains High School. His father, Harry, worked for an insurance company, and his mother, Elizabeth, was an occasional seamstress.He became interested in technology early. In a 2007 autobiography, \u201cValley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins,\u201d he wrote that as a youth he assembled television kits and had planned to be a TV repairman.Accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he studied electrical engineering and computer science, earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in both. He later received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. After working for a time for Sperry Gyroscope Company in Great Neck, on Long Island, he moved to California, where he worked in the technology industry for a decadeHe joined H.P. in the 1960s, working for the company\u2019s founders, David Packard and William Hewlett. In his autobiography, Mr. Perkins wrote that Mr. Packard and Mr. Hewlett \u201cwere restless and driven men.\u201d\u201cTheir aspirations always reached beyond the present success,\u201d he added, noting that he had been \u201cfortunate to have come knocking on their door.\u201dWhen Mr. Perkins and Eugene Kleiner founded Kleiner Perkins in 1972 (Mr. Byers and Mr. Caufield joined later), Silicon Valley knew little of venture capital, and the men had the field largely to themselves, investing in fledgling companies like Tandem Computers, Applied Materials and Genentech.Mr. Perkins later stepped away from active venture investing and joined several corporate boards over the years, including Compaq Computer and News Corp. Compaq was purchased by H.P. in 2002, and Mr. Perkins joined H.P.\u2019s board in 2005, not long before its chief executive at the time, Carly Fiorina, was fired. Mr. Perkins supported Ms. Fiorina\u2019s recent run for the Republican presidential nomination.Before his marriage to Ms. Steel, Mr. Perkins was married to Gerd Thune-Ellefsen, a Norwegian whom he had met skiing near Lake Tahoe, until her death in 1994. He is survived by two children from that marriage, a son, Tor, and a daughter, Elizabeth.An earlier version of this obituary misidentified one of the Kleiner Perkins co-founders who released a statement on Mr. Perkins\u2019s death. It was Brook Byers, not John Doerr. The earlier version also misstated his place of death. He died in Marin County, Calif., but not in Tiburon.An obituary on Friday about the venture capitalist Thomas J. Perkins misstated part of the name of a company in which he invested. It was Tandem Computers, not Tandem Computer. The obituary also misstated, in some editions, the year that Hewlett-Packard, on whose board Mr. Perkins served, bought the computer company Compaq.

A starting price of $90,450 for a base hardtop coupe will save most of us from having to choose between the two. As tested, the Cabrio just clears $135,000.Going from the hard top coupe to Cabrio costs around $12,000. The updated leather interior in Bordeaux red sets you back $4,280, and the sport seats are another $2,320. Can\u2019t do without the Spyder Design wheels? That\u2019ll be $2,370, please.Manual 911s dash from standstill to 60 miles an hour in about 4 seconds, while the PDK \u2014 which stands for Porsche Doppelkupplung, not Pretty Darn Kwik \u2014 is a couple of ticks faster.Sonically, the 911\u2019s precision clockwork-on-amphetamines characteristic remains, save for a whisper of a whistle added by the turbos that should be a deal breaker only to those sensitive to ultrasonic dog whistles. That symphony of mechanical delight is deliberately guided into the cabin.Corner hard and the 911\u2019s heroic abilities feel different from those of the midengine Cayman and Boxster. The rear-engine 911 essence is a perceptively heavier tail that\u2019s easier to rotate in a controlled manner. Brakes scrub speed off like nobody\u2019s business. Front vents and an active rear spoiler improve aerodynamics on the fly. Drop the perfectly tailored fabric top (something you can do while moving at speeds up to 30 m.p.h.) and air management in the cockpit is well managed.Not much changes in the familiar cabin, which treats eyes and fingers to materials with visual and tactile heft. The world\u2019s most over-engineered cup holders spring from the dashboard, and the new entertainment system is fully modern with pinch-to-zoom features, Google Maps and Apple CarPlay. A front-axle lift option means steep driveways will no longer keep people from owning a Porsche.The \u201cfrunk\u201d is roomier than you might expect; two carry-on suitcases will fit. Anything else will need to go in the back seat. I use the term \u201cseat\u201d loosely.To those who would rather buy a Miata and pocket the extra $100,000, your frugality is commendable; the Mazda is a fun romp. Know that the 911\u2019s precision and gravitas are on a whole different level. It\u2019s why second mortgages were invented. Loyalists may approach turbocharging across the board with trepidation, but newcomers to the brand should simply feel free to enjoy the evolution of a legend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tony Fadell Steps Down Amid Tumult at Nest, a Google Acquisition", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byTime to move on. That is the explanation Tony Fadell, a former star executive at Apple known for his aggressive management style, offers for his departure from Nest, a maker of digital versions of household staples like thermostats and smoke detectors that he helped found and sold to Google.Mr. Fadell, the company said, will become an adviser to Alphabet and to its chief executive, Larry Page.In a recent interview in his Palo Alto office, Mr. Fadell, 47, talked about his career. At Apple, he led the engineering team that created the iPod digital music player and worked on the first three versions of the iPhone. In 2010 he founded Nest with Matt Rogers, a young Apple engineer.\u201cI\u2019m a guy who\u2019s at the beginning of things,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do maintenance mode. It\u2019s not what gets me out of bed.\u201dThe sharpest attack came from Greg Duffy, the founder and former chief executive of Dropcam, the home video camera and cloud-computing service that Nest acquired for $555 million in 2014, about six months after Google bought Nest. Mr. Duffy clashed with Mr. Fadell, remained at Nest for eight months and briefly moved to another post at Google before departing last September.In the interview, which Mr. Fadell agreed to on the condition that it not be published before Alphabet announced he was leaving, he had answers for most of the criticisms of his tenure. He described the staff departures as a small fraction of Nest employees and in line with the turnover in Silicon Valley, where switching jobs is common.Mr. Fadell said that Nest had \u201cstrong double-digit\u201d revenue growth from the outset. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Page, citing Nest\u2019s achievements, noted that its revenue growth was \u201cin excess of 50 percent\u201d a year since it began shipping products in 2011.Mr. Fadell characterized Nest as healthy, with 1,100 workers and strong teams in design, software and services around its three product families \u2014 its \u201clearning\u201d thermostat, smoke detector and video camera.Yet the larger issue is not Nest\u2019s past performance but what impact Mr. Fadell\u2019s departure will have on its future. Nest is the linchpin of Alphabet\u2019s bet on the emerging smart home market \u2014 devices and software to automate homes for convenience, energy savings and security.Mr. Fadell will be succeeded by Marwan Fawaz, a former executive vice president of Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker Google bought for $12.5 billion in 2011. Google unloaded Motorola three years later to Lenovo for the fire sale price of $2.9 billion, though a sizable share of Motorola\u2019s value was its thousands of patents.In the troubled Motorola acquisition, Mr. Fawaz led a financial bright spot, Motorola Home, a television set-top box business. He pared its product line, cut costs and oversaw its sale in 2013 for $2.35 billion to the Arris Group, a cable television equipment maker.In the Alphabet portfolio, Nest is a leading entry among the parent company\u2019s \u201cother bets,\u201d its effort to build businesses beyond Google\u2019s lucrative franchise in online search and advertising. Google\u2019s record with acquired hardware businesses, notably the Motorola deal, has not inspired confidence.When the Nest thermostat was introduced in 2011, it was an innovative reimagining of a product category, much as the iPod was a reinvention of the MP3 music player and the iPhone was a new take on the cellphone. It was a stylish piece of hardware, a circle of brushed stainless steel, reflective polymer and a crystal-sharp color display.Inside, the Nest thermostat houses sensors for detecting motion in the room and clever software to learn and adjust room temperatures, according to whether people are present or not, to curb electric bills.Priced at $249, the Nest thermostat was far more expensive than traditional models. Rivals scoffed but later offered their own models. Honeywell, for example, now has a $249 model that resembles the Nest oval.The pace of product introductions in the home necessarily will be more gradual, which critics often miss, Mr. Fadell said. A thermostat typically lasts 10 or 12 years.\u201cSome people expect us to be a gadget factory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want your thermostat to be like your smartphone, replacing it every two or three years.\u201dMore is done with software, especially updates, sent over the internet and wirelessly connected to Nest devices. Relying on software, of course, opens the door to software bugs. In 2014, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered a recall of more than 400,000 Nest Protect smoke and gas detectors because a defect could cause users to turn them off unintentionally. Nest halted sales for a while and fixed the problem by updating the software.The software is what allows its devices to communicate with each other. The Nest Protect, for example, can detect a carbon monoxide leak and tell the Nest thermostat to turn off the furnace.Mr. Fadell points to the 18,000 software developers working with Nest software, 12,000 retail stores that sell Nest devices and more than 100 utility companies, many of which offer consumer rebates to buy Nest thermostats, for their energy saving potential.\u201cWe\u2019re not a products company,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a products, services and software company.\u201d And, he added, building up those networks \u201ctakes a long time.\u201dIt will be up to others to do that building now. Yet Mr. Fadell expresses no regrets. Selling to Google, he insists, was the right choice to give Nest the financial ballast it needs for the long term.When Nest started, the technology giants were not in the smart home market. But now, Samsung has SmartThings software and devices, Apple has HomeKit software, and Amazon has the Echo voice command device.Nor does Mr. Fadell apologize for his management style. He described his strength as \u201cholding people to a higher standard than they thought they could achieve and pushing them beyond what they thought they could achieve.\u201dMr. Fadell said he had no immediate plans but he would spend more time looking at technology start-ups.In the last decade, he has quietly invested in and advised many fledgling companies. His current investments include Impossible Foods, which synthesizes beef without cattle; Airwave, an operating system for drones; Mousera, sensor technology to speed insights from preclinical drug trials on lab animals; and Phononic, semiconductor-based heating and cooling.\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for technology that is about to come out of the lab and has the potential to transform a business. I like to see these technologies raw.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Compete Better, States Are Trying to Curb Noncompete Pacts", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byIn today\u2019s on-your-own economy, workers are urged to be entrepreneurial job hoppers, constantly adapting and searching for the next opportunity.But an estimated 30 million Americans \u2014 nearly one fifth of the nation\u2019s work force \u2014 are hobbled by so-called noncompete agreements, fine print in their employment contracts that keeps them from working for corporate rivals in their next job.Now a number of states are looking to untangle workers from these agreements. The Massachusetts House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on a noncompete reform bill. The state is also the location of a union organizing campaign on the noncompete practices of the EMC Corporation, a large technology company based in Hopkinton, Mass., that is known for its aggressive application of these employment contracts.Other states are also taking steps as noncompete agreements have spread to summer interns and sandwich shop employees. Hawaii banned noncompete agreements for technology jobs last year, while New Mexico passed a law prohibiting noncompetes for health care workers. And Oregon and Utah have limited the duration of noncompete arrangements.The issue hits Massachusetts with particular force because of its technology heritage and failure to keep up with Silicon Valley. In the early 1980s, the Route 128 corridor outside Boston, birthplace of the minicomputer industry and long-gone tech giants like the Digital Equipment Corporation, was seen as the Silicon Valley of the East.Noncompete pacts were only one ingredient in the recipe that worked against Massachusetts and to the advantage of Silicon Valley, where employees can depart and start their own companies mostly without fear of a lawsuit. But they mattered. In California, companies are generally prohibited from enforcing noncompete agreements because of a worker-friendly statute from the 19th century.\u201cIt\u2019s hurt our economy in the past, and it\u2019s a statement of values about entrepreneurship and mobility that Massachusetts has noncompetes and California does not,\u201d said Stephen Kraus, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and president of the New England Venture Capital Association.Noncompete arrangements, proponents say, can protect valuable trade secrets and motivate employers to invest in worker training because employees are less likely to leave.But recent research underlines the effects of noncompete agreements on engineers and scientists in technology businesses, where more than one-third of the employees are covered by them. Technical workers in Massachusetts would be paid about 7 percent more if the state\u2019s noncompete practices mirrored California\u2019s, said Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the lawsuit, but about the far larger chilling effect,\u201d said Matthew Marx, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.In 2008, Brian Connolly, an engineer with years of experience writing software for medical devices, joined a start-up developing diagnostic technology to identify biohazards, First Light Biosciences. After the financial crisis hit, the start-up laid off 12 of its 14 employees, including Mr. Connolly.Shortly after meeting with a new company, Mr. Connolly got a call from his previous employer, telling him the noncompete prohibited him from joining any company in diagnostic devices, even if the application and the technology were different.\u201cI understood noncompetes were common practice, but I didn\u2019t think they would enforce it, and that broadly, after a layoff,\u201d he said.While the one-year noncompete was in force, Mr. Connolly worked for a consultant, doing software quality testing.Today, two jobs later, Mr. Connolly says he is finally getting back to his previous income level. He signed a noncompete with his current employer, and he understands they have their uses. But he says he thinks they should give workers more freedom and companies less control.\u201cThey should allow the engineer or scientist to stay current in the field,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. \u201cThat\u2019s so important in technology.\u201dKevin Johnson holds a graduate degree in engineering and a Harvard M.B.A. He is veteran of big tech companies and start-ups, and he\u2019s an ardent opponent of noncompete contracts.He spotted an opportunity to go after the noncompetes at EMC, an aggressive practitioner, because it is being acquired by another old-line computer company, Dell. The buyout, Mr. Johnson said, promises to create turmoil and cuts in the work force.The goal, Mr. Johnson said, is to create a \u201cpop-up union\u201d that would force EMC to abandon the use of most noncompete pacts.In a statement, Paul Dacier, EMC\u2019s general counsel, said, \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, EMC has not been contacted by anyone representing this group.\u201dMr. Johnson said he sent an email to an EMC executive and to a lawyer representing Denali Holding, Dell\u2019s parent company, both in mid-May, informing them of the organizing effort.In Massachusetts, noncompete reform bills were introduced as far back as 2009. But previous legislative efforts stalled in the face of strong opposition from EMC and other companies in the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group.This time, a bill has emerged from a House committee, and the Massachusetts speaker, Robert A. DeLeo, has pledged to bring reform legislation to a vote soon.Lori A. Ehrlich, a Massachusetts representative who has sought to curb noncompete agreements, said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to balance a situation where workers have so much less power than the corporations that employ them.\u201dIf a bill passes the House, approval in the State Senate is likely. Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, is taking a wait-and-see stance.This year, EMC and the trade group have said they are willing to compromise. To a point.The House bill, as it emerged from the legislative committee, would require companies to explain noncompete agreements clearly and limit them to one year. It would also prohibit noncompetes for certain categories of employees like hourly workers, summer interns and college students. And it would require companies to pay former employees 50 percent of their salary during the period of the noncompete contract. If both sides agree, they could negotiate higher or lower rates.Christopher P. Geehern, an executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said his group would support legislation but only if the compensation provision was removed.But the compensation requirement, proponents say, is what gives companies a market incentive to prune their noncompete practices. It was one of the principal recommendations in the Treasury Department report this year.The compensation requirement is the linchpin in the legislation for the EMC union organizing campaign and for venture capitalists.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial because it will stop most noncompetes from being enforced,\u201d said Rich Miner, a general partner for Google Ventures in Cambridge, Mass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.A.A. Issues Commercial Drone Rules", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government on Tuesday made it much easier for companies to use drones for a variety of tasks, including aerial photography and emergency response.The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s new commercial drone rules allow a broad range of businesses to use drones under 55 pounds, but with several restrictions: The drones must be operated by a pilot who has passed a written test and is at least 16 years old. And drones can be flown only below 400 feet, during the day and at least five miles away from airports.The new F.A.A. rules do not necessarily preclude a hodgepodge of state and local drone regulations that have popped up in recent years. The administration sent a letter to states and cities saying they recommend everyone follow their lead. But it is only a recommendation.Still, the action brings the drone delivery vision one step closer to reality. And experts predict that in time federal regulators will get comfortable with the notion.\u201cWithin months you will see the incredible impact of these rules with commercial drones becoming commonplace in a variety of uses,\u201d said Michael Drobac, a lawyer at Akin Gump who represents drone efforts at companies like Amazon and Google. \u201cThis will show the technology is reliable and then it becomes harder to argue against broader uses \u2014 like for delivery.\u201dDrone makers and tech companies have been lobbying for the rules for five years. But the Obama administration, while trying to accommodate the potential economic benefits of the technology, has struggled to safely integrate the popular, remote-controlled flying vehicles into airspace.Pilots and privacy groups that pushed hard for greater safety provisions and strong surveillance rules expressed fear that clearing the way for more of the flying machines posed new dangers and few protections from spying. The F.A.A. rules prohibit drones from flying above people and faster than 100 miles per hour.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.\u201cThe F.A.A. continues to ignore the top concern of Americans about the deployment of commercial drones in the United States \u2014 the need for strong privacy safeguards,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of Electronic Privacy Information Center.In February 2015, the F.A.A. created its first rules for recreational drone users, and more than 450,000 hobbyists registered last winter in the government\u2019s user database.Previously, companies had to apply for special permission from the F.A.A. to operate drones. The government has issued more than 6,000 approvals and about 7,000 companies are on a waiting list for approval. When the new rules go into effect in 60 days, companies will no longer have to gain that special exemption.\u201cWith this new rule, we are taking a careful and deliberate approach that balances the need to deploy this new technology with the F.A.A.\u2019s mission to protect public safety,\u201d said Michael Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator. \u201cBut this is just our first step. We\u2019re already working on additional rules that will expand the range of operations.\u201dIn a fact sheet released by the White House, the government cited economic estimates that commercial drones could generate more than $82 billion in the next decade.Drones \u201crepresent a potentially powerful innovation that could have a positive impact on our economy,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The new rules are \u201cjust the beginning of the process.\u201dAmazon has hired several lobbyists just to focus on drone rules. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, expects drone delivery to be available within the next few years and has begun testing its own devices.\u201cWe are extremely pleased the rule establishes a risk-based, federal approach for operating drones nationwide, and thank the F.A.A. for engaging industry throughout the process,\u201d said Kara Calvert, director of a coalition of drone manufacturers including the Chinese company DJI and GoPro.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Driverless Cars, Citylike Test Sites Offer the Unpredictable", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Here in this college town 40 miles west of Detroit, behind black sheeting attached to an eight-foot-tall chain-link fence, the future of the auto industry is being worked out in a secret setting.The fence surrounds a testing center called Mcity \u2014 a 32-acre patch of land that aims to recreate Anywhere, U.S.A., complete with simulated city streets and intersections. Within its borders are 13 types of traffic lights, storefronts, road signs, parking meters and a tunnel. A railroad crossing will be added soon.Mcity is one of a half-dozen or so testing grounds for autonomous vehicles in the world as automakers and technology companies engage in a heated competition to create the perfect self-driving car \u2014 and to keep their competitors from knowing how they are doing it.But while they have honed the technologies that enable cars to find their way on their own, these companies now face an even more daunting challenge: how to take that technology, with all its promise, and make those cars perform flawlessly in an unpredictable world.Both the car companies and regulators have decades of experience making vehicles safer in crashes, but the means and methods for validating the reliability and safety of self-driving cars have not even been invented.\u201cWhen you no longer have a human doing the sensing and decision-making, the car has to be flawless,\u201d said John Maddox, an assistant director at the University of Michigan Mobility Transformation Center.Mcity officials can name the companies that use the site \u2014 Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and the auto parts suppliers Bosch and Delphi, among others \u2014 but little beyond that. Demonstrations for the public or media are rare.After all, Mcity is a place for trial and error, outside of the public eye, in an industry where errors can cripple a reputation.On a recent sunny afternoon, a gap in the sheeting afforded a view of a black Lincoln MKZ sedan with sensors mounted on its roof and two engineers in the front seats. It crept cautiously toward an intersection, slowed to a stop and executed a right turn, using its turn signal, of course. The black car made its way through the artificial downtown.6 PhotosMoments later, a white Lincoln MKS rolled along a straightaway at about 25 miles per hour, swept around a wide left turn and negotiated its way through the downtown. Later, the cars stopped side by side under a green highway sign indicating a nonexistent ramp for I-96 to Lansing. There, the occupants stepped out to examine the rooftop sensors. After a long pause, the two cars repeated the same trek at a deliberate pace \u2014 much more slowly than the cars traveling on the public roads surrounding the site.The testing is being conducted with the utmost care because the number of unanticipated challenges that arise on the road is almost limitless \u2014 a fallen limb, black ice, a reckless driver, a toddler in the street.\u201cThere are real and significant questions about the safety of new technologies,\u201d Mark Rosekind, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at an April 27 meeting in California. \u201cThe old model of counting vehicle miles and counting crashes and injuries is not sufficient.\u201dThis month, the safety agency, which has limited authority to regulate the practice of test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, cautiously gave approval to several companies to begin testing on public roadways.But the industry is not waiting around.In addition to its Mcity effort, the University of Michigan is a partner in a project to set up a much more complex site about 10 miles away in neighboring Ypsilanti. It will be called the American Center for Mobility and will comprise 335 acres that were once part of G.M.\u2019s Willow Run plant. During World War II, it was the site of a famed bomber factory. Mr. Maddox has been named the center\u2019s chief.Unlike Mcity, this larger site will have long stretches where autonomous cars can be tested at highway speeds and space for creating a variety of complex intersections. Its existing roadways include overpasses and bridges.Ford is interested in potentially using the Willow Run facility, said Randy Visintainer, Ford\u2019s director of autonomous vehicle development. \u201cIt is something we would probably have to create if it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.In California, a former military base has been turned into a 2,100-acre test site called GoMentum Station, where Honda has been testing its autonomous driving technology. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment. It is also a secure location where companies can test cars in private.Outside Blacksburg, Va., Virginia Tech set up a test site that incorporates stretches of public roads and a closed track.The challenge, by all accounts, is enormous.This year, an Audi executive mused upon how difficult it would be for a driverless car to distinguish between a shopping cart and a baby carriage. Delphi has reported that the systems it is working on struggle at times to read traffic lights. The problem? The glare of a setting sun.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.\u201cThe bottom line is if you have a 4,000-pound car in the same space as a 200-pound human, you have to know the vehicle is going to react exactly the way you want every single time,\u201d Mr. Maddox said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of testing to validate that.\u201dThe Willow Run test track is supposed to have an engineering center where Mr. Maddox hopes automakers and regulators can work together to develop new test methods.So far, most of the testing of autonomous vehicles has taken place on public streets.Google says its cars have driven more than 1.5 million miles in the testing it conducts on roads near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. In recent months, it has expanded its testing program to Kirkland, Wash., Austin, Tex., and Phoenix. All other companies have accumulated far fewer test miles.Mr. Maddox suspects that is a small fraction of the testing that needs to be done. On average, he noted, a fatal accident happens once for every 100 million miles that Americans drive. \u201cWe are a long way from having enough experience,\u201d he said.A recent study by the RAND Corporation concluded that autonomous vehicles might have to be driven hundreds of millions, or even billions, of miles to reach a statistical certainty of their safety.Moreover, on-road trials fall short of what is needed. If an autonomous car doesn\u2019t react properly in a real-world situation \u2014 if, for example, a building\u2019s shadow causes the car to slow suddenly \u2014 the situation cannot be recreated and repeated to identify the issue and fine-tune the car\u2019s sensors, said Huei Peng, an engineering professor and director of the University of Michigan Mobility Transformation Center.\u201cWe have to see how these vehicles interact with their surroundings and need repeatable, reliable tests to do that,\u201d he said.And crashes do occur. Google\u2019s cars, as of last September, had 16 crashes, and all were because of human error, the company said at the time. In a report to California regulators, Google disclosed that human drivers had to take control of its test cars 341 times in a 15-month period covering 2014 and 2015, including 13 incidents when the car would have crashed had the driver not intervened.Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are working together to have a test fleet of 100 minivans driving themselves around roads in Michigan and elsewhere by the end of the year. Google is setting up an engineering center in Novi, Mich., to equip the minivans with self-driving technology.In the same time frame, Ford plans to expand its fleet to 30 self-driving prototypes from 10. G.M. and its partner, the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, hope to have a test fleet of driverless taxis running within a year.Advertisement"}

There should be a name for this kind-of sort-of online dossier. \u201cWebssier,\u201d maybe? It sounds like the beginning of that kids\u2019 song:Ta-ra-ra webssier,I know your take-home pay,I know the books you\u2019ve readAnd that your dog is dead. I see your partner MortWill see you soon in court,Your ex-wife seems quite sweet \u2014My God, she looks like me.Not that I wasn\u2019t planning on Googling the guy myself; I just wouldn\u2019t have been as thorough. I save that level of diligence for after the breakup, when I hope to see him reprinting stories he did 40 years ago for The East Village Other and posting links to melancholy Platters songs at 3 a.m. Prerelationship, I like a little mystery.I know I\u2019m in the minority with this one. Googling before a date is now so ingrained in the culture, it\u2019s practically hygienic, like using mouthwash. Not Googling, on the other hand, is like getting into a car with a guy you just met at a party: If they find you floating in the Hudson a few days later, it\u2019s on you.Sure, when you Google you may learn that a date has been arrested for drunken driving or is not entirely divorced. But it also removes the delight of surprise. This is especially troublesome on first dates, where it is essential to look cool. I have made a study of this, and I have discovered that people have exactly three cool things each.One of my cool things is that I once lived in Paris, working on a book about a French spy who had a child with a Chinese opera singer who turned out to be a man. This is harder than you might think to slip into conversation, but believe me, I manage.The coat that woman is wearing reminds me of the time I lived in Paris, in a little apartment in the Sixth. You\u2019d never see a coat like that in Paris \u2026If I try that these days, my date already knows that I lived in Paris because he read about it online. I haven\u2019t even finished my drink and I\u2019m down to two cool things, one of which is my car, so I\u2019m not sure it counts. And I know my date\u2019s cool things, like that Gilda Radner used to go to his loft for leftovers and that he introduced Bob Dylan and Norman Mailer. We\u2019ve known each other an hour and we\u2019re already sick of each other\u2019s stories, which isn\u2019t supposed to happen until after we\u2019re married.It\u2019s a spoiler, the dating equivalent of somebody telling you that Harry Lime is alive at the beginning of \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d On the other hand, since everybody does it, if a date hasn\u2019t done a cursory search on you it\u2019s also a bit insulting. He\u2019s already standing there at the bar with his cellphone, looking at baseball scores; how hard would it be to say, \u201cSiri, check \u2018Wadler,\u2019 \u2018arrests,\u2019 \u2018New York City\u2019\u201d?You know how romance used to be in Greenwich Village, back in the \u201970s? We\u2019d pick each other up in the street. The neighborhoods were more peaceful then because you didn\u2019t have the cellphone screamers. If you wanted to hear someone fight with a partner, you had to go back to your apartment and wait till you had fallen asleep.Bars and restaurants were also good places to meet someone because the acoustics were such that we could hear one another. We didn\u2019t have OkCupid to tell us beforehand if someone A) believed in astrology, B) did not believe in astrology but thought it was still kind of fun, or C) covered every electrical device in his home with aluminum foil; we operated on conversation and chemistry. I once met an architect at an all-night burger joint called David\u2019s Pot Belly whom I saw for several months and it was lovely.I also once got picked up in the West Village by a city councilman. He was smoother than the scruffy reporters and photographers I usually went for, but charming. We exchanged numbers and I met him for brunch at the Riviera, a sidewalk cafe on Sheridan Square. I have no memory of what we talked about, but not long after we sat down, an attractive, dark-haired woman leaned over the railing and said something to the guy along the lines of \u201cI\u2019d just like you to know that you put me in the hospital with a ruptured gallbladder.\u201d And to me, \u201cYou should know that you\u2019re sitting with a guy who likes to hit women.\u201dThen she walked away.I was out of that cafe like a shot and raced after her on the street. When I caught up with her she was embarrassed and started apologizing, saying she should have never interfered.Then again, had she not come along, there might have been the very real humanness of an assault.There may be something to be said for Googling.I Was Misinformed is a humor column about survival in New York City.

{"Headline": "Some Early Signs of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Upheaval", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own \u201cremain\u201d vote \u2014 with his feet. Mr. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial start-up with him.The looming question on Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain\u2019s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.The long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \u201cremain\u201d camp\u2019s warnings of economic tumult could come true.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo on Friday that in months to come \u201cwe may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\u201d Mr. Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London\u2019s real estate boom.J\u00fcrgen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.\u201cAll companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\u201d said Mr. Maier, Siemens\u2019s chief executive for Britain.For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain\u2019s coattails out of the union.It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain cheaper to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the \u201cleave\u201d forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe.But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive decision-making could be paralyzed and investment could come to a standstill.Britain\u2019s financial services industry, which employs 1.2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage.Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe.James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees \u2014 many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume \u2014 they said they might \u201cconsider adjustments to our operating model.\u201dEven Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,\u201d said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. \u201cAt this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there\u2019s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides.\u201dPerhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15,000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers.Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. \u201cThis is a lose-lose result for both Britain and Europe,\u201d said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. \u201cWe will review our U.K. investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201dOther sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. \u201cUncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,\u201d BP said in a statement Friday.United States technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1,000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe\u2019s common marketplace.The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany\u2019s third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the mid-1980s into a world-class factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475,000 vehicles, about a third of Britain\u2019s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union.Yet despite the European Union\u2019s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said on Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond.Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative.Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14,000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Mr. Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions.For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like self-driving cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out.\u201cThe question is more about future investment, future research and development,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThat\u2019s hanging in the balance.\u201dHe embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Mr. Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives.\u201cIt\u2019s usually a really buzzing office,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThis morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren\u2019t calling. That\u2019s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in.\u201dContributing reporting were Chad Bray and Stanley Reed from London, Nathaniel Popper and Michael Corkery from New York, Mark Scott from Rome and David Jolly from ParisAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Microsoft, LinkedIn Deal Could Be a $26.2 Billion Time Machine", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byAnd if other beleaguered tech companies think that suitors will pay such handsome sums, more transactions may be coming down the pike.How generous is Microsoft\u2019s takeover bid? It puts LinkedIn\u2019s enterprise value at 79 times the social network\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the 12 months that ended on March 31.On the basis of that multiple, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIn\u2019s monthly active users. By comparison, when Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion two years ago, it spent $40 for every user.For LinkedIn, the attractions of the deal are obvious: Its shares fell nearly 42 percent from the beginning of the year through last week, as investors expressed disappointment over a weak earnings forecast for 2016. Finding a buyer with deep pockets dulls the pain of being a publicly traded company.The question is whether other suitors will emerge with rich offers in hand.One perennial subject of deal rumors is another social network: Twitter.Shares of Twitter jumped nearly 7 percent in trading on Monday, borne aloft by investors\u2019 hopes that the struggling tech company might finally receive a takeover offer. Twitter shares have fallen 64 percent since the company went public in 2013, as the social network has struggled to show growth in the face of tough competition from the likes of Facebook and Snapchat.Potential buyers for Twitter include Google and Facebook, analysts say, though they caution that Twitter\u2019s valuation may need to fall more before a suitor steps up.At the price-to-sales multiple that Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn, roughly 7.2 times the social network\u2019s revenue for the last 12 months, Twitter would fetch roughly $18.7 billion \u2014 or nearly double its current market value of $10 billion.Microsoft\u2019s bet on LinkedIn \u2014 which less than five months ago was trading above the acquisition price of $196 a share \u2014 suggests that tech has more room to run, even as some bears are projecting that another bubble is bound to pop.\u201cMicrosoft just paid on the assumption that we\u2019re going back to the multiples we had a year ago, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.Advertisement"}

The tradition goes back centuries. Galileo and Darwin fought mightily to use observation, logic, and mathematics to create a reality-based view of the universe and humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been easy. For Galileo, who used observations of the planets and stars to show that the Earth was not the center of the universe, the result was house arrest for the final years of his life as religious leaders fought the erosion of world views based on faith. Darwin meticulously and patiently spent more than twenty years assembling his argument and evidence for evolution before the publication of The Origin of Species, yet a large portion of society still rejects that firmly established theory.By fostering the capacity for critical thinking rather than simply providing examples, \u00c2\u00a0invaluable given that science and technology will\u00c2\u00a0always be providing new material for myth makers to latch on to. The existing debate over nuclear power and genetically modified foods will soon give way to battles over synthetic biology and nanotechnology.With \u201cHow to Fake a Moon Landing,\u201d Cunningham reveals the roots of misinformation and intentional disinformation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of both out there. But, more important, he provides a road map for how anyone can do this. One of the great challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094and opportunities\u00e2\u0080\u0094in twenty-first-century life lies in finding ways to navigate the sea of assertions and facts we face on the Internet and come away with some sense of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really known and unknown, or simply feared or imagined, in a complicated, dynamic world. When I was coming of age in the mid-twentieth century, there was usually some authority doing the work for you, whether a silver-haired anchorman on the nightly news or the printed front page of a newspaper. Now, no matter what your predispositions, you can probe the web\u00c2\u00a0 and, seconds later, come away with information or ideas that bolster them.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Cunningham would be happy to have readers finish his book and raise their own questions about his conclusions. That would mean they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve absorbed his prime message. As he explains in the foreword, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis book is pro-science and pro-critical thinking. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a book promoting a scientific \u00c3\u00a9lite whom we must all follow, sheep-like.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the end, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoping that after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read this book, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dead set on becoming your own best myth buster\u00c2\u00a0.

Cerf, another founder of the internet and chief internet evangelist at Google, in a phone interview ahead of a speech to the group scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cPeople think making things digital means they\u2019ll last forever, but that isn\u2019t true now.\u201dThe project is in its early days, but the discussions \u2014 and caliber of the people involved \u2014 underscored how the World Wide Web\u2019s direction in recent years has stirred a deep anxiety among some technologists. The revelations by Edward J. Snowden that the web has been used by governments for spying and the realization that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have become gatekeepers to our digital lives have added to concerns.Efforts at creating greater amounts of privacy and accountability, by adding more encryption to various parts of the web and archiving all versions of a web page, also came up. Such efforts would make it harder to censor content.\u201cEdward Snowden showed we\u2019ve inadvertently built the world\u2019s largest surveillance network with the web,\u201d said Mr. Kahle, whose group organized the conference. \u201cChina can make it impossible for people there to read things, and just a few big service providers are the de facto organizers of your experience. We have the ability to change all that.\u201dMany people conflate the internet\u2019s online services and the web as one and the same \u2014 yet they are technically quite different. The internet is a networking infrastructure, where any two machines can communicate over a variety of paths, and one local network of computers can connect with other networks.The web, on the other hand, is a popular means to access that network of networks. But because of the way web pages are created, managed and named, the web is not fully decentralized. Take down a certain server and a certain web page becomes unavailable. Links to pages can corrode over time. Censorship systems like China\u2019s Great Firewall eliminate access to much information for most of its people. By looking at internet addresses, it is possible for governments and companies to get a good idea of who is reading which web pages.In some ways, the efforts to change the technology of creating the web are a kind of coming-of-age story. Mr. Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, as a tool for scientists. Today, the web still runs on technologies of the older world.Consider payments. In many cases, people pay for things online by entering credit card information, not much different from handing a card to a merchant for an imprint.At the session on Tuesday, computer scientists talked about how new payment technologies could increase individual control over money. For example, if people adapted the so-called ledger system by which digital currencies are used, a musician might potentially be able to sell records without intermediaries like Apple\u2019s iTunes. News sites might be able to have a system of micropayments for reading a single article, instead of counting on web ads for money.\u201cAd revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cPeople assume today\u2019s consumer has to make a deal with a marketing machine to get stuff for \u2018free,\u2019 even if they\u2019re horrified by what happens with their data. Imagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.\u201dTo make that work now, Mr. Kahle has to search and capture a page, then give it a brand new web address. With the right kind of distributed system, he said, \u201cthe archive can have all of the versions, because there would be a permanent record located across many sites.\u201dThe movement to change how the web is built, like a surprising number of technology discussions, has an almost religious dimension.Still, not all the major players agree on whether the web needs decentralizing.\u201cThe web is already decentralized,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cThe problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We don\u2019t have a technology problem, we have a social problem.\u201dOne that can, perhaps, be solved by more technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Backs Rules Treating Internet as Utility, Not Luxury", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byThe decision affirmed the government\u2019s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision.The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers.The court\u2019s decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online.\u201cAfter a decade of debate and legal battles, today\u2019s ruling affirms the commission\u2019s ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections \u2014 both on fixed and mobile networks \u2014 that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future,\u201d Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement.The two judges who ruled in favor of the F.C.C. emphasized the importance of the internet as an essential communications and information platform for consumers.\u201cOver the past two decades, this content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie,\u201d wrote David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan, the judges who wrote the opinion.But the legal battle over the regulations is most likely far from over. The cable and telecom industries have signaled their intent to challenge any unfavorable decision, possibly taking the case to the Supreme Court.AT&T immediately said it would continue to fight.\u201cWe have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court and we look forward to participating in that appeal,\u201d said David McAtee II, the senior executive vice president and general counsel for AT&T.For now, the decision limits the ability of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon to shape the experience of internet users. Without net neutrality rules, the broadband providers could be inclined to deliver certain content on the web at slower speeds, for example, making the streams on Netflix or YouTube buffer or shut down. Such business decisions by broadband providers would have created fast and slow lanes on the internet, subjecting businesses and consumers to extra charges and limited access to content online, the F.C.C. has argued.\u201cThis is an enormous win for consumers,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. \u201cIt ensures the right to an open internet with no gatekeepers.\u201dGoogle and Netflix support net neutrality rules and have warned government officials that without regulatory limits, broadband providers will have an incentive to create business models that could harm consumers. They argue that broadband providers could degrade the quality of downloads and streams of online services to extract tolls from web companies or to promote unfairly their own competing services or the content of partners.The court\u2019s ruling was a certainty for the F.C.C. Two of the three judges who heard the case late last year agreed that wireless broadband services were also common carrier utility services that were subject to anti-blocking and discrimination rules, a decision protested by wireless carriers including AT&T and Verizon Wireless.In the opinion, the two judges in favor of the rules said internet users don\u2019t feel the difference between fixed-wire broadband and mobile service. To an iPad user, whose device switches automatically between Wi-Fi and wireless networks, the government\u2019s oversight of those technologies should not differ, they said.Tech firms cheered the decision, which they said would be particularly helpful to start-ups that did not have the resources to fight gatekeepers of the web.\u201cToday marks a huge victory for the millions of microbusinesses who depend on the open internet to reach consumers and compete in the global marketplace,\u201d said Althea Erickson, the senior director of global policy at the online crafts marketplace Etsy.In a statement, the cable industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group highlighted the comments of the dissenting judge, Stephen Williams, and said that its members were reviewing the opinion. The group also said broadband legislation by Congress was a better alternative to the F.C.C.\u2019s classification of internet business as a utility.\u201cWhile this is unlikely the last step in this decade-long debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers,\u201d the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said in a statement.In his lengthy dissenting opinion, Mr. Williams called the rules an \u201cunreasoned patchwork\u201d that will discourage competition in the broadband industry.The biggest threat to broadband providers is the potential of any regulations to hurt the rates they charge for the service, analysts said. The F.C.C. has promised it will not impose rate regulations on the firms like it does for phone companies.\u201cThe pendulum has today swung a bit further in the direction of long-term price regulation,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.The F.C.C. was divided along party lines on the rules. It began its quest for net neutrality rules in 2009, with two previous attempts at creating rules overturned by the same court.In a statement, Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner who was among a minority who opposed the regulation of broadband as a utility, urged cable and telecom firms to keep going with their legal challenge.\u201cI continue to believe that these regulations are unlawful, and I hope that the parties challenging them will continue the legal fight,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement by a cable industry lobbying group.

Now, as the siege intensified, the Juma brothers were sitting out the battle at this farmhouse on the southern edge of Surt, their apprehension tempered by a wave of sheer relief.\u201cLife was hell,\u201d said Hammad, a lanky 16-year-old with a shock of unkempt hair, describing the Islamic State\u2019s brutal 18-month rule. Cafes were closed, schools renamed and girls flogged for not covering their faces, he said. He watched in horror as a hooded figure chopped off the hand of a thief \u2014 a desperate man who had stolen medicine. Nightmares came after the Islamists crucified people accused of crimes at a major traffic junction, then left their bodies to rot.\u201cI would wake in a panic, thinking I was suffocating,\u201d he said. His brother Mohammed, 19, nodded in agreement. The Islamists had executed his friend Abdullah by pushing him from a tall building, accusing him of blasphemy. Abdullah was 15 years old, Mohammed said.The assault on Surt, now in its third week, has put the Islamic State in Libya under crushing pressure, threatening to rob the group of its largest base outside Iraq and Syria. The attack force, led by militias from the nearby city of Misurata and organized under the auspices of the United Nations-backed unity government, has corralled the Islamists into the city center, where they are pummeled with bombs and gunfire and cut off from their main escape route by sea.The siege coincides with the Islamic State\u2019s recent eviction from the Iraqi city of Falluja, and combined they are a heavy blow to the group\u2019s territorial ambitions \u2014 even as it retaliates with devastating attacks against civilians. Turkish officials say they suspect the Islamic State of being responsible for the suicide bombings at the Istanbul airport on Tuesday that killed at least 41 people.The Surt offensive moved with breathtaking speed at first, shrinking the territory controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from 150 miles of coastline to barely four miles. But since the battle reached the densely defended streets of Surt, progress has been measured in yards, and the price in blood has risen sharply.11 PhotosI arrived last week, with a photographer and a Libyan journalist who has worked for The New York Times since 2011. The first hurdle was bureaucratic: negotiating the maze of official permissions required to work in a country with three rival governments, and split by byzantine rivalries.After acquiring the paperwork, and a commander willing to take us into the battle zone, we set off at night, speeding down a highway strewn with the charred remains of vehicles destroyed in suicide bombings.Surt crackled with tension. We had arrived after the bloodiest day of fighting yet, in which 36 Libyan fighters had died and over 150 were injured in the latest push toward Islamic State lines. In all, over 800 men had been wounded since the fighting started, medics at the nearby field hospital said.On the beach road, where artillery cases littered the empty street, fighters crouched under a berm of sand. Occasionally they leapt to their feet, spraying bullets toward Islamic State fighters in buildings more than 200 yards down the street.The reply came in the form of a sharp crack, then the soft zip of a sniper\u2019s bullet whistling overhead.Their commander was Mohammed Ahmed, a preternaturally calm man who, in T-shirt and flip-flops, seemed dressed more for the beach than a front line. He called orders into a walkie-talkie then pointed behind us, to a cluster of holiday villas where Libya\u2019s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, once housed visiting foreign dignitaries. Now it was raked with bullet holes and smeared with graffiti.Capturing the villas, and a few hundred yards of road, cost the lives of four men, he said.Circling drones overhead signaled the presence of small teams of American and British Special Operations forces that, according to Libyan officials, are using surveillance technology to provide targeting information to Libyan artillery spotters and their handful of aging warplanes.\u201cThey tell the ground forces where to push and where to hold, and they coordinate the airstrikes,\u201d said Mohamed Benrasali, a senior politician from Misurata.That, so far, has been the extent of direct Western help on the battlefield, even as Libyan commanders appeal for more muscular assistance \u2014 ammunition, airstrikes and medical supplies.\u201cHere we are, fighting the West\u2019s war against terrorism,\u201d said Ibrahim Mustafa, 29, a commander, in a widely held view. \u201cBut although the West promises help, it never comes.\u201dThe American officials and their allies counter that they must proceed cautiously, worried that such help could upset the precarious balance between Libya\u2019s many factions and potentially inflaming a knotty civil conflict involving an array of outside countries.Below the drones. the ground fight is a decidedly analogue affair. Many of the Libyan militiamen are part-time fighters armed with decades-old weapons. Their commanders scoff at Pentagon estimates of 6,500 Islamic State fighters in Libya \u2014 or a figure of 8,000, given by John Brennan, the director of the C.I.A., in testimony to Congress on June 20. The Libyans estimate that no more than 600 fighters are left in the city. But few doubt that the Islamic State fighters cornered in central Surt \u2014 mostly from Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan, according to anecdotal accounts, as well as a smaller number of Libyans \u2014 make a determined enemy.At the beach front, a handful of fighters walked toward the sea, only to halt in their tracks: A barely visible line was pulled tautly across the sand, a mark of land mines laid in the night. The fighters retraced their steps, slowly, to the road.Despite the fighting, the Islamic State radio station still broadcasts across Surt, offering a mixture of stuffy religious sermons and red-blooded threats against the group\u2019s enemies. But predictions that Surt could become Raqqa on the Mediterranean, in a reference to the Islamic State headquarters in Syria, now look highly unlikely.As the Libyan fighters push deeper into Surt, the infrastructure of fear that helped the Islamic State exert a viselike grip is being dismantled. At the Zafran roundabout, the scaffolding where men in orange jumpsuits were once executed has been pulled down, and the Islamic State flag has been replaced by the Libyan national standard.Retreating fighters have mustered at the Ouagadougou Center, a cavernous, marble-walled conference hall turned religious pulpit and weapons store. Their families cluster in an area called Dollar, with no water or electricity, former residents say.For decades Surt was a byword for tribal cronyism in Libya. Colonel Qaddafi, who was born in a tent 10 miles south of the town, devised a series of vainglorious schemes intended to catapult the obscure city to global prominence. At one point he promoted it as the headquarters of a notional \u201cUnited States of Africa.\u201dToday those ideas have gone from ridiculous to tragic as the follies of the era \u2014 the luxury hotels and villas, the conference hall and the Great Man-Made River, a multibillion-dollar water project that Colonel Qaddafi hailed as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d \u2014 form a crumbling backdrop to Libya\u2019s latest violent drama.Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s more enduring legacy is the paranoid factionalism that has pitted Libya\u2019s politicians, fighters and towns, so viciously against one another since 2011, and that could yet endanger battlefield gains against the Islamic State.A few miles behind the front lines, the commander leading the assault on Surt sat in a cramped room, before a radio transmitter and a large screen with a Google Earth map detailing the battlefield. It was the holy month of Ramadan, so most of his fighters were not eating during daylight hours. In the darkness of evening, after the fast had been broken, the commander lounged in the courtyard of his small compound, sucking on a water pipe, as he welcomed subordinates who huddled over maps, sipped sweet coffee and plotted the next day\u2019s actions.The commander agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity, citing fears that his family could be targeted in Islamic State attacks. He was at once welcoming and guarded \u2014 loudly echoing popular complaints about lack of Western support, but also making it clear that he considered Western intentions in Libya to be cynical.\u201cWe\u2019re sending our youth to die against terrorists, and Europe is playing football matches,\u201d he said, referring to the soccer championship underway.Surprisingly, he did not see the Islamic State as the greatest danger to Libya. Instead he expounded at length about the perfidy of Khalifa Hifter \u2014 the dominant military commander in eastern Libya, and a man widely viewed by many Misuratans as an enemy. The commander suggested that Mr. Hifter, in concert with a relative of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s based in Cairo, was secretly supporting the Islamic State \u2014 a theory given little credence by Western officials, but one that points to the deep suspicions that undergird every aspect of the Libyan society.Mr. Hifter, for his part, also holds himself out as a warrior against Islamist extremists in the eastern cities of Benghazi and Derna. Last week he traveled to Moscow, requesting that the Kremlin provide him with weapons, Russian news media reported.Such jostling has plagued efforts to bring Libya to peace since 2011, and helped the Islamic State move into Surt in 2014. Local clashes in recent weeks between rival groups near Tripoli and in Ajdabia, east of Surt, provide ominous signals of rising political as well as military tensions.Although the unity government enjoys strong backing from the United Nations, the United States and many European countries, it has weak political authority and, on the ground in Surt, little respect. Instead, most fighters claimed to be fighting in the name of their town, their brigade, or their blood.On the eastern front line, near the city port, Mohammed Haima peered down a pair of old military binoculars, one lens broken, toward the Islamic State lines a few hundred yards away.The extremists had captured his brother, a fighter named Faisal, last summer, he said. He later learned, from a former prisoner, that Faisal had been tortured and had his fingernails pulled out.Two months ago Islamists phoned Mr. Haima, offering to trade his brother for another prisoner. No deal was made. So now, Mr. Haima said, he was fighting to find his brother, or to avenge his death.\u201cThose terrorists are a cancer that needs to be wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made my brother call me to prove he was alive. I\u2019m going to find him for his sake \u2014 and for that of our mother.\u201dSuliman Ali Zway contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Altogether it\u2019s haunting, heady stuff.However, roughly half of the collection is set during the Rising itself, and these weaken the whole. Instead of nuanced examinations of the politics of fear, stories like \u201cThe Day the Dead Came to Show and Tell\u201d and \u201cSan Diego 2014: The Last Stand of the California Browncoats\u201d are what Newsflesh wasn\u2019t: just zombie stories.

{"Headline": "China Wins New Bragging Rights in Supercomputers", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers provides more evidence that the once-yawning technology gap between the United States and China is closing.Also for the first time, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer uses Chinese-made microprocessor chips instead of chips from Silicon Valley\u2019s Intel.Supercomputers are viewed in scientific circles as an indicator of national technology leadership, and they are vital for research in areas ranging from the development of new weapons and medicines, to the design of cars and consumer products. American computing experts and business executives have warned for years that leadership in supercomputing is vital to a range of national interests.\u201cToday even consumer detergent bottles are designed with supercomputers,\u201d said Eric D. Isaacs, a physicist and provost of the University of Chicago. \u201cThe Chinese are getting good at building these computers, and it\u2019s a competitive issue now for U.S. industry and national security.\u201dThe United States primacy on the Top500 list has slipped for a number of reasons. Government support for supercomputing has been slowed by long-running debates on the level of federal spending on basic scientific research, as well as opposition to funding for industrial innovation that is not directly related to national security.In the private sector, companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon invested billions of dollars in cloud-computing centers that don\u2019t focus as much on solving scientific problems.And last year, the United States blocked the sale of a number of advanced microprocessors to China over concerns they were being used in nuclear weapon development, which most likely accelerated the development of China\u2019s own technology, said Jack Dongarra, a University of Tennessee computer scientist who helped create the list of the world\u2019s fastest computers in 1993.The Top500 list is maintained by Dr. Dongarra and Erich Strohmaier, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Individual computing centers report descriptions and performance to them twice a year.In 2001, there were no Chinese supercomputers on the Top500. Now, China has 167 systems on the list compared to 165 from the United States. China also leads a more obscure category \u2014 total processing power, or the combined computing speeds of all of its supercomputers on the list.The fastest machine, the Sunway TaihuLight System, was installed this year at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, in China\u2019s Jiangsu province.Despite those achievements, Intel still provided the chips for 91 percent of the machines on the list. And China is still catching up with the United States in state-of-the-art technologies, like software and the networking that links the thousands of chips in a modern supercomputer.But that could soon change. Officials at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the Chinese government has an ambitious $150 billion program to acquire as well as develop new technologies in various kinds of chips.After years of neglect, the United States does appear to be taking the competitive threat seriously, said John Neuffer, president of the S.I.A. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to double down on supercomputing and get ourselves back on track,\u201d he said.While the Chinese have perfected the manufacture of traditional supercomputers pioneered by American companies like IBM and Cray, the United States may focus on new, more efficient supercomputers that might lead to machines intended for challenges like artificial intelligence, according to Larry Smarr, a physicist who directs the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.One of the design challenges of the fastest computers is their vast power consumption. The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer in China, which could fill a large warehouse, requires the same electric power needed to run roughly 15,000 homes. An exascale supercomputer will very likely require more than twice that amount of power, or roughly the amount of power produced by the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, the largest producer of solar power in the United States.At the same time, even if the United States is able to design an exascale computer within the next decade, the Chinese could get there first. According to Dr. Dongarra, the Chinese government is committed to reaching the exascale goal by the end of this decade.Because of funding shortages and technology challenges, \u201cthere has been a delay in getting the exascale launched in the U.S., and as a result, we\u2019re further behind than we should be,\u201d he said.The Sunway supercomputer in Wuxi is a marvel of Chinese manufacturing prowess, Dr. Dongorra noted. The computer is based on 10.6 million processor \u201ccores\u201d spread across 40,960 microprocessors that work together. The chips are relatively slow individually \u2014 about the speed of the processor in Apple\u2019s iPhone 6.The Sunway machine does have its shortcomings. It has older memory-chip technology, meaning it is limited in the speed with which it can move data in and out of each processor when compared with the most powerful American supercomputers. And the new Chinese supercomputer is still based on American-made optical network technology that is used to connect the thousands of microprocessor chips.Despite the fact that the Chinese now have the most supercomputers on the list, the United States still dominates the top 20, with 10 machines. There are now 105 supercomputers in Europe. Japan has 29 systems on the list, down from 37 systems in November.Several American scientists compared what is going on now to the 1980s, when they worried that the nation was losing ground to Japanese supercomputers.\u201cScientists might be saying, \u2018I have to go to China to run my computations,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Smarr.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: That Business of Microsoft Buying LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byBitsAnd, really, in most cases, a good rule of thumb for internet users is: If it\u2019s bad for AT&T and Verizon, it\u2019s probably good for you.Here\u2019s my best guess: Microsoft is buying a social graph. That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.To my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)So what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.Is all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.There are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.For instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)Granted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.Oh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn? Thanks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A London Subway Experiment: Please Don\u2019t Walk Up the Escalator", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byLondon JournalLONDON \u2014 Perhaps it is all the tourists \u2014 18.6 million international visitors to London last year, a record. Perhaps it is the gradual \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of Britain. And perhaps it is just something to do with the blocked traffic on these ancient streets and all the diesel fumes in the air.Cars still drive on the left, and signs still instruct you to walk on the left. But these days, on the sidewalks, staircases and escalators, chaos reigns. Walking anywhere in London or navigating the subway during rush hour means having to make a mad, dodging, aggressive dance against an oncoming tide of people, many of whom seem oblivious to Britain\u2019s long tradition of walking on the left. And that is not counting those engrossed in their smartphones or blocking the exits while consulting Google Maps.The answer to traffic, of course, should be the subway, or the Underground. But the system is chronically overcrowded, and annual ridership, already at 1.34 billion, has been increasing nearly 4 percent a year.It has been rising so much that at Holborn Station, one of London\u2019s busiest and deepest, with more than 56 million passengers a year and escalators 23.4 meters, or 77 feet, tall, there is an experiment to encourage people at rush hour to stand side by side on the escalators going up and merely ride them.The science is simple: Fill the available space on the escalators with people, rather than leaving the left side of each step largely empty, except for the few who choose to march up the metal mountain.The London Underground has concluded that in stations with escalators more than 18.5 meters, or about 61 feet, tall, much of the left side of the escalators goes unused, causing blockages and lines (\u201cqueues\u201d) at the bottom.A three-week trial at Holborn last year found that standing on both sides of the escalator reduced congestion about 30 percent. During rush hour, about 16,220 people could travel on the escalators, compared with 12,745 in normal conditions.So a six-month trial began at Holborn in April. \u201cIt seems to be working better,\u201d said Kieron Racher, a member of the Special Requirements Team for the London Underground. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly changing people\u2019s minds.\u201dMark Evers, the customer strategy director for the London Underground, said results had been mixed, \u201cas we expected at this stage.\u201d With customer use increasing so fast, and given the depth of Holborn, it made sense to try the experiment during the morning and evening rush hours, he said, when the station is particularly hellish.Holborn Station, opened in 1906, serves a busy commercial and academic part of London, near the British Museum, the London School of Economics and Bloomsbury Square, and two major lines, the Piccadilly and the Central, pass through it.During many evening rush hours, staff members limit the number of people who can enter the station, or they shut it entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time because the escalators and platforms are packed.Peter McNaught, the operations director for the London Underground, expressed optimism about the escalator experiment. \u201cWe hope this can lead to improving congestion at Holborn, making journeys easier for all our customers,\u201d he said.Of course, not everyone is happy. Some, like Andrew Hossack, are in a hurry to get to work. \u201cA lot of people walk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSome, like Beth Forrester, like climbing for the exercise. \u201cI always walk,\u201d she said. \u201cI always get my steps in!\u201dAndrew Brenner said he had stood that day, \u201cbut normally I walk, because it seems so stupid just to stand there.\u201dMartin Dearden said he normally stood. \u201cThere are so many people,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose in the end it does get more people out faster.\u201dThe behavioral science department at the London School of Economics has developed different messages to encourage travelers to stand.Screens at the bottom of the escalators show a looped video of a neatly uniformed woman from the staff advising people to stand on both sides. There are signs on the floors; painted footsteps on both sides of the escalator stairs; electronic versions of triangular \u201cstand on the right\u201d signs; and, of course, station announcements that are difficult to hear through an inadequate loudspeaker system.But the Underground has also, cleverly, left a third escalator \u2014 on the far left, of course \u2014 for anyone to ride or climb as he or she pleases, so in some sense it is stepping heaven, without any official hectoring.If Holborn is a nightmare, Victoria Station is arguably worse, because it is undergoing a long reconstruction project to deal better with increased traffic and work more efficiently with the hugely busy railway and bus station there.Given the building work, together with major construction projects nearby in an area that is being quickly built up, the walkways near the station are temporary and narrow, with uneven surfaces and lined with painted plywood.They are made narrower still by pillars, homeless people and puzzled tourists, since these pathways do not typically show up on smartphones and can be disorienting.So at normal times they are difficult, and during rush hour they are a terrible obstacle course. Made much worse, of course, by the breakdown of the traditional British habit of walking on the left.Instead, bodies fill all available space, especially as people wait at crosswalks or peer around to see if they can walk against the light, and then come at you like a Roman phalanx with shoulder and shopping bags instead of shields.And of course, in this land of Magna Carta, some think it is their right as freeborn English men and women to do whatever they please, without Brussels or the London Underground telling them what to do.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank President Nikesh Arora Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 A former Google executive and Silicon Valley star was on course to be the next chief executive of SoftBank of Japan, one of the world\u2019s most prominent technology conglomerates. Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank\u2019s global ambitions.When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google\u2019s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent.Mr. Arora was vaunted for his deal-making prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son\u2019s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise.The honeymoon did not last.Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank\u2019s overseas deals. Investments in start-ups like DramaFever and Housing.com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered.And the carefully orchestrated succession plan \u2014 or what appeared to be \u2014 has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon.Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to \u201cwork on a few more crazy ideas\u201d at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer.\u201cThis will require me to be C.E.O. for at least another five to 10 years \u2014 this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,\u201d Mr. Son said.Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. \u201cMasa and I are still in love with each other,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cI will support everyone I invested in, and they know that.\u201dMr. Arora\u2019s legacy \u2014 good or bad \u2014 will ultimately be determined by his investment record.After joining SoftBank, Mr. Arora was put in charge of picking takeover targets around the world. His mandate was to diversify a company that, despite the Sprint acquisition and others, still makes about 70 percent of its operating profits in its home market. It owns a major mobile phone network and a controlling interest in Yahoo Japan, among other domestic assets.Expectations for Mr. Arora had been high. Besides his Google pedigree, he had been unusually well paid.In his first six months at SoftBank, Mr. Arora earned 16.6 billion yen, or $159 million at current exchange rates, including a signing bonus, according to company disclosures. That made him one of the best compensated executives in the world during that period, and one of the highest paid executives in Japan, a country known for relatively low pay at the upper echelon.He earned about 8 billion yen last year. Mr. Arora made a huge personal financial commitment to SoftBank in 2015, buying 60 billion yen of the company\u2019s shares.But some of his bets haven\u2019t panned out. DramaFever, a Korean video site, shed traffic months after SoftBank invested in the business, prompting the Japanese company to find buyers for some of its stake.This year, SoftBank has defended Mr. Arora against criticism from a group of mostly anonymous international shareholders, who laid out their case against Mr. Arora in a letter to the company\u2019s board in April. They said a number of start-ups he backed have fizzled. They also questioned his decision to remain an adviser to an American investment firm, Silver Lake, that could potentially compete with SoftBank for deals.\u201cMr. Arora\u2019s investment strategy as the C.E.O. of SIMI appears to be nothing more than throwing a dart at a dart board,\u201d a lawyer representing the investors wrote in the letter, referring to SoftBank\u2019s internet and media operations as SIMI. \u201cHow many more millions of dollars of shareholder value must be wasted before the board realizes something must be done?\u201dA representative for Silver Lake declined to comment. Advisers like Mr. Arora generally receive limited insight into the private equity firm\u2019s deliberations and spend only a few hours a month with Silver Lake.SoftBank said on Monday that an internal panel set up to investigate the investors\u2019 claims had found no evidence of conflict of interest or other misconduct. Still, the episode may have shaken Mr. Son\u2019s trust in Mr. Arora, soured Mr. Arora on SoftBank, or both.\u201cClean chit from board after through review. Time for me to move on,\u201d Mr. Arora said in another tweet on Tuesday.And it was always an open question whether Mr. Son would readily give up control.Mr. Arora was one of only a small number of non-Japanese to have attained a top management position at a major Japanese company. He faced fewer bureaucratic and cultural obstacles than most, in part because SoftBank\u2019s power structure is simple. SoftBanks starts and ends with Mr. Son, who founded the company in the 1980s and runs it with unquestioned authority.\u201cI feel my work is not done,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement on Tuesday.An article on Wednesday about the abrupt departure of Nikesh Arora, who was in line to be chief executive of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, referred incorrectly in some editions to the Chinese company Alibaba\u2019s main line of business. It is e-commerce, not search.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.Advertisement"}

In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units \u2014 emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs \u2014 tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them.If emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media \u2014 film, TV or amateur video \u2014 and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs \u2014 those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation \u2014 feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising.Buying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet.The commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces.With Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue; Ansel Elgort pouting; Ansel Elgort wearing headphones.Meanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut.For the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other sport-themed glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Omar Mateen: From Early Promise to F.B.I. Surveillance", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byFORT PIERCE, Fla. \u2014 Omar Mateen\u2019s life seemed to be on a successful trajectory a decade before he carried out one of the worst cases of mass murder in American history.He earned an associate degree in criminal justice technology in 2006. A year later, he was hired by one of the world\u2019s premier private security companies, G4S. And then, in 2009, he got married and bought a home.Soon, though, signs of troubles emerged. His wife, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, divorced him in 2011, after he abused her.Two years after that, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in after reports from Mr. Mateen\u2019s co-workers that he, the American-born son of Afghan immigrants, had suggested he may have had terrorist ties. The F.B.I. interviewed him twice, but after surveillance, records checks and witness interviews, agents were unable to verify any terrorist links and closed their investigation.After the terrorist investigations cleared Mr. Mateen, he maintained both his Florida security-officer license and his job. He also kept his Florida firearms license, and within the last few days he legally purchased a handgun and a \u201clong gun.\u201dLabeling the attack an act of domestic terrorism, law enforcement officials said Mr. Mateen had called 911 once the attacks began and swore allegiance over the phone to the Islamic State.\u201cThey were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, \u2018Look at that. In front of my son, they are doing that,\u2019 \u201d the elder Mr. Mateen said.Mr. Mateen\u2019s father said the killing had nothing to do with religion, and he apologized for his son. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aware of any action he is taking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in shock like the whole country.\u201dIn an interview at her home near Boulder, Colo., Ms. Yusufiy said that when she first met Mr. Mateen online through Myspace in 2008, he was a funny charmer with a decent job and aspirations to become a police officer.But after they were married, he made her hand over her paychecks from her day care job, prevented her from calling her parents and hit her, sometimes as she slept, she said. He also kept a handgun in the house.\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere except work,\u201d she said.Mr. Mateen was an observant Muslim, but never expressed sympathies for terrorist organizations or radical Islamists, she said.He also made anti-gay comments when he was angry. \u201cThere were definitely moments when he\u2019d express his intolerance towards homosexuals,\u201d she said.Ms. Yusify said she left Mr. Mateen in 2009 after her parents flew down from New Jersey and rescued her from the marriage, and had no contact with him since, save for one time when he tried to message her on Facebook.\u201cI thought I had closed the chapter on this horrible mistake,\u201d said Ms. Yusufiy, who said she learned of the tragedy from her parents.After the shooting, law enforcement officials swarmed a condominium complex in Fort Pierce, Fla., where Mr. Mateen owned a unit that property records show he purchased in 2009. The complex, wedged between Interstate 95 and the shore, now sits among some of Fort Pierce\u2019s working-class blocks.The authorities also focused on at least two other homes in the area, both in nearby Port St. Lucie, and spent hours canvassing a pair of properties connected to Mr. Mateen\u2019s family.Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.It appeared that Mr. Mateen may have contacted another Orlando club in the days leading up to the shooting.After the attack this morning Mr. Bass thought the name of the man looked familiar. When he searched the name on Google he realized it was in fact the same person who had contacted him.The imam firmly denied that Mr. Mateen had heard any teachings at the mosque that would radicalize him.Mr. Mateen\u2019s father is an outspoken Afghan political activist, but that played no part in the investigations of his son that the F.B.I. carried out in 2013 and 2014, a law enforcement official said.A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.His father, Sediqque, hosted a talk show for a television channel broadcasting to the Afghan diaspora.Recently, the elder Mr. Mateen has taken to posting videos on his Facebook page where, dressed in a military uniform in front of the Afghan flag, he sharply criticizes the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani.The statement confirmed that Mr. Mateen had worked for the company since Sept. 10, 2007, and expressed the company\u2019s sadness at Sunday\u2019s attack. It also said Mr. Mateen underwent screening and background checks both when he was recruited in 2007 as well as in 2013, and nothing of concern surfaced either time.Yet the statement did not address whether company officials had ever asked the F.B.I. why it had investigated Mr. Mateen. The company also did not respond to questions about Mr. Mateen\u2019s conduct raised by one of his former co-workers.\u201cHe talked about killing people all the time,\u201d said Mr. Gilroy, who joined G4S after a career with the Fort Pierce police and later left the security firm. He said he could not provide names of any other co-workers who could support his account of Mr. Mateen\u2019s behavior.Advertisement"}

It feels like a longer word that got cut off,\u201d she said, although she added that renaming the company gives it a good platform to help publicize its new strategy \u2014 not to mention media attention.Bob Killian, founder of Killian Branding, had a similar reaction. \u201c\u2018Tronc\u2019 has a few demerits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strangled sound, and it creates an ugliness.\u201d But it helps, he said, that the name is short and easy to say.Rob Frankel, a branding expert, was also negative. \u201cThe renaming thing blows up way more often than there\u2019s any benefit,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe wrong way is when people confuse brand for identity.\u201dIra Kalb, an assistant professor of clinical marketing at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, says many companies overlook the role a name plays in their identity. \u201cIn a brand platform, the three big items we have are the name, the logo and the slogan. Those three things work together to help create your brand in the mind of the buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you change that name, you\u2019re changing the relationship, and most people don\u2019t understand that.\u201dExperts say one of the most common mistakes that companies make is to let employees or customers make suggestions, or to make a contest out of picking a new name. \u201cTo create an effective name, it should not be a democracy,\u201d Ms. Cottineau said. \u201cEverybody feels they\u2019re an expert in naming.\u201dThe reality is that most people are not, Mr. Killian said. \u201cAn internal contest is a disaster about 100 percent of the time. You\u2019re asking people to do something that\u2019s not in their skill set,\u201d he said. A renaming contest also creates a dynamic with winners and losers, which can inject unnecessary tension into a company\u2019s work force, he said.Ms. Cottineau says most companies make a lot of mistakes when it comes to rebranding. \u201cChanging your corporate name is really difficult. This one little word has to overcome so many different hurdles,\u201d she said.Not only should the ideal brand name be easy to pronounce and spell, but, Ms. Cottineau said, a newer concern is making sure that the word does not get automatically corrected \u2014 possibly to something embarrassing \u2014 when typed in an email or text message.\u201cProbably the biggest one is trademark and URL availability,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s not unheard-of for naming consultants to cycle through thousands of possibilities before settling on a short list of available ones.Different barriers to starting a business today, with the evolution of the tech start-up industry, and changes to trademark law mean that an entrepreneur can effectively take a name out of circulation even if the business plan never comes to fruition.Ms. Cottineau says another challenge is companies\u2019 growing preference for real words \u2014 a trend driven by the perception that these words represent a more authentic experience \u2014 as opposed to \u201ccoined words,\u201d or made-up monikers.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a trend towards real-word naming now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really hard to get, though. When you\u2019re trying to secure a trademark for a real word, it has to be relevant but not descriptive of your category.\u201dStarbucks, for instance, is a better name than something more generic that might include the word coffee, she said. Likewise, Apple stands out among its technological brethren with a name that evokes harvests rather than hard drives.Ms. Cottineau praised the name choices of the ride-hailing service Uber and the food delivery service Seamless. Both hint at what their companies aspire to be without pigeonholing them.Although it\u2019s easier to err than to score a victory when renaming a brand, experts say, one effort that earned high marks was by Google, which changed its corporate name from Google, its flagship search engine, to Alphabet last year as it expanded into potentially risky ventures like high-speed broadband, smart-home devices and self-driving cars.\u201cA lot of those things are innovative, and innovation comes with failure,\u201d Mr. Kalb said. \u201dAnd when your brand fails, you don\u2019t want it to spill over to other products.\u201dMr. Frankel, the branding expert, said, \u201cBlackBerry made the same mistake. WordPerfect did in the \u201980s, which is to confuse product with brand.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the product missteps one time, it takes the whole brand down with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s the laws of attraction.\u201dHe then crossed the street to attend a drag show at mYXto, a gay-friendly bar, where he would stay until about 5 a.m.Attraction drives the Malec\u00f3n, which is a popular hangout for all Habaneros, especially for those who are gay \u2014 including escorts. Another habitu\u00e9, Jorge Luis Ramos Medina, 30, a gay information engineer, described its broad appeal as \u201cHavana\u2019s sofa.\u201dIt\u2019s what cities in the United States and Europe, pre-internet, once called \u201ccruising grounds\u201d \u2014 areas that have for the most part become quaint artifacts of the gay past, replaced by hookup apps like Grindr, Jack\u2019d and Scruff. Havana is gay night life before Grindr.On an island of communists, gay Cubans were long Havana\u2019s have-nots, the last among equals. That began to change in 2008, when, after a gay rights speech by Mariela Castro Esp\u00edn, the daughter of President Ra\u00fal Castro, the capital staged its first gay pride parade, which has continued annually, less as a shirtless spectacle and more as a protest. Kingbar, which opened last year in the hip Vedado neighborhood, harks back to a time when American gay bars still had a bit of a renegade quality.\u201cIt\u2019s like freedom of expression,\u201d said Manuel Subarez, 27, a sandwich maker at a cafe who is also a \u201cfull-time Lena Dunham superfan.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like we can do anything we want today, because we are gay,\u201d he said at this year\u2019s parade, tugging proudly on his Keith Haring tank top. Homosexuality was legalized here in 1979, but a 1988 law prohibits a \u201cpublicly manifested\u201d presence.\u201cThe revolution continues,\u201d said Dr. Castro, 53, a sex educator, at the official post-parade festival as she held a rainbow placard of this year\u2019s motto, \u201cYo Me Incluyo (I Include Myself).\u201d \u201cUntil there is equality and diversity for all Cubans in all aspects of our society.\u201dA dedicated gay bar \u2014 as opposed to one with, say, a night devoted to gay clientele \u2014 debuted here in 2013, the first ever in Havana. But its closure last October was met with a collective roll-with-the-punches shrug. More places catering to gays are coming, joining a dozen weekly parties and Mi Cayito, a beach popular with gays. And the Malec\u00f3n itself is too vital a scene to be shut down. Gay clubs frequently swell with the roaring titular anthem of a Jacob Forever pop song: \u201cUntil the Malec\u00f3n runs dry!\u201dWi-Fi bandwidth is another matter. Cuba has up to 4,000 active daily Grindr users, said Jennifer Foley Shields, a publicist for the app. But a recent series of Grindr check-ins here by this reporter revealed, on average, 11 online users in this city of two million (a population roughly equivalent to Houston\u2019s).Even in a five-star hotel along the Malec\u00f3n with four-bar Wi-Fi reception, one typical check-in, after several false starts, required 14 minutes to open the app.Joel Simkhai, 39, Grindr\u2019s founder and chief executive, has touted the app\u2019s reach in nations struggling technologically. This year, after a visit to the island, Mr. Simkhai told On Cuba magazine that gay Cubans \u201cstill haven\u2019t got it 100 percent.\u201d During that trip, he hosted a party sponsored by Grindr at a bar on its gay night.In a phone interview, Mr. Simkhai said he would not share the minimum bandwidth Grindr needed to function, adding: \u201cOur numbers are O.K. It\u2019s not a huge market for us.\u201d Cuba is \u201ca growth opportunity in a market dying for Grindr,\u201d he added.Last year, the Cuban government created public for-pay Wi-Fi zones. Verizon began Cuba\u2019s first data-roaming deal with the United States last September. In March, Google announced plans for a technology center here, offering 70 megabytes per second (as opposed to the normal one megabyte per second speed that is standard here).Mr. Calderon, who goes by the nickname Wild, has accounts with Grindr, Hornet, PlanetRomeo Uncut and Scruff, and claims to be the only man in Havana on Daddyhunt. He finds the apps unappealing.\u201cGay life is about being open, being unlimited,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m bisexual, because I prefer the unlimited. Why would anyone \u2014 bisexual, gay, whatever \u2014 want to be trapped as a photo, as an internet profile in an app? That\u2019s a different kind of closet, a box. So boring.\u201dHis friend Juan Carlos Godoy Torres, 25, a saxophonist and flutist with an 8-year-old son, agreed.\u201cI didn\u2019t fight through five years of slow development in the gay community to end up spending two or three CUCs an hour maybe meeting a virtual person,\u201d Mr. Godoy said. \u201cI prefer the magic of the streets, someone who can trap me with his eyes, who can dance with me, who can touch my face. I want more than sex.\u201cI was married, and I want that moment of revelation of that day, when you see someone for the first time, the surprise of it. That\u2019s not possible if they are sending me messages that begin with photos of their chest. That\u2019s not romance. That\u2019s shopping.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: China Has the World\u2019s Most Powerful Computer (Again)", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byBitsBy some measures, China now has the world\u2019s best computer. The question is whether America should worry about it.The United States was a strong second, but it used to dominate the list. From the American point of view, not good.Perhaps as impressive as the outcome is the means by which the machines\u2019 engineers arrived at the output. The United States does not allow the shipment of advanced semiconductors to China, because chips of that kind can be used in weapons design. So the winning team figured out how to string together over 40,000 Chinese-made chips, each with the processing power of a nice smartphone.That achievement also underlines some shortcomings in viewing this as a straightforward competition, however. The winning computer required as much power as would be needed for 15,000 American homes, and seemed to hit that power level by using relatively little memory.It is a fine machine, but it may not be a very practical machine. The real race now may be how quickly China can develop its own artificial intelligence industry, along with high-performance semiconductors. These could, if combined with the networking know-how shown by this machine, make a severely daunting computer. It is spending billions on that effort.Even more than for the bragging rights, supercomputers now matter for everything from weather forecasting to packaged-goods design. They are increasingly important for the great number of products and processes that are being developed using A.I.The United States lost the race to the top in supercomputers, but it still placed pretty well. It had 165 machines on the list, compared with 167 for China. Japan, which came in third, had 29 computers on the list. The United States had the largest number of supercomputers in the top 20.And the United States has leading researchers in A.I., both in universities and at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The companies matter because they have lots and lots of data on which to train machines, a critical part of making algorithms work better.Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of semiconductors, is now focusing on the use of high-performance chips in commercial A.I., particularly as part of overall computing systems of chips and data. On Monday, Intel showed the latest A.I. features of its high-end commercial chips at an international supercomputing conference in Germany.One feature that figured in the presentation was the ability to deliver nine times the performance of other commercial A.I. systems for the same money. That is a metric the supercomputing list doesn\u2019t consider. But, as they say, it\u2019s money that matters.\u201cPeople miss the importance of making powerful machines accessible to everyone,\u201d said Nidhi Campbell, who runs Intel\u2019s work in this area. \u201cThis has implications for lots of things in the future, like autonomous cars, but first it has to work easily and well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.The policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.Last month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.Kanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201dMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.Opening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201dThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.Mr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.Apple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Apple Think Outside the Device?", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMore than any other company in tech, Apple prizes physical objects \u2014 expensive, perfectly designed, self-contained nuggets of aluminum and glass that you buy today, use for a couple years and replace.Until recently, that view worked quite well. Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apple\u2019s device-centric aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world \u2014 and raked in eye-popping profits while doing so.Yet Apple\u2019s view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech.So the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices?The answer: Yes, but slowly \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough.But a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as add-ons to its devices \u2014 not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apple\u2019s best chance to create the kind of transcendent, cross-device experience that its competitors are now pushing.Analysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV; Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apple\u2019s devices, left unclear what Apple\u2019s ultimate aims were for the voice assistant.The new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone \u2014 you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine.These shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice \u2014 in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.Siri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps, ride-sharing apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri won\u2019t let you control music apps, for example \u2014 you can\u2019t ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apple\u2019s own music subscription service.This limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort \u2014 one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t.For now, this isn\u2019t a big problem \u2014 you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?The device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend \u2014 and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201dTo handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload \u2014 there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?But based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is. It\u2019s taking a more moderate app-based, device-centric path. Many of its voice features will be fine \u2014 useful, even. But it sure isn\u2019t pushing for a revolution.Advertisement"}

Bingham \u2014 a former Newsweek correspondent and the author of \u201cClass Action\u201d and \u201cWomen on the Hill\u201d \u2014 interviewed over 100 people, many of whom speak eloquently about possibility and impossibility. \u201cWitness to the Revolution\u201d starts with David Harris, one of the heroes of the antiwar movement and draft resistance, who explains that \u201ceverything .\u2008.\u2008. grew out of the Mississippi taproot\u201d: Freedom Summer in 1964, when white college students went south to help with voter registration and saw for the first time \u201cthe heroism of the black people in Mississippi.\u201d In subsequent chapters, interviewees talk about Woodstock, LSD, the Pentagon Papers and the F.B.I. campaign to destroy the Black Panthers. The book also features an excellent chapter on women\u2019s liberation, with comments by, among others, Robin Morgan, the author of the article \u201cGoodbye to All That\u201d (\u201cGoodbye forever, counterfeit left .\u2008.\u2008. male-dominated cracked-glass mirror reflection of the Amerikan Nightmare\u201d).And of course, overshadowing the entire era, and the entire book, is the seemingly endless war in Vietnam, highlighted by Richard Nixon\u2019s invasion of Cambodia in May 1970. It provoked the largest student strike in the nation\u2019s history, with 2.5 million students boycotting classes, and 700 colleges shut down \u2014 among them Kent State, after National Guardsmen killed four students there. Allison Krause was one of them, shot when she was 343 feet away from the guardsmen. Laurel Krause says, \u201cMy sister bled to death, for 45 minutes, before an ambulance came, yet ambulances were available over the hill, reserved for guard and authority injuries only.\u201d Some months before that, Seymour Hersh\u2019s reports on the My Lai massacre came out. Here he recalls talking with the mother of one of the soldiers who participated; she said, \u201cI sent them a good boy and they made him a murderer.\u201dMany of Bingham\u2019s interviewees are well known: Daniel Ellsberg, Jane Fonda, Carl Bernstein, Oliver Stone. Some of them have been interviewed a lot: If you Google \u201cBernardine Dohrn\u201d and \u201cinterview,\u201d you get more than 20,000 results. (I\u2019ve interviewed her myself, along with a dozen of the other people here, for radio or print.) And many of them have written their own memoirs or histories of the era. But some of the people here are not so familiar, and their interviews are among the most valuable. Bingham talked to a police officer from Madison, Tom Mc\u00adCarthy, who was part of a street war with the counterculture there; he says, \u201cEveryone on the Madison police force celebrated after we heard about the Kent State shootings.\u201d And she interviewed an F.B.I. agent, Bill Dyson, whose job was to listen in on leaders of the antiwar Students for a Democratic Society (S.D.S.). (Disclosure: I was a member.) He was impressed by their \u201cdedication,\u201d and had his own doubts about Vietnam, telling Bingham, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know why we were there.\u201d The familiar voices and the unfamiliar ones are woven together with some documents to make this a surprisingly powerful and moving book.If America seemed hopeless, though, the rest of the world didn\u2019t. As the Weathermen saw it, in Rudd\u2019s words, \u201cthe nonwhite people of the world,\u201d starting with the Vietnamese and the Cubans, were \u201cgoing to bring down American imperialism.\u201d And inside the heart of the empire, their comrades, a small group of privileged white revolutionaries, could strike powerful blows. So they shut down the S.D.S. national office, and 150 Weathermen went underground. They started a campaign of bombings that were mostly symbolic \u2014 targeting, for example, a bathroom in the Capitol building. They aimed to exploit the news media\u2019s fascination with violence and reveal the system\u2019s vulnerability. The Weather Underground knew they were a tiny group, but they saw themselves acting on the global stage, in solidarity with the great majority of the world\u2019s oppressed people.However, Vietnamese and Cuban leaders \u201call told us not to do it,\u201d Dohrn recalls. Rudd says they wanted \u201ca united antiwar movement\u201d with millions of people, not a violent, clandestine group with a couple of hundred. The Weather Underground knew better. Rudd calls that \u201cour arrogance.\u201dBut Ayers did help kill S.D.S. Rudd says it best: What he regrets most about the Weathermen is that \u201cwe destroyed S.D.S. at the height of the war.\u201d That happened, Tom Hayden emphasizes, before the Moratorium in October 1969, when two million people participated in the largest antiwar protest to date, and before the nationwide student strike against the war in May 1970. \u201cThere were many student uprisings to come,\u201d he says, but \u201cthe group that had triggered it .\u2008.\u2008. was actually dead. Unbelievable. And this was not seven years from the time when S.D.S. was formed.\u201dThe only real flaw in the book is in the title, which refers to 1969-70 as a year of \u201crevolution.\u201d Bingham attributes that idea to the Nixon aide Stephen Bull, who told her, \u201cYou have no idea how close we were, as a country, to revolution.\u201d I don\u2019t know any historians who would agree with that; Michael Kazin, who is interviewed here, certainly doesn\u2019t. \u201cThe war was incredibly unpopular,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the antiwar movement was also unpopular.\u201d As for Bingham herself, she was not a \u201cwitness to the revolution\u201d \u2014 she was 6 years old in 1969, and writes that she always felt as if she had \u201cmissed the party.\u201dShe gives the last word to Robin Morgan: \u201cPeople who get misty-eyed about that period drive me nuts because then I trot out all the things that were wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was also a visionary period in the life of this country, and I\u2019m glad I was part of it.\u201dJon Wiener is a contributing editor at The Nation.

A second work of election fiction \u2014 by a different writer \u2014 will follow this fall.Melania decided she would order the flowers herself. Donald was too busy now anyway to call Alessandra\u2019s as usual and ask for \u201csomething amazing.\u201d Once, in the early years, before she fully understood him, she had asked what his favorite flowers were.\u201cI use the best florists in the city, they\u2019re terrific,\u201d he replied, and she realized that taste, for him, was something to be determined by somebody else, and then flaunted.At first, she wished he would not keep asking their guests, \u201cHow do you like these great flowers?\u201d and that he would not be so nakedly in need of their praise, but now she felt a small tug of annoyance if a guest did not gush as Donald expected. The florists were indeed good, their peonies delicate as tissue, even if a little boring, and the interior decorators Donald had brought in \u2014 all the top guys used them, he said \u2014 were good, too, even if all that gold yellowness bordered on staleness, and so she did not disagree because Donald disliked dissent, and he only wanted the best for them, and she had what she really needed, this luxurious peace. But today, she would order herself. It was her dinner party to celebrate her parents\u2019 anniversary. Unusual orchids, maybe. Her mother loved uncommon things.Her Pilates instructor, Janelle, would arrive in half an hour. She had just enough time to order the flowers and complete her morning skin routine. She would use a different florist, she decided, where Donald did not have an account, and pay by herself. Donald might like that; he always liked the small efforts she made. Do the little things, don\u2019t ask for big things and he will give them to you, her mother advised her, after she first met Donald. She gently patted three different serums on her face and then, with her fingertips, applied an eye cream and \u00adsunscreen.What a bright morning. Summer sunlight raised her spirits. And Tiffany was leaving today. It felt good. The girl had been staying for the past week, and came and went, mostly staying out of her way. Still, it felt good. Yesterday she had taken Tiffany to lunch, so that she could tell Donald that she had taken Tiffany to lunch.\u201cShe adores all my kids, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Donald once told a reporter \u2014 he was happily blind to the strangeness in the air whenever she was with his children.To keep the lunch short, she had told Tiffany that she had an afternoon meeting with the Chinese company that produced her jewelry \u2014 even though she had no plans. Tiffany had cheerily forked spinach salad into her mouth, her California voice too pleasant, too fey. Her wrists looked fragile and breakable. She talked about how much she loved Ivanka\u2019s new collection; she talked about a vegan recipe, reciting details of berries and seaweed, as though Melania would actually ever make it. She played a recording of her singing and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not there yet but I\u2019m working on it. You think Dad will like it?\u201d Melania said, \u201cOf course.\u201dNow she found herself warming to Tiffany, perhaps more because the girl was leaving today. Tiffany was nice. Tiffany courted her. Tiffany acknowledged her power. Tiffany was different from that Czech woman\u2019s children \u2014 she never disputed, with her manner, the primacy of Melania\u2019s place in Donald\u2019s life.Not like Ivanka. Melania breathed deeply. Even just thinking of Ivanka brought an exquisite, slow-burning irritation. That letter Ivanka wrote to Donald after their engagement. She would never forget it. Congratulations, Dad. At least your ex-wife was pure. It lay carelessly on the desk, as most of Donald\u2019s papers did, and Melania had read it over and over, and later, unable to control herself, had shown it to Donald. What does she mean by this? Donald laughed it off. Ivanka gets moody and jealous, he said. I am here! Melania had wanted to shout once at the girl, golden-haired and indulged by Donald, one summer when Ivanka joined them for breakfast in Palm Beach and did not once glance at Melania.\u201cMelania looks great, but we have to think about how to make her more relatable for the convention, maybe less contour makeup and her smiling and not squinting so much,\u201d Ivanka said just two days earlier, at a meeting with Donald\u2019s campaign team. Melania was seated there, next to Donald and part of the meeting, and yet Ivanka spoke of her as though she were invisible.\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Donald said. He always agreed with Ivanka. Ivanka who spoke in eloquent streams of words that meant nothing but still impressed everyone, Ivanka whom Donald showed off like a glowing modern toy that he did not know how to operate.Remember, only praise for his daughter when he is there, her mother told her whenever Melania complained.Her phone chimed; a text from Donald. I\u2019m leading in the latest poll. National! Nice!It was probably what he had tweeted as well. He copied and pasted his tweets to her in text messages. Once she had suggested he hold back on a tweet and he replied that he had already tweeted it. He showed her his tweets after he had sent them, not before.That is so great! she texted back.She sagged suddenly with terror, imagining what would happen if Donald actually won. Everything would change. Her contentment would crack into pieces. The relentless intrusions into their lives; those horrible media people who never gave Donald any credit would get even worse. She had never questioned Donald\u2019s dreams because they did not collide with her need for peace. Only once, when he was angry about something to do with his TV show, and abruptly decided to leave her and Barron in Paris and go back to New York, she had asked him quietly, \u201cWhen will it be enough?\u201d She had been rubbing her caviar cream on Barron\u2019s cheeks \u2014 he was about 6 then \u2014 and Donald ignored her question and said, \u201cKeep doing that and you\u2019ll turn that kid into a sissy.\u201dShe forced herself to stop thinking of Donald winning. There was this evening to look forward to, with Donald and her parents and a few friends, food and flowers, the butler\u2019s creaseless service, and the magnanimous ease of it all.Barron had told her last night that he would not join them at dinner. \u201cToo boring, Mom,\u201d he had said in Slovenian. She missed his delicious younger days, when he was pliable and happy to go everywhere with her, when she would brush his hair and hold his perfect little body close and feel it almost one with hers. Now, he had an individual self, separate and wise, with knowledge of golf and video games; when she kissed him he twisted away. At least she had persuaded him to come down and say hello to the guests after they arrived.She had asked the chef for a menu that was both \u201cold and new,\u201d and he suggested steak and watercress and quinoa and lobster and something else she did not remember. Her mother would like it. When she was growing up, her mother used the French or English terms for the food she cooked, as if the Slovenian would make them unforgivingly ordinary. She would serve a ragout for dinner, after a long day at the textile factory, her lips still carefully rouged, her waist tightly cinched, always striving, always trying to escape the familiar. A woman had to hold herself together, her mother said, or end up looking like a wide middle-aged Russian.\u25c6The butler called her bedroom. \u201cMiss Tiffany would like to say goodbye, Mrs. Trump.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Melania said, and waited for Tiffany to knock on her door.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, didn\u2019t want to bother you,\u201d Tiffany said. Her blond hair extensions were distracting; too long and doll-like.\u201cNo, no problem,\u201d Melania said. \u201cYou look nice.\u201d\u201cThank you so much for everything! See you in Cleveland next week!\u201d Tiffany said, hugging her.\u201cTake care.\u201dAt the door, Tiffany turned back and said, \u201cIvanka donates to Hillary.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI saw it on her laptop when I went over there last night. She uses a fake name. It\u2019s the same fake name she uses to order stuff online. I thought you should know.\u201dMelania swallowed her surprise. Why was Tiffany telling her this? Around Ivanka, Tiffany was like an eager insecure puppy, as though she would not truly be part of the family but for Ivanka\u2019s good grace \u2014 a grace that needed to be fed with loyalty and adulation.So why tell her this? And could it be true? Tiffany was watching, waiting for a reaction. She was determined to say nothing, just in case Tiffany was reporting back to someone. She always suspected intrigue among Donald\u2019s children \u2014 and she would not tell Donald about this, not yet; she would first discuss it with her mother. Whether it was true or not, this was a morsel to be saved, molded, used in the best way.\u201cI must get ready for my Pilates, Tiffany,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cSee you in Cleveland.\u201dDonald called just after she ordered the orchids. He had some meetings, but his big event of the day was a luncheon organized by the Republican National Committee.\u201cHow is it going?\u201d she asked.\u201cGreat. Did you see the polls, honey? Can you believe this?\u201d His voice had an ebullient pitch. He still did not entirely believe this was happening \u2014 his lead in the polls, the new veneer of being taken seriously. She could tell from the disbelieving urgency of his actions, and from the way he flipped through cable channels and scanned newspapers for his name.\u201cRemember I told you: You will win,\u201d she said.She always tried to sound casually believing, as if the polls were merely incidental, and her faith had conjured his victory. But she was as startled by his rise as he was.When she had first told him \u201cyou will win,\u201d that balmy day in Florida last year, drinking Diet Coke in tennis whites, she had meant he would win at what he wanted: the publicity, the ego polish. It would help his TV show, and impress those business associates tickled by fame. But she had never meant he would actually win the Republican primary, nor had she expected the frenzy of media coverage he received. Americans were so emotionally young, so fascinated by what Europeans knew to be world-weary realities. They were drawn to Donald\u2019s brashness and bluster and bullying, his harsh words, even the amoral ease with which untruths slid out of his mouth. She viewed these with a shrug \u2014 he was human, and he had his good points, and did Americans truly not know that human beings told lies? But they had followed him from the beginning, breathlessly and childishly. There were days when every television channel she switched to had his image on the screen. They did not understand that what he found unbearable was to be ignored, and for this she was grateful, because being in the news brought Donald the closest he could be to contentment. He would never be a truly content person, she knew this, because of that primal restlessness that thrummed in him, the compulsion to prove something to himself that he feared he never would. It moved her, made her feel protective. Even the way he nursed his grudges, almost lovingly, unleashing in great detail slights from 20 years ago, made her protective of him. She often felt, despite the age gap of more than two decades, that she was older than Donald. Her response to his agitations was a curated series of soothing murmurs. Be a little calmer, she told him often. In bed, she had learned to gauge Donald and know when he expected her to gasp. On nights when she did not have the mental energy to act, she would tell Donald, \u201cIt is not a good night today,\u201d and he would kiss her cheek and leave, because he liked her air of delicate mystery.\u25c6The butler knocked and brought her lemon water on a tray. \u201cJanelle is here, Mrs. Trump.\u201dHe did his characteristic almost-bow. He liked her, mostly because of how little she said, and how she encouraged an air of enigmatic formality.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.She applied concealer and lip gloss and highlighter, checked herself in the mirror. She had not worn makeup with Amy, her last instructor, but Janelle made her want to look attractive. After Amy moved to Los Angeles and recommended Janelle, Donald saw her \u2014 he was home on Janelle\u2019s first day and said: \u201cReally? I didn\u2019t think they did that Pilates stuff. It\u2019s not like Pilates is hip-hop or whatever.\u201d She, too, was taken aback when she first saw Janelle, sinuous and small, skin the color of earth, locs pulled up in a bun. She\u2019s professional and discreet, Amy had said. Now, weeks in, Melania wished that Janelle were not so professional, so singularly focused on straightening Melania\u2019s feet, flattening Melania\u2019s belly, and never saying anything personal.\u201cHi, Mrs. Trump. Ready for the warm-up?\u201d Janelle asked, her face, as usual, a pleasant mask scrubbed of expression.\u201cYes,\u201d Melania said.Janelle was beside her on the mat, legs aloft. She smelled of grapefruit. Melania wanted to reach out and taste her \u2014 the smooth skin of her arm, her full, \u00adbrownish-pink lips. She followed Janelle\u2019s lead and wondered about Janelle\u2019s life. Was there a boyfriend? Someone like her, dignified and quiet? Each time the Pilates session ended, she considered asking Janelle to stay for lunch, or just a glass of juice, but she feared that Janelle would say no.\u201cOh, I must get a massage, for my thighs,\u201d Melania said, tentative, desperate to say something personal and yet safe.\u201cA warm bath should help,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cHave a good day, Mrs. Trump.\u201dMelania felt deflated. Had she expected Janelle to offer to give her a massage? It was so silly of her. Had Janelle meant anything more by \u201cwarm bath\u201d? She was trying to read what was not there. But she would not allow herself to be sad. There was the evening to look forward to.\u25c6Her phone chimed. Another text from Donald.Hope says fashion people are asking what you\u2019ll wear to convention. Has to be a big name. An American designer. Have you decided?I have three and will choose tomorrow, she texted back.Donald had never taken much interest in what she wore. Not like Tomaz, her ex, who had picked out her clothes and liked the smell of her sweat. Why had she suddenly thought of Tomaz? Tomaz smoked thin cigarettes and walked the world in an existential haze of disapproval. After she was interviewed in a French magazine some years ago, Tomaz had sent her an email through her sister Ines. Now you have what you always wanted, you have forgotten Ljubljana? It had annoyed her and of course she did not reply. Unlike Tomaz, Donald was not a sensual man. But it was what had attracted her to Donald in the beginning: He was not a man who traded in complexities. After brooding, Sartre-quoting Tomaz, Donald came as a relief.She checked the time. Donald would be done with his luncheon. She would call, to remind him to be back on time. He sometimes forgot himself at these things.\u201cThe dinner party?\u201d he said. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be home.\u201d\u201cYou want me to wear those first diamonds?\u201d she asked, light and teasing. It was their joke; the first time they made love, she had worn nothing but those earrings. It had also been his first gift to her, in a pretty black box, and he asked her to open it, humming with a need for her gratitude. He was not eager to please her, she realized, he was keen to be pleased by her pleasure. And so she gave in, thanking him, wreathing her face with delight, even though she wished the diamonds were bigger.\u201cYes, wear them. I bet those beauties have tripled in value,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to go, honey, I\u2019m meeting with the top five guys of the committee. They\u2019re all dying to talk to me.\u201dShe undressed and examined herself in the mirror. There was a new dimple in her thigh. Donald would say something if he noticed it. \u201cYou need to get these fixed soon,\u201d he had said a few months back, cupping her breasts, and when he got up from bed, she looked at his pale, slack belly, and the sprinkle of bristly hair on his back.\u25c6In the bath, sunk into scented foam, Melania settled down to read the latest coverage of Donald. There was a story about his money; they kept saying he did not have as much as he claimed to have. What did it matter? He had a lot. She glanced at the comments at the end of the article and the name \u201cJanelle\u201d caught her eye. The commenter wrote: Trump needs to modernize those ill-fitting suits, throw away the bottle of orange tan, get fake teeth that actually look like teeth and let himself go bald like God intended. How many Janelles were there in America? Of course it could not be her Janelle. Still, seeing the name excited her. It was unfair that people made fun of Donald\u2019s hair but she could not help smiling, reading it, imagining her Janelle writing it.There was a story about some of his angry supporters, displaying swastikas on their trucks, and she cringed reading it. Extremes of anything discomfited her. The day Donald announced he would run for president, she had been filled with light on their glorious descent in the escalator, eyes and cameras on them, and everything dazzling. Afterward, she escaped to the cool white of her bedroom, and lay still for a long time, and then looked online at the coverage. She loved the way her smoky eyes popped in the photographs. A heady sense of accomplishment suffused her. But she did not want too many more of those moments, because they shifted her balance, left her spirit vaguely disjointed.She Googled herself and enlarged some of the photos. Why did some news sites choose the most unflattering images? It was deliberate. She was scrupulous about presenting the best angles of her face to the cameras, practicing the tilt to her neck that ensured a slim silhouette. Yet some photo editors were determined to use the few bad shots. They were jealous of Donald; nothing else could explain it.She hoped Donald would not open her bedroom door tonight; this was the kind of day that he would come, exuberant and expansive from victory. It had been almost two months. The last time, he kissed her, eager and dramatic and sweaty as he often was \u2014 he hated her initiating things, \u201caggressive women make me think I\u2019m with a transsexual,\u201d he\u2019d told her years ago \u2014 and then fumbled and shifted and suddenly got up and said he had a phone call to make. Only then did she understand what had happened. They did not talk about it, but for a few days he had sulked and snapped, as though it were her fault.\u25c6Donald came home red-faced, his lips a snarl of rage. He ignored the butler\u2019s greeting. Melania kissed him hello and braced herself.\u201cCan you believe these losers? They\u2019re talking about 2020,\u201d he said. He flung his jacket down on the living room floor and she picked it up.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.\u201cReince pulled me aside after the meeting. He\u2019s a great guy, always nice to me. He said all the top guys at the R.N.C. have decided to focus on 2020, and put very little money and effort into my campaign. Like I don\u2019t even have a chance at all!\u201d\u201cIt makes no sense what they want to do. You have many votes. Look at the polls. People love you.\u201dShe knew how easily mollified he was by praise, but he barely seemed to hear her, consumed as he was, typing furiously on his phone. She hoped he would not hurl the phone at the wall, as he had done after a newspaper wrote about Trump University, after which he stayed up all night writing hasty, flagrant letters to journalists.The doorbell rang and there was Ivanka, her face dewy as though she had not had a long day at work, lips crimson. Too crimson; Melania herself favored nude lipsticks. She imagined Ivanka sending money to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, using a fake name. Could it be true? What name did she use? Thinking of a fake name made her think of Janelle.\u201cHey!\u201d Ivanka said. A general greeting, but she was looking at her father.\u201cIvanka. What a surprise,\u201d Melania said.\u201cIvanka wanted to come over to discuss this,\u201d Donald said, glancing up from his phone. He was only telling her now. He would expect her to ask Ivanka to dinner and she would have to endure Ivanka\u2019s polished voice, that fulsome surface that shielded cold metal.\u201cOh, what gorgeous flowers,\u201d Ivanka said. \u201cAre they from Alessandra\u2019s, Dad?\u201d\u201cNo. I used another florist,\u201d Melania said. Ivanka\u2019s admiration pleased her, and she resented Ivanka for it.\u201cCan you just believe these losers?\u201d Donald said testily, impatient with talk of flowers. \u201cThey want to sabotage me!\u201dDonald admired in his daughter qualities he would not abide in a wife. Not that Melania minded, she told herself, watching them. Ivanka moved like him, loose-limbed. Like him, she was comfortable with display. Like him, she was always selling something. The difference was that you knew what Donald was selling; Ivanka left you wondering.\u201cIt\u2019s utter sabotage and unacceptable,\u201d Ivanka said.\u201cI\u2019ve got to hit back at these guys.\u201d\u201cYou do have to hit back, totally,\u201d Ivanka said. \u201cWe have to figure out the best way.\u201dWhy did she not calm him down? Melania was annoyed. Her evening would be ruined, Donald\u2019s churlish mood would darken her dinner, and he would probably leave after the main course, without apology. He had done it the day after Cruz beat him at a primary, and they had been with guests that he had invited.\u201cI\u2019m leaving the Republican Party. That\u2019s it. If they\u2019re going to treat me this way. It\u2019s not nice. That\u2019s it,\u201d Donald said.\u201cBut you need the party,\u201d Melania said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t Europe, honey. You don\u2019t know anything about this,\u201d Donald said and turned back to Ivanka.She would not be annoyed, not with Ivanka to witness it. Donald used \u201cEurope\u201d to belittle her sometimes, but he also used \u201cEuropean\u201d as Americans did, like an aspirational word. European chocolates. European bread. European style.\u201cCan we set up a three-way with Paul and Hope in the study, Dad?\u201d Ivanka said, looking amused. \u201cIs Barron in his room? I\u2019ll just go say a quick hi.\u201dMelania felt an unreasonable urge to get up and drag Ivanka back. You do not go to my son\u2019s room without my permission!If only Barron didn\u2019t like her. It was Ivanka with whom he discussed tennis and golf.\u201cLook, honey, can we do this dinner another time?\u201d Donald said after Ivanka left. \u201cI need to think about this. These losers can\u2019t do this to me. Your parents will be fine. They\u2019re here most of the time anyway, and I can fly them back in if they want to. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201dHe was still speaking, but she could no longer understand. A tightness had gripped her temples, her hands shook. \u201cDonald, I want this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not hosted my parents. It is 50 years of marriage for them. Their friends are coming. I have planned for one week. I want this today.\u201dDonald looked up astonished from his phone. She dug her nails in her palm and stared back at him.\u201cO.K., O.K.,\u201d Donald said sighing. \u201cJust give me some time to talk to Ivanka.\u201dHe went inside, and a new elation settled in Melania\u2019s bones.They emerged half an hour later, Donald\u2019s face relaxed, Ivanka laughing, pushing her hair away from her face, fondly indulgent of her beloved man-child father.\u201cWe can\u2019t keep letting them think you\u2019re going to be Caligula when you become president, Dad,\u201d Ivanka said.\u201cWhatever,\u201d Donald said with a grin. He turned to Melania. \u201cHoney, we have a plan. I announce two days before the convention that I\u2019m done with the party. My supporters don\u2019t care about the party anyway. It\u2019s Trump they want. If I\u2019m an independent they\u2019ll still come to me. So that leaves the R.N.C. with one day to try and fix things. I\u2019ll give them a list of my conditions, they need to show me plans and figures for how they\u2019ll support my campaign, otherwise no deal. It\u2019ll knock them down. Let\u2019s see what they do with that!\u201d He sounded gleeful.Melania was startled. How could Ivanka have agreed to this? It would only lose him votes. His supporters were already with him, but what about the people who would vote for him only because of the Republican Party? Would that not turn them off? She opened her mouth to say something and then closed it. Ivanka had the smallest of triumphant smiles on her face. A well-oiled smile. Melania remembered that smooth smile at other times, when Donald insulted John McCain, when Donald boycotted a Republican debate. Ivanka always egged him on, never dissuaded him; she stirred the pot with her fulsome words.But Donald was calmer and her evening would go well and her mother would be happy.After dinner, she would ask Donald to come to her room, and she would be soft and subtle, and wear the jasmine scent he liked, and tell him Tiffany had come to her this morning, upset and crying, because she had discovered that Ivanka was supporting Hillary Clinton. She would suggest that Donald do and say nothing about it, hopefully none of the dishonest media people would find out, because of course it would be terrible if he had to publicly denounce his daughter, and Ivanka was so wonderful really, even though she was always telling the press how she didn\u2019t agree with all of her father\u2019s policies.\u201cIvanka, will you join us for dinner?\u201d Melania asked, knowing Ivanka would decline.\u201cThanks, but I have to get back to the kids,\u201d Ivanka said.Melania smiled sagely. \u201cOf course. Say hello to the family.\u201dThe doorbell rang. Her guests had arrived.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author of three novels, most recently \u201cAmericanah.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pinterest wants to be known as a network for inspiration in topics like travel, cooking and crafts, as well as for shopping both on and offline.At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google \u2014 a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.\u201cShopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday.Among the features are buyable \u201cpins,\u201d or buttons, in browsers that users can click to purchase items on the site, as well as a digital shopping bag that follows users from their desktops to their smartphones or tablets.Perhaps most interesting is Pinterest\u2019s object-detection software, a type of product search and discovery that companies like Amazon have tried. The software analyzes a photo of an object, such as a stuffed animal, recognizes it and highlights the item \u2014 or something like it \u2014 in a pop-up window. Users can then buy the item through Pinterest.The commerce-focused updates come as Pinterest, six years old and valued at roughly $11 billion, faces pressure to prove it can live up to the high expectations of investors.As other social networks like Facebook and Twitter have scaled back efforts to build e-commerce businesses, Pinterest has long said it will dedicate resources to make shopping on the site a regular activity.Advertisement"}

But if you are like me, you may um and ah too much, spurred by the worry that nerves may get the best of you, that you might speak too fast or mess up in some way. So I have been practicing my public speaking with the help of some apps.Ummo can show a transcript of what you have said on the screen. To improve, you can tell the app to beep when you use a filler word and edit the list of filler words to include ones you know you overuse.Ummo can then give data like how many words were spoken and how often words were reused. It also displays your pace in words per minute, how loud you were, whether your volume was consistent and so on. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs, and if you tap on a point in the graph, you can see the words in the speech transcript at that moment. The idea is to learn when in the speech you faltered so you can practice and fix mistakes.Public Speaking, which is a virtual reality app, delivers an immersive 3-D video that moves as you look around. The videos make you feel as if you are standing in different public speaking venues, like a podium in a small boardroom or a theater, sometimes with video of people listening to you. The idea is to get someone accustomed to what it feels like to be presenting to a crowd, and thus prepare for the same situation in real life.This is not as simple as it sounds, and Amber Light gets it right with clear controls and custom timers. People can choose the different color alert times and the option to have the phone buzz if they prefer a physical rather than a visual alert.Lastly, don\u2019t forget the smartphone\u2019s camera app. Making a video of yourself speaking can be a powerful way to spot mistakes \u2014 assuming you can get over the sometimes icky feeling of watching yourself on camera.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Software as Weaponry in a Computer-Connected World", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The internet was created nearly 40 years ago by men \u2014 and a few women \u2014 who envisioned an \u201cintergalactic network\u201d where humans could pull data and computing resources from any mainframe in the world and in the process free up their minds from mundane and menial tasks.\u201cThe hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled,\u201d wrote Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, who was known as \u201cLick\u201d and is the man widely remembered as the internet\u2019s Johnny Appleseed. Mr. Licklider joined the Pentagon in 1962, and his ideas later formed the basis for the military\u2019s primordial internet work.Even a big-vision idealist like Mr. Licklider could never have imagined that more than 50 years later, we would be telling the internet our deepest secrets and our whereabouts, and plugging in our smartphones, refrigerators, cars, oil pipelines, power grid and uranium centrifuges.And even the early internet pioneers at the Pentagon could not have foreseen that half a century later, the billions of mistakes made along the way to creating the internet of today and all the things attached to it would be strung together to form the stage for modern warfare.It is rare to find a computer today that is not linked to another, that is not baked with circuitry, applications and operating systems and that has not \u2014 at one point or another \u2014 been probed by a hacker, digital criminal or nation looking for weaknesses to exploit for profit, espionage or destruction.There is plenty of raw material to work with. On average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of code in delivered software, according to Steve McConnell, the author of \u201cCode Complete.\u201d Today, most of the applications we rely on \u2014 Google Chrome, Microsoft, Firefox and Android \u2014 contain millions of lines of code.

Governments big and small are stockpiling vulnerabilities and exploits in hardware, software, applications, algorithms and even security defenses like firewalls and antivirus software.They are using these holes to monitor their perceived enemies, and many governments are storing them for a rainy day, when they might just have to drop a payload that disrupts or degrades an adversary\u2019s transportation, energy or financial system.They are willing to pay anyone who can find and exploit these weaknesses top dollar to hand them over, and never speak a word to the companies whose programmers inadvertently wrote them into software in the first place.The leaks revealed a long customer list, including police departments, law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States, Europe and countries like Bahrain, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Morocco.But the market for exploitable bugs is much bigger than Hacking Team\u2019s client list, and nations have been paying huge sums to hackers willing to turn over those weaknesses to governments, and withhold them from software companies, for more than 20 years.Once Stuxnet and its motivations were uncovered \u2014 first by a security researcher in Belarus and then around the world \u2014 a Pandora\u2019s box was opened.Today, more than 100 governments have publicly acknowledged their own offensive cyberwar programs. Countries that were not in the market before Stuxnet was discovered are in it now.Iranian officials now claim to have the third-largest digital army in the world behind the United States and China. Those claims are impossible to verify, in large part because most countries keep such programs secret. But Iranian hackers have made plenty of demonstrations.The next year, Iranian hackers were blamed for a series of attacks on the United States banking system. And while security experts who have analyzed those attacks claim that the Iranians\u2019 abilities are still nowhere near those of the United States and its closest allies, they are steadily improving.Nations took a while to catch on to the wartime potential of the internet, but countries are now doubling down on their digital attack capabilities.Advertisement"}

The final agreement, though, may be postponed until the week of July 11, when Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, who helped to negotiate the Privacy Shield, is expected to visit Brussels.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cThis new framework for trans-Atlantic data flows protects the fundamental rights of Europeans and ensures legal certainty for businesses,\u201d Christian Wigand, a European Commission spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe are now in the process toward formal adoption.\u201dA representative for the Commerce Department was not immediately available to comment.European officials forced their American counterparts to offer Europeans more control over how their data was collected when transferred to the United States. A new position, called the Privacy Shield Ombudsman, also was created in the State Department to review European data protection complaints.In the draft agreement, the European Commission said it had been reassured that this position would remain independent of American intelligence agencies and that United States officials had offered further commitments to limit the bulk collection of Europeans\u2019 online data.\u201cOn the basis of all the above, the commission concludes that the United States ensures effective legal protection against interferences by its intelligence authorities with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data are transferred from the Union to the United States under the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield,\u201d the document said.The agreement may be short-lived. Many national regulators remain concerned about how it will be put into effect, and several data protection campaigners have said they will probably file legal cases against the new pact. These legal challenges, expert say, are likely to be heard by the European Court of Justice, the region\u2019s highest court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018The Wonder Trail,\u2019 Steve Hely Takes a Comedic Detour", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesIt\u2019s possible that there are lazier travel writers than Steve Hely, whose new book describes going from Los Angeles all the way down the Americas\u2019 western coast to Patagonia, without eliminating the suspicion that he never actually left home. But if you can let Mr. Hely\u2019s joking offset his featherweight work ethic, there aren\u2019t many who make better company.\u201cThe Wonder Trail\u201d is a fizzy, wildly untrustworthy account by a guy who helpfully made up his own Ponce de Le\u00f3n quotation (\u201cTo tell the tale of the journey is to go on it a second time\u201d) and who values facetiousness very highly. He has been an editor of The Harvard Lampoon and a comedy writer for TV shows including \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201cThe Late Show With David Letterman,\u201d \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201dSo what does he know about travel? Well, he\u2019s written one previous book on the subject. He has had the experience of leaving home. And he obviously hopes that \u201cpeople on trips, people who aren\u2019t taking trips, people who like trips and people who don\u2019t like trips\u201d are all potential readers of facile, funny, short-chaptered books full of gags, anecdotes, local color and touches of the cheerfully bizarre.Since Mr. Hely is also lazy enough to favor abundant padding, as well as a hit-or-miss approach, he\u2019s ready to include just about anything that comes to mind. The only things that organize \u201cThe Wonder Trail\u201d are a timeline and a compass. His plan in its entirety: Start in Los Angeles, head south and come home when his hiatus from TV writing is over.Mr. Hely claims that inspiration struck when he was sitting in his local coffee shop and noticed a map of Central and South America, one that started in Mexico and ended in Tierra del Fuego. Thus his idea of going south was hatched. \u201cIf this was a bad idea, no one told me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI live in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, nobody ever tells you if your idea is bad.\u201dThere\u2019s a little about Cortez. A little about Montezuma. A lot about Mr. Hely\u2019s taking walks. A look at a Diego Rivera mural. And then a wrap-up, which includes these boldface points: All the strings of lights in Mexico City make it feel like a carnival. It has wild color combinations. (\u201cIf you\u2019re tidy in your color schemes, you won\u2019t like it.\u201d) The food is good. If you go searching for night life, you may wind up feeling like a gringo. And so on.Mr. Hely is best when he veers away from the obligatory. Beware his chapters on anything as Google-ready as the Panama Canal, and look instead for anecdotes about how a guy ought to deal with a competitive hippie guy (inevitable on this route, Mr. Hely says) who\u2019s out to impress the same woman. Hippie guy, almost certainly bare-chested, will say things like \u201cThis isn\u2019t the real Mexico,\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of going back to India.\u201d Mr. Hely\u2019s advice: Don\u2019t take the bait. Chances are good that the woman is en route to a remote cheese-making community and that you\u2019ll never see her again. Let it go.And so off Mr. Hely himself goes, on to the surfers and dangers of Central America. He writes of both the natural beauty and extreme dangers of El Salvador, and the pretension he found at a turtle sanctuary/pelican retreat. He gets to the island of Ometepe, where he does not find the world\u2019s greatest cup of coffee. He riffs on Costa Rica\u2019s much-vaunted awesomeness before getting to Peru, where the drug ayahuasca and the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu command equal amounts of his attention. These are the things he suggests doing upon completing the arduous trip to the high-altitude Machu Picchu: \u201cTake Pictures.\u201d \u201cTake stuff in and out of your backpack.\u201d \u201cExplore.\u201d \u201cFeed an apple to a llama.\u201d Maybe think a little. Gape. And then what? Mr. Hely says his full routine took him only 20 minutes.Getting closer to his goal, if no closer to any form of enlightenment, he reaches Chile and its astoundingly barren Atacama Desert. He is quick to point out that you can spend seven hours there driving past absolutely nothing, and that he did this on a bus playing the film \u201cAustenland\u201d for a group of uncomprehending Chilean miners. Mr. Hely is someone who would find that choice of film more interesting than anything else about his surroundings, except for San Pedro de Atacama, the minuscule oasis at which he finally arrives. By this point, he\u2019s running out the clock and getting better at finding kindred spirits even in the middle of nowhere.This book ends by accomplishing what it meant to: making itself indispensable, even when its author is just plain treading water. Here, for example, are Mr. Hely\u2019s thoughts about a parrot that can say \u201chola\u201d: Why would a parrot speak Spanish? Why would a parrot care? How many languages are spoken by parrots? Is there a parrot that speaks Inuit? Should he train one? And if you think he\u2019s ready to leave it there, you\u2019re dreaming.An earlier version of this review omitted a credit on the picture of Steve Hely; it is by Caleb Beyers.The Wonder TrailTrue Stories From Los Angeles to the End of the WorldBy Steve HelyIllustrated. 311 pages.

Unlike Alphabet\u2019s GV, which is better known for investing in early-stage companies, Google Capital tends to invest in older \u201cgrowth stage\u201d businesses that are looking to expand.But Google Capital has not previously invested in publicly traded companies. Now it is following in the footsteps of investment firms like Silver Lake that have bought preferred shares in publicly traded companies.Care.com was founded in 2007 and went public in early 2014. The company offers customers a range of services that include babysitting, senior care, housekeeping and pet sitting, as well as options to manage taxes for nannies through its HomePay service.To Care.com\u2019s founder and chief executive, Sheila Lirio Marcelo, bringing in Google Capital provides money to help the business expand \u2014 and gain access to what she said were the resources on tap at Google and its parent, Alphabet.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for Care.com,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cThrough Google Capital, we can get access to Google and Alphabet\u2019s experts.\u201dCare.com first became known to Google when the technology company signed up as a customer five years ago. That eventually prompted Laela Sturdy, a partner at Google Capital who was looking to use Care.com\u2019s services, to inquire into investing in the company.\u201cCare.com exemplifies the kind of company that we want to invest in,\u201d Ms. Sturdy said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on growth-stage companies, and really our only criteria is their having Google-sized aspirations.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Google Capital will buy convertible preferred stock in Care.com at a conversion price of $10.50 a share, or 24 percent above Wednesday\u2019s closing price for its common stock. The preferred shares pay an annual interest rate of 5.5 percent.Also, Ms. Sturdy will receive a seat on the board.Connected to Wednesday\u2019s deal, Care.com said that it would buy back 3.7 million shares owned by an early backer, Matrix Partners.

It is one of the single largest investments in a start-up ever, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s 5 percent stake values Uber at $62.5 billion, making it by far the most valuable pre-I.P.O. company in Silicon Valley.But the comparisons don\u2019t end there. For example:\u25a0 At this valuation, Uber is worth $10 billion more than Ford, $20 billion more than General Motors, and twice as much as Tesla. It\u2019s worth more than three times as much as American Airlines, and four times as much as United Airlines. That sounds like a lot, provided Uber someday turns those make-believe values into real ones.\u25a0 Driving from San Francisco to San Jose, the span of the Silicon Valley, costs about $200 on Uber. For the price of its investment, Saudi Arabia could treat its entire population of 31 million to that ride, if folks didn\u2019t mind doubling up. Or one Saudi could just go across Midtown Manhattan 2 billion times. That\u2019s a lot.Admittedly, some of these comparisons are absurd. It is just not entirely clear which ones. If Uber is really changing both transportation and work worldwide, maybe Saudi Arabia just bought into something bigger than we can imagine.

{"Headline": "How to Fix Feminism", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byTo me, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sheer professional survival is as inspiring as any of her other accomplishments. A woman with a small child can easily lose faith that she\u2019ll ever do anything else again. God knows I did. For the first five years of my child-rearing life, I was supposed to be writing a book, but mostly I dodged my editor\u2019s calls. The 3-year-old had separation anxiety, so I waited it out on one of the nursery school\u2019s kid-size chairs. I lacked the heart to say no to play dates, so I shut my computer and attended to juice boxes.Then there was Ladies\u2019 Night, when the mothers on my cul-de-sac got together to drink too much wine. Fun, sure, but really: \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d? The fact that I went every week proved that my professional viability was fast disappearing, or so I thought at the time.How did Mrs. Clinton hold on to hers? How did she rebound from the years in which she was raising a daughter, pursuing a law career and serving as first lady of Arkansas? She has a steely will, as everyone knows. But another answer is that it was in many ways easier to be a working mother in 1980, when Chelsea Clinton was born, than it is today.Between the \u201980s and the aughts, when I had my children, a cloud of economic anxiety descended on parents, tightening what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild has called \u201cthe time bind.\u201d The workweek of salaried professionals ballooned from 40 hours to 50 hours or more, not counting the email catch-up done after the kids\u2019 bedtime. Union protections, predictable schedules and benefits vanished for vast numbers of blue-collar workers. Their jobs in the service or on-demand economies now pay so little, and child care costs so much (168 percent more than it did a quarter-century ago) that parents have to stitch together multiple jobs. Meanwhile, terrified that their offspring will sink even lower, parents siphon off time and money to hand-raise children who can compete in a global economy.Women like me who scale back in the face of impossible expectations feel themselves morphing into caricatures: attachment freaks, helicopter moms, concerted cultivators, neo-traditionalists. These stereotypes are just plain sexist, but I don\u2019t know many mothers whose careers, paychecks and sense of self-worth haven\u2019t been eroded by all the compromises they\u2019ve had to make. Our worlds have narrowed; our bank accounts have dipped below the minimum balance; and our power within the family and the world has dwindled. We\u2019d be quick to tell you that we wouldn\u2019t have done it any differently. Still.What if the world was set up in such a way that we could really believe \u2014 not just pretend to \u2014 that having spent a period of time concentrating on raising children at the expense of future earnings would bring us respect? And what if that could be as true for men as it is for women?We live in an age rich in feminisms. One celebrates our multiplicity of identities: black, lesbian, transgender. Another has effectively anathematized sexual violence. Yet another \u2014 I think of it as C-suite feminism \u2014 chips away at the glass ceiling that keeps women out of the most powerful jobs, such as, say, the presidency.But we need another feminism \u2014 and it needs a name that has nothing to do with gender. Let\u2019s call it, for lack of a better term, \u201ccaregiverism.\u201d It would demand dignity and economic justice for parents dissatisfied with a few weeks of unpaid parental leave, and strive to mitigate the sacrifices made by adult children responsible for aging parents.Mrs. Clinton could be a champion of caregiverism. She has been blunter this electoral season about family-friendly policies than she has ever been before. She emphasized paid family leave when she began her campaign and again in the opening statements of the first Democratic presidential debate. In May, she said she\u2019d cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of a household\u2019s income, down from what, for a household supported by minimum-wage workers, can now be more than 30 percent.But she needs to go further. Her focus is on wage-earners; what about the people who want to get out of the workplace, at least for a while? Mrs. Clinton should talk to Representative Nita Lowey of New York, who last year introduced a bill that would give Social Security credits to caregivers who left the labor market or cut back on hours \u2014 a public nod to the reality that care is work and caregivers merit the same benefits as other workers.Mrs. Clinton belongs to an earlier generation, one whose objective was to free women from the prison of domesticity \u2014 at least the middle-class women who didn\u2019t already have jobs \u2014 and send them marching into the work force to demand equality there. But true equality will take more than equal pay and better working conditions. It will require something more radical, a \u201ctransvaluation of all values,\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s phrase.There is also a venerable tradition in feminist history of trying to overturn a status quo that esteems professionals and wage-earners while demeaning those who do the unpaid or low-paid work of emotional sustenance and physical upkeep. In the 1960s, the largely African-American National Welfare Rights Organization demanded welfare payments that would maintain a decent standard of living, partly on the grounds that these mothers were working already, raising future workers, and partly because they couldn\u2019t find jobs that would support them. \u201cI am 45 years old; I have raised six children,\u201d wrote the group\u2019s chairwoman, Johnnie Tillmon, in 1972. \u201cA job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some 10 million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ve got the best chance of getting one.\u201dAround the same time, the Marxist feminists Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James began a campaign called Wages for Housework that called for the overthrow of a capitalist order subsidized, in their view, by the unpaid slog of homemaking and, yes, sexual services. This did not mean that women should necessarily go out and find jobs. \u201cNot one of us believes that emancipation, liberation, can be achieved through work,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSlavery to an assembly line is not liberation from slavery to a kitchen sink.\u201dLiberal feminists accused them of wanting to push women back into domestic drudgery, but they denied it. \u201cWe have worked enough,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe have chopped billions of tons of cotton, washed billions of dishes, scrubbed billions of floors, typed billions of words, wired billions of radio sets, washed billions of nappies, by hand and in machines.\u201d So what did they want? I asked Silvia Federici, a founder of the New York chapter of Wages for Housework who writes prolifically on these questions. Actual wages for housework aside, she said, the movement wanted to make people ask themselves, \u201cWhy is producing cars more valuable than producing children?\u201dThe program put in place by Bill Clinton in 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, cuts off benefits after five years or less; forces women to hold or look for jobs, whether or not there are any to be had; and allows states to shunt welfare funds into other programs. And so, from 1996 to 2011, the number of families living in extreme poverty \u2014 on $2 per person a day or less \u2014 more than doubled. A majority of those households were headed by single mothers.IN an important new book, \u201cFinding Time,\u201d the economist Heather Boushey argues that the failure of government and businesses to replace the services provided by \u201cAmerica\u2019s silent partner\u201d \u2014 the stay-at-home wife \u2014 is dampening productivity and checking long-term economic growth. A company that withholds family leave may drive away a hard-to-replace executive. Overstressed parents lack the time and patience to help children develop the skills they need to succeed. \u201cToday\u2019s children are tomorrow\u2019s work force,\u201d Ms. Boushey writes. \u201cWhat happens inside families is just as important to making the economy hum along as what happens inside firms.\u201dI had my children at 39 and 40. (Mrs. Clinton was 32.) My 12-year-old daughter is already calculating how soon she\u2019ll have to have children if I\u2019m going to be strong enough to lift them. Younger than I was, I tell her. But she\u2019s bright and ambitious. I could see her going to graduate school.I recently got into an argument with a professor friend about the plausibility of restructuring higher education and the professions so that women \u2014 and men \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have to hustle for positions like partner or associate professor just as they reach peak fertility. Many universities, I said, now stop the tenure clock for a year when assistant professors have children. My friend laughed. A year is nothing when it comes to a baby, she said. She\u2019d never have won tenure if she\u2019d had her son first.I didn\u2019t know what to say. At least she had a child, unlike friends who waited until too late.Here\u2019s a fantasy my daughter and I entertain: What if child-rearing weren\u2019t an interruption to a career but a respected precursor to it, like universal service or the draft? Both sexes would be expected to chip in, and the state would support young parents the way it now supports veterans. This is more or less what Scandinavian countries already do. A mother might take five years off, then focus on her career, at which point the father could put his on pause. Or vice versa.Vice versa was the deal struck by characters on the Danish TV series \u201cBorgen,\u201d a member of Parliament and her husband. He\u2019d schlep and clean for five years; then she\u2019d do the same. (As it turned out, she became prime minister and their marriage went to hell. But that\u2019s a problem few of us would ever have to face.)What really makes the \u201cBorgen\u201d model a mismatch for the United States is that American families, particularly low-income families, can\u2019t do without a double income, given wage stagnation and the cost of children in a country that won\u2019t help parents raise them. But having to work should not be confused with wanting to work, at least not without some stops along the way. \u201cIt takes 20 years, not 12 weeks, to raise a child,\u201d as the feminist legal scholar Joan Williams has written.It\u2019s a little late for me, if not, thank goodness, for my daughter. I fled my cul-de-sac before I should have, in part because I convinced myself that it was becoming a lovely, leafy, azalea-pink prison. City life is great, thank you, but I have regrets. I should have gone on longer rambles with the babies; blown more deadlines; been quicker to heed my son\u2019s demand to \u201csee train\u201d at the nearby station. The articles could have waited; the sight of a little boy clapping as a train squealed to a stop could not. As for Ladies\u2019 Night, it took me a long time to assemble a coterie of mothers as genial and supportive. If I\u2019m ashamed of anything now, it\u2019s how little I appreciated them then.Advertisement"}

Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.That is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominantFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.The move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)Advertisement"}

Since then we have become expert at tapping on the glass of our phones and tablets.While the built-in keyboards from Apple, Google and other device makers are much better than they used to be, they are not the only options available.Gboard, though, has some very nice extras. The space bar doubles as a track pad that lets you scroll the cursor around in text you have already typed.Also, Google has incorporated search features directly into the keyboard.Hit the Google button as you type a message and you are typing in a search box. All of Google\u2019s search results are then accessible, ready to be copied and pasted into the text \u2014 useful in looking up a word definition, checking a street address, or finding a GIF or a YouTube video. You can even search for emoji, which saves you the trouble of hunting manually.Gboard also offers the option to glide-type \u2014 swiping between consecutive letters instead of tapping on the screen \u2014 and many of the app\u2019s features are customizable through settings.SwiftKey also suggests the words you may want to type next so they can be entered with a single keystroke. SwiftKey can even learn your slang and emoji habits.The app does a good job of detecting which language you are using, automatically switching its correction of typos even if you switch languages midmessage (a common weak point of other keyboards\u2019 autocorrect systems, as bilingual typists like me know well).As with Gboard, the space bar doubles as a track pad, and Fleksy has a one-handed typing mode, which is handy if you are carrying something in your other hand.The app\u2019s main feature is that it has customizable keyboard rows, so that particular words or keys can always be available.Swype is still a very good app. It offers many of the same features as its rivals, like predicting the next words to be typed, and lets gestures perform tricks like scrolling back through text that has already been entered. It also has different themes, so its look and feel can be changed. But Swype has not advanced as quickly as its peers in adapting to new trends and offering new features.All the standard keyboard tricks are there \u2014 predictive text, smart autocorrection and glide typing. But Word Flow is one of the best-looking keyboard apps, and its customization options let you place an image behind the keyboard instead of simply colorful themes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Refugees Encounter a Foreign Word: Welcome", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "How Canadian hockey moms, poker buddies and neighbors are adopting Syrians, a family at a time.Supported byTORONTO \u2014 One frigid day in February, Kerry McLorg drove to an airport hotel here to pick up a family of Syrian refugees. She was cautious by nature, with a job poring over insurance data, but she had never even spoken to the people who were about to move into her basement.\u201cI don\u2019t know if they even know we exist,\u201d she said.At the hotel, Abdullah Mohammad\u2019s room phone rang, and an interpreter told him to go downstairs. His children\u2019s only belongings were in pink plastic bags, and the family\u2019s documents lay in a white paper bag printed with a Canadian flag. His sponsors had come, he was told. He had no idea what that meant.When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support, from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. She and her partners had already raised more than 40,000 Canadian dollars (about $30,700), selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a nearby mosque.Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on.For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family\u2019s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. \u201cYou mean we\u2019re leaving the hotel?\u201d Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, \u201cWhat do these people want in return?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,\u201d John McCallum, the country\u2019s immigration minister, said in an interview.In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called \u201cNew Canadians.\u201d The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg\u2019s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper.The fear is that all of this effort could end badly, with the Canadians looking na\u00efve in more ways than one.And volunteers cannot fully anticipate what they may confront \u2014 clashing expectations of whether Syrian women should work, tensions over how money is spent, families that are still dependent when the year is up, disagreements within sponsor groups.Still, by mid-April, only eight weeks after their first encounter with Ms. McLorg, the Mohammads had a downtown apartment with a pristine kitchen, bikes for the children to zip around the courtyard, and a Canadian flag taped to their window. The sponsors knew the children\u2019s shoe sizes; Abdullah and Eman still had keys to Ms. McLorg\u2019s house. He studied the neighborhood\u2019s supermarkets, and his wife took a counseling course so she could help others who had experienced dislocation and loss. When the male sponsors visited, she sat at the dining room table with them instead of eating in the kitchen \u2014 as she would have done back home \u2014 as long as her husband was around, too.Mr. Mohammad searched for the right words to describe what the sponsors had done for him. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve been on fire, and now I\u2019m safe in the water,\u201d he said.But he and other new arrivals were beginning to confront fresh questions: How were they supposed to work with these enthusiastic strangers? What would it mean to reinvent their lives under their watch?As sponsors sign the paperwork that commits them, no one really explains the potential range of their unofficial duties: showing a newcomer to spit in a dentist\u2019s sink by miming the motions, rushing over late at night to calm a war-rattled family terrified by a garage door blown open by the wind, or using Google Translate to tell children who lived through war and exile that they are supposed to wear pink at school for anti-bullying day.One April morning, Liz Stark, the grandmother in chief of another sponsor group, could not find Mouhamad Ahmed, the father in the family. She tried his phone and waited in vain outside their new apartment. This was a problem: Wissam, his wife, was in labor with their fifth child.The pregnancy had been anxious because the couple had lost even more than their old life in Syria, where Mr. Ahmed used to farm wheat, cotton and cumin. They had spent years in a refugee camp in Lebanon, their three children never attending school because tuition was too expensive. Ms. Ahmed became pregnant there with their fourth child, but labor was troubled and the girl lived only six hours. They named her Amira, which means princess.\u201cI was thinking maybe the same thing will happen to me here as well,\u201d Ms. Ahmed said.As Ms. Stark hunted for Mr. Ahmed, Peggy Karas, another sponsor, stayed at the hospital massaging Ms. Ahmed\u2019s hand during contractions. Like other such pairs, the two women had come together through opaque, bureaucratic machinery. A United Nations agency referred Ms. Ahmed and her family to Canadian officials who interviewed and screened them, then passed their file to a new nonprofit dedicated to matching Syrians with private sponsors, who had 24 hours to say yes or no based on the barest of details.Ms. Stark and many of her co-sponsors were retired teachers, bossy and doting, and they had become hellbent on bringing this new child into the world safely. They had introduced Ms. Ahmed to the vitamins she would take, the machines that would monitor her, the hospital ward where she would deliver. The older women had repeated the doctors\u2019 reassurances that all would go smoothly this time. They had helped her pick out tiny outfits and baby gear, but she was too superstitious to take them home, so they formed a small mountain in a sponsor\u2019s living room.Ms. Stark had recruited another newly arrived Syrian refugee to serve as an interpreter during labor. When she finally found Mr. Ahmed, who had been playing soccer, unaware of what was happening, she ushered him to the hospital room, where he took over holding his wife\u2019s hand.Suddenly a medical team rushed her away, saying the umbilical cord was in a dangerous position and she needed an emergency cesarean section. Ms. Ahmed, terrified, asked her husband to take care of their children if she did not survive. As Mr. Ahmed collapsed, sobbing, the sponsors asked his permission to pray.When a nurse finally appeared to say the newborn was healthy, whisked off to intensive care for observation, Ms. Ahmed said she would not believe it until she held the baby, but Mr. Ahmed was jubilant. He called his father in Syria and let him choose a name: Julia, the family\u2019s first Canadian citizen.Once the infant was home, she went from being the Ahmed family member the sponsors worried about most to the one they fretted about least. She would grow up hearing English, going to Canadian preschool and beyond. For her siblings \u2014 10-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, and an 8-year-old brother \u2014 the sponsors found a program for children who had never been to school. Their father, who had gone through only second grade, worked on learning enough English to find a job.Ms. Ahmed worried about her children. \u201cWhat if my kids don\u2019t adjust, don\u2019t settle in school very well?\u201d she asked.Everyone was on a deadline: After one year, the sponsors\u2019 obligation ends, and the families are expected to become self-sufficient. Toronto rents are high, and the Ahmeds may not be able to stay in the relatively inexpensive apartment the sponsors found for them \u2014 the monthly rent is 1,400 Canadian dollars, or about $1,100 \u2014 even if Mr. Ahmed finds a job.Like many sponsors, Ms. Stark believes that her country is especially suited to resettling refugees, with its vast size, strong social welfare system, and a government that emphasizes multiculturalism. Canada has not endured acts of terrorism like the Sept. 11 hijackings or the Paris attacks, or even an assault on the scale of the Orlando nightclub killings. And with only one land border, little illegal immigration and a tenth of the population of the United States, Canada is hungry for migrants. Officials around the country have clamored to bring Syrian refugees to their provinces.\u201cWe are an accident of geography and history,\u201d said Ratna Omidvar, who co-founded Lifeline Syria, a group that matches Syrians with sponsors.Opposition to the influx has been relatively muted. The Conservative Party argues that the country is taking in more refugees than it can provide for, but supports accepting Syrians. Some Canadians complain that the country should take care of its own first, and new chapters of the Soldiers of Odin, a European anti-immigrant group, have cropped up in recent months. A few incidents targeting Syrians \u2014 graffiti reading \u201cSyrians go home and die\u201d at a Calgary school, a pepper spray attack at an event welcoming refugees \u2014 drew widespread condemnation.One May evening, three weeks after Julia\u2019s birth, Ms. Stark stopped by the Ahmeds\u2019 apartment with a plastic table for the balcony and cradled the baby. She had a new grandchild, but she had spent more time with Julia. The cookie-baking retirees were planning a party to welcome her the Syrian way, by feasting on a newly slaughtered lamb on her 40th day. Meanwhile, Mr. Ahmed had adopted a new custom: He sometimes brought his wife breakfast in bed and got the children ready. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw men just doing everything that women do in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought, yeah, of course, I will do the same.\u201dThat night, Ms. Ahmed handed Ms. Stark a form from the twins\u2019 school, unsure what it was about. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to the Blue Jays game?\u201d she crowed to the boy, Majed, who grinned back under his dark curls. Then she turned to his parents. \u201cThis costs money, but your sponsors will pay for it because this is important.\u201dThe Ahmeds were so frugal that their benefactors sometimes worried whether they were buying enough to eat. Ms. Ahmed said they wanted to purchase no more than the family needed. \u201cThe sponsors worked for the money they are giving us, and we\u2019re not just going to throw it in the garbage,\u201d she explained later.Before leaving, Ms. Stark explained the proper Tylenol dosage for the couple\u2019s daughter, Zahiya, who had a fever. She and her twin now spent their school bus rides exchanging language lessons with a pair of Chinese brothers, pointing to objects and naming them. One day when their parents tried to bring them home after a dentist appointment, the Syrian children refused, insisting on returning to school for the time remaining.English words were starting to emerge from the older children\u2019s mouths, but the sponsors and the adult refugees could barely understand one another without help, often relying on mimed gestures or balky translation apps. Even when the groups use interpreters, they often get stuck in roundelays of Canadian and Syrian courtesy, so reluctant to impose that they do not say what they mean. Ms. Ahmed, who had a first-grade education and was not attending English classes because she was home with a newborn, said that not being able to communicate was painful.\u201cSometimes I feel like I am losing my mind,\u201d she said, because she felt so close to the sponsors but could not even tell them little things about the baby.Still, some groups faced greater challenges. Some Syrians have backed out before traveling to Canada, intimidated by the geographic and cultural leap. Sam Nammoura, a refugee advocate in Calgary, said he was tracking dozens of cases in which Syrian-Canadians sponsored friends and relatives and then left them destitute. Other pairings have turned out to be mismatches of expectations; one formerly well-off Syrian family expressed disappointment that its apartment was a second-floor walk-up and lacked a washing machine. Others were shocked to discover that their sponsors were posting Facebook messages and blog entries about them that strangers could read.Even when sponsors and refugees become enmeshed in one another\u2019s lives, they do not fully know one another. Not every family is open about its history, and many sponsors would like to know the worst but do not want to ask. (The Ahmeds and the Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, and were reluctant to publicly share details of their experiences in Syria because they feared reprisals against relatives still there. Most of the refugees in this article left Syria around 2013, during fighting between the Assad regime and rebels.)The sponsors do not share everything about themselves, either. Emma Waverman, the leader of another cluster, was telling her co-sponsors about the stirring bar mitzvah speech her son had written about the Syrians they were aiding when another woman stopped her.\u201cDo they know we\u2019re Jewish?\u201d she asked.Few issues are as delicate as how hard the sponsors should push and when the refugees can say no. Should the Syrians live close to downtown sponsors or in outer-ring neighborhoods with more Middle Easterners \u2014 and is it right for sponsors to decide without consulting them? The Canadians raise tens of thousands of dollars for each newcomer family; who controls how it is spent?Some worry that sponsors are overpowering the refugees with the force of their enthusiasm. Kamal Al-Solaylee, a journalism professor at Ryerson University who is originally from Yemen, said he had noticed a patronizing tone, as when some sponsors highlighted their volunteering on social media. \u201cThe white savior narrative comes into play,\u201d he said.When Muaz and Sawsan Ballani and their 2-year-old son arrived here in February, they seemed so disoriented and alone that their sponsors became especially eager to nurture them. Mr. Ballani, 26, had once worked in his father\u2019s clothing store, which was run out of their home. Now he introduced himself to his sponsors by showing them a picture of his oldest brother: not a smiling snapshot, but an image of the young man lying dead back home, blood streaming from his body. (Mr. Ballani believed that his brother had been caught in fighting between the regime and the opposition, but in the chaos of the conflict, he said, he could not learn more.)Sawsan wed Muaz when she was 16 in an arranged marriage, rushed because of bombings and failing electricity; a month later, they fled. Now 20, she had not seen her family since.The couple had been languishing in Jordan, sleeping in a house crammed with too many people, not enough beds or blankets, and ants that crawled over their son, named Abdulrahman, after Mr. Ballani\u2019s dead brother, and nicknamed Aboudi. One of Mr. Ballani\u2019s brothers was still stuck in the house in Jordan, he said, and his brother\u2019s widow was living in a park in Syria with her three children, foraging for food.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come here, we would have died,\u201d he said.The family\u2019s sponsors started as mostly strangers to one another \u2014 a few former colleagues, a friend of a friend. Helga Breier, a market research consultant and one of the organizers, was drawn into sponsorship last summer, when she felt haunted during her Mediterranean vacation by the suffering across the water.The Ballanis became their galvanizing cause. Together they found a bright apartment near their homes and countered the bareness \u2014 the family had few belongings \u2014 with cheery posters and tags labeling everything in English: lamp, cupboard, wall, door. The couple spoke almost no English, so to teach Mr. Ballani to get where he needed to go, the sponsors helped him photograph the route. When Aboudi threw tantrums in day care, they sat with him so his mother could stay in language class. The couple cooked elaborate Middle Eastern thank-you meals for the sponsors and mostly welcomed their interventions. Mr. Ballani donned a Toronto Maple Leafs hat that he wore day after day, and his wife gamely hopped on a toboggan.Sometimes the sponsors barely hid their views of how the Ballanis should adjust. At a spring potluck dinner, Ms. Ballani described how she had recently traveled by subway on her own, a trip she could not have imagined taking just a few weeks before. The sponsors around the table, firm feminists, asked what else she might like to do herself.She turned to her husband. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you an honest question,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you let me work here?\u201d As they waited for the answer, the Canadian women held their breath.\u201cYes, but I wouldn\u2019t have let you work back\u201d in Jordan, he said, adding that even women who behaved traditionally there were often harassed and that those who appeared too independent faced worse. Ms. Ballani pressed forward: She wanted to attend university and have a career of her own, she said, a daunting set of goals for a woman with only a seventh-grade education. The Canadians beamed; two high-fived each other.At the same time, the sponsors worried that they were becoming helicopter parents, as Ms. Breier put it. When the Syrians skipped English lessons (Aboudi sometimes kept them awake at night) or missed an appointment for donated dental services (a misunderstanding), the sponsors agonized over what to say, debating on the messaging app Slack. Should they show up every morning at the Ballanis\u2019 apartment to make sure they got to class? Aboudi did not nap regularly and seemed to consume a lot of sugar \u2014 he drank soda, sometimes for breakfast \u2014 so should they offer advice?Mr. Nammoura, the refugee advocate in Calgary, said he saw a pattern among the cases. The Canadians, who feel responsible for the refugees\u2019 success, want to give them as much help and direction as possible. But many Syrians, finally safe after years of war and flight, want to exhale before launching into language regimens and job searches, and sometimes feel that sponsors are meddling.When the Ballani sponsors sought advice from an Arab community center caseworker and an older Syrian mother, they were told to be harsher \u2014 to threaten fines or loss of sponsorship if the couple did not accept their guidance. Instead, the sponsors tried to strike a balance, being insistent on issues like health and education but easing off in other areas.A few weeks before Ramadan, the Ballanis raised the prospect of missing school during the month of long fasts. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard because we have to fast 16 or 18 hours,\u201d Muaz Ballani told the sponsors.Ms. Breier and her partners dismissed the idea, saying they feared that the couple would lose their slots if they missed too many classes. The Ballanis quickly relented. It was not clear how much freedom they felt to express disagreement to outsiders; they seemed reluctant to acknowledge anything but gratitude.That morning, Ms. Ballani said she and her husband never had different opinions from the sponsors. \u201cWe\u2019ve never felt like they were telling us what to do,\u201d she added.Another weekend, the extended group gathered for a picnic, the first birthday party anyone had thrown for Mr. Ballani. He was deeply moved by the gesture. \u201cA human life has value here,\u201d he had said in an interview. \u201cYou can feel it everywhere.\u201dBut the conversation at the party turned to his relatives in Syria, and he seemed distant as the Canadians presented his cake. Like many of the newcomers, he regularly receives calls and texts from family members, some in harrowing straits, as news reports describe starvation back home and mass drownings in the Mediterranean.\u201cI am really thankful to them; I don\u2019t want them to misunderstand,\u201d he said later about the sponsors. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m two people at the same time, one happy and one unhappy,\u201d because of his family\u2019s continued suffering.The sponsors had been working on that, too, helping match Mr. Ballani\u2019s brother in Jordan with another Toronto sponsor group and laboring over the paperwork. By late spring they had news: His relatives could arrive by year\u2019s end.Mr. Ballani, overjoyed, started planning what he would show his relatives in the city that had taken him in. This time, he would be the guide.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to help,\u201d he said.Three months after the Mohammads\u2019 awkward first meeting with Kerry McLorg and the other sponsors at the airport hotel, they had clicked into a productive rhythm, settling into Canada faster than anyone had expected.They went on a picnic to Niagara Falls and danced around a maypole at a spring festival. The girls won student-of-the-month honors. Bayan, the eldest, who had whipped past the boys she raced on Jordanian streets, was now beating runners from schools across the city. When the sponsors came to give informal language lessons, Ahmad, the 4-year-old, liked to try new phrases in English, such as \u201cGood job!\u201dStill, there was some culture shock. When Abdullah Mohammad took the children to a community pool, he encountered a woman in a string bikini. \u201cI ran away,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before in my life.\u201dMs. McLorg, measured and methodical, had organized the sponsor group, but the most energetic member was an artist named Susan Stewart, with a seemingly endless list of activities for the family and long email exchanges with the children\u2019s teachers. During her turn to give English lessons, she brought flashcards down to the courtyard, telling the children to alternate between loops on their bicycles and new words. She was sweetly relentless, which was partly why the family had made so much progress, the other sponsors said.When Mr. Mohammad voiced interest in working, Ms. Stewart became consumed with helping him find a job. Of all the tests for the family \u2014 and, by extension, the sponsors \u2014 this was perhaps the most crucial. So Ms. Stewart found an Arabic-speaking settlement counselor to advise Mr. Mohammad and drove him to a job fair for refugees, where they struck up a conversation with a Syrian supermarket owner. After he invited Mr. Mohammad for an interview, Ms. Stewart fashioned a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from a questionnaire she had helped him fill out.\u201cI am keen to learn all aspects of the trade from stocking and organizing shelves to marketing strategies and Canadian shopping habits,\u201d she wrote. Describing his work experience \u2014 doing odd jobs during his three years in Jordan \u2014 she wrote, \u201cAs a refugee I had to be resourceful and find work wherever I could.\u201d Even though the interview would be in Arabic, she drilled him in English phrases like \u201cI can stock shelves.\u201d\u201cTen more times!\u201d she told him as they drove to the interview.When he was offered the part-time position, the sponsors were thrilled. But a few days later, he called the Canadians to say he would turn it down. He struggled with taking money from the sponsors \u2014 back home, others had come to his family for help, and it was \u201creally hard to be on the receiving end,\u201d he said. But he wanted to consider options, such as becoming a mechanic. In Syria or Jordan, he had never had freedom to choose his work. \u201cIt\u2019s always what you have to do to earn a living rather than what you really want to do,\u201d he said later.And he did not want to take a job until he improved his English, he said, because he did not want any more favors or charity. At the supermarket, unable to answer basic questions from customers, \u201cI would be a burden to my employer,\u201d he added. He had been annoyed at Ms. Stewart for pressing so hard, he said later, but mostly he was embarrassed to pass on the job after she had done so much.But Ms. McLorg saw a plus side: Mr. Mohammad was starting to navigate his own path in Canada, and the relationship between the sponsors and the family, so lopsided at the start, was beginning to balance out. \u201cOur job was to help them come into Canada and show them the options that are here,\u201d she said.In mid-May, at the end of a routine meeting with the sponsors and the Mohammads, she shared news of her own: She had breast cancer. Now that she was facing surgery, she was the one who was vulnerable, and the Syrians were the ones who were checking on her.They brought flowers and chocolates; the other sponsors, now practiced in the logistics of caring, offered meal deliveries and other assistance. \u201cI had no intention of building my own support group, but I have one now,\u201d Ms. McLorg said.Bayan and Batoul, the two oldest Mohammad children, made get-well cards using the same set of watercolors the sponsors had used to make greeting signs that first day at the airport hotel. The morning after Ms. McLorg\u2019s operation, when she made her way down to her living room, the cards were the first things she saw.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the surname of two of Muaz Ballani\u2019s sponsors. They are David Dennis and David Dennis Jr., not David Scrivener and David Scrivener Jr.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s White Guy Problem", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionACCORDING to some prominent voices in the tech world, artificial intelligence presents a looming existential threat to humanity: Warnings by luminaries like Elon Musk and Nick Bostrom about \u201cthe singularity\u201d \u2014 when machines become smarter than humans \u2014 have attracted millions of dollars and spawned a multitude of conferences.But this hand-wringing is a distraction from the very real problems with artificial intelligence today, which may already be exacerbating inequality in the workplace, at home and in our legal and judicial systems. Sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are being built into the machine-learning algorithms that underlie the technology behind many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems that shape how we are categorized and advertised to.This is fundamentally a data problem. Algorithms learn by being fed certain images, often chosen by engineers, and the system builds a model of the world based on those images. If a system is trained on photos of people who are overwhelmingly white, it will have a harder time recognizing nonwhite faces.The reason those predictions are so skewed is still unknown, because the company responsible for these algorithms keeps its formulas secret \u2014 it\u2019s proprietary information. Judges do rely on machine-driven risk assessments in different ways \u2014 some may even discount them entirely \u2014 but there is little they can do to understand the logic behind them.At the very least, this software risks perpetuating an already vicious cycle, in which the police increase their presence in the same places they are already policing (or overpolicing), thus ensuring that more arrests come from those areas. In the United States, this could result in more surveillance in traditionally poorer, nonwhite neighborhoods, while wealthy, whiter neighborhoods are scrutinized even less. Predictive programs are only as good as the data they are trained on, and that data has a complex history.Regardless, algorithmic flaws aren\u2019t easily discoverable: How would a woman know to apply for a job she never saw advertised? How might a black community learn that it were being overpoliced by software?We need to be vigilant about how we design and train these machine-learning systems, or we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.Like all technologies before it, artificial intelligence will reflect the values of its creators. So inclusivity matters \u2014 from who designs it to who sits on the company boards and which ethical perspectives are included. Otherwise, we risk constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society, with its old, familiar biases and stereotypes.If we look at how systems can be discriminatory now, we will be much better placed to design fairer artificial intelligence. But that requires far more accountability from the tech community. Governments and public institutions can do their part as well: As they invest in predictive technologies, they need to commit to fairness and due process.While machine-learning technology can offer unexpected insights and new forms of convenience, we must address the current implications for communities that have less power, for those who aren\u2019t dominant in elite Silicon Valley circles.But for those who already face marginalization or bias, the threats are here.Advertisement"}

Lionsgate closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3 billion.A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Many details were being ironed out, and the talks could still falter.If an agreement is reached, it would be the end of a long road for Starz, which has been the subject of merger speculation for three years, since being spun off from the Liberty Media empire controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone.It also would be the latest instance of consolidation in the media industry.Starz, run by the former HBO executive Chris Albrecht, has become one of the country\u2019s top premium TV networks with hits like \u201cOutlander\u201d and \u201cPower.\u201dThe channel has surpassed Showtime to become the second-biggest premium cable TV network in the country with an estimated 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan.

Starz could help lock in an outlet for Lionsgate\u2019s TV productions, providing ballast for a sometimes volatile movie business.Starz fielded multiple takeover bids, according to the person briefed on the matter.

It was 10:07 a.m. on April 25; I Googled to make sure, before I filed this review, that she was still alive. She was. Her \u201conc doc\u201d gave her a year in April 2015, which meant, if she survived another seven days, she would technically beat the projections. She did not. She died on the morning of April 28, 2016.Diski, as she makes vitally clear in her new memoir, \u201cIn Gratitude,\u201d spent her every moment on earth beating the projections of authority figures. She overcame abusive and neglectful parents, foster homes, suicide attempts, repeated hospitalizations and the persistently gloomy conviction of relatives, caregivers, teachers, doctors and occasionally herself that she would fail at whatever she attempted.In September 2014, two months after the diagnosis, Diski began publishing essays in The London Review of Books about her illness and impending death. She was more than wary of the maudlin pitfalls (even she expressed disbelief at her choice to write \u201canother [expletive] cancer diary\u201d); as a result, her monthly testimonies are droll and uncertain and disobey time and, like memory itself, circle obsessively back to moments she finds most difficult to emotionally process, such as the realization that she will never see her small grandchildren \u201cbecome their own people.\u201dDiski also began publishing essays about her quasi-\u00adadoption by (and subsequent decades-long relationship with) the Nobel Prize-winning writer Doris Lessing. \u201cIn Gratitude\u201d collects like metal filings around these two magnetic points \u2014 the functional end of Diski\u2019s life as a writer, and the functional beginning of it, due to Lessing\u2019s \u201crush into kindness\u201d and mentorship.While her sections about cancer offer unruly testimonies to sickness and dying (and, frankly, living), it\u2019s in the sections about Lessing where Diski\u2019s idiosyncratic mind \u2014 and her bravery as a human confronting both imminent obliteration as well as certain vexing questions that, years later, she\u2019s still rolling around in her head \u2014 is most potently on display.Because of course the \u201cin gratitude\u201d of the book\u2019s title contains, with one tap of the delete key, its negation. Diski riskily interrogates the ingratitude lurking beneath her feelings toward Lessing \u2014 the aristocratic savior (of the Communist-Sufi-literary variety) to her Dickensian waif. Diski was a classmate of Lessing\u2019s son Peter, who urged his mother to invite Diski, 15 at the time and in a mental institution, to live with them.Diski accepted Lessing\u2019s invitation and was tossed into a stimulating melee of writers and activists (among those at the Lessing dinner table were Ted Hughes and R.D. Laing). Yet she struggled with \u201ca substantial amount of anger at having to be grateful, the gratitude ever increasing, the bill never settled, and made more enraging by Doris\u2019s insistence that I wasn\u2019t to feel it.\u201d Lessing, to her credit, practiced what she preached \u2014 just stop being emotional, she was known to advise. Also known about Lessing: She had left two young children in Southern Rhodesia when she moved to London with Peter to pursue her dream of becoming a writer.\u201cIn Gratitude\u201d stalks a particular early moment in Diski\u2019s relationship with Lessing. Diski, who had been shunted between various institutions since birth, who knew too well \u201cthe fearful feeling of privation when your time as part of a system runs out,\u201d was terrified of being kicked out of this new system as well. She bumblingly confronted Lessing one night: \u201cI wanted to know if she liked me, and what on earth could be done if she didn\u2019t.\u201dLessing reacted badly. The next morning, Diski found a letter from Lessing, accusing her of emotional blackmail.Diski is not condemning Lessing for her behavior. She is seeking, in these final moments of her own life, the fullest possible understanding of a woman who represented, despite her prickliness and remove, the closest thing she had to a family. Diski courageously and persistently speaks what many might deem unspeakable. She tries to comprehend Lessing\u2019s ability to leave two children on a continent so far away she was guaranteed never to know or even much to see them. \u201cI get the need to flee, but no matter how I try to put myself in her place, I am perplexed by her emotional ability actually to do it.\u201dBut Diski always lets Lessing respond from the grave. To the contention that she, Diski, could never imagine leaving her own daughter in order to \u201cfulfill her promise\u201d \u2014 \u201cDoris would say, I think, that I was lucky I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d Diski proves again and again her spectacular originality in her ability to empathize with as well as profess a total failure to comprehend the mind of another human being. These pages are evidence of her undiminished aptitude, even while her body was on the wane, to vigorously inhabit and investigate emotional spaces that shift and change shape as her sentences accrue.While I couldn\u2019t read \u201cIn Gratitude\u201d without a persistent lump in my throat, and without the persistent awareness that its author was in a bed, somewhere, experiencing the very last days or hours or minutes of her life, Diski\u2019s final book proves transcendently disobedient, the most existence-affirming and iconoclastic defense a writer could mount against her own extinction.Heidi Julavits is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Folded Clock.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Researchers Give Them a Low Rating", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionA small Italian place in a strip mall across the bay from San Francisco, Botto is just a few miles from my house. The other night, I packed up the family and headed off for dinner.The attitude is a little brusque. \u201cWe have no ice, no butter, no ranch, no lemon,\u201d a sign behind the counter warns. \u201cWe charge for bread. We charge for everything.\u201dGive Botto five stars for undermining Yelp. The bistro did not want to be reviewed and let itself be subject to the whims of people with no names but plenty of opinions. But Yelp doesn\u2019t allow businesses to opt out.Some shady outfits try to load the dice by buying favorable reviews, but Botto went in the other direction. It asks people to trash it. When we left, the co-owner and chef, Davide Cerretini, gave me a sticker that said, \u201cI gave Botto one star on Yelp.\u201d If I did that, my next pizza would be half price.The restaurant has been fighting Yelp in earnest for nearly two years now. More than half of its 250 reviews are one-star. Mr. Cerretini seems to enjoy the game. \u201cIt may sound to you like a suicide mission, but our business is up,\u201d he said.If Botto\u2019s critical notices on Yelp are often written to be outrageous and unbelievable (\u201cthe pizza arrived at the table with a dead rat under the cheese\u201d), they also reflect the confused state of reviewing on the internet. Even as researchers are finding that reviews are less reliable, more people are relying on them. On Yelp alone, the number of reviews now exceeds 100 million.But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results.Bart de Langhe, an assistant professor of marketing at Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, used to see numerical reviews online and accept them implicitly. Then, when his son was born three years ago, he needed to buy a car seat. Mr. de Langhe noticed that the seat rated lowest by Consumer Reports got a high rating on Amazon, and the one rated highest by Consumer Reports received a low rating on Amazon.The more popular seat on Amazon was also more expensive. Were reviewers, he wondered, paying more attention to things like price and brand than the objective, measurable ability of the seat to protect its occupant? With two other researchers, Philip Fernbach and Donald Lichtenstein, Mr. de Langhe began a study that compared online reviews for items like air-conditioners and car batteries with the evaluations in Consumer Reports.In other words, the consumer saw a number \u2014 4.6 stars out of 5 \u2014 and took it much more seriously than it merited.Nearly half the time, Amazon reviewers and the Consumer Reports experts disagreed about which item in a random pair was better. Moreover, average user ratings did not predict resale value in the used-product marketplace, another traditional indicator of quality.Julie Law, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said \u201cAmazon customer reviews reflect the feedback, tastes and concerns of real customers, not professional reviewers. That\u2019s what makes them powerful.\u201d She also said the company was now giving more weight to the most recent helpful reviews from purchases that were verified.Mr. de Langhe stuck with this recommendation: \u201cYou should rely much less on reviews than you currently do.\u201dThe store also carried some novels that are either self-published or from small publishers, and these often seemed to receive better ratings than the classics. Tamara Lyon\u2019s \u201cPost-Traumatic Brazilian Wax Syndrome,\u201d in which an interior designer named Bristow Sparks tries to regroup after colliding with a park bench on a first date and suffering other disasters, got 4.7 stars.In an email from Stockholm, where he is now living, Mr. Nasser said the praises were an embarrassment of riches.\u201cHonestly, I wish \u2018Home Is a Fire\u2019 had received more three- and four-star reviews, in order to balance out the final result, because I think the sequel, \u2018The Fire Went Wild,\u2019 is a much better book,\u201d he wrote.In any case, Mr. Nasser said his book was not comparable to the classic books with lower ratings. \u201cAbsolutely not, and I would never imply that in any way,\u201d he said.Although that is exactly what anyone strolling through the store would think. Ms. Law of Amazon said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything here that needs to be fixed.\u201dThe problem with reviews and ratings, said Joseph Reagle Jr., author of \u201cReading the Comments: Likers, Haters and Manipulators at the Bottom of the Web,\u201d is that we have elevated them to supreme importance.\u201cThey have always been somewhat subjective, arbitrary, capricious, befuddling, and bemusing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what\u2019s different is that we forget this is the case, particularly given the sheen of big data and quantification.\u201dSix months or so after Botto Bistro began trolling Yelp, the review site blinked. While it did not bend on the restaurant \u2014 a Yelp spokeswoman said Botto was simply cheating itself out of customers \u2014 the site reportedly began exploring offers to sell itself.So does Botto. If you dig on Yelp, you will find reviewers who said they genuinely were not impressed, which is about where I fell. An adequate pizza, a good salad and a beer were $46, not including the minimum \u201csuggested gratuity\u201d of 18 percent \u2014 which, considering this is a place where you set your own table and pick up your food from the counter, was rather aggressive.I\u2019d write a review saying all this, but I doubt it would do any good.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ingress Has the World as Its Game Board", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionPOINT BONITA, Calif. \u2014 On a chilly Monday afternoon in May, just before the lighthouse here closed for the rest of the week, the three Ingress players met and hustled across the metal bridge to the 19th-century landmark.To remedy the error, the gamers had to ignore a park ranger\u2019s remonstrations and linger past closing time. They managed to flip the lighthouse back to Resistance hands, although an attempt to create a virtual link to another landmark in Hawaii was blocked by the opposing team, which was unable to get anyone to the lighthouse but spotted the activity on the game\u2019s scanner.This blend of real-world, multiplayer interaction and complex digital strategy sets Ingress apart from other mobile games. Nodding to childhood pastimes like Capture the Flag as well as to vast online simulations like World of Warcraft, Ingress is one of the first popular games built using augmented reality, a technology that overlays virtual objects onto the real world.The back story of Ingress involves mysterious aliens that are sending exotic matter to Earth via portals like fountains, public buildings and landmarks. Players choose to join the Enlightened team, which believes the exotic matter is beneficial to humanity, or the Resistance, which distrusts the aliens and is fighting their influence.To take most actions in the game, players must physically visit the portals. More elaborate actions, such as connecting portals to build an energy field, require many players to work together in a coordinated fashion.The focus on physical places in both games is deliberate. John Hanke, Niantic\u2019s chief executive, joined Google in 2004, when his start-up, Keyhole, was acquired by the search giant and became the basis of Google Earth. After refining Google\u2019s mapping products over the next seven years or so, Mr. Hanke and his team began pondering what else could be done with the map.\u201cEveryone is spending all this time inside, by their computers. No one goes to the local parks,\u201d Mr. Hanke said in an interview at Niantic\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cWe wanted to do something that was aspirational: Let\u2019s get people outside.\u201dMr. Harman, a data architect who goes by the nickname Auros, frequently hops on his bicycle in the evening to take action on portals in his Silicon Valley neighborhood. And last September, he hiked high into the California back country with his spouse and a friend to recapture enemy-controlled portals in Kerrick Meadow near Yosemite National Park. The location was so remote that they had to use a satellite modem to connect to the internet and get access to the game.Ms. Jensen, a learning coach, said she had made many new friends playing Ingress and visited her 10,000th portal in Paris in April 2015, using the locations in the game as a guidebook to the city. \u201cI saw way more of Paris than most people do,\u201d she said.Niantic also sponsors large Ingress events every quarter, most recently at the end of May, when gamers gathered for operations in nine communities, including Brooklyn; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Cape Town; Tainan, Taiwan; Padua, Italy; and Manila.Ingress players, whose repeated visits to a single location can look suspicious, say they are sometimes questioned by officials, such as park rangers or police officers. But once the officials learn about the game, they often join in.\u201cWe have a fair number of cops who are players,\u201d Mr. Hanke said.Mr. Hanke declined to discuss Niantic\u2019s finances, although the company earns some revenue from sponsorships. One of the game\u2019s most powerful shields, for example, is named after the Axa insurance company. Niantic also allows companies to sponsor their stores in the game, which Lawson and SoftBank do in Japan.In addition, Niantic makes money from hosting player gatherings, selling virtual items in the game, and peddling mementos like posters, T-shirts and e-books. The company is exploring an Ingress television show. And a successful Pok\u00e9mon Go would bring in additional revenue streams.Mr. Hanke said that Ingress was intended not just to entertain, but also to help people explore the world they live in.\u201cPart of the joy of the game is going off the beaten path,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not about being strapped in a couch in \u2018The Matrix.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of a photo caption with this article misspelled the surname of the person shown. He is R.M. Harman, not Harmon. An earlier version of this article misspelled the code name used by Mr. Harman. It is OninekoKin, not OninekoKim.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Lydia\u2019s Week in Tech: Twitter Woes and a More Wary Political Class", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byBitsOne of the juiciest details: To satisfy Wall Street\u2019s desire for higher user numbers, Twitter goosed activity on the site by sending lapsed users an email claiming that there might be something wrong with their accounts. They log on to fix the problem and voil\u00e0 \u2014 they\u2019re counted as active users!Do you use Snapchat? I see its appeal, but I spend so much time on Twitter that I haven\u2019t really had time to cultivate this new place to waste time. So basically I\u2019m spending all my goofing-off energy on the wrong platform. And I gather you are, too? Boy, we media people sure know how to pick \u2018em.Sure, there are exceptions like the Gawker-hunter and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who is a Trump delegate, but for the most part, Mr. Trump turns people in the Valley off. HP Inc. also said this week that it would not contribute financially to the Republican National Convention.Mr. Trump has attacked Apple, Facebook and Amazon, so his unpopularity in Silicon Valley is no surprise. But David\u2019s report also suggested that Hillary Clinton, who hasn\u2019t really championed the tech industry in her run, is also greeted with mild skepticism here. In the Obama era, tech companies have been revered \u2014 Google has easy access to the White House, and many Obama staff members have gone to work for the tech industry. But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically. So I wonder: Is that good?Don\u2019t you think that the tech skepticism among the major candidates reflects the bloom coming off the tech rose in general, and a yearning for a pre-internet era when everyone had good jobs and the future seemed so bright?We\u2019ve long feared that technology would eat our jobs, but platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit offer a dystopian look at what a future of fragmented employment might actually look like. And with wages and jobs at the center of much of the campaign for both Democrats and Republicans, there isn\u2019t much to love there. Data breaches scare the bejesus out of everyone. And in an anti-establishment moment, it has become clear that tech has matured into the establishment.Anyway, great to chat with you, Lydia. See you on Twitter!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dev Hynes: New York\u2019s Last Bohemian on the City and His New Album", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byIt can seem that there\u2019s not an inch of New York \u2014 not a block, not a scene, not a cultural ecosystem \u2014 where Mr. Hynes, the 30-year-old singer-songwriter-producer, hasn\u2019t left a footprint. To many, the city is an unsolvable puzzle. For some, comprehension is possible, but only from a distance. Fluency, though, is something that\u2019s in short supply. New York has always been a city of secrets, but some people seem to know all of them.One recent night, Mr. Hynes was sitting in DeSalvio Playground in NoLIta, nibbling on a peanut butter cookie as the sun began to shrug. It\u2019s a small spit of a park, the sort of place you might walk right past without noticing. But not Mr. Hynes. \u201cI\u2019m in this playground a lot, actually,\u201d he said enthusiastically. This tiny corner is his, too.That sort of engagement feels almost antiquated, a product of an older time when place was something close to destiny. That\u2019s no longer the case. It is less essential than ever, in this time of easy mobility of ideas and internet-driven transnational fame, for an artist to identify with one spot in the world. To be, in essence, local.But every so often, an artist becomes part of the city\u2019s tapestry \u2014 not high nor low, mainstream nor underground. Just there. Mr. Hynes\u2019s ubiquity has become a fact of 2010s New York. To follow him on Snapchat \u2014 he was a natural at self-documentation in the medium, right up until the moment this month when his account was hacked, then deleted \u2014 is to see an artist endlessly fascinated with this city\u2019s many crevices.A committed cultural citizen, he stands out among the New York musicians of his generation. Mr. Hynes\u2019s modern bohemianism feels like a holdover from an earlier time, more reminiscent of the uptown-downtown cross-pollination of the early 1980s, or how Lou Reed bridged proto-punk and art, or how Warhol\u2019s Factory took in the outcasts from all the city\u2019s scenes and gave them a home.His cultural life is broad and fluid, a throwback to when New York culture was less professionalized, more intimate and less segmented. \u201cFreetown Sound\u201d suggests a conversation with the city, navigating a host of styles while weaving in vocal snippets of local characters, from KRS-One to Ta-Nehisi Coates.Mr. Hynes moved here from London, where he was born and raised, at 21, already a few years deep into making music (then, as part of the band Test Icicles, and as a solo artist under the alias Lightspeed Champion). \u201cI was reading books about New York, like \u2018Please Kill Me,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the punk history. \u201cI was super-inspired from it. When I came here, I was still always just pulling from the city.\u201dA history buff with an itchy Google finger, he owns a bookshelf full of titles about the city, which is his muse and text. He takes long walks, stumbles on things, gets curious, then goes and looks them up. (In Washington Square Park, he\u2019s apt to give an impromptu lecture about the arches.)Then he carries the history with him, to use as inspiration, and sometimes as source material: \u201cI like the idea of these actual physical hubs, and what\u2019s happened on those streets over time \u2014 there\u2019s almost ghosts, traces of what\u2019s been happening.\u201dAnd so Mr. Hynes makes the city his own. His cohort of collaborators and friends includes musicians, yes, but also dancers, writers, artists and at least one lampshade designer. He plays soccer in public parks and basketball in a court at a West Village public school (in a loose league that was begun many years ago by the Beastie Boys, no less). He hosted a benefit for a Harlem music school at the Apollo Theater. He plays small, intimate shows at bookstores, like one for a book release for the artists Alex Da Corte and Jayson Musson, and provides scores for art installations at the Knockdown Center in Queens and elsewhere. When friends like Florence Welch have concerts, he goes.But he\u2019s also willing to follow his curiosity \u2014 a combination of a restless artistic imagination and a belief in the New York mythos. When he wants to see a ballet recital, he buys tickets. \u201cThere\u2019s not, like, a special list,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on the website buying like everyone else.\u201dAnd like anyone who\u2019s lived in New York long enough to have a mental map that corresponds to his or her life, he has his own landmarks: the East Village block where his old apartment burned in a fire that took all of his possessions and his dog; Chelsea, where he had a studio a couple of years ago, in which he\u2019d worked with the pop singer Carly Rae Jepsen, and which he left because \u201ca fashion company wanted to use the space as storage.\u201d Until recently, he had space in a walk-up office/studio on St. Marks Place that served as a communal hangout for friends, a recording space and a 24-hour pied-\u00e0-terre for creative exhalation. His preferred watering hole is the Fat Cat, a plain jazz bar in the West Village where he enjoys unwinding at the Ping-Pong table with his musician friends. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hidden gem,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that it\u2019s either old people or students and there\u2019s no real in between. On the weekends sometimes you\u2019ll get, maybe, like an office group.\u201dThis is Mr. Hynes\u2019s New York, elegant and mundane all at once. But even now, after almost a decade here, he said he doesn\u2019t quite feel full ownership of the city, but rather sees it as \u201csome kind of cool big brother that you\u2019re kind of watching. They go out the door and you don\u2019t quite know where they\u2019ve gone, where they\u2019re going, what they\u2019re doing, but it seems cool. It\u2019s half protectiveness, half aspiration.\u201dWhich is why, when the opportunity presents itself to leave, as it often does, for touring, Mr. Hynes rarely takes the bait. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird for me to take time out of my life,\u201d he said, half-apologetic. For him, New York is home, and nourishment, and purpose. If he spent more time on the road, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be me.\u201dDev Hynes will release \u201cFreetown Sound,\u201d his third album as Blood Orange, on Friday, July 1. It\u2019s his most accomplished one yet, with the sweet romanticism and austere cool of new wave cut through with slashes of emotional, social and political sorrow. Here are edited excerpts from a conversation with him.In what ways does your fascination with New York come out in your music, especially on this album?A lot of the music I make, it\u2019s music for me to listen to on headphones to soundtrack me just walking around. I get moods walking down streets that I think sound good in a certain way. What\u2019s happened slowly over the last few years, instead of writing music that I pictured in certain parts of New York, now those parts of New York are actually in the music.You make street recordings?On an iPhone. Like, Houston and First at different times of the day. \u201cAugustine\u201d has this audio from Broadway. Some of it loops \u2014 if you pay attention to \u201cAugustine,\u201d then \u201cBetter Numb,\u201d you can hear it\u2019s the same motorbike going by, the same person saying something. There\u2019s a lot of audio from Washington Square Park. One of my favorites is in \u201cWith Him\u201d and also \u201cSquash Squash\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s audio from Central Park. There was an opera singer, a female tenor under the bridge singing some Puccini piece, and also in the distance there was a saxophone player. I wrote a saxophone part that can lead from that.This album has a lot of pastiche, but also the most melodically direct songs you\u2019ve released.Even though this album is more complex as a whole, I think each song is way simpler than my older songs. I was aware that I was going to be asking a lot of people anyway, so I wanted it to be digestible. I\u2019m always trying to make my melodies as direct as possible. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m attempting to do.Is part of what you enjoy about working with female pop artists that they can go places you might not?It\u2019s half that, and it\u2019s half I don\u2019t know how! I was working with Carly Rae Jepsen again last week, and I love working with her because we can\u2019t do what each other do. She\u2019s such a pro. I\u2019m aware of what I\u2019m doing but I wouldn\u2019t know how to make a song that sounds like \u201cSorry\u201d or whatever \u2014 my brain just doesn\u2019t go there.How literal is your songwriting?A lot of my songs sound like love songs, and they\u2019re usually really not. \u201cBut You\u201d is interesting. It\u2019s actually about walking down a street, and me trying to work out what to do, say, if there\u2019s like a young blond girl in front of me, and we\u2019re the only ones on the street, and it\u2019s me trying not to scare her walking \u2014 trying to work out if I should cross the road, if I should walk faster and try to speed past \u2014 but it\u2019s kind of told through this shield.So woven into these melodies is a the difficulties of living in a black body in a white society. Did you ever want to make a straightforward agit-pop album?What work have you done that\u2019s most political?Maybe the first Lightspeed [Champion] album. It dealt with a lot of similar themes, like being black in a particularly white world. At the time no one particularly noticed. If that came out now with that political content, I think people would associate me with it more. The album was mainly about being a weird black kid, 80 percent of it. That is closest lyrically to this one.What artists do you feel kinship with on these topics?I would say Le1f. Kelela \u2014 the stuff she\u2019s been working on now is really similar. Solange, of course. I really love Elysia Crampton. It\u2019s kind of intense \u2014 there\u2019s no vocals in it, but it still deals with being displaced. She\u2019s transgender and dealing with being herself in this world. But you can feel it. And then there\u2019s people that I look up to, like Kendrick.Do you feel those messages, explicit or implicit, are more in tune with this political and social moment?It sounds like you are decentering your voice on this album. I\u2019m wondering about that as deliberate aesthetic strategy, but also as a psychological strategy.I definitely am always subconsciously and sometimes consciously trying to step back and let other things take center stage. I can only relate things to sports. It\u2019s basically like, when I play soccer, I\u2019m midfield, sometimes I\u2019m like, left wing, and I enjoy it. Every now and then, I want to like maybe play striker.

{"Headline": "Tekserve, Precursor to the Apple Store, to Close After 29 Years", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byIt was the Apple Store in New York City before there was such a thing as an Apple Store.Before iPods and iPads and iPhones, before Apple started selling and servicing its devices out of a glass cube on Fifth Avenue, the eclectic Tekserve store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan was where customers went for upgrades to their PowerBook laptops or to have their computers fixed.But times have changed, Tekserve\u2019s managers said, and on Wednesday, they announced that the company was closing its retail and customer-service operation. The service center will remain open until July 31, and the retail store will close on Aug. 15. About 70 employees will lose their jobs, the company said.\u201cThis is a cultural shift,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Jerry Gepner, said in an interview in his office above the store. \u201cIt\u2019s not a failure of the business. It\u2019s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.\u201dTekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve\u2019s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. \u201cIt was the cult of Mac,\u201d said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer.He said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. \u201cIt was also a gathering place,\u201d Mr. Gepner said, \u201cwhere knowledge was shared.\u201dWhile Apple\u2019s own stores are sleek and modern in appearance, Tekserve had the feel of a throwback, its shelves lined with old-fashioned radios and a soda machine where customers could grab a chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle. There was also a \u201cmuseum\u201d of Apple computers, with models dating back more than three decades, including a Macintosh 128K \u2014 the original Apple Macintosh personal computer \u2014 signed by Stephen Wozniak, the company\u2019s co-founder.These days, though, Apple has six stores in Manhattan, including one in Chelsea, not far from Tekserve. There is also a Best Buy store just on the other side of Sixth Avenue from Tekserve. And then there are the options online.Resellers like Tekserve, once among the few places where customers could get Apple products, have been the victims of the technology company\u2019s growth. But also, Tekserve said in a statement, swiftly rising rent has not helped.Mr. Gepner said that when he joined Tekserve in 2014, the owners asked him to see whether the diminishing retail operation could be saved. But, he said, the owners realized that a turnaround seemed unlikely. \u201cFor us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe trend wasn\u2019t going to reverse.\u201dTalk of the store\u2019s closing had circulated for weeks among neighbors and regular customers. Employees were officially told on Wednesday that the end was imminent.\u201cWe love our customers, and we love what we do,\u201d Mr. Gepner said. \u201cBut there comes a point where that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.\u201dThe company will continue with its corporate sales and professional services, as well as with an operation focused on small- and medium-size businesses, an area that has experienced growth, Mr. Gepner said.Outside the store on Wednesday afternoon, word had not yet reached many customers, who said they were disappointed. Alan Wolk said he had been coming to Tekserve for about 15 years, including once to repair a keyboard damaged by spilled coffee.\u201cIt\u2019s been here forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys, they know their stuff. You can trust them.\u201dKerry Elson said she first came to Tekserve about a decade ago, when she was still working as an intern and trying to figure out how to use a new computer. She kept coming because she trusted those who worked there.\u201cI feel like this is my go-to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed like they were on your side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By contrast, established sites like YouTube have sophisticated processes to monitor user-generated content.Rohit Agarwal, the general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, the company\u2019s education unit, said the company was looking into how the materials in question came to be uploaded on the site.\u201cOur team is doubling down and investigating what the root cause is,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said in an interview on Tuesday evening at the annual conference of the International Society for Technology in Education, attended by about 16,000 educators in Denver. \u201cWe will do what is appropriate to respond to the results of the investigation.\u201dAmazon Inspire is a major step by the company to gain market share in an education tech landscape where rivals like Apple, Google and Microsoft have already established footholds.

Mr. Agarwal said that users were not supposed to upload copyrighted materials and that the site had a process in place to quickly take down items that were the subjects of such complaints.But it may be more difficult than Amazon executives realized for the site\u2019s users to distinguish between open educational resources and copyrighted works.\u201cEven with all the safeguards in place, you have the ability to have someone upload a resource that violates a copyright,\u201d Mr. Agarwal conceded.\u201cIt takes tremendous work to create engaging and rigorous educational resources,\u201d said Adam Freed, the chief executive of Teacher Synergy, the company behind teacherspayteachers.com. \u201cSo we understand the concerns from our TeachersPayTeachers community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Challenges of Closing the Digital Divide", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionWASHINGTON \u2014 United States history is marked by modernization efforts aimed at leaving no one behind. In the 1930s, it was lighting up farmsteads with electricity. In the 1950s, it was paving highways to every town. Today, the federal government is trying to bring broadband, which it considers a utility, to an estimated 33 percent of residents who don\u2019t have the service.We sat with Ms. Clyburn, a former public utilities commissioner from South Carolina, to discuss the challenges of closing the digital divide.Q: What do we know about the people who aren\u2019t able to obtain access to or afford broadband? Many people who may not have broadband lines into their home get online through their phones. Perhaps we should view smartphone access as an imperfect substitute?They are complements but not substitutes because there are certain things that can\u2019t be done on smartphones. Look, if we have seen 45 states with frameworks where one in five public assistance programs are online, you need full access to the internet. The opportunity of a fixed broadband connection is so much greater, by way of speeds, the ability to fill out all forms and transfer files.This also affects low-income consumers in particular with 7.8 million low-income consumers who only have access through their mobile device. There are limitations with what you can do on your smartphone, and 48 percent lose coverage over the course of their contract because they can\u2019t afford it at some point. So they are getting counted for having broadband on their phones but they don\u2019t have continual coverage.Why aren\u2019t people adopting internet when it is available to them? Is it just cost? I\u2019ve seen surveys citing skepticism over the relevance of the internet.What is the definition of relevance? And relative to what? I think someone who doesn\u2019t adopt may not admit to you that they have some type of challenge in digital literacy. They may say they don\u2019t need it when the real answer may be that they aren\u2019t comfortable with a keyboard or mouse. Where do you see the biggest problems?There isn\u2019t incentive for carriers to go into low-income areas where they may not make as much money. How do you balance their business concerns with your public interest concerns?Urban areas are more difficult from where I sit. In rural areas, people get the business issues and we have things like the Connect America Fund so money can flow to rural areas that cost more to serve.When you have dense urban areas, where on paper things seem to be working as far as the infrastructure being there, it\u2019s more difficult to solve the problems.Let\u2019s take D.C. Across the street from my home is what people would call a public housing complex. Their world is completely different from mine. We are on the same block. And I guarantee you there is an affordability component that will prevent many of them from regular connectivity. Too many of us don\u2019t have the sensitivity of that and say things like \u201cthese people can go to the library to get online.\u201dWhat is your opinion of cities trying to create their own municipal broadband networks? You are being sued by internet service providers for your rules that support municipal broadband.We are waiting for a decision from courts but I won\u2019t tiptoe in saying I have been supportive of local communities. If they have reached out to their logical incumbent I.S.P. and if they aren\u2019t getting what they need from those incumbents and they have the means to build their own infrastructure, I will be supportive of them.I\u2019ve been interested in how you\u2019ve used mergers to help bridge the divide. With Charter\u2019s merger with Time Warner Cable, the F.C.C. required the company to create a low-income service and to extend its footprint to two million more homes.Every merger should push forward the goals and aspirations of connectivity. We should all want companies and regulators to maximize that goal. I am very pleased by some of the commitments we\u2019ve gotten from companies who also see benefits of offering a wider array of price points and service.They want customers that would help their bottom lines. We knew it would be the only way for us to truly connect to communities, through public-private partnerships. What\u2019s the best example of how broadband access improves lives?In a pilot project in Ruleville, Mississippi, 100 diabetics used broadband to regularly connect with doctors online. In the first year, none of those patients had hospital visits. It saved $339,000 in Medicaid spending. Google Fiber and new broadband start-ups are going into new cities with a lot of excitement. But they often aren\u2019t going to low-income neighborhoods. How does this affect the digital divide?I assume those companies making those investments will want to grow and will reach customers they aren\u2019t reaching at the start.I don\u2019t worry that much about them because the community will demand the service. That\u2019s putting a lot of trust in carriers to do the right thing. Their business models clash with your objectives. If those who are left behind can\u2019t afford service, how does this help Google or Comcast\u2019s business?I don\u2019t think there is any business that wants to be perceived as not being a good partner with society.It took a call from you, a federal regulator, to help a high school in Mississippi to get better broadband service. That shows people don\u2019t have the power to get better broadband on their own.Is it a perfect system? Heck no. It may have taken that interaction from me, but it will get done. And that is my job. And that is the beauty of having local, state and federal regulators. Yes, it may take some years to get broadband rolled out to all cities, but it\u2019s going to get done.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On a Fashion Journey With Gucci, Prada, Missoni and Armani", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byFashion ReviewMILAN \u2014 The kooky utterances fashion designers sometimes spout (and some fashion journalists often parrot) seldom offer much indicator of what\u2019s actually going on in the collections.Both in his elaborate show notes and backstage before a beautiful final stand-alone show of men\u2019s wear for Gucci on Monday, the label\u2019s creative director Alessandro Michele alluded to the metaphysics of journey: real travel, time travel, armchair travel, metaphoric and philosophical voyages, everything but budget trips to Las Vegas on a Greyhound bus.It doesn\u2019t really matter that the blather bore minimal relation to what he showed on the runway. In just a few seasons, Mr. Michele has revived the flagging fortunes of this venerable luxury goods label, one whose revenue for the year is predicted to top four billion euros (or $4.5 billion).To a large extent, he has done so by capitalizing creatively on how people consume culture in the internet era, rummaging for imagery and information, either ignorant or agnostic about the sources of signs and symbols, references and ideas.Thus when Mr. Michele offers a men\u2019s wear collection (and it was emphatically a men\u2019s wear collection, notwithstanding the inclusion of a smattering of female models) before an audience that included his Hollywood BFF Jared Leto (they attended the Oscars together this year), Ryan McGinley and the blond ephebe boy-star Olly Alexander in a plush bordello space lighted the color of absinthe, two of the three dressed in glorious half-drag, you know you are in for a trip.And Mr. Michele delivered with souvenir jackets scrolled with dragons; flower patterned suits and contrast piped rowing blazers; Mary Janes with jeweled buckles; slickers and rain caps straight off a box of Fisherman\u2019s Friend lozenges; over-embroidered jeans jackets; Fair Isle sweaters with Donald Duck woven into the pattern; satin kimono lounge jackets; tunics ornamented with military braid; drawstring painter\u2019s pants and evening clothes stitched with what looked like trapunto flora.In doing so, he demonstrated not only his estimable design chops but his kinship with millions of consumers who themselves are Instagram or Pinterest magpies, grabbing at bright scraps and shiny fragments for recombinant use.Travel, as others have pointed out, has been a leitmotif throughout the Milan men\u2019s wear season. And while this is probably not the place for cranky opprobrium, it feels necessary to call out the obliviousness of designers who presented collections rife with references to campsites, tarpaulins, tents and displacement when millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees crowd Europe\u2019s borders or wash up dead on its shores.Naturally there is a temptation to sit back and enjoy the spectacle when Thom Browne stages one of his usual displays for Moncler Gamme Bleu (a subsidiary line of the puffer giant Moncler, founded in 1952 and reinvented five decades later by Remo Ruffini as a fashion concern) in a glamping show rife with references to scouting and Smokey Bear.15 PhotosWhat is the harm? Mr. Browne is a skilled entertainer, albeit one occasionally in need of a dramaturge. As with past collections, the tableaux vivant devised here ended without plot resolution.In a bunkerlike show space on the edge of town, Mr. Browne laid sod, installed mature fir trees and piped in the sounds of crickets and birds. He erected 40 translucent pup tents in four parallel rows, and then had his models march out in hooded floor-length coats that were half sleeping bag, half cagoule jacket.One by one, the guys installed themselves before their bivouacs. Soon two mascot bears appeared, stopping by turns to help the models wriggle out of their bag-coats, revealing beneath them suits with short pants that formed the collection\u2019s core.Some were in blanket plaid. Some were channel quilted. Some were in techno fabrics. Some had sequins, and several were constructed using astrakhan, the fleece of newborn or fetal lambs. (Memo to PETA: Don\u2019t blame the messenger.)Most were worn with knee socks and either safari or field jackets, all adorned with so many bellows-pockets you\u2019d need a compass to find your keys. Once revealed, the models paraded around the space, dragging their cloaks behind them before returning to their tents and, unfurling the bags, bedding down inside.That was it. The show ended. The audience filed out. And as they did, some wondered what may become of those tents. \u201cExaggerated utility,\u201d was his theme, Mr. Browne said later. Given recent events in Europe, the phrase struck an unwittingly callous tone.Miuccia Prada, too, seemed to take up travel as a thematic for a show that cast models as vagabonds, dressing them for the road in skinny cycling pants or chunky sweaters or nylon blousons, burdening their scrawny frames with bulging rucksacks (Prada\u2019s first commercial success, in 1984, was a nylon backpack) from which brogues were hung hobo-style.That many of the clothes had been printed with random motifs like watermelons, sombreros or the Buddha suggested that Ms. Prada has more in common with a designer like Mr. Michele than you may imagine. Is there anyone left whose creative process is not influenced by the mysterious algorithms of Google Image? Probably not.The imaginative set for Prada \u2014 by AMO, a research arm of the Dutch architecture studio OMA \u2014 recast the interior of Prada\u2019s space as a series of raked ramps constructed from structural metal mesh. Entering under eerie green light, and with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez\u2019 distorted remix of Bjork\u2019s \u201cArmy of Me\u201d as an aural backdrop, the models climbed ever uphill toward some unseen vanishing point.As at Moncler Gamme Bleu, exaggerated utility was Prada\u2019s tacit through-line. And as at Moncler Gamme Bleu, the show provoked questions that even a designer of Ms. Prada\u2019s sure intelligence seems unprepared to answer.The sunniness of Angela Missoni\u2019s relationship to travel is not easy to square with her personal experience of its perils. It was just three years ago last January that a chartered plane carrying her brother Vittorio, 58, his wife and four others (including a pilot and co-pilot) vanished as it left the Caribbean archipelago of Los Roques. The loss was devastating for a family whose label Mr. Missoni ran with his siblings.Yet there on Sunday, almost exactly on the anniversary of the discovery of the wreck and the identification of the bodies, Ms. Missoni mounted a show that harks back to travel in happier times. \u201cWe went on a family trip to Guatemala when I was 15,\u201d Ms. Missoni said backstage. \u201cAnd I never forgot it.\u201dA jacket she bought on that trip was the point of departure for a collection that used Missoni\u2019s signature knitwear patterns for shorts and cropped trousers, tracksuit tops and shirts, relaxed suiting, Breton-striped undershirts and roomy jackets embroidered with toucans. The woven leather Malibu hippie sandals had closed toes. Cuban heeled boots were transformed into sling-backs.Many of the models in what was by far the most racially diverse casting of recent memory wore straw jibaro hats more characteristic of Cuba or Puerto Rico than Central America, but no matter. Even with rain falling in the loggia of the university courtyard where the show was held, the mood was celebratory, even redemptive.Giorgio Armani also alluded to travel in his show on Monday, largely into his own back pages. Mr. Armani, undisputed king of Italian fashion, surveys a realm that \u2014 however remote it may occasionally seem from developments in contemporary design \u2014 sooner or later must acknowledge him.It is not rote obeisance. Mr. Armani laid down the codes other designers flout. He devised silhouettes many decades ago that have sustained him, snapshots from a long and memorable journey.If there was little novelty in a collection that offered variations on his customary snug knit jackets and tunics, worn over voluminous bottom-hugging linen trousers as feminizing as anything Alessandro Michele ever created, the collection served to remind viewers that the past is also, for some, a destination. The future is, of course, uncertain.The present, at the moment, is in certain ways a pretty ugly place.slide showslide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Music World Bands Together Against YouTube, Seeking Change to Law", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byA few years ago, the biggest enemy of the music industry was Pandora Media. Then Spotify became the target.Now it is YouTube\u2019s turn.In recent months, the music world has been united to a rare degree in a public fight against YouTube, accusing the service of paying too little in royalties and asking for changes to the law that allows the company to operate the way it does. The battle highlights the need to capture every dollar as listeners\u2019 habits turn to streaming, as well as the industry\u2019s complicated relationship with YouTube.\u201cThis is the result of an explosion of views of music videos on YouTube against a backdrop of decline in the recorded music business in general,\u201d Larry Miller, an associate professor of music business at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School, said of the fight.With more than a billion users, including the youngest and most engaged music fans, YouTube has long been seen by the music business as a vital way to promote songs and hunt for the next star. At the same time, music executives grumble that it has never been a substantial source of revenue and is a vexing outlet for leaks and unauthorized material.It may not be a coincidence that the major record labels are also in the midst of renegotiating their licensing contracts with YouTube this year.In its newest effort, the music industry has asked the federal government to change the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying that the law, which was passed in 1998 and protects sites like YouTube that host copyrighted material posted by users, is outdated and makes removing unauthorized content too difficult.Cary Sherman, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, says that even when songs are taken down, they can easily be uploaded again.\u201cThis is a new form of piracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go into dark corners and sell stuff out of your car. You can do it in plain sight and rely on the D.M.C.A. to justify that what you\u2019re doing is perfectly legal.\u201dIn an interview, Robert Kyncl, YouTube\u2019s chief business officer, said that since its inception in 2005, YouTube has paid $3 billion to the music industry around the world. (In earlier statements, YouTube has said that Google, its parent company, paid that amount across all of its sites, but Mr. Kyncl now says that YouTube alone has contributed that sum and that other Google services have added even more.)\u201cMusic matters tremendously to us,\u201d Mr. Kyncl said. \u201cArtists matter to us. We are connecting artists and fans on our platforms.\u201dHe also pointed to the site\u2019s new subscription plan, YouTube Red, and said YouTube\u2019s copyright protections were functioning as they should. Content ID, the site\u2019s proprietary system, lets copyright owners keep track of their material, and when the system detects a new video including a tracked song \u2014 whether in a full music video or just the background of a user-uploaded clip \u2014 the owner can choose to keep the video online or take it down.According to YouTube, 98 percent of copyright claims on its system are made through Content ID, and 99.5 percent of the claims related to music are handled automatically. YouTube says about half the money it pays in music royalties is related to user-generated videos that incorporate music processed through Content ID.\u201cWe are working to create what has become the most significant revenue generator in the entertainment industry,\u201d Mr. Kyncl said, \u201cwhich is a dual revenue stream where you monetize all people: heavy users through subscription, and light users through advertising.\u201dBut the music world argues that YouTube\u2019s financial contributions have not kept pace with the popularity of its streams. In March, the recording industry association\u2019s annual report of sales statistics, usually a dry financial summary, criticized YouTube harshly. It said that free ad-supported sites like it, which let users pick specific songs on demand, paid $385 million to record labels in the United States \u2014 less than the $416 million collected from the sale of just 17 million vinyl records.The fight over the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has touched a nerve. The music industry is bracing for what may be a high-wattage lobbying battle reminiscent of the one over the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill that was abandoned in 2012 after opposition from technology activists and Internet giants like Google and Wikipedia.The copyright law gives \u201csafe harbor\u201d to Internet service providers that host third-party material. While music groups criticize the law, some legal scholars and policy specialists say any change to it would need to be considered carefully, particularly to preserve protections like fair use.\u201cAnything that rewrites the D.M.C.A. isn\u2019t just going to affect YouTube,\u201d said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cIt is going to affect blogs. It is going to affect fan sites. It is going to affect places for game creators and documentarians and all kinds of others.\u201dIn December, the United States Copyright Office asked for comments about D.M.C.A. as part of a review of the law, and filings by record companies show how laborious copyright policing can be. Universal Music said that after Taylor Swift\u2019s album \u201c1989\u201d was released in late 2014, the company devoted a team of employees full time to search for unauthorized copies; to date, the company said, it has sent 66,000 takedown notices to various sites about \u201c1989,\u201d in addition to 114,000 blocks on YouTube made automatically through Content ID.Maria Schneider, a Grammy-winning jazz composer, said in an interview that the problem was particularly acute for independent acts like her, who do not have Content ID accounts, and that the D.M.C.A.\u2019s takedown process discouraged lawful requests.YouTube says that about 8,000 companies and organizations have access to Content IDand that independents may get access through affiliated companies and industry groups. Mr. Kyncl said the steps in the takedown process were meant to ensure the accuracy of requests and deter false claims.Mr. Azoff said that after the Copyright Office made its request, he and other managers asked artists they represented whether they wanted to sign a letter calling for changes to the law.\u201cNot one artist declined,\u201d he said.\u201cBut if there are creators who like their music on YouTube and SoundCloud, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Mr. Azoff said. \u201cThe whole point is choice: Artists should be able to choose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Microsoft Likes LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byBitsSo what does Microsoft get for $26.2 billion?Drug company deals are more straightforward though, and the price is usually based on what the acquirer hopes to squeeze out of the products and talent. Technology mergers tend to require a little more imagination to justify their cost.LinkedIn may have 400 million \u201cmembers,\u201d as the people who post their job data there are called, but in 2015 it had revenue of about $3 billion, and posted a net loss of $166 million. The year before it lost only $15 million on $2.2 billion in revenue. It is hard to see why Microsoft paid a premium of about 50 percent of Friday\u2019s LinkedIn share price.But think like a tech chief executive, using the key values of relevance, synergy, data and growth. Microsoft is in the midst of an epochal transition from the time of personal computers and computer servers to machine-based intelligence everywhere, via cloud computing and mobile devices. Where once it owned the desktop, now it strives with the likes of Google and Amazon for a $1 trillion prize, the global market for corporate computing.At the end of last March, Microsoft had $105 billion in cash, far more than the competition. Spending some of that on a well-regarded cloud company it can transition over to its own enormous cloud system makes Microsoft ever more relevant in this world.Unlike Google and Amazon, Microsoft already has a large presence in corporate software, and some of LinkedIn\u2019s functions will fit nicely into its human resources and financial planning products. Microsoft is also trying to increase the corporate utility of Skype, the online communications company it bought for $8.5 billion in 2011.Bolted onto LinkedIn, it could be a means not just of recruitment, but of organizing teams. Much of LinkedIn\u2019s proposition has been that it will be the core of a future in which there is much less lifetime employment and lots more freelancing, consulting and other independent contracting across the globe.LinkedIn already has probably the world\u2019s best trove of data on the work people are doing and looking for, and one of the best-regarded teams of data scientists in tech. That information and those people will now work with counterparts in areas like online search, gaming and artificial intelligence, or A.I.Data is not just inherently important these days; it is a key asset for improving the performance of A.I. systems. Big data sets lend themselves to better results (incidentally, a reason many in tech are starting to worry about the data owned by the biggest companies.) Buying LinkedIn didn\u2019t just improve the likely performance of Microsoft\u2019s own algorithms. It took a large potential data resource off the table for Amazon and Google.That is, in large part, the positive situation \u2014 which is how such enormous acquisitions should begin. Now for the hard part of making it all work as planned.Advertisement"}

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away.Jonathan A. Knee is professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School and a senior adviser at Evercore Partners.

{"Headline": "New York Above 800 Feet", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "By Jake SilversteinPerhaps much of this history has been driven by crude competition \u2014 the fierce battle between the Chrysler Building and the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building (40 Wall Street), for instance, to be the World\u2019s Tallest Building, a fight the Chrysler won by a stunning coup de gr\u00e2ce: the last-minute addition of its secretly constructed spire, which nudged New York\u2019s altitude record up to 1,046 feet for 11 precious months until the Empire State Building topped out. But the city\u2019s architectural history cannot be reduced to gamesmanship. Something else is going on. Manhattan builds up because it cannot build out and because it cannot sit still. Those of its inhabitants who can afford to do so will seek to climb to higher ground.We are currently in the midst of another clambering epoch. The city has 21 buildings with roof heights above 800 feet; seven of them have been completed in the past 15 years (and three of those the past 36 months). In this special New York Issue, we explore the high-altitude archipelago that spreads among the top floors of these 21 giants. It totals about 34 million square feet in all, encompassing lavish living spaces, vertiginous work environments (during construction and after), elite gathering places. Visually, the experience of this new altitude feels different in kind from its predecessors, the peak uplifts of previous booms that topped out at 400, 500 or 600 feet. At 800 and above, you feel something unusual in a city defined by the smelly bustle of its sidewalks and the jammed waiting and inching and zooming of its avenues \u2014 a kind of Alpine loneliness. Every New Yorker knows the pleasant private solitude that can be found at street level, among anonymous crowds. This is something different: an austere sense of apartness inspired by achieving a perspective seemingly not meant for human eyes.Jake Silverstein is editor in chief of the magazine.By Michael Kimmelman\u201cWould you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?\u201d Harry Lime asked on the Ferris wheel in \u201cThe Third Man.\u201dJimmy Park, whose office is also on the 85th floor and who is a mountain climber in his spare time, put it another way: \u201cYou\u2019re looking down on something you\u2019re not in, and you feel you\u2019re a long way from where you need to be if you need to be safe. At the same time, there\u2019s something therapeutic about seeing great distances. It happens on planes, on mountains, on beaches. I\u2019ll have a meeting with a new client, and we\u2019ll gaze out the window and have this comfortable silence.\u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he went on, \u201cto the \u2018overview effect\u2019 that astronauts feel, which created the whole environmental movement. You realize how small you are and how big the world is.\u201dThe Old Testament declared every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low, in keeping with classical beliefs about proportion and balance. By the 18th century, awe, terror and exultation, previously reserved for God, passed over to geological phenomena like mountains and experiences like conquering peaks. Kant called it \u201cthe terrifying sublime.\u201d In the 19th, with new technology and the growth of cities, nature was rivaled by the man-made. The sublime became reachable by climbing to the top of a tall building.In this spirit, Richard Morris Hunt designed New York\u2019s Tribune Building, built in 1875, with its clock tower at 260 feet, competing with the spire of Trinity Church to be the tallest structure in the city. A quarter-century later, Daniel Burnham\u2019s Flatiron Building, at 285 feet, established a new ideal of tall and skinny, soon dwarfed by the 700-foot-tall Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower, just across Madison Square Park, which was itself outdone, in 1913, by Cass Gilbert\u2019s Woolworth Building, at 792 feet.The New York skyline found its Platonic ideal less than two decades later with the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. The Empire State\u2019s 204-foot mooring mast for passenger dirigibles, which never actually docked there, represented the mercantile equivalent of Trinity\u2019s steeple. As E.B. White wrote, the city skyline was \u201cto the nation what the white church spire is to the village \u2014 the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying that the way is up.\u201dIt was exclusivity of neighborhood, more than sheer height, that connoted status in Manhattan half a century ago: a 20th-floor penthouse on Park Avenue still signified the pinnacle of the social pyramid. Back then, real nosebleed altitudes, like 800 feet, belonged primarily to commercial, not residential, buildings. Skyscrapers advertised companies. Apartments alone couldn\u2019t cover the extraordinary cost of construction at such heights.That changed only during the last decade or so, once apartments in luxury buildings like 15 Central Park West fetched $3,000 a square foot and more. Suddenly, a very tall, very slender project on 57th Street, with a floor plate just big enough for one apartment, or maybe two, and needing far fewer space-hogging elevators than a commercial tower, seemed profitable to aggressive developers. Big-name architects were enlisted. As Carol Willis, the founding director of the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan, likes to put it, form follows finance.Height suddenly substituted for neighborhood as a signifier of status, partly because zoning regulations steered sky-high construction toward less restricted, mixed-use parts of the city, like 57th Street, which also offered money shots of Central Park, and partly because a target clientele of South Asian copper-mining industrialists and Russian oligarchs had little intention of living in their apartments. In any case, they didn\u2019t actually want neighbors. They wanted views. Developers promoted these buildings as de facto country estates, where the chances of encountering someone who isn\u2019t a paid employee of the building are vanishingly slim, and in-house restaurants serve only tenants, so that even eating out won\u2019t require actually going out.Many New Yorkers, infuriated by tax breaks given to these skyscraping potentates, picture themselves toiling in the long, skinny shadows the new towers will cast. But shadows aside, that\u2019s not entirely fair to the supertalls. Some people may not like their scale, but a handful of apartments in mostly nonresidential blocks of Midtown or near Wall Street are hardly the cause of gentrification and displacement. And there may be just a little xenophobia in the anti-supertall phenomenon. It\u2019s a good bet that more than a few wealthy Chinese, Indians and Arabs, like Jews before them, facing an impossible vetting process from co-op boards on the Upper East Side, elected instead to look down on them.In any case, 57th Street is now dubbed Billionaire\u2019s Row, and wealth has reached new altitudes. Advances in skyscraper technology have much to do with this. William F. Baker, who helped engineer the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 2,717 feet the world\u2019s tallest tower, recently explained the engineering behind life above 800 feet. Engineers, he said, who long ago figured out how to make sure skyscrapers won\u2019t topple over, are focused more and more these days on the trickier problem of making people inside feel secure. It\u2019s a challenge because very tall, very slim buildings are designed, like airplane wings, to bend not break. An average person starts worrying about movement in a high-rise long before there\u2019s anything approaching a threat to safety. Mild jostling that you take for granted in a car or train can provoke panic at 100 stories, even if you\u2019re still safer in the building than in the car.Incredible efforts now go into mitigating those effects. Today\u2019s superslender towers are outfitted with sophisticated counterweights, or dampers, and other movement-tempering devices, as they are also outfitted with elevators that speed tenants to their aeries but not so swiftly that you will perceive any troubling G-forces. Something around 30 feet per second seems to be an ideal velocity, suggesting there may be an ultimate height for luxury towers \u2014 not because we can\u2019t engineer a mile-high building but because rich tenants won\u2019t abide elevators that take several minutes to reach apartments for which they paid the annual expenditures of the Republic of Palau.Exceptional engineering requirements are said to account for a hefty portion of the cost of apartments in the supertalls, like 432 Park Avenue, presently the tallest apartment tower in Midtown Manhattan, and one of the costliest. Its exterior is a grid of concrete and glass, like an extruded Sol LeWitt, or a distended Josef Hoffmann vase (or a middle finger stuck up at the city, depending on your perspective). Giant twin dampers near the roof, the size of locomotive engines \u2014 with their own spectacular double-height views over the city \u2014 act like shock absorbers, providing ballast and discouraging chandeliers from tinkling and Champagne glasses from toppling over.But taste is tricky to legislate. Critics greeted the Chrysler Building with horror when it was finished, then held it up as a model of what skyscrapers should look like when a modern generation of glass and steel towers reshaped the postwar skyline and provoked fresh outrage. Looking back, we can see that 1950s landmarks like Lever House, by SOM\u2019s Gordon Bunshaft, and the Seagram Building, by Mies van der Rohe, are as beautiful and refined as any architecture in America, although in the following decades they spawned a million mediocre imitations, cluttering Manhattan and obscuring the originals\u2019 genius. This was the era of white flight and suburban sprawl, when Roland Barthes described New York as a vertical metropolis \u201cfrom which man is absent by his accumulation,\u201d and America\u2019s so-called towers in the park \u2014 those often unjustly maligned housing projects of clustered high-rises in poor neighborhoods, many on the margins of the city \u2014 were left to ruin. The ugliest skyscraper in town, long known as the Verizon Building, at 375 Pearl Street, a seemingly windowless behemoth, still looms over the Brooklyn Bridge. It went up in 1976, just after the twin towers, by Minoru Yamasaki, which New Yorkers loved to hate \u2014 until many came to regard them differently, and not just because of what happened on Sept. 11. At dawn and dusk, the sculpted corners of the towers captured sunlight, making orange and silver ribbons float in the ether. Now, 1 World Trade has risen from their ashes. The classic modernist skyscraper is fashionable again. Taste, like the New York skyline, remains an endless work in progress.Of the new buildings, I like 432, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, and the studied jumble of 56 Leonard, downtown (Herzog & de Meuron are the architects). They\u2019re designed with finesse, punctuating the skyline. Other buildings going up, like Jean Nouvel\u2019s 53 West 53rd, beside the Museum of Modern Art, and 111 57th Street, by SHoP Architects, promise to help tip the scales back toward an older ideal of the sophisticated, attenuated tower, crowded out by those decades of plug-and-play boxes.And corporate chieftains are no longer clamoring for glitzy new company towers. They\u2019re more in tune with millennials, who prefer repurposed buildings, street life and live-work neighborhoods. The architect Bjarke Ingels has recently envisioned a couple of New York towers that feature enormous, sky-high terraces, to bring something of the pleasures of being on the street into the ether.\u201cThe tendency has been to create a hermetic experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows, so you\u2019re incarcerated in a box,\u201d Ingels said. \u201cOutdoor space used to be considered a nuisance, which didn\u2019t contribute to the building\u2019s value, but I believe that\u2019s changing. I am starting to hear leasing people say they want outdoor space. That\u2019s true in residential as well as commercial properties. I think the future at 800 feet is more likely to be engaged with the outside and less an escape from it.\u201dMaybe. In New York, it can get pretty windy and cold up there. For ages, my aunt has rented a studio apartment, a bit lower down, on the 16th floor of a building in Greenwich Village, with a terrace looking toward Washington Square Park and Lower Manhattan, although mostly the view consists of a jumble of low-rise buildings, black-tar rooftops and fire escapes. The terrace has a sun-bleached, green-and-white canvas awning that can be rolled out for shade. Voices and car horns waft up from the street. Rain splatters on the terra-cotta floor. Spring blows in on breezes from the river. I feel like the luckiest man in New York when I\u2019m there, above the city and in the middle of it.Everyone\u2019s sweet spot is different. I stood with Jimmy Park at his window in 1 World Trade, 1,000 feet up. He was extolling the view of Brooklyn and Queens. The roof of 7 World Trade, a neighboring 743-foot glass office tower, cleverly conceived by David Childs, was several hundred feet directly below us. We could just make out the mechanicals. Someone standing up there would have been one of Harry Lime\u2019s dots.I asked Park how tall he thought it was. He scrunched his forehead. He hadn\u2019t really thought about it, he said. \u2666Matthew Pillsbury is a photographer.

Finally, he led me west.But as he looked out the window his eyes flickered, a little irritated, at two new supertall condo buildings that tower above his, slightly blighting his west-facing view. To the right in the middle distance was One57, a blandly luxurious gray-blue monolith that rises to 1,004 feet and casts a significant shadow over the south side of Central Park; just to the right of that stood the even loftier 432 Park Avenue, pencil-thin and still unfinished. The design of 432 Park is more attractive than One57\u2019s \u2014 it resembles a neat stack of pale Rubik\u2019s Cubes \u2014 and its rapid rise has made it perhaps Manhattan\u2019s most noticeable skyscraper. When Estis moved into Trump World Tower in 2002, his year-old home was the world\u2019s tallest residential building. Now 432 Park dwarfs it.\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to an art gallery,\u201d Enkin said. \u201cThe painting has to be on eye level.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of being above it all?\u201d Estis said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on the beauty of the city and the various structures. Here you have the flavor.\u201dEstis is, much like the man who built Trump World Tower, thickset, restless, plain speaking and motivated by a desire to win. He grew up in Little Neck, Queens, his mother a legal secretary and his father a lawyer for the Veteran\u2019s Administration. At school, they asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. \u201cRich,\u201d Estis replied. He was 6. While in college, he rented an ice-cream truck and drove it around on an aggressive schedule \u2014 eight months out of the year. Soon after he graduated from law school he had enough money saved to buy his first piece of property: a two-family home in Bay Terrace, Queens. Now 57, he owns approximately 65 apartments and houses throughout Manhattan and Queens, and heads a 79-lawyer law firm.Enkin, like Trump\u2019s first and third wives, is an ex-model who grew up in the Eastern bloc. She was raised in Soviet Ukraine and worked as a hydrologist in the Siberian gulags before moving to the United States to become a model for the Elite agency and Marc Jacobs. Now 40, she works as an artist\u2019s agent.By living above 800 feet, Estis and Enkin are two members of an unexpectedly exclusive group in Manhattan. In my estimation, no more than 40 people currently live above that line, scattered among just three buildings (Trump World Tower, One57 and 8 Spruce Street, a Frank Gehry building downtown). But they\u2019re just the vanguard. The city is in the midst of another building boom, one unlike any that has come before. In the past, Manhattan\u2019s tallest buildings were filled with corporate offices; now, the most imposing skyscrapers are built as homes for some of the wealthiest people on the planet. By 2020 there are expected to be at least 14 residential skyscrapers in New York City. Many of them will block out the light for a great expanse of Central Park. A small city is being built in the sky \u2014 but for whom? I was curious to learn about them, so I set out to meet as many as I could.Estis and Enkin were the first I got in touch with, and the most hospitable. I lingered around their apartment for hours, until the sun was setting over the Hudson. The spires of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building suddenly illuminated, bathing the apartment in their light.\u201cWhen you\u2019re up there,\u201d Estis said, meaning the 432 Park penthouse, \u201cyou\u2019re missing this. You\u2019ll see lights. But not at this level. You never want to be level with, or looking down on, rooftops. There\u2019s no advantage.\u201d\u201cApparently that penthouse sold for $95 million,\u201d I said. The buyer has been reported to be the Saudi Arabian retail and real estate giant Fawaz Alhokair (432 Park\u2019s representatives declined to comment). He made his $1.37 billion fortune by bringing outlets of Western retail chains \u2014 Topshop, Banana Republic, Zara and Gap \u2014 to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus.Estis shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cThey get bragging rights,\u201d he said. Then he affected the smug tone of a 432 Park penthouse purchaser and added: \u201cI paid more money than anyone else in the building. But I may not have the best view.\u201dThe view may not matter in the end. According to Forbes, Alhokair lives primarily in Riyadh, so presumably 432 Park\u2019s penthouse will become just a pied-\u00e0-terre for him \u2014 or perhaps simply an investment property, destined to remain pristinely and forever empty.Tracking down the owners was a drawn-out process. I would make a trip to the New York City Registry to fetch the names and addresses of the limited-liability companies that made the purchases and try to contact them that way. For example, the top two floors of One57 make up a single duplex, Apartment 90, which sold for $100.5 million to an L.L.C. named, unhelpfully, P89-90 LLC. (It remains Manhattan\u2019s most expensive single residence.) The lawyer representing the L.L.C., Andrea Riina, emailed me, \u201cYour request was forwarded to the client and declined.\u201dI had slightly better luck with Apartment 90\u2019s downstairs neighbor, the owner of Apartment 88. In April 2015, it was sold for $47.3 million to Pac Wholly Own L.L.C., which is associated with a Chinese airline, Pacific American. The airline is owned by the HNA Group, which is in turn owned by the billionaire Chen brothers, Feng and Guoqing. After correctly predicting in the early 1990s that Hainan, a balmy island south of Beijing, would become a kind of Chinese Riviera, they started an airline to take passengers there. Soon, they amassed a fortune. According to a 2014 Bloomberg profile, Chen Feng is a \u201crigorously private\u201d man; apparently his brother is, too. I emailed Guoqing Chen\u2019s assistant several times before she finally responded: \u201cOne57 is a company investment program, and Mr. Chen doesn\u2019t live in One57 right now. So, I am afraid Mr. Chen can\u2019t take the interview. Thank you so much for your consideration.\u201d The rebuff knocked out Apartment 86 too. The L.L.C. that purchased it, One57 86 L.L.C., is registered to the same small downtown Manhattan office suite that houses Pacific American airlines.Apartment 83 is unsold, and the owners of Apartments 85 and 82 \u2014 the billionaire retailers and business partners Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, respectively \u2014 \u201cprefer not to be included in the article,\u201d their assistant wrote. Stroll, who made his money by investing early in Tommy Hilfiger, is Canadian but a resident of Geneva, according to Forbes. Chou \u2014 an early investor in Michael Kors \u2014 lives in Hong Kong.I had a good feeling about Apartment 81 (which lies slightly below 800 feet, but I felt I\u2019d earned it). For a start, there was a chance its owner actually lived there. The apartment cost $55.5 million and \u2014 according to The Times\u2019s real estate pages from the week of the sale \u2014 boasts a \u201cgalvanizing 75-foot-long entrance gallery,\u201d a \u201cgrand salon,\u201d four bedrooms, a \u201cone-ton bathtub carved from a single marble slab,\u201d \u201chead-on views of the park to the north\u201d and a concierge who can organize everything from \u201chelicopter service to the Hamptons\u201d to use of a quartz stone bed at a spa on a lower floor that has, apparently, certain healing properties. These apartments are marketed in grandiose ways. As Michael Graves, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman, told The Times in November 2015, \u201cLiving on a full floor at One57 is probably the closest thing to being a king in the 21st century.\u201d (To be pedantic, the world\u2019s 15 actual kings are closer to being kings than the residents of One57 are, though there might conceivably be some overlap.)The purchaser of Apartment 81 turned out to be a Texan named Becky Moores. Unlike her neighbors, she didn\u2019t conceal her identity. She bought it in her own name \u2014 well, in the name of the Rebecca Ann Moores Family Trust. She married her childhood sweetheart, John, in 1963. Forty-five years later she filed for divorce, hinting at infidelity. The divorce was messy and public and the payout vast enough to afford her not only Apartment 81 but a $34.3 million apartment on One57\u2019s 54th floor too. The settlement proved less fortuitous for fans of the San Diego Padres. John Moores was the team\u2019s owner, and to pay the settlement he had to sell his majority share. In the process, the payroll plummeted, and the star players Jake Peavy and Adrian Gonzalez were traded off to save money. \u201cUltimately, the team collapsed,\u201d says Tom Krasovic, a sports reporter at The San Diego Union-Tribune who covered the Padres for years. He seemed confident that Becky Moores would grant me an interview. \u201cI always found her to be a very nice lady,\u201d he told me over the telephone. \u201cShe\u2019s very well liked and very approachable with a lot of the media.\u201d\u201cBad news,\u201d emailed my contact for Moores. \u201cRebecca Moores isn\u2019t interested in participating in your story.\u201dSorting out who lives above 800 feet in Trump World Tower is slightly easier, thanks both to the tabloids and to the fact that it was built before this vogue for secrecy really took hold. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z used to live up there. They rented an apartment a few floors above Estis and Enkin for a year, paying a reported $65,000 per month. The former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter lived there, too. He sold his 5,500-square-foot apartment on the 89th floor, identical in shape and size to Estis and Enkin\u2019s, for $15.5 million in 2012. Nowadays, their neighbors include the widow of a Delta Air Lines pilot who made a fortune in the stock market, a human rights advocate from South Africa who specializes in health care projects for the developing world, the chairman of Assist America (a global medical-emergency service) and a mysterious Asian businessman who purchased the three remaining apartments all at once, paying in cash, according to Enkin. \u201cHe\u2019s Japanese,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know exactly what he does.\u201d (According to a resident and city records, his name is Chinh Chu. Chu works in finance and he is, in fact, from Vietnam. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)8 Spruce Street stands out among these new buildings because it\u2019s rental-only \u2014 none of the units are for sale. Only the top three floors sit above the 800-foot line. The resident of Penthouse South, on the very top floor, agreed to meet me.Penthouse South is tiny \u2014 so tiny it looks as if there has been some mistake. Its 453 square feet are inclusive of literally everything. It\u2019s so incongruous amid the huge penthouses it abuts that it feels almost magical, like the secret railway platform from which the wizards take the train to Hogwarts. It was designed to be a guest or nanny\u2019s room for one of the other penthouses, but building management rented it instead to Stellan Parr \u2014 33, tattooed, soft-spoken and studying to be a physician assistant. He pays rent \u201cin the low thousands.\u201d He is a unique man: perhaps the only person of (somewhat) modest means who lives at such heights in New York. We sat at his kitchen/living room/bedroom table and admired his view, which takes in the Statue of Liberty, the curve of the East River, 1 World Trade Center and the 9/11 Memorial pools. He opened his window a fraction, and we both suddenly experienced debilitating vertigo. He closed it, and the feeling immediately dissipated.As my elevator descended and my ears popped, it occurred to me that I would almost certainly never take in such a view again. And in fact, maybe nobody will, if these apartments wind up becoming empty investments.A few weeks later, via email, I received an enormous surprise. For the first time ever, a purchaser of an apartment above 800 feet in one of the mysterious new supertall condo buildings had agreed to speak with a journalist about his purchase. I was to meet him in his Fifth Avenue office on Thursday at 4 p.m.Howard Lorber is a 67-year-old New Yorker, balding, gregarious, instantly likable. He stood at his 52nd-floor office window, which looks out over \u2014 or, I suppose, under \u2014 his future home. His apartment will be on the 67th floor, he told me, 850 feet above the ground.\u201cI point it out to everyone who comes in here,\u201d he said.I mentioned my calculation that only a few dozen people currently live above 800 feet in the city. Lorber, who works in real estate, did his own calculation and said, \u201cOnce 432 Park is filled, there\u2019ll be 40 more.\u201dOn his mantelpiece were photographs of him with Donald, Ivanka and Melania Trump. \u201cI think Donald is fantastic, and he\u2019s going to beat Hillary and be the next president,\u201d he said. There was also a photograph of him with Mitt Romney. \u201cI should take that one down,\u201d he said.Lorber grew up in the Bronx. His father was an electrical engineer, and Lorber entered the work force by the time he was 13, \u201cflipping pizzas, pumping gas.\u201d He went to college but hated it, so he became a sociology major because someone told him it was the easiest way to graduate. Out in the world, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the sort of work he could find with a sociology degree, so he went back to college and learned accounting. He became a stockbroker, then moved into insurance. Eventually, he made enough money to buy Nathan\u2019s Famous, the hot-dog company. He\u2019s currently chairman of the real estate firm Douglas Elliman, the very same firm that is now selling the condos at 432 Park \u2014 hence, perhaps, his willingness to be interviewed. From time to time during our conversation, he lapsed into a kind of marketing autopilot: \u201c432 Park is an unbelievably striking building, it\u2019s like a masterpiece, it has to be the most talked-about and revered building in New York City. ... \u201d But I didn\u2019t mind the spiel because \u2014 given his expertise \u2014 he provided insightful answers to my lingering questions about the supertall boom.\u201cHow come Trump World Tower is so much less expensive than 432 Park?\u201d I asked.\u201cBy New York standards it\u2019s already an older building,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst Avenue in the 40s doesn\u2019t command the same price as Park Avenue in the 50s. It just doesn\u2019t. Everyone wants to live in the middle, as opposed to the ends. I guess Central Park is the equivalent of living on the water in the Hamptons. Then there are the ceiling heights, the amenities. ... \u201d (432 Park will have a restaurant, a fitness center and several floors of studios that the owners of the larger apartments can purchase as offices or for staff accommodation. When I walked into Lorber\u2019s office, he was complaining to one of his associates about the price of these studios. \u201cSeven hundred feet for $3 million, to house your staff?\u201d he was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d Still, he has reserved one for himself.)I recounted to him my lack of success at One57, how I was impeded in part by the impenetrable L.L.C. names. \u201cPeople do it for privacy,\u201d he said.\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit worked.\u201dI asked him about all the emptiness up there. Will those apartments purchased as investments by foreign billionaires really remain forever vacant?\u201cIt depends on the people,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome foreigners just want to get their money out of the countries they\u2019re in. They may or may not rent them, but it\u2019s not about making money. It\u2019s more a matter of wanting stability, to be in a safe haven, which they believe New York City is. Look around the world. Look at all the turmoil. Argentina\u2019s bankrupt, Brazil\u2019s in trouble. In China the prices probably went down 20 to 30 percent last year.\u201d But this, he added, was more an issue for One57 than for 432 Park. \u201cOne57 is geared more to foreigners; 432 Park is mostly domestic.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt ended up that way,\u201d he said. \u201cOne57 has a hotel in it. 432 Park doesn\u2019t. I think the foreigners like the idea of having a hotel. The locals like the privacy and the security of not having a hotel. And also, in fairness, One57 was on the market first. So they had the first shot at those people.\u201dThis last statement made me realize just how tiny a group this is \u2014 these foreign billionaires happy to spend tens of millions on New York City apartments they may never visit. It\u2019s a very small community, the superrich. In fact, when Lorber asked me who else I had interviewed for the story, and I mentioned Warren Estis, he broke into a huge smile and said: \u201cI know Warren very well! He\u2019s a client of the company! He\u2019s a fun guy!\u201dWhen I was at Estis and Enkin\u2019s apartment we got to talking about Trump and the hostility that follows him around. Trump World Tower was itself constructed amid much acrimony and division \u2014 a chaotic and upsetting experience for some neighbors and a bonanza for others. Taking advantage of the city\u2019s idiosyncratic \u201cair rights\u201d process, Trump quietly bought rights from the owners of several low-rise neighboring buildings \u2014 a church and a Japanese cultural center among them \u2014 until he had enough to build one gigantic tower. He undertook his maneuver with such stealth that none of the other neighbors, not even Walter Cronkite, knew what was unfolding in their backyards. When Trump\u2019s plans were finally revealed, Cronkite made an emotional petition to the city appeals board, calling the design \u201cdemeaning\u201d to the United Nations. \u201cHow can we allow an institution as important to the world and New York as the U.N. to be forever dwarfed by this outsize and illegal tower?\u201dA Trump executive, Abraham Wallach, responded by reminding the media that Cronkite himself lived in a 50-story high-rise at U.N. Plaza. \u201cPeople who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d he said.Before setting off for Trump World Tower, I emailed the Rev. Robert J. Robbins, formerly of the Church of the Holy Family, to ask what the church did with its unexpected $10 million air-rights windfall from Trump. He declined my interview request, citing \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s present high profile\u201d as the reason. One of Estis and Enkin\u2019s neighbors refused to let The Times photograph their apartment because they didn\u2019t want their name associated with Trump\u2019s in the current climate. For that reason, I felt concerned about mentioning his name to Estis and Enkin. But I needn\u2019t have worried. They are huge fans of his and intend to vote for him.\u201cHe\u2019s truly impressive,\u201d said Estis. \u201cHe gives off an aura of presence and he usually has very positive things to say to the individual he\u2019s talking to. He makes you feel good about yourself. He\u2019ll praise you.\u201d\u201cHow has he praised you?\u201d I asked.\u201cOne time I ran into him at the U.S. Open, and he was with a well-known name in New York real estate,\u201d Estis said. \u201cWe shake hands, and he turns to the builder-developer and says, \u2018Warren\u2019s probably one of the best lawyers in New York City.\u2019\u2009\u201d Estis beamed. \u201cAs I said, it makes you feel good.\u201dTrump does like to say things that make people feel good, though the question of their veracity is often tricky. Trump World Tower\u2019s public-relations agency repeatedly assured The Times that Estis\u2019s apartment lay 810 feet above the ground. But then I called Marshall Gerometta, an expert in skyscraper heights at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\u201cOnly the top residential unit is above 800 feet,\u201d he said. That\u2019s the 90th-floor penthouse, four floors above Estis and Enkin. His figure, he told me, came from a 3-D image of the building on Google Earth. When I raised doubts about his methods, he said that he had \u201cchecked dozens of buildings this way against the actual blueprints, and it\u2019s usually within a couple of feet of accuracy. I\u2019m kind of the go-to guy on this.\u201d (This is true: The Council on Tall Buildings is a respected source.)\u201cIs Trump known for exaggerating his buildings\u2019 heights?\u201d I asked.Gerometta replied that he didn\u2019t know about that, but he did know this: Trump was probably one of the first builders to skip floor numbers in order to inflate the total count. \u201cWhat he markets as the 90th floor is often actually the 72nd floor, just to make it sound more impressive.\u201d\u201cThe Donald,\u201d Gerometta said, laughing, \u201clikes to exaggerate.\u201d (Trump World Tower continues to dispute Gerometta\u2019s figures but has not produced blueprints or other evidence to the contrary.)For Estis and Enkin, the precise altitude of their apartment is ultimately immaterial. At sunset we sat at a west-facing window. The evening light filled the room, and Enkin had opened a bottle of Champagne. I suddenly remembered recent demonstrations at various Trump-owned skyscrapers across New York City.\u201cWas there an anti-Trump protest outside this building a couple of weeks ago?\u201d I asked them.Enkin smiled. Then she shrugged and said, \u201cYou only see the top of their heads.\u201d \u2666Christopher Anderson is a Magnum photographer and a recipient of a Robert Capa Gold Medal Award. By Helen MacdonaldBehind the tourists pressed against the perimeter fence, there\u2019s a man leaning back against the wall. Above him the stars and stripes flap languidly in the night air. I can\u2019t see his face in the gloom, but I know this is the man I\u2019ve come to meet because he\u2019s holding a pair of binoculars that look far better than mine, and his face is upturned to sky. There\u2019s an urgency to the way he stands that reminds me of people I\u2019ve seen at skeet shoots waiting for the trap to fire the next target. He\u2019s tense with anticipation.This is Andrew Farnsworth, a soft-spoken 43-year-old researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and I\u2019m joining him here in hope of seeing a wildlife phenomenon that twice a year sweeps almost unseen above the city: the seasonal night flights of migrating birds. I can\u2019t help thinking this is an absurdly incongruous place for a nature-viewing expedition. Apart from the familiar exceptions \u2014 pigeons, rats, mice, sparrows \u2014 we tend to think of wild creatures as living far from the city\u2019s margins, and nature as the city\u2019s polar opposite. It\u2019s easy to see why. The only natural things visible from this height are a faint scatter of stars above and the livid bruise of the Hudson running through the clutter of lights below. Everything else is us: the flash of aircraft, the tilt of bright smartphones, the illuminated grids of windows and streets.Skyscrapers are at their most perfect at night, full-fledged dreams of modernity that erase nature and replace it with a new landscape wrought of artifice, a cartography of steel and glass and light. But people live in them for the same reason that they travel to wild places: to escape the city. The highest buildings raise you above the mess and chaos of life at street level; they also raise you into something else. The sky may seem like an empty place, just as we once thought the deep ocean to be a lifeless void. But like the ocean, this is a vast habitat full of life \u2014 bats and birds, flying insects, spiders, windblown seeds, microbes, drifting spores. The more I stare at the city across miles of dusty, uplit air, the more I begin to think of these supertall buildings as machines that work like deep-sea submersibles, transporting us to inaccessible realms we cannot otherwise explore. Inside them, the air is calm and clean and temperate. Outside is a tumultuous world teeming with unexpected biological abundance, and we are standing in its midst.Wind-borne migration is an arthropod specialty, allowing creatures like aphids, wasps, lacewings, beetles, moths and tiny spiders hoisted on strands of electrostatically charged silk to travel distances ranging from tens to hundreds of miles. These drifting creatures are colonizers, pioneers looking for new places to live, and they\u2019ll make a home wherever they find one. Place a rose bush out on the arid environment of a top-floor balcony and soon wind-borne sap-sucking aphids will cluster on its stems, followed by the tiny wasps that parasitize them.Insects travel above us in extraordinary numbers. In Britain, the research scientist Jason Chapman uses radar systems aimed into the atmosphere to study their high-altitude movements. Over seven and a half billion can pass over a square mile of English farmland in a single month \u2014 about 5,500 pounds of biomass. Chapman thinks the number passing over New York City may be even higher, because this is a gateway to a continent, not a small island surrounded by cold seas, and summers here are generally hotter. Once you get above 650 feet, he says, you\u2019re lofted into a realm where the distinction between city and countryside has little or no meaning at all.During the day, chimney swifts feast on these vast drifts of life; during the night, so do the city\u2019s resident and migrating bats, and nighthawks with white-flagged wings. On days with northwest winds in late summer and early fall, birds, bats and migrant dragonflies all feed on rich concentrations of insects caused by powerful downdrafts and eddies around the city\u2019s high-rise buildings, just as fish swarm to feed where currents congregate plankton in the ocean.It\u2019s not just insects up there. The tallest buildings, like the Empire State, 1 World Trade Center and other new supertowers, project into airspace that birds have used for millenniums. The city lies on the Atlantic flyway, the route used by hundreds of millions of birds to fly north every spring to their breeding grounds and back again in the fall. Most small songbirds tend to travel between 3,000 and 4,000 feet from the ground, but they vary their altitude depending on the weather. Larger birds fly higher, and some, like shorebirds, may well pass over the city at 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Up here we\u2019ll be able to see only a fraction of what is moving past us: Even the tallest buildings dip into only the shallows of the sky.Though you can see migrating raptors soaring at altitudes well over 800 feet over the city during the day, most species of diurnal birds migrate after nightfall. It\u2019s safer. Temperatures are cooler, and there are fewer predators around. Fewer, not none. Just before I arrived, Farnsworth saw a peregrine falcon drifting ominously around the building. Peregrines frequently hunt at night here. From high-rise lookout perches, they launch flights out into the darkness to grab birds and bats. In more natural habitats, falcons cache the bodies of birds they\u2019ve killed among crevices in cliffs. The ones here tuck their kills into ledges on high-rises, including the Empire State. For a falcon, a skyscraper is simply a cliff: It brings the same prospects, the same high winds, the same opportunities to stash a takeout meal.I feel less like a naturalist and more like an amateur astronomer waiting for a meteor shower, squinting expectantly into the darkness. I try a new tactic: focusing my binoculars on infinity and pointing them straight up. Through the lenses, birds invisible to the naked eye swim into view, and there are birds above them, and birds higher still. It strikes me that we are seeing a lot of birds. An awful lot of birds.For every larger bird I see, 30 or more songbirds pass over. They are very small. Watching their passage is almost too moving to bear. They resemble stars, embers, slow tracer fire. Even through binoculars those at higher altitudes are tiny, ghostly points of light. I know that they have loose-clenched toes tucked to their chests, bright eyes, thin bones and a will to fly north that pulls them onward night after night. Most of them spent yesterday in central or southern New Jersey before ascending into darkness. Larger birds keep flying until dawn. The warblers tend to come earlier to earth, dropping like stones into patches of habitat farther north to rest and feed over the following day. Some, like yellow-rumped warblers, began their long journeys in the southeastern states. Others, like rose-breasted grosbeaks, have made their way up from Central America.Something tugs at my heart. I\u2019ll never see any of these birds again. If I weren\u2019t this high, and the birds weren\u2019t briefly illuminated by this column of light cast by a building thrown up through the Depression years to celebrate earthly power and capital confidence, I\u2019d never have seen them at all.Farnsworth pulls out a smartphone. Unlike everyone else holding screens up here, he\u2019s looking at radar images from Fort Dix, in New Jersey, part of a National Weather Service radar network that provides near-continuous coverage of airspace over the continental U.S.A. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a heavy migration night tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see those kinds of patterns on radar, in particular, those greens,\u201d he explains, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about 1,000 to 2,000 birds per cubic mile potentially, which is almost as dense as it gets. So it\u2019s a big night.\u201d After days of bad weather for birds wanting to fly north, with low cloud and winds in the wrong direction, a bottleneck of migrants built up, and now the sky is full of them. I watch the pixellation blossom on the animated radar map, a blue-and-green dendritic flower billowing out over the whole East Coast. \u201cThis is biological stuff that\u2019s up in the atmosphere,\u201d Farnsworth says, pointing one finger to the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s all biology.\u201dMeteorologists have long known that you can detect animal life by radar. Just after World War II, British radar scientists and Royal Air Force technicians puzzled over mysterious plots and patterns that appeared on their screens. They knew they weren\u2019t aircraft and christened them \u201cangels\u201d before finally concluding that they were flocks of moving birds. \u201cThat was their contamination, right?\u201d Farnsworth says of radar meteorologists. \u201cThey wanted to filter all that stuff out. Now the biologists want to do the reverse.\u201d Farnsworth is one pioneer of a new multidisciplinary science, fit for an era in which weather radar has become so sensitive it can detect a single bumblebee over 30 miles away. It\u2019s called aeroecology, and it uses sophisticated remote-sensing technologies like radar, acoustics and tracking devices to study ecological patterns and relationships in the skies. \u201cThe whole notion of the aerosphere and airspace as habitat is not something that has come into the collective psyche until recently,\u201d Farnsworth says. And this new science is helping us understand how climate change, skyscrapers, wind turbines, light pollution and aviation affect the creatures that live and move above us.New York is among the brightest cities in the world after Las Vegas, only one node in a flood of artificial illumination that runs from Boston down to Washington. We cherish our cities for their appearance at night, but it takes a terrible toll on migrating songbirds: You can find them dead or exhausted at the foot of high-rise buildings all over America. Disoriented by light and reflections on glass, they crash into obstacles, fly into windows, spiral down to the ground. More than 100,000 die each year in New York City alone. Thomas King, of the New York pest-control company M&M Environmental, has had calls from residents of high-rise buildings asking him to deal with the birds colliding with their windows during migration season. He tells them that there\u2019s no solution, but they can talk to their building manager about turning the lights off. It helps. Programs like the New York City Audubon\u2019s Lights Out New York have encouraged many high-rise owners to do the same, saving both energy and avian lives.Every year the \u201cTribute in Light\u201d shines twin blue beams into the Manhattan night as a memorial to the lives lost on Sept. 11. They rise four miles into the air and are visible 60 miles from the city. On peak migration nights songbirds spiral down toward them, calling, pulled from the sky, so many circling in the light they look like glittering, whirling specks of paper caught in the wind. On one night last year, so many were caught in the beams that the few pixels representing the \u201cTribute\u201d site glowed superbright on the radar maps. Farnsworth was there with the Audubon team that got the lights shut off intermittently to prevent casualties. They switched off the \u201cTribute\u201d eight times that night for about 20 minutes at a time, releasing the trapped birds to return to their journey. Each time the lights went back on, a new sweep of birds was drawn in \u2014 the twin towers made ghosts of light visited over and over by winged travelers intermittently freed into darkness before a crowd rushed in to take their place. Farnsworth is a lead scientist in BirdCast, a project that combines a variety of methods \u2014 weather data, flight calls, radar, observers on the ground \u2014 to predict the movements of migrating birds throughout the continental United States and forecast big nights like this that might require emergency lights-out action.The flow of birds over the observation deck continues, but it\u2019s getting late. I make my farewell, take the elevator back down the building and wander uphill to my apartment. Though it\u2019s long past midnight, I\u2019m wide-awake. Part of what high-rise buildings are designed to do is change the way we see. To bring us different views of the world, views intimately linked with prospect and power \u2014 to make the invisible visible. The birds I saw were mostly unidentifiable streaks of light, like thin retinal scratches or splashes of luminous paint on a dark ground. As I look up from street level, the blank sky above seems a very different place, deep and coursing with life.Living in a high-rise building bars you from certain ways of interacting with the natural world. You can\u2019t put out feeders to watch robins and chickadees in your garden. But you are set in another part of their habitual world, a nocturne of ice crystals and cloud and wind and darkness. High-rise buildings, symbols of mastery over nature, can work as bridges toward a more complete understanding of the natural world \u2014 stitching the sky to the ground, nature to the city.For days afterward, my dreams are full of songbirds, the familiar ones from woods and back lots, but also points of moving light, little astronauts, travelers using the stars to navigate, having fallen to earth for a little while before picking themselves up and moving on. \u2666Brian Rea is an illustrator and artist based in Los Angeles.Photographs by Jack DavisonCamille Sweeney is a journalist and a co-author of \u201cThe Art of Doing.\u201dBy Gareth CookAt last, the wind happens upon one of the supertall towers south of the park and reveals a far more wicked talent. It strikes the building\u2019s face and rushes for the edges, whipping off the corners and spiraling tightly, creating a columnar vortex that sucks at the tower\u2019s side and goes careering downwind. If air is moving quickly, these vortices form to a beat, pulling first one way, then the other. The gale is coming out of the north, but this force acts on the perpendicular, along the east-west axis, rocking the structure. Specialists call this the crosswind effect, and in certain circumstances, the rocking hits a building\u2019s \u201cnatural frequency.\u201d Imagine, says Derek Kelly, an engineer, that the hand of God were to reach down and gently pluck one of the skyline\u2019s spires: The skyscraper would vibrate back and forth, like a guitar string. That is a building\u2019s natural frequency. If it matches the crosswind tugs, the two are in resonance; the oscillations grow, like a child kicking on a swing. East then west, east then west. When a gale rolls in, a supertall will lean back, but it\u2019s nothing compared with the potential power of the crosswind effect.Today\u2019s engineers have conquered gravity: With enough structural steel and high-performance concrete, a tower will soar. The more dogged foe is wind. While gravity pulls down, wind can come from any compass point. It can apply pressure or suction, or alternate between the two. The wind, unlike gravity, changes from city to city, from season to season. Most harrowing of all is the wind\u2019s dynamism. It is changed by everything it touches, and the wind even shapes itself, with every current pulling on all its neighbors. Gravity is plodding and obvious, but give wind a chance, and it will gather itself together and riot.In the world of tall buildings, a novel kind of specialist has come to prominence: the wind engineer. As towers grow taller, they climb into more powerful winds, and lighter construction techniques can leave them more vulnerable. Developers have begun putting up very slender skyscrapers, like 432 Park Avenue in New York, and these are particularly sensitive to the aerial environment. When a wind engineer like Kelly looks at such a building, he understands that it is airborne, with one end pinned to underlying bedrock, the rest riding the winds of Manhattan.Kelly is a principal at RWDI, one of North America\u2019s top wind consultants. The company\u2019s client list includes 432 Park Avenue and 111 West 57th Street, a 1,428-foot skyscraper set to be among the slimmest in the world. (Imagine a one-foot ruler, stood on end and stretched to roughly twice its height.) When testing shows too much sway in an initial design, a near certainty with slender supertalls, RWDI offers a \u201cshaping workshop.\u201d The architect, developer and engineer make the trek from their home metropolis to the company\u2019s headquarters in Guelph, Ontario, with dibs for the day on a wind-test tunnel and a cadre of model makers so that ideas can be tried in the tunnel and improved upon. The goal is to find ways that the building might, as these specialists say, \u201cconfuse the wind.\u201d Designers of airplane wings want a smooth rush of air, to generate lift; designers of buildings want to divide the wind and leave it in disarray.Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, at 2,717 feet the planet\u2019s tallest man-made structure, is asymmetrical, winding down from the top in a series of steps, like an expanding spiral staircase. The crosswind effect depends on a building\u2019s width, and so at each level on the Burj, the wind beats at a different frequency: confused and frustrated, like a toddler kicking wildly on a swing that won\u2019t get going. Another favorite weapon of wind confusion, seen on many skyscrapers, is cut corners, which disrupt suction forces along the side. Pinnacles and antennas are subjected to the kind of scrutiny given America\u2019s Cup yachts. In the case of 432 Park Avenue, the design team used five gap layers, each two floors in height, where the facade opens to allow air to pass through, sapping vortices. These horizontal bands give the tower a visual rhythm, but they are there because of the wind. In the natural world, wind sculpts sand dunes and cuts the snow, carving rings where it has whipped around a tree. It leaves its marks on buildings too.If shaping and structural tweaks reach their limit, engineers can reduce motion further by installing \u201ctuned mass dampers\u201d near the apex. One version consists of an enormous mass on a suspension system with pistons that resist the mass\u2019s movement. The damper acts as a pendulum, but set just off the building\u2019s natural frequency, meaning that whenever the tower lurches, the mass drags, out of sync, steadying it. The 1,667-foot Taipei 101 is damped with a 728-ton ball that does double duty as a tourist attraction. From the observation deck, the ball appears to swing in heavy winds, though actually the tourists are also in motion.Hidden at 432 Park Avenue, some 1,300 tons of combined mass stroke away on two dampers. The building\u2019s engineer, Silvian Marcus, the U.S.A. director of building structures at WSP/Parsons Brinckerhoff, visited one of the top floors with a group and asked if anyone felt anything. No, they said. He rested a laser pointer on the floor, aimed it up and stood back. The dot wandered as the tower flexed. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable; we feel nothing,\u2019\u2009\u201d Marcus told me. With high-end damping, most people will not sense motion in normal weather. For supertall residential skyscrapers, tuned mass dampers are the rare luxury amenities that go unseen.Very tall buildings are a recent invention, and the public has not yet developed an intuitive sense for them. \u201cWe still have this innate understanding that a building we enter will remain stationary,\u201d says Melissa Burton, the global head of civil structures for BMT Fluid Mechanics. \u201cIt scares us when it moves.\u201d You can choose to make a home in the clouds, comfortably isolated from the elements, but you can never escape the wind. The walls, and everything they contain, will always be in motion. Most of the time, this will fall beneath your notice. Yet someday a storm will come, the wind will riot and you will feel its touch. \u2666Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.Photographs by Matthew PillsburyPhotographs by Thomas StruthThomas Struth is a photographer based in Germany who often examines the relationships between people and their modern environments. His photographs have been shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Museo del Prado in Madrid and others.By Taffy Brodesser-AknerJimmy Chin wasn\u2019t all that concerned with safety, to be honest; he was more concerned about the unknowns of rigging the first shots. He wanted to convey the \u201cairiness\u201d of being up that high; he wanted to convey the awe he knew that he would feel \u2014 the awe that motivates everything he does, whether photographing free climbers in Yosemite for National Geographic or dangling from unclimbed sandstone towers in Chad. He was mostly thinking that shooting straight down the spire \u201cmight not give you a sense of the actual spire,\u201d and how can you show how big the world is from up there with just one shot? He wanted the camera to swing out a little, and he was thinking of the best ways to do that. He settled on a long monopod, a six-foot pole, and that\u2019s about all he could think about. He had returned from China a few days before, coming home jet-lagged from another big shoot. The safety issue felt like a nonissue to him. This guy was part of the first ascent of the sharkfin at Meru, in the Himalayas. He skied from the summit of Everest. He\u2019d never climbed a skyscraper, but 1,776 feet in the air is nothing for him; 1,776 is usually what he calls a good start. And anyway, he had his very own safety liaison.All the time Walsh was lecturing, and during the entire six hours they were up there together, Chin was thinking what a good teacher Walsh must have been, back in Walsh\u2019s previous life, at that Philadelphia public school. But the school district was a mess, Walsh says, and when he was laid off four years ago, he didn\u2019t look very hard for another teaching job. A relative told him about FallProof, a company that teaches fall prevention, to head off lawsuits (and falls).Chin couldn\u2019t help noticing how patient Walsh was, how they seemed to speak the same language despite having such extraordinarily different backgrounds. For a minute, Chin could imagine Walsh doing both things, the climbing and the teaching. You know that old physics theory about a multiverse? In which there are infinite numbers of concurrent universes for every moment of the past and present and future? In the multiverse, there stands Jamison Walsh, patiently teaching the special-needs population of the city, and there is Chin skiing down Everest right this minute, every minute, thinking that that is probably the craziest thing he will ever do.This wasn\u2019t Walsh\u2019s first time up the spire; it wasn\u2019t even his second. The other times, he was on the clock for safety checks and needed to just get the job done \u2014 making sure the ladders and all the fall protection were in \u201ctiptop shape\u201d for the people who would be climbing later to service the weather barometers and the beacon for airspace, and eventually the array of antennas for local television that will be installed this summer, antennas similar to the ones that used to be on the World Trade Center. But this time, up there for hours with the sole purpose of letting the time pass, letting the light change and the clouds move for Chin\u2019s camera, he was able to really contemplate it, you know?They grew chatty over the hours. Walsh asked Chin about Everest, the only mountain he\u2019d heard of that Chin had climbed and photographed. Walsh told Chin about the rooftop he\u2019d recently been on in York, Penn., how he could see the mountains around him. They talked about the view from nearly 1,776 feet. They high-fived about what giants they were. Walsh tried to FaceTime with his poor wife, who gets nervous about what he does, who sighs with relief every time he walks through the door at the end of the day. \u201cWe\u2019re up here!\u201d he said into the camera. Chin will tell you that Walsh seemed a little giddy up there. The excitement took Walsh by surprise. \u201cIt was undescribable,\u201d Walsh said. Yes, being a safety liaison is mostly just a regular job, but sometimes regular jobs can burst your heart.There they hung, harnessed King Kongs, dangling off the building. As late afternoon descended and Chin\u2019s shutter clicked, Walsh watched the city, trying to wrap his head around the beauty of it. \u201cIt\u2019s simply whatever God produced,\u201d he said, trying to convey what it was like. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d He looked over at the Statue of Liberty, which was ant-size, and he looked over at Jersey City, for God produced Jersey City as well, and he watched the sunset. He thought about Sept. 11 up there. How could you not? At the base of the spire, construction workers had graffitied memoria for those they lost in the attack into the steel. Far down below were the footprints of the old towers and the reflecting pools, and people surrounding them at all hours, paying respects, wondering how we\u2019ve moved on so quickly that right next door there\u2019s a new tower now, taller even. If you were to believe in a multiverse, you could imagine that somewhere in a parallel universe, the people in the twin towers are still there doing their jobs as on any given day, scurrying through the halls with their papers and their tasks, at their terminals. But if you believe in a multiverse, you could also imagine that day when the people descended suddenly and unwillingly, how they jumped and fell \u2014 that day is happening on a loop forever, too. One World Trade Center rose up in spite of all that happened, and in our audacity or our hubris, we\u2019re going higher. As Walsh says, business is good.You couldn\u2019t even see them from the ground that spring day, Walsh and Chin. The sky darkened, and the city lit up, and Walsh looked up past Chin, past the crow\u2019s nest, and saw that there was not much left to go before the climb was complete. Eventually they came down off the spire, and they both signed the base. That night, Chin went to get a cheeseburger, something he can never do in the Himalayas. And that night, Walsh took the train back to Pennsylvania, and he walked through the door of his home once again, and his wife sighed relief and asked him about his day. \u2666By Sam AndersonWe want to see.What do we want to see?A large part of what we want to see, it turns out, is ourselves seeing.The photographer Brian Finke captured people capturing people \u2014 themselves and others \u2014 on top of New York\u2019s highest public observation decks: the Empire State Building, Top of the Rock and One World Observatory. Together, these skyscrapers attract around 10 million tourists a year. They are spikes of capitalist triumph: symbols of wealth, strength, power, transcendence.But humans are sensitive creatures. Even though these platforms are not, in the grand scheme of things, all that high \u2014 850 feet, 1,250 feet \u2014 the air is measurably thinner up there. Our lungs have to work a tiny bit harder to smuggle oxygen into our bloodstreams. We know, viscerally, that we\u2019re unlikely to survive a fall from such an inhuman height. It is both terrifying and giddy. We feel we are standing, temporarily, in a band of the sky; we are only visitors in this elevated realm, and won\u2019t stay long. Still, we reach up higher. We hold our cameras out at arm\u2019s length, or even beyond arm\u2019s length with selfie sticks, straining for every last inch of perspective, so that in the resulting photo, right there in the foreground of the panoramic expanse (the park, the river, the rival skyscrapers, the harbor), is the familiar spectacle of us: our Hawaiian shirts, our sunglasses, our babies packed snugly into their elephant-print slings, our tender, terrestrial faces. \u2666Design: Gail Bichler, Matt Willey.

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley Suburbs, Calls to Limit the Soaring Rents", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 After years of punishing rent increases, activists across Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area are pushing a spate of rent control proposals, driven by outrage over soaring housing prices and fears that the growing income gap is turning middle-class families into an endangered species. Those campaigns, if successful, would lead to the largest expansion of tenant laws since the 1970s.\u201cIn the national picture, tenants\u2019 rights and housing advocacy for the poor has been pretty sleepy for several decades,\u201d said Michelle Wilde Anderson, a law professor at Stanford. \u201cCalifornia is starting to wake up, and it may lead to national change.\u201dThe Bay Area may be a special case, with the growth of technology industries driving housing costs into the stratosphere and a California initiative system that allows citizens to put proposed laws on the ballot. But the state has a long history of being at the forefront of populist uprisings that spread across the country, and rent control movements have already popped up in other higher-cost cities like Portland, Ore., and Seattle.In 1978, Proposition 13 sharply reduced California\u2019s property taxes, presaging a nationwide tax revolt. More recently, the state government adopted one of the nation\u2019s most expansive minimum wage laws, to $15 statewide by 2022, reflecting a populist tide against income inequality that the rent control effort is also riding.\u201cThis is happening so fast that we in the advocacy community can\u2019t even keep track of it,\u201d said Daniel Saver, a housing lawyer who is helping draft rent control proposals in several towns.Instead of being based in big cities like San Francisco, today\u2019s renters\u2019 rights movement is centered in the collection of suburbs and bedroom communities that fill the peninsula south of the city. Here, the collision of tech riches with decades of slow-growth development measures has pushed rent prices up about 50 percent over the last five years, according to Zillow, the online real estate pricing service.\u201cThe solution to the overall increase in housing prices in this area is bringing supply and demand into better balance,\u201d said Leonard Siegel, a city councilman in Mountain View, where Google has its headquarters. \u201cBut until we get there \u2014 which means we need time to build housing \u2014 we keep losing people, and the fabric of our community is being torn apart.\u201dSilicon Valley looks and feels suburban, lacking in pedestrians and full of single-family homes. It also has many tenants. In Mountain View, for instance, renters make up 60 percent of the households. And since this is a place where a $1 million starter home is considered a steal, those renters also include well-paid tech workers at some of the most valuable companies on earth.Google employees routinely show up at City Council meetings to speak out about rents and evictions. And after a 2014 election that served as a housing referendum by bringing Mr. Siegel and two other housing advocates onto the council, Mountain View is poised to add 15,000 new units, about a 40 percent increase in the housing stock.\u201cWe recognize that if there isn\u2019t new development and there aren\u2019t dollars for affordable housing, we are going to be up against the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe days of the industry trying to play below the radar are, unfortunately, over.\u201dEconomists have an almost universally dim view of rent control because it does nothing to attack the underlying problem here, which is that more people want to live in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley than there are housing units to put them in.Indeed, study after study has shown that while limits on rental increases may have helped a comparative handful of tenants stay in their apartments, they only added to a shortage of affordable housing and did little to stem the tide of higher costs.Rent control also comes with unintended consequences. The supply of rental apartments can become tighter as landlords exit the business. The properties that remain can become shabbier as owners stop keeping up with maintenance.\u201cRent control exists for a reason, and it\u2019s because someone gains from it,\u201d said Daniel Fetter, an economics professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. \u201cThe question is, \u2018Is that really the best policy for achieving those ends?\u2019\u201dBut such abstruse arguments don\u2019t carry much weight when many people are worried about being displaced, especially in the Bay Area, where losing a cheap apartment can mean moving an hour or more from work.On a recent evening in Burlingame, a Silicon Valley bedroom community about 20 minutes south of San Francisco, a 66-year-old legal secretary named Cindy Cornell sat at a foldout table in a San Francisco Giants visor collecting signatures for another rent control initiative.About half the households in Burlingame are renters, and the list of horror stories went up and down the economic ladder. There was a 36-year-old mother of one whose husband is an engineer who makes good money at a tech company. She signed because their landlord raised the rent to $4,600 from $3,400 while she was pregnant.A woman with four children and a husband who paints houses signed because the rent on her two-bedroom apartment had risen to $1,600 a month from $1,400 a month in two years.A half-hour later in nearby San Mateo, Reyna Gonzalez, a 57-year-old nanny, was going door to door with her granddaughter and a clipboard, finding voters for similar proposal.Whether or not these efforts are successful, Mr. Bannon, from the landlords\u2019 group, said he expected escalating housing costs to remain one of the state\u2019s central political issues for years.\u201cMy members are not going to put their buildings on wheels and move them out of California,\u201d Mr. Bannon, the landlord lobbyist, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something to build. We can\u2019t continue like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Takes Aim at Sony With Cheaper Xbox, Virtual Reality and Cross-Platform Games", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byMicrosoft on Monday unveiled a smaller, less expensive Xbox One and plans for a new console that can offer virtual reality games as it seeks to catch up with Sony in video game hardware.The new Xbox One S starts at $300 and costs up to $400 for a 2-terabyte hard drive; the Xbox One previously started at $349. The new device supports 4K video and is about 40 percent smaller than the original model. A special edition will be available in August and standard versions will come out later this year.Microsoft is competing fiercely against Sony in the console market, which has lost some of its shine as new forms of play \u2014 such as mobile games \u2014 come to the fore, but which remains a lucrative area with a dedicated demographic of hard-core gamers. Sony has sold about 40 million PlayStation 4s, which are its latest generation of consoles, with Microsoft estimated to have sold about 21 million Xbox One consoles, according to SuperData Research.The console makers are also trying to keep ahead of technology trends, with virtual reality regarded as a promising direction. Facebook, HTC and others have released virtual reality headsets and an early use of the technology is for games. Sony has already announced a virtual reality headset that will work with its PlayStation 4 console.Monday\u2019s Xbox announcements are Microsoft\u2019s attempt \u201cto catch up\u201d with Sony, said Joost van Dreunen, the chief executive of SuperData Research.The new machine will be the first Xbox to offer virtual reality and will most likely be more expensive, so it is unlikely to cannibalize sales from the lower-priced Xbox One, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.Microsoft also said that it expected more Xbox games to be compatible across all of its hardware products, and that many could also be played on platforms made by Apple, Google and Microsoft PC.The company also announced new communities and groups for Xbox game players, including realms for the popular Minecraft game that allow players to collaborate whether they use Xbox, iOS, Android or PC operating systems.\u201cXbox has become aware that it has to engage customers more,\u201d Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "While Limited, Wi-Fi-First Phones Are a Good, Frugal Bet", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe internet companies Google and Bandwidth.com have turned that little-known fact into a business opportunity. Their mobile phone services rely on cell networks that they lease from traditional carriers, but if a Wi-Fi network has a better connection, they shift phone calls and data over to Wi-Fi instead.More often, your Wi-Fi is going to have a stronger data connection, so in tech industry parlance, these phone services are sometimes called \u201cWi-Fi first.\u201dIn contrast, AT&T\u2019s cheapest phone plan starts at $45 a month for a bucket including only 300 megabytes of data, and Verizon charges $50 a month for its plan including one gigabyte of cellular data.Based on numbers alone, you might wonder, how could one resist going with a Wi-Fi-first phone plan? But there are several other factors to consider, including the reliability and ease of using the phone services, customer service quality and the phones that work with the networks. (For example: The iPhone is out of the picture.)After testing Project Fi and Republic Wireless for a few weeks and comparing their performance with traditional carriers, I concluded that they are ideal for budget-conscious consumers who don\u2019t need to have the latest and greatest devices.Project Fi and Republic Wireless share a lot in common, though there are differences. Both services work only with phones running Google\u2019s Android system. In the United States, both primarily rely on Sprint and T-Mobile networks for cellular coverage. But Project Fi\u2019s plans also include cell coverage from U.S. Cellular, a smaller carrier, as well as foreign networks in more than 120 countries.When you receive a Project Fi phone, you insert the SIM card and activate it through the Project Fi app. Similarly, with Republic Wireless, when you receive the phone, you activate it through the Republic app downloaded through Google\u2019s app store.The technologies for both services work seamlessly \u2014 if you start a phone call over a Wi-Fi connection and move out of its range, for example, the call is handed off to a nearby cell tower.I tested Project Fi and Republic Wireless in two cities where getting a good cell signal can be challenging \u2014 San Francisco and South Lake Tahoe, Calif. \u2014 and compared their performance with a smartphone on AT&T\u2019s network. Both Project Fi and Republic Wireless worked reliably and turned in impressive results.To assess data performance, I ran network tests with the app Speed Test on the phones multiple times in each location. AT&T\u2019s cell network was faster over all: Its download speeds peaked at 28 megabits a second. Republic Wireless reached 17 megabits a second for downloads, and Project Fi\u2019s fastest download speed was 9.2 megabits a second. All those speeds are fast enough to smoothly stream music or video.Both Project Fi and Republic Wireless were better at handling Wi-Fi calls than AT&T. I tried starting phone calls in an area with a strong Wi-Fi connection and then walked out of range of the Wi-Fi. AT&T dropped the call when I left the Wi-Fi zone, but Project Fi and Republic Wireless hung on. As for audio quality, calls on both Project Fi and Republic Wireless sounded similar; I could not discern a meaningful difference between a call placed over Wi-Fi or cellular.For a stress test, I tried using all the phone services while riding in a car through mountains around Lake Tahoe. Not surprisingly, all the services struggled to place calls or browse the web.Traditional phone carriers are not well known for quality customer service, so it\u2019s important to know how quickly and capably Project Fi and Republic Wireless can solve customer problems. Both had customer service operations that felt more modern than traditional carriers.Project Fi lets customers reach out via phone, web chat or email. I experienced a hiccup with Project Fi \u2014 after activating my account and choosing a phone number, Project Fi gobbled my existing Google Voice phone number.After I contacted a service representative over web chat in the evening, Google restored my Google Voice number the following morning \u2014 not ideal. Google said it would revise its sign-up process to clarify that customers will lose their existing Google Voice numbers if they choose a new number for Project Fi.However, in another test, I emailed Google asking why my coverage was spotty in Lake Tahoe, and after about three hours a service representative responded, explaining that reliable service in that area was not guaranteed, and issued me a $5 refund.Republic Wireless has a number of interesting approaches to customer service. You can open a support ticket through the Republic app or website and get a response via email, or ask someone to call you. You can also use web chat or send a text message to a chat bot, which spits out a list of options for how you can get help, and connect with a service representative.I used both the chat bot and app to pose the same question about why coverage was spotty in Lake Tahoe. Within minutes, two representatives looked into it and said there were no outages in the area, so performance should have been fine.Because Republic Wireless and Project Fi are similar, the trade-offs will guide you.Project Fi costs a little more than Republic Wireless, but you will also have the benefit of being able to use the service overseas at the same rates, without swapping out a SIM card.But a major downside is that you have only two phone options: Huawei\u2019s 5.7-inch Nexus 6P and LG\u2019s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X. So if you are frugal, travel often and don\u2019t mind having few options for phone models, go with Project Fi.Then there is the option of sticking with a traditional carrier. The big carriers tend to get the latest and coolest phones right when they are released. In addition, AT&T and Verizon generally have faster and more reliable coverage throughout the country. Early adopters of new gear and professionals who value a zippy cell connection will probably want to stick with a big carrier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skeptics of Self-Driving Cars Span Generations", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byWheelsThe technology to make autonomous cars a reality may be ready, but American drivers don\u2019t seem to be.From smartphone-addicted teenagers to researchers designing the next generation of self-driving vehicles, there\u2019s a fair amount of skepticism among consumers when it comes to letting go of the wheel and allowing a car to do the driving, several surveys over the last year have found. Even engineers have some qualms.\u201cI have no problem letting a car take control,\u201d said Jeffrey Miller, an associate professor of engineering practice at the University of Southern California. \u201cBut having a car take my kids to school? You\u2019re talking about people who don\u2019t have the ability to take over if something goes wrong. I\u2019m not that comfortable with it.\u201dThat sentiment was echoed in a survey of over 400 respondents by IEEE, the professional engineering organization, that grew out of a round table that Professor Miller took part in. On a scale of 1 to 5 \u2014 with \u201cvery comfortable\u201d being a 5 \u2014 more than two-thirds of the experts in the study said they weren\u2019t ready to have a robotic car play nanny, giving the concept a 3 or lower. Not exactly a ringing endorsement from engineers of the state of the art in self-driving cars.\u201cIt\u2019s not the technology. It\u2019s user acceptance that\u2019s holding us up right now,\u201d Professor Miller said.This is not to say experts and consumers don\u2019t see potential benefits.Scott Fischer, 55, the chief executive of a privately held recruiting firm in Chicago, foresees a variety of situations in which autonomous vehicles would be a major advantage. \u201cI\u2019m not skeptical at all,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Mr. Fischer, who took part in a study of older drivers conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s AgeLab and the Hartford Center for Mature Market Excellence, part of the insurance company The Hartford, said autonomous cars could give him more peace of mind about his two daughters, who are in their 20s and have limited driving experience. \u201cThey don\u2019t drive as much they take Uber,\u201d he said, \u201cso I see the safety aspects.\u201dFor his father, who is in his early 80s and facing driving challenges because of vision issues, an autonomous vehicle would be a way to get around on his own, Mr. Fischer said. And for his own part, Mr. Fischer would let the car take over when he was tired on a long drive or needed to read email.\u201cBut I want to see proof of concept that the technology actually works,\u201d he added.Joseph Coughlin, director of the M.I.T. AgeLab, said that for the study\u2019s participants, who ranged in age from 50 to 69, there was no reflexive aversion to technology-assisted driving. \u201cIf they see it as useful or enhancing safety,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re willing to pay for it.\u201dJodi Olshevski, a gerontologist and executive director of the Hartford Center, said that, in general, people over 50 expressed the most interest in technology that alerts drivers to vehicles in their blind spot, said \u201cIt was naturally appealing to them since there\u2019s often a reduced range of motion\u201d in older drivers, Ms. Olshevski noted.Still, even older drivers were hesitant to give up total control. In the M.I.T. study, most were less likely to accept automatic parking and cruise assistance systems, worried that they would become overly reliant on the technology at the expense of their driving skills.There\u2019s also the Route 66 romanticism many older Americans still have with the automobile. \u201cBaby boomers have a love affair with the car,\u201d said Raj Rajkumar, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a longtime researcher on autonomous vehicles. \u201cOn the other hand, the current generation would rather be Snapchatting, and they are a lot more receptive to technology.\u201dAnd in the autonomous-vehicle age, established automakers may be on an equal footing with technology companies. A Nielsen automotive study of over 1,100 participants 8 to 18 years old found there was an equal interest in buying a self-driving car from a technology company, such as Google or Apple, as there was from purchasing one an automaker like Ford or General Motors.According to a 2016 Autotrader Car Tech Impact Study, about two-thirds of consumers would switch brands to get the technology they want. \u201cBut completely brand agnostic, I don\u2019t think people are shopping that way yet,\u201d said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader.More telling, perhaps, is that roughly two-thirds of the consumers in the Autotrader survey acknowledged that they still would not feel confident enough in a self-driving car to take their eyes off the road.Even the young participants in the Nielsen study seemed reluctant to take their hands off the wheel, especially high school students with licenses. Roughly three out of four drivers of high school age would prefer to drive themselves, according to the Nielsen study. And one-third said self-driving cars were unnecessary.That may reflect the fact that those with freshly minted driver\u2019s licenses may be particularly reluctant to give up their newfound independence, says Mike VanNieuwkuyk, vice president, automotive, at the Nielsen Company. Mr. VanNieuwkuyk also noted that younger drivers have not yet logged hundreds of annoying hours stewing in traffic or had to suffer through the daily ritual of monotonous commutes.\u201cAnd yet young people are the ones who are going to be the potential beneficiaries of this technology,\u201d Mr. VanNieuwkuyk said. \u201cThe youngest have more acceptance; they\u2019re already passengers and they\u2019re more engaged with technology.\u201dThe various studies also reflect a sharper divide between those who love to drive and those who find it a stressful activity.\u201cThere are people who want to hop into the back seat and go to sleep,\u201d said Ken Washington, vice president of Ford\u2019s research and advanced engineering division, \u201cand others who say, \u2018No robot is going to drive my car.\u2019\u201dMost of the researchers and automotive experts say driver attitudes will shift as more advanced safety and semiautonomous systems are introduced into new models. Education about how the systems work and their benefits will also help.\u201cAnd just think of being stuck in a traffic jam,\u201d said Professor Rajkumar of Carnegie Mellon. \u201cThen you start to see the light.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Airbnb and Social Control in the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byBitsTechnology has all kinds of ways to make life easier \u2014 particularly for the tech companies themselves.When people sign up for the service, they waive the right to sue Airbnb, or join any arbitration or class-action lawsuit against the company. A few months back, Airbnb highlighted those terms, and older users were compelled to show that they were aware of the rights they were losing by listing with Airbnb.What Airbnb did not do was disclose how many clients it had who did seem to be renting out large blocks of real estate for long periods of time. That would have been simple for such a data-driven outfit, but that detail occupied little of the debate.The class-action waiver is particularly important where discrimination is concerned. Class-actions are a strong tool in discrimination cases, as the significance of the number of participants reinforces the idea that a systemic ill is being promulgated. It is the kind of thing that has helped ease discrimination by hotels and real estate brokers \u2014 Airbnb\u2019s old-economy counterparts.For its part, Airbnb says it is committed to ending discrimination, noting that it has kicked off hosts who discriminated against an African-American and a transgendered woman.What it hasn\u2019t done, yet, is show a policy that is superior to existing legal remedies, though an outside adviser to Airbnb tells Ms. Benner that it doesn\u2019t need the kind of pressures older companies needed to do the right thing. Apparently the new breed of companies are simply better, and don\u2019t do that kind of thing.Maybe. But Airbnb is hardly alone among tech companies in curbing the rights of the public on which it relies.Employees at tech companies are frequently bound by nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements that may follow them for years after they leave these companies \u2014 so, frequently, are contractors and government officials who work with the tech companies. While some of that may be understandable, nondisclosures in tech have few parallels elsewhere in the private sector.Tech is an industry supposedly built on the idea that transparency and information sharing make a better world for us all. Apparently not when the information involves things that might affect the company itself.It\u2019s enough to make you Google search the word \u201chypocrisy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an Archive of the Internet Could Change History", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyA few years ago, the Brooklyn Museum put on a Keith Haring exhibition, with a focus on his early career. There were videos of Haring at work, feverishly painting his way across an enormous scroll, and a room filled with drawings he illegally chalked in subway stations. But most stunning, at least to me, were Haring\u2019s notebooks. They were displayed under clear cubes, their well-worn sheets pinned open for visitors to study.The notebooks were sublimely surreal, filled with dogs crawling beneath bulbous U.F.O.s and penises ejaculating alongside concave cylinders that looked like nuclear cooling towers. By the time I first encountered Haring\u2019s work as a teenager, his artistic legacy had been reduced to catchy imagery of colorful, blocky bodies hugging and dancing on T-shirts. But the notebooks showed what nagged at the artist, what motivated him. I saw someone so suspicious of government surveillance that he often wrote in secret code, someone obsessed with the subversive power of gay sex and someone working to merge his skepticism of capitalism with a deep-\u00adrooted desire for fame and commercial appeal.I left with an urgent curiosity about what sort of artifacts we would display a few decades from now, for future generations to discover. Our contemporary analogues to the personal notebook now live on the web \u2014 communal, crowdsourced and shared online in real time. Some of the most interesting and vital work I come across exists only in pixels. Tumblr, for example, contains endless warrens of critical theory about trans identity politics and expression, one of the few havens on the web where that sort of discourse exists. Many of the short videos on Vine feel as though they belong to an ever-\u00adevolving, completely new genre of modern folk art. Some of the most clever commentary on pop culture and politics is thriving deep in hashtags on Twitter. Social media is as essential to understanding the preoccupations and temperature of our time as Haring\u2019s notebooks were for his. But preserving materials from the internet is much harder than sealing them under glass.Building an archive has always required asking a couple of simple but thorny questions: What will we save and how? Whose stories are the most important and why? In theory, the internet already functions as a kind of archive: Any document, video or photo can in principle remain there indefinitely, available to be viewed by anyone with a connection. But in reality, things disappear constantly. Search engines like Google continually trawl for pages to organize and index for retrieval, but they can\u2019t catch everything. And as the web evolves, it becomes harder to preserve. It is estimated that 75 percent of all websites are inactive, and domains are abandoned every day. Links can rot when sites disappear, images vanish when servers go offline and fluctuations in economic tides and social trends can wipe out entire ecosystems. (Look up a blog post from a decade ago and see how many of the images, media or links still work.) Tumblr and even Twitter may eventually end up ancient internet history because of their financial instability.There are scattered efforts to preserve digital history. Rhizome, an arts nonprofit group, built a tool called Webrecorder to save parts of today\u2019s internet for future generations. The Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine has archived hundreds of billions of web pages. But there\u2019s still a low-grade urgency to save our social media for posterity \u2014 and it\u2019s particularly urgent in cases in which social media itself had a profound influence on historic events.In August 2014, Bergis Jules, an archivist at the University of California, Riverside, traveled to Washington for the annual meet-up of the Society of American Archivists. The day before the conference began, Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Jules, along with millions of others, found himself glued to Twitter for news, reactions and commentary. In the days that followed, hashtags like #IfTheyGunnedMeDown challenged the narratives presented by the mainstream media and prompted a national dialogue about racial stereotypes and police brutality. Jules teamed up with Ed Summers, a software developer in attendance, and started collecting tweets that included the word \u201cFerguson.\u201dAs an archivist, Jules was struck by the way Twitter \u2014 and all social media, for that matter \u2014 is permanently altering the way we think about history. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking ahead to how we\u2019ll look back,\u201d Jules says. He offered the example of how their project, DocNow, collected tweets tagged with #SayHerName, a campaign that emerged within the Black Lives Matter movement to make the movement more gender inclusive. For now, DocNow is focused mainly on Twitter, but Jules hopes it may be built out in the future to work elsewhere.Social media might one day offer a dazzling, and even overwhelming, array of source material for historians. Such an abundance presents a logistical challenge (the total number of tweets ever written is nearing half a trillion) as well as an ethical one (will people get to opt out of having ephemeral thoughts entered into the historical record?). But this plethora of new media and materials may function as a totally new type of archive: a multidimensional ledger of events that academics, scholars, researchers and the general public can parse to generate a more prismatic recollection of history.In March, I participated in a talk at the Museum of Modern Art about racial and gender disparity among Wikipedia contributors and how it influences the texture of the site. (Roughly 80 percent are men, and minorities are underrepresented.) Print out everything about the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe, and you\u2019ll have a heavy tome, but many notable abolitionists and female scientists are practically nonexistent. Considering that Wikipedia is the sixth-\u00admost-\u00advisited site in the world and increasingly treated like the encyclopedia of record, this problem seems worth considering. After the discussion, Kyra Gaunt, a professor and social-\u00admedia researcher, approached me. In her spare time, she maintains the \u201ctwerking\u201d entry on Wikipedia, which is embroiled in a never-\u00adending debate about how to define the dance move. Is it more crucial to highlight its roots in black culture or Miley Cyrus\u2019s impact on its mainstream popularity? Even new historical records like Wikipedia can be derailed by old biases reasserting themselves. At least Wikipedia publishes each page\u2019s edit history, so as long as it can keep its servers running, there will be a rich catalog for future historians to see what we argued about and why.The internet is pushing us \u00ad\u2014 in good ways and in bad \u2014 to realize that the official version of events shouldn\u2019t always be trusted or accepted without question. And historians are constantly updating the record by looking for primary sources that were overlooked in earlier eras, often from marginalized figures. These days, such omissions will still happen, but we can catch them faster. Oversights that would have taken decades to correct are now resolved in weeks, even hours. We now get a kaleidoscopic view of events as they unfold, often in real time, on our screens and devices. History is not neutral or synonymous with truth, but the internet affords us a newfound vantage on the totality of passing time \u2014 the profound implications of which we are just now beginning to grasp.Last year, two scientists presented a theory in quantum mechanics that they called \u201centangled histories.\u201d They argue that the existence of a particle in space is fractured along many alternate timelines, all of which must be considered to understand the full chronology of its life cycle. It is baffling and exhilarating in the way only quantum physics can be, but one idea stood out as particularly resonant. Jordan Cotler, an author of the paper and a graduate student at Stanford Univer\u00adsity, has said, \u201cOur best description of the past is not a fixed chronology but multiple chronologies that are intertwined with each other.\u201d We\u2019ve long known that this is how human history works \u2014 an unimaginable number of small stories, compressed into one big one. But maybe now we finally have the ability to record and capture them all, and history can become something else entirely: not a handful of voices, but a cacophony.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 Season 3, Episode 8: Erlich\u2019s Charade", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported bySilicon ValleyPerhaps the quintessential shot of Erlich Bachman pops up near the end of \u201cBachman\u2019s Earning\u2019s Over-Ride,\u201d in the moments after the self-styled tech visionary has finally hit bottom. As the Pied Piper team celebrates 100,000 installs in 10 days and smiting its nemeses at Hooli, Erlich sits alone on the back porch, smoking weed out of a formal glass pipe. We\u2019ve seen him inhale through many vessels, so the choice of bong is significant: This is Erlich at his most distinguished and professorial, looking one tweed jacket away from a tenured position at Sarah Lawrence. He is an absurd man who longs to be taken seriously.The shot appropriately bookends an episode that opens with Erlich joining Richard on a Bloomberg TV segment, where he pronounces the \u201cc\u201d in the words \u201cEmbarcadero\u201d and \u201cSan Francisco\u201d with the Spanish \u201cth\u201d sound. He\u2019s at once the high-chinned father of Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest compression company and the numbskull who dumped his 10 percent stake in Pied Piper to cover debts from a separate venture. As the ultimate pretend-sophisticate, Erlich loves to hold court, but reality has humbled him, made him desperate. There ostensibly to promote Pied Piper, he\u2019s fishing for new business to bail him out of his Bachmanity debacle, with the sad proviso that prospective incubees can find him in the White Pages under \u201cErlich Blachman.\u201d He looks like a pitchman heading into the last hour of an all-night infomercial.At this point, Richard doesn\u2019t know that Erlich sold his stock to Laurie Bream the night before the platform\u2019s triumphant launch, which adds an almost childlike poignancy to Erlich\u2019s plight, as if he\u2019s hiding a bad report card from his parents. He\u2019s spent the last 10 days basking in the sun, pretending that he\u2019s Jobs to Richard\u2019s Wozniak and making himself available for press appearances and photo shoots. On the phone, he begs Monica to let him keep Richard in the dark for another 24 hours, just so he can attend an exclusive Vanity Fair dinner, for which he\u2019s already requested a pesca-pescatarian meal. (A pesca-pescatarian, he explains, is someone who only eats fish eaten by other fish.) Erlich will extend this charade for all its worth.Erlich\u2019s separation from the group this season has given \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d a more varied dynamic, where success and failure can coexist or perhaps meet somewhere in the middle. When Erlich, Richard and the gang were trying to get the company off the ground, their fortunes were tethered together, so their endless setbacks had all of them pushing that Sisyphean boulder up the hill. On Sunday night\u2019s episode, Richard and his engineers are riding higher than they\u2019ve ever been, hailed as a \u201cunicorn\u201d company that could be worth billions. Meanwhile, Gavin Belson, Richard\u2019s b\u00eate noire, has been ousted by the Hooli board, which isn\u2019t persuaded by his tortoise-and-the-hare metaphor. (After decrying the bulldog earlier this season, Gavin blasts the \u201cinsolent and cocksure hare.\u201d The entire animal kingdom should consider itself on notice.) And then there\u2019s Erlich, eager for an encore after Pied Piper, blowing Big Head\u2019s $20 million settlement on juicers, a tech blog and a $1 million luau at Alcatraz.Erlich\u2019s series of misfortunes aside, \u201cBachman\u2019s Earning\u2019s Over-Ride\u201d was loose enough to allow for a little tomfoolery and the triumphant return of former Pied Piper power brokers Action Jack Barker and Russ Hanneman. The introduction of a hideous green and yellow Pied Piper jacket gives Gilfoyle the chance to torment Dinesh. (\u201cI\u2019m like a suicide bomber of humiliation,\u201d says Gilfoyle, standing next to him in the jacket at the coffee shop. \u201cI\u2019m happy to go out as long as I take you with me. Your shame is my paradise.\u201d) Bringing Jack and Gavin together on an airport tarmac suggests a revenge plot to come, but the show uses the opportunity to parody the absurd wastefulness of executives taking separate private jets to the same location. As for Russ, he\u2019s there to deliver a hunk of exposition about Erlich\u2019s pitiful stock dump, but odiousness is as deliciously ripe as a wedge of French cheese.In the end, though, the episode is another affirmation of friendship as a defining value of Pied Piper. Richard cannot have rumors of a stock dump torpedo his company, but he and his cohorts cannot send out a news release that will ruin Erlich\u2019s career, either. Erlich doesn\u2019t have the discipline and tact to be a passable P.R. chief, but Richard offers him that concession to salvage some measure of dignity from his public failure. \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has shown the many ways Pied Piper could have perished already, but their loyalty to one another could prove to be their undoing.Bytes\u2022 The rats patched onto the arms of the Pied Piper jacket are a great touch, not just for the needless reference to the original story, but as a callback to Jared\u2019s cot in Erlich\u2019s rodent-filled garage.\u2022 Of the wellspring of jokes related to the ugly jacket, Jared\u2019s earnest appraisal stands out: \u201cHowever unattractive this jacket is to you, once you slip it on, everything will change. It\u2019ll shake out its hair and take off its glasses and before you know it, you\u2019ll be in love.\u201d\u2022 Richard\u2019s impulsive decision to give Erlich\u2019s board seat to Jared sets off a maelstrom of conflicted emotions in Jared that Zach Woods handles like four Oscar clips crammed into four seconds. Happiness, fear, regret and compassion smash together like a highway pileup.\u2022 Erlich immediately switches to damage control when Richard threatens to send a news release about his screw-up, but to no avail. The release will go out to everyone. \u201cEven Uproxx?\u201d Yes. Even them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cable Industry Mobilizes Lobbying Army to Block F.C.C. Moves", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In recent weeks, staff members for Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, have asked fellow lawmakers to sign a letter opposing a Federal Communications Commission proposal to limit how broadband providers can share users\u2019 personal data.Last month, 60 lawmakers signed a separate letter voicing their objections to an F.C.C. regulation that would open the market for cable television set-top boxes.What the actions have in common: the financial connections and legwork of cable companies like Comcast.The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, an industry lobbying group, said it had edited the letter shared by Mr. Rush\u2019s staff. Cable industry lobbyists also helped gather the 60 signatures on the set-top-box letter; nearly all of the lawmakers who signed count cable and telecom companies as top campaign donors, according to federal disclosures.The behind-the-scenes activity by cable companies and their industry groups is part of the biggest lobbying push by the $115 billion industry in Washington since 2009, when the government drew up its net neutrality rules. These days, the cable and telecom industries are hiring more lobbyists, issuing warnings that they may sue federal agencies, and making speeches and writing scathing blog posts about policy makers.The trigger? A string of proposed regulations by the F.C.C. that has left cable companies feeling besieged.\u201cThe policy blows we are weathering are not modest regulatory corrections,\u201d Michael K. Powell, president of the N.C.T.A., said in a speech last month. \u201cThey have been thundering, tectonic shifts.\u201dThe cable companies\u2019 frustration has been compounded by concerns that the F.C.C. proposals punish them but reward tech companies like Google. The set-top-box proposal could give those companies access to cable and satellite television programming for their devices and let them track viewer habits for their ad businesses. The broadband privacy rules apply only to cable and telecom companies; tech companies are not included.The F.C.C. has largely adopted recommendations from Google on set-top-box reforms, the cable and telecom companies said. AT&T\u2019s senior vice president for external affairs, Jim Cicconi, has called the plan the \u201cGoogle proposal.\u201d The cable companies also said the F.C.C.\u2019s broadband privacy proposal would be much stronger than any restrictions placed on web companies.So the cable industry has harnessed its vast lobbying resources in Washington to fight back.AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and the N.C.T.A. are also practicing softer forms of lobbying \u2014 such as sponsoring studies and consultants who write op-ed articles \u2014 that cannot be easily traced, analysts and public interest groups like Free Press, which supports several broadband regulations, say.The industry\u2019s focus has been on helping members of Congress write letters of opposition to the F.C.C., including the critical letter shown by Mr. Rush\u2019s staff. The association said an employee contributed \u201cminor suggestions\u201d to the letter from Mr. Rush. Mr. Rush\u2019s spokeswoman, Debra Johnson, said the N.C.T.A. edits \u201cdid not change the substance of the letter\u201d and added that the congressman had a history of standing up for consumer protection issues.Mr. Waxman and other lawmakers who have been critical of the set-top-box plan said they were not financially motivated to weigh in on the issue.\u201cI don\u2019t represent clients on issues I don\u2019t believe in,\u201d Mr. Waxman said.Comcast and AT&T declined to comment on their lobbying activities. The N.C.T.A. declined to comment specifically on lobbying but said the set-top-box reform was widely unpopular and was also opposed by networks geared toward minority audiences as well as movie studios and labor unions.The F.C.C. said its proposals were aimed at creating more competition in the broadband market and protecting consumers.\u201cThese proposals are technology neutral and do not target any one company or sector of the telecommunications industry,\u201d said Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for the F.C.C. \u201cChairman Wheeler\u2019s proposals are about one thing: promoting meaningful competition among service providers so that consumers can have meaningful choices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Daniel Radcliffe and the Art of \u2018Privacy\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe please ask that you turn your cellphones on.\u201dWhile Ms. Rourke, dressed in turquoise sneakers and a flowing cloak, worked on pace and rhythm, Mr. Graham, stubbled and wearing a beige surfer shirt, made notes that would likely result in new pastel-colored pages. The actors\u2019 scripts, an assortment of blue, yellow and pink, already resembled flattened Easter baskets.New interviewees, many of whom will appear as characters, include Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee; Randi Zuckerberg, the former market development director at Facebook; and Sherry Turkle, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology specialist in technology and intimacy, who was tickled to learn that she\u2019ll be played by the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alumna Rachel Dratch.Over a salad lunch in an upstairs office (\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much kale since we\u2019ve come to America,\u201d Ms. Rourke said with some bemusement), the creators discussed what inspired \u201cPrivacy\u201d and how they\u2019re altering it for New York audiences.Ms. Rourke, 39, and Mr. Graham, 33, both grew up in the north of England and describe themselves as private people, so private that they skitter around personal details and consented to share only a few pages from the play\u2019s script.Ms. Rourke wasn\u2019t always this way. \u201cA big part of my childhood was people telling me to stop showing off,\u201d she said. But she later came to embrace a culture in which \u201cit\u2019s quite rare for people to talk freely, openly and constantly about their feelings,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham\u2019s social introversion is even more acute. \u201cI used to be private to the point where it was actually hard for relationships, for friendships, for my family,\u201d he said. He\u2019s had to push himself to become more open, both in his work and in his personal relationships, a trajectory that mirrors the Writer\u2019s journey in the play. \u201cI began to understand there\u2019s only so far you can go unless there\u2019s openness,\u201d he said.For more than a year, they hosted \u201ca two-person book group, reading stuff back and forth,\u201d Ms. Rourke said. They learned about how the internet works, how corporations mine data to focus their advertising, how email has altered written communication, how social media transforms individual psychology.Speedily, they set about interviewing their initial experts. Mr. Graham used his natural shyness and sympathy to coax people into speaking freely. \u201cI do just want to listen,\u201d he said. Ms. Rourke then followed with \u201cthe smash-and-grab for the bit I know we\u2019ll need,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham assembled that testimony into the London version of the script, which also included satirical versions of themselves, a slightly paranoid playwright and a somewhat pushy director. For the New York production the director character has been dropped and the portrayal of the writer now seems less satirical.At first he squirmed while an actor portrayed him, but he came to feel that the character \u201cfelt like me. His paunch was a bit more pronounced than mine but the rest of it was pretty accurate,\u201d Mr. MacAskill wrote.Though Ms. Rourke and Mr. Graham said they were pleased by the enthusiastic response to the play in London, neither considered it finished. Ms. Rourke acknowledged that the original piece had been written with \u201can incredibly tight deadline\u201d and that there were \u201cnotes in the margins that we didn\u2019t get to address.\u201dTo help the piece to resonate with New Yorkers, they\u2019ve now interviewed some two-dozen United States experts. Ms. Rourke noted that, \u201cGenerally, the British are unconcerned about the state having their data but reluctant to share their personal histories.\u201d In America it\u2019s been the opposite. The number of audience interactions have been increased and there is a more graceful emphasis on the connections between the personal choices each individual makes (what to reveal to another person, what to disseminate online) and larger political trade-offs between liberty and security.During the London run, some critics complained that the play was ultimately too diffuse, that it didn\u2019t advocate strongly enough for any particular stance. That\u2019s one element that Mr. Graham and Ms. Rourke have chosen not to alter, in part because they\u2019re still making up their minds. If they are sometimes suspicious of technology, they are also reliant on it and sometimes excited and consoled by it.Besides, as Mr. Graham explained, the conversation around privacy and technology \u201cis moving at such light speed and it\u2019s going to evolve and change over the course of our lives.\u201d He has no interest in writing \u201cthe kind of play that makes its audience think \u2018we\u2019ve lost our freedoms, we\u2019ve lost our privacy, I\u2019m going to go down into the basement and wear a tin hat and never interact with anyone again,\u2019\u201d he said. Rather, he wants to spark discussion and debate.The conversation around privacy clearly engages Mr. Radcliffe, 26. Having been cast in the Harry Potter franchise as a preadolescent, the continuum between the private and the public is very real for him.\u201cPeople probably perceive me as someone who doesn\u2019t have very much privacy,\u201d he said during a rehearsal lunch break. \u201cI still feel like I have a lot and it\u2019s very important.\u201d To preserve this, he keeps away from social media platforms. He\u2019s never tried online dating; he doesn\u2019t Instagram his meals. (As he skipped lunch in favor of a black-currant drink and a cigarette, there may not be much to Instagram.)Mostly he finds this minimal online presence liberating. \u201cWhen I see my friends I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been up to, we can have a conversation about it,\u201d he said. But he clearly still worries about how much privacy he can and should maintain. When a reporter observed that he seemed far less neurotic than the Writer, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just masking that well,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of me in the character.\u201dDuring rehearsal that character is changing. The playwright is changing, too. As he has worked on the script, Mr. Graham has reduced his online presence, lessening his use of Twitter and Facebook. He\u2019s no Luddite, but he\u2019s thinking more deliberately about how he shows himself to the world \u2014 the online one, the real one.\u201cIt\u2019s about how much control do you have, how much consciousness do you have and how happy you are,\u201d he said, spearing another forkful of kale. \u201cThis show is not in any way trying to say throw your cellphones away.\u201dAn article last Sunday misstated the day that the play \u201cPrivacy\u201d was scheduled to begin performances. It was Saturday, July 2 \u2014 not Friday, July 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Common Ground in Interfaith Marriage", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byMr. Diamond was expected to marry a Jewish woman one day and raise Jewish children, a view his mother later reinforced, he said, by asking the religion of every girl he dated.Then, in November 2012, Mr. Diamond, a psychotherapist, met Ashley Mask, a doctoral student researching art museum education. At that time, Ms. Mask had started to reconnect with her Presbyterian upbringing. But after falling in love with Mr. Diamond, she agreed, should they marry, to raise their future children as Jewish.\u201cI had this na\u00efve sense that since we had the same creation story, it wouldn\u2019t be hard,\u201d said Ms. Mask, 38. But it was. As the relationship progressed, she feared abandoning important holiday traditions. At synagogue services, she said, she felt lost. She worried she would always be an outsider.Interfaith couples represent a swiftly rising demographic. Before 1960, only 19 percent of American married couples were of two different religions, according to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center. Today, it\u2019s nearly 40 percent.The trips cost $1,800 a couple \u2014 or about 20 percent of the total cost \u2014 with the remainder picked up by a Jewish family foundation in Boston (which prefers to be unnamed), as well as by Jewish organizations in the cities where Honeymoon Israel operates.Once in Israel, the couples, who are organized into groups of 20, are encouraged to explore Jewish culture and religion. They stay in upscale hotels, lounge by the Mediterranean and visit Jewish, Christian and Muslim historic sites.They also bond with their fellow travelers, other committed couples also struggling to figure out what role religion should play in their marriages, their homes and in the lives of their future children.\u201cThe train has left the station,\u201d said Avi Rubel, a founder of Honeymoon Israel, which expects to send 360 couples this year. Mr. Rubel said the program has no political or religious agenda.\u201cWe don\u2019t care what you believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou married into our family, so you\u2019re in our family. We want couples to explore the issues on their own terms. We\u2019re not trying to dictate how anybody feels about being Jewish or about Israel.\u201dMs. Mask and Mr. Diamond went to Israel in February, three months after their wedding, with the first group organized out of New York City. Ms. Mask was especially relieved to meet so many other Christians in her situation. \u201cIt helped address this fear that I will lose part of my identity,\u201d she said.For Mr. Diamond, the trip \u201cwas all about an open-mindedness to the idea that there are many kinds of Jewish families,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019ve been exposed to most of my life: a celebration instead of a grudging acceptance.\u201dSeth Preminger, 31, and Tracy Lyons, 30, each assumed they would marry within their own faiths. Dr. Preminger, a child and adolescent psychologist in Chicago who was raised Jewish, and Dr. Lyons, a pediatrician in Chicago who was raised Catholic, met in July 2011. \u201cAs a little girl, the only thing I\u2019d ever planned for my wedding was what church I\u2019d get married in and what church music I\u2019d have,\u201d Dr. Lyons said.Neither realized how stressful planning an interfaith wedding would be. The Catholic clergyman who agreed to be an officiant wanted to marry them in a church, but that made Dr. Preminger uncomfortable. It was difficult to find a rabbi willing to be part of a joint ceremony.\u201cIt was really exciting for us to hear these kids talk about growing up in an environment that supports both faiths, especially as we were planning our wedding,\u201d Dr. Lyons said. \u201cThey help you explain the different traditions to extended family.\u201dDr. Preminger said their wedding in May 2015 at the Kenmare Loft, a former factory in Chicago, raised a few eyebrows, but everyone eventually came around.\u201cThe American Jewish community sees this as a public concern for Jews at large,\u201d said Helen Kim, an associate professor of sociology at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. \u201cThey want to mobilize the larger community.\u201d\u201cIn this multicultural, global, diverse world, where people are bringing many differences into a family, the old post-World War II paradigm, where you married the boy next door and everyone went to the same church, has completely changed,\u201d said Sheila Gordon, the group\u2019s president.Some 100 children are enrolled in Interfaith Community\u2019s educational programs, Dr. Gordon said, but the number of couples in the premarital workshops has declined, even as the percentage of interfaith marriages has increased.At least for younger couples, \u201cthe millennial ethos of fairness and respect means they don\u2019t feel threatened by entering into this kind of partnership,\u201d she said. So these couples do not think workshops are necessary.And yet, such programs can be vital for some couples, who do face challenges in joining different faiths.\u201cIt helps to know other people in the same boat,\u201d said Kamran Khan, a Muslim who joined Ms. O\u2019Farrell Smith\u2019s group with his Christian fianc\u00e9e, Corinne Atty. Their wedding, planned for September in Chicago, has caused a rift, with Mr. Khan\u2019s parents disapproving of his relationship and refusing to talk about it or to attend the wedding. But Mr. Khan wants to discuss the difficult questions with Ms. Atty now, \u201cinstead of seven years from now,\u201d he said.Being a part of the Christian-Muslim group at Interfaith Union, he added, has given him a sense of pride about creating a different kind of family. \u201cWe can blaze a trail for others,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the forefront of something.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byJust ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\u201cAmazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,\u201d Mr. Patterson said.Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks \u2014 the inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system \u2014 have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.Already, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems.In a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms.\u201cEvery teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. He added: \u201cWe are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality.\u201dThe site for teachers is not Amazon\u2019s first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.)In March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students.In the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups.Mr. Agarwal said the company\u2019s new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features.\u201cWith the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,\u201d he said.On Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX \u2014 a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches.Google also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Finds Cancer Clues in Search Queries", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byMicrosoft scientists have demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they may in some cases be able to identify internet users who are suffering from pancreatic cancer, even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease.\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Dr. Horvitz said.The researchers focused on searches conducted on Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine, that indicated someone had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. From there, they worked backward, looking for earlier queries that could have shown that the Bing user was experiencing symptoms before the diagnosis. Those early searches, they believe, can be warning flags.While five-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer are extremely low, early detection of the disease can prolong life in a very small percentage of cases. The study suggests that early screening can increase the five-year survival rate of pancreatic patients to 5 to 7 percent, from just 3 percent.The researchers reported that they could identify from 5 to 15 percent of pancreatic cases with false positive rates of as low as one in 100,000. The researchers noted that false positives could lead to raised medical costs or create significant anxiety for people who later found out they were not sick.The data used by the researchers was anonymized, meaning it did not carry identifying markers like a user name, so the individuals conducting the searches could not be contacted.A logical next step would be to figure out what to do with that search information. One possibility would be some sort of health service where users could allow their searches to be collected, allowing scientists to monitor for questions that indicate warning flag symptoms.\u201cThe question, \u2018What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Horvitz, in a reference to the company\u2019s speech-oriented online personal assistant software service.Although the researchers declined to offer specific details, Dr. White is now the chief technology officer of health intelligence in a recently created Health & Wellness division at Microsoft.They acknowledged that health-related data generated from web search histories was still new territory for the medical profession.\u201cI think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data,\u201d Dr. Horvitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation.\u201dThe new research is based on the ability of the Microsoft team to accurately distinguish between web searches that are casual or based on anxiety and those that are genuine searches for specific medical symptoms by people who are experiencing them, he noted.Both a computer scientist and a medical doctor by training, Dr. Horvitz said he had been exploring this area in part because of a phone conversation with a close friend who had described symptoms. Based on their conversation, Dr. Horvitz advised him to contact his doctor. He received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died several months later.The availability of vast sets of behavior data based on individual web queries using the search engines offered by companies like Google and Microsoft has for a number of years been seen as a potential indicator of health-related information.The researchers are exploring evidence related to a range of devastating diseases. They also said that unlike the drug interaction data, which would be of direct value to the F.D.A. as an early alert, it was possible that symptom alert data might be made available as part of a broader online health service that a company like Microsoft might offer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shareholder Initiatives Show Their Value", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsFor all its imperfections, shareholder democracy has real value. For evidence, look no further than a plethora of cases this week in which voting is proving to be of great consequence.Facebook\u2019s board is planning now for the future of the supervoting power of its founder Mark Zuckerberg, while investors in Sika, the Swiss maker of building materials, are fighting the sale of just such a controlling minority stake. Sometimes, as at Tribune Publishing, votes are merely protests. A mistake at the ballot box, however, is costing T. Rowe Price hard cash.It\u2019s too easy to be jaded about some initiatives. For example, the shareholder votes required by the Securities and Exchange Commission on executive pay are not binding. Yet it has turned out that in most cases, boards have tried to change plans if even a large minority \u2013 maybe 30 percent or so \u2013 expresses displeasure with the rewards. In a reversal from the steady increases in recent years, average compensation for the highest-paid American corporate chieftains fell 15 percent in 2015, according to Equilar.Likewise, it\u2019s easy to argue that investors who buy into companies with multiple classes of shares know what they are getting into. Witness the havoc at Viacom, where Sumner Redstone is using his elite voting status to keep a firm grip despite persistent questions over his mental competence.It\u2019s true that for as long as Mr. Zuckerberg or the founders of Google, to name a few, display the golden touch, shareholders are not apt to complain much. The problems tend to come when the people in control mess up at the disproportionate expense of other owners. Mr. Zuckerberg, for example, has 54 percent of the votes at Facebook but only a 15 percent financial interest.To the credit of Facebook\u2019s board, it said on Thursday that it wanted shareholders to approve a change to the terms of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s supervoting Class B shares to ensure that if the he stops running Facebook some day, his shares will convert to normal voting ones.The proposal coincides with Facebook\u2019s plan to issue a new class of nonvoting stock that will further entrench Mr. Zuckerberg for the time being, which is a less-enlightened governance move. Still, it shows a sensible desire to forestall possible tension with investors down the road.That\u2019s exactly what did not happen at Sika. The Burkard family, which controls the company, struck a deal to sell its holding vehicle to the French giant Saint-Gobain for a hefty $2.8 billion, essentially leaving the other shareholders in the cold. The Burkards\u2019 52 percent voting control and 16 percent economic interest mirror Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s position at Facebook.Sika\u2019s independent board members and other investors, including the usually below-the-radar Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, have fought the sale since it was unveiled in late 2014. So far, they have been successful in enforcing noncontrolling shareholder protections that the Burkards have argued do not apply to the sale as structured.Moreover, Sika\u2019s financial performance has held up. But Saint-Gobain said this week that it was set on the deal despite the lengthy battle. The minority shareholders face twin dangers: If they eventually win, the distraction may by then have damaged Sika\u2019s business; and if they lose, the value of their investment will depend entirely on Saint-Gobain. More respect for matters of shareholder democracy could perhaps have avoided the conflict or pointed to a negotiated solution.As when electing people to office, the ballot choices are not always perfect. Gannett, the publishing group whose pursuit of Tribune Publishing has been rebuffed, did not have the right timing to put its own director nominees up for a vote at its target\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. Instead, it asked investors to withhold votes from Tribune Publishing\u2019s own directors.The certified count is not yet available, but Gannett estimates that five of eight directors received less than 50 percent support from Tribune shareholders if board insiders\u2019 votes, including a 16.5 percent stake associated with Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman, are excluded. Tribune Publishing says all directors had majority support.The competing statements are potentially consistent in mathematical terms, and they allow both sides to claim victory. The withheld votes may serve only as a protest, however, if the Tribune Publishing board keeps placing hurdles in the way of discussions with Gannett and instead pursues a jargon-riddled rebranding as Tronc (with a lowercase \u201ct\u201d in the company\u2019s materials) and what looks like a form-over-substance transfer of its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Yet even votes that do not appear to change outcomes can matter. A group of investors who objected to Michael Dell\u2019s $25 billion deal to take his computer company private in 2013 won a ruling in a Delaware court this week that will net them nearly an extra 30 percent on the deal price. T. Rowe Price wanted to be part of the lawsuit, but it was excluded because it mistakenly voted in favor of the buyout at the time.The investment manager is figuring out how to reimburse its clients, who but for the error would have been nearly $200 million better off, according to The Wall Street Journal. It is another argument for all investors, whether the pushier sort or traditionally passive ones, to pay close attention to voting. Even second-order effects can cost real money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Won the Keys to Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byChina Rules10 PhotosSHANGHAI \u2014 Disney had pushed China too hard, putting the company\u2019s plans for a new theme park here in limbo. Now, Robert A. Iger wanted to kick the yearslong negotiations into high gear.Mr. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, took a corporate jet to Shanghai in February 2008 to meet with the city\u2019s new Communist Party boss, Yu Zhengsheng. Over dinner at a state guesthouse, Mr. Iger offered a more conciliatory approach, setting the tone for the next phase of talks.After that, Disney substantially dialed back its demands. In addition to handing over a large piece of the profit, the control-obsessed company would give the government a role in running the park. Disney was also prepared to drop its longstanding insistence on a television channel.For Disney, such moves were once unthinkable. Giving up on the Disney Channel meant abandoning the company\u2019s proven brand-building strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to get everything we want,\u201d Mr. Iger recalled saying at the time.Mr. Iger\u2019s trip and the new attitude in the talks that followed appeased Chinese officials. Before long, they had struck a landmark deal to build the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, opening China to a singularly American brand and setting the pace for multinational companies to do business in the country.But Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with the Communist Party. While that partnership has made it easier to get things done in China, it has also given the government influence over everything from the price of admission to the types of rides at the park.Worried that importing classic rides would reek of cultural imperialism, Disney left out stalwarts such as Space Mountain, the Jungle Cruise and It\u2019s a Small World. Instead, 80 percent of the Shanghai rides, like the \u201cTron\u201d lightcycle roller coaster, are unique, a move that pleased executives at the company\u2019s Chinese partner, the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, who made multiple trips to Disney headquarters in California to hash out blueprint details.Disney then ran with the idea, infusing the park with Chinese elements. The Shanghai resort\u2019s signature restaurant, the Wandering Moon Teahouse, has rooms designed to represent different areas of the country. The restaurant is billed as honoring the \u201crestless, creative spirit\u201d of Chinese poets.Such accommodation is becoming increasingly common. A growing number of multinationals have agreed to cooperate with the Chinese state through alliances, joint ventures or partnerships, all in the hopes of garnering more favorable treatment and gaining access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States.\u201cThis is part of the China trade-off,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cIf your market is so big, we\u2019ll accept rules and regulations we wouldn\u2019t in other parts of the world.\u201dFor Disney, if all goes as planned, the Shanghai park will create an ecosystem of demand in China for movies, toys, clothes, video games, books and TV programs. Mr. Iger has called Shanghai the \u201cgreatest opportunity the company has had since Walt Disney himself bought land in Central Florida\u201d in the 1960s.That site, of course, became Walt Disney World, a group of four theme parks that attracts roughly 40 million visitors annually. About 11 million visitors are expected next year at the Shanghai park, with annual attendance estimated to reach 20 million within a few years, according to Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If all doesn\u2019t go as planned, Disney will suffer the wrath of Wall Street, which expects the resort to offset slower growth at ESPN, the company\u2019s longtime profit engine, and some of its other theme parks. The last thing Disney wants is another Disneyland Paris, a money pit that suffered from cultural miscues and, after 24 years, is still struggling to turn a profit. Hong Kong Disneyland, which is relatively small, has had mixed financial results since opening in 2005.While he delegated certain duties to lieutenants, Mr. Iger has been the guiding force. He pre-tasted the food, which will include items like pork knuckles and Donald Duck-shaped waffles, and decided which characters would appear in the parade. He has held face-to-face talks with Chinese presidents, prime ministers and propaganda officials.Mr. Iger, 65, has sought a personal relationship with China\u2019s paramount leader, President Xi Jinping. After Mr. Iger learned that Mr. Xi\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader, had visited Disneyland in 1980, he pressed his staff to find a photograph. A color photograph shows the president\u2019s father, who died in 2002, wearing a Mao suit, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Mr. Iger presented it to the Chinese leader as a gift and a symbol of their partnership.When Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle last September, Mr. Iger was among the American executives on hand to welcome him. At the White House state dinner a few days later, Mr. Iger was seated at Mr. Xi\u2019s table. Just last month, Mr. Iger flew to Beijing to meet the president at the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the fruits of efforts over the years,\u201d a smiling Mr. Xi told Mr. Iger at a public meeting between the men at the Great Hall of the People in early May. \u201cAnd I believe the new cooperation will continue to yield new outcomes.\u201dIt may be all smiles now, but Mickey Mouse knows all too well what can happen when the Middle Kingdom gets mad.The year was 1997, and Disney had finally found a bit of success in China. \u201cThe Dragon Club,\u201d a Disney cartoon series, was popular in Chinese homes, and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d had given Disney its first big hit in Chinese cinemas. But then came \u201cKundun.\u201dAs part of a now-defunct effort to make films for more sophisticated audiences, Disney agreed to back the director Martin Scorsese, who wanted to make \u201cKundun,\u201d about China\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Chinese government, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, denounced the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.In the end, Disney decided that it could not let an overseas government influence its decision to distribute a movie in the United States. \u201cKundun\u201d was released, and China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling \u201cThe Dragon Club.\u201d\u201cAll of our business in China stopped overnight,\u201d Disney\u2019s chief executive at the time, Michael D. Eisner, recalled.Although \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was screened in Shanghai in the 1930s, Disney really had no measurable business in China until decades later, when Mr. Eisner secured Sunday evening placement for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons on the country\u2019s biggest state-run broadcaster. That led to Mickey\u2019s Corner kiosks that sold consumer goods like Minnie Mouse-branded shampoo, and to more television shows.By the time of the \u201cKundun\u201d debacle, the demand was clearly there. Mr. Eisner just needed to undo the damage.Disney hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and mounted an intense lobbying effort. In October 1998, Mr. Eisner met Zhu Rongji, who had just been named prime minister, at China\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Mr. Eisner apologized for \u201cKundun,\u201d calling it a \u201cstupid mistake,\u201d according to a transcript of the meeting.\u201cThis film was a form of insult to our friends, but other than journalists, very few people in the world ever saw it,\u201d Mr. Eisner said during the meeting. (\u201cKundun\u201d bombed, taking in just $5.7 million against a production budget of about $30 million.)Mr. Eisner said the company had learned a lesson. And he introduced Mr. Iger, then Disney\u2019s international president, as the person who would carry on negotiations for a theme park. The Chinese prime minister responded favorably. Land in Shanghai, he said, had already been set aside.And just like that, the door to China started to reopen.The negotiations that followed were slow and painful. Disney had to navigate a thicket of agencies, bureaucrats and officials. At one point, Disney essentially had to start over in Shanghai, after a senior Chinese official was abruptly arrested on corruption charges unrelated to the park.There were sticking points large and small. Who would control the park? What kind of transportation infrastructure would support it? How were Disney\u2019s nightly fireworks shows going to work in smoggy Shanghai? There was also the not-so-minor matter of introducing Disney characters to a country whose icon, since the Communists took power in 1949, was Mao.\u201cDisney had to educate the Chinese government on how they operate, and the government wanted to persuade Disney that they needed a local partner to make this thing work,\u201d said Tang Jun, one of Mr. Iger\u2019s former lieutenants in China.By 2009, the Chinese government was finally on board. It took a 57 percent stake in the Shanghai resort, which includes revenue from hotels, restaurants and merchandise sold on the grounds. Disney also gave the government a 30 percent piece of the Disney management company that runs the property.It was in stark contrast to the deal with Hong Kong. Desperate to end a tourism slump, Hong Kong had given Disney breathtaking terms, including providing a majority of the construction funds. Disney gave up no management control.Confetti was blasted into the air. A 50-member children\u2019s choir sang as Chinese dancers and drummers paraded onstage. Mickey and Minnie Mouse frolicked in traditional Chinese costumes.\u201cThis is a defining moment in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cAlong with our partner, the Shanghai Shendi Group, today I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Shanghai Disney Resort.\u201dWhen the Communist Party first invited overseas companies into the country in 1979, global businesses had to team up with the state. It wasn\u2019t pretty.As commercial interests clashed with socialist principles, there were wage disputes, allegations of intellectual property theft and conflicts over corporate strategy. To put it in the parlance of a Chinese proverb, it was like two people sleeping in the \u201csame bed, dreaming different dreams.\u201dPepsi found itself managing a tanning factory, as part of its Chinese partnership. McDonnell Douglas claimed that some machine tools had been diverted to a factory that made missiles, in violation of United States rules. The American and Chinese partners in Beijing Jeep disagreed over quality control.\u201cI now tell people, \u2018If you don\u2019t have to do a joint venture, don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Don St. Pierre Sr., an American businessman who worked for Beijing Jeep.After the blowups, China started to allow some companies to go it alone. But Disney didn\u2019t have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the park\u2019s front gate.The partnership is \u201cstructured so that it will work,\u201d said Mr. Iger. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount riding on it.\u201dBut Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade China\u2019s economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the city\u2019s easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disney\u2019s site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises \u201cperformances\u201d by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.\u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201dThe partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disney\u2019s new resort.The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the world\u2019s largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the park\u2019s television and advertising budget, since it controls the city\u2019s biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.\u201cThe more partners you have, the more potential conflicts,\u201d said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.\u201cEach of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations,\u201d he added. A multinational must then \u201ccontend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.\u201dWhen Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesn\u2019t require a ticket.\u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wang\u2019s criticism as \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. \u201cWe made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and there\u2019s a cost to that,\u201d he said.Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of China\u2019s political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disney\u2019s expansion and growth.\u201cI suggest that we shouldn\u2019t allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built\u201d in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. \u201cIf children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.\u201dDisney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with China\u2019s propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the company\u2019s global platform to \u201cintroduce more about China to the world.\u201d And he has done just that.\u201cWhen global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China,\u201d said John A. Quelch, who teaches at Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in China. \u201cThey need to demonstrate that they are willing to promote things the government is interested in.\u201dMr. Iger is trying especially to give Shanghai Disney some Chinese flair. He instructed park designers to infuse as many Chinese elements as possible.Builders collected indigenous trees from all around China, including a 59-foot chestnut oak from Zhejiang Province, to adorn the grounds. A \u201cTarzan\u201d show was directed by Li Xining, an acrobatics expert who once worked for the Chengdu Military Area Command under the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The Broadway version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will be performed entirely in Mandarin \u2014 a first.Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.\u201cWhat are we doing here that will make this park successful in China?\u201d Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. \u201cOne of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that it\u2019s theirs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Red Buys \u2018Step Up,\u2019 Its First Big-Budget TV Drama", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 YouTube Red, the Google-owned paid streaming service, has acquired its first big-budget, Hollywood-produced television drama, moving it into more direct competition with players like Netflix and traditional cable networks.\u201cBigger, bolder\u201d and an offering that will \u201cdrive subscription\u201d is how Susanne Daniels, YouTube\u2019s global head of original content, described the still-untitled series in an interview. Kevin Beggs, Lionsgate\u2019s television chairman, called it \u201ca distinctive, noisy, platform-defining series\u201d that \u201cmultiple networks wanted.\u201dMr. Tatum will be an executive producer of the drama, expected to arrive next year. It will cost several million dollars per episode to make, signaling the arrival of YouTube Red as a major-league buyer of content. The series, which will feature YouTube stars as dancers and actors, will be set at a performing arts high school and be most similar in tone to the first of the five \u201cStep Up\u201d movies.\u201cIt is hard to tell whether the effort is succeeding or will succeed,\u201d Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a client report last month. \u201cIt is possible that it might be too little too late.\u201d Notably, Mr. Kirjner cited a lack of \u201chigh-production-value content\u201d as one of YouTube Red\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going to resonate,\u201d Ms. Daniels said. \u201cYou just have to sort of jump in the water.\u201dStill, the \u201cStep Up\u201d project represents a very educated guess. \u201cDance videos on YouTube drive millions of hours of watch time every month,\u201d Ms. Daniels said, adding that dance is a popular genre for YouTube around the world. YouTube Red is available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and has plans for overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.Music videos are also enormously popular on YouTube \u2014 the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies are known for their music-backed montages \u2014 and some of the biggest traditional television hits of the last decade, including \u201cEmpire,\u201d \u201cGlee\u201d and NBC\u2019s live musicals, have been rooted in song.Mr. Beggs of Lionsgate said that Ms. Daniels was able to nab the series in part because she was willing to commit to a full season without first making a pilot episode as a test. \u201cThat got everyone\u2019s attention,\u201d he said.The deal got its start at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Los Angeles home of Erik Feig, co-president of Lionsgate\u2019s movie division. Ms. Daniels was among the guests. That night, \u201cErik said the studio was getting ready to talk to distributors about a \u2018Step Up\u2019 TV show, and so I immediately started my hot pursuit,\u201d she said.More than most other Hollywood studios, Lionsgate has been early to spot the promise of streaming services as buyers of high-end television shows. Lionsgate\u2019s production roster includes \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d for Netflix and \u201cCasual,\u201d which was renewed on Hulu for a third season. (The now-concluded \u201cMad Men\u201d is still Lionsgate\u2019s best-known series, however.)Will \u201cStep Up\u201d provide the studio with another television hit, the kind that mints money by running multiple seasons? It is too early to say, of course, but Mr. Feig, who has been involved with the \u201cStep Up\u201d franchise from its beginning, has high hopes.Advertisement"}

The bride\u2019s father was a consul at the Egyptian consulate in New York. The bride is also the adopted daughter of Martin D. Ferenczi, the president of the North American region of Oberthur Technologies, a software developer and producer of chip payment cards in Chantilly, Va.The groom, also 29, is a physicist for the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab in Venice, Calif., where he designs and analyzes superconducting quantum circuits. He graduated from Rice University and received a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Maryland.He is a son of Orna Z. Kafri of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Tal Kafri of Carrboro, N.C. The groom\u2019s mother is a registered nurse at UNC Health Care, a nonprofit medical system owned by the State of North Carolina and based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His father is an associate professor of microbiology and immunology in the Gene Therapy Center, also at the University of North Carolina.The couple met in February 2013 at a kickball game with mutual friends in Silver Spring, Md.\u201cI thought she was really cute,\u201d said Mr. Kafri, who had a girlfriend at the time. \u201cShe was really sweet and very charming.\u201dIn September, Ms. Abou Negm and Mr. Kafri met again at her housewarming party in Washington, but it was no coincidence. Ms. Abou Negm had returned from the Peace Corps less than a year before and only knew a few people in the city, so she invited five friends, and told each of them to bring along a friend of their own. That opened the door for Mr. Kafri, who was now single and tagging along with a mutual friend in the hope of becoming better acquainted with Ms. Abou Negm, whom he remembered from their kickball game.\u201cI really wanted to see her again,\u201d he said.\u201cI liked him right away,\u201d Ms. Abou Negm said. \u201cI sort of remembered him from kickball, and I thought he was very cute and very nice.\u201dThe next day, Ms. Abou Negm noticed a long footnote about quantum entanglement in the novel she was reading, \u201cA Visit From the Goon Squad,\u201d and texted Mr. Kafri. When she broached the subject with him, he took the opportunity to broach another with her: lunch.The next weekend they went on their first date, to a Dominican restaurant in Washington, and began dating steadily thereafter.\u201cHe had such a great sense of humor and he was very smart,\u201d she said.\u201cShe seemed to love life more than anyone else I had ever met,\u201d he said.In June 2015, Ms. Abou Negm returned to Metu, with Mr. Kafri in tow.\u201cIt had been such a huge part of my life and I still had friends there,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to share what I had been through and seen with Dvir.\u201dA week later, they were still in Ethiopia and hiking on the highlands of Lalibela, overlooking a troop of gelada baboons and a flock of shepherd boys behind them in the distance, when Mr. Kafri reached for the engagement ring he had brought along.\u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, how romantic do you think this scene is?\u201d he asked Ms. Abou Negm, who was now sitting beside him in the grass.When she replied \u201cseven,\u201d Mr. Kafri began putting the ring away for a more appropriate time, but just then, Ms. Abou Negm, realizing why she had been asked the question, began blurting out \u201c10! 10!\u201dHe then proposed and slipped the ring on her finger, and Ms. Abou Negm began to cry.\u201cIt was a rather surreal moment, but there were no witnesses,\u201d Mr. Kafri said, \u201cexcept for the baboons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Grand Rendition of Beethoven. It Takes Up a Million Square Feet, in Fact.", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byGrace Notes6 PhotosELLENVILLE, N.Y. \u2014 Roger Baker walked across Beethoven\u2019s hair, down to the left eye and over to the right eye.The canvas is a huge field where cows once grazed. The artist is a man who was inspired while listening to Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas on long-playing records that he found at a yard sale. His tools include four tractors.\u201cBeethoven\u2019s got great hair \u2014 what can I tell you?\u201d said Mr. Baker, who is a commercial artist and sculptor when he is not creating colossal portraits in grass. \u201cHis hair is timeless. It was good back then, and it would go good today. Great image. When you see a picture of Beethoven, you just know who it is. You look at that scowling face, you think, dun-dun-dun-DUH.\u201d There was no mistaking the famous four-note opening of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 5 (Op. 67), even as he insisted he could not carry a tune.The likeness in the grass is familiar, based on a painting of Beethoven in his late 40s \u2014 middle age, according to the calendar; late period, according to the opus numbers. But Mr. Baker\u2019s Beethoven differs from the painting. This Beethoven\u2019s complexion is blemished by woodchuck holes. His right shoulder is cut off by a creek.And Beethoven\u2019s prominent forehead? \u201cA great place to land a helicopter,\u201d Mr. Baker said, after explaining that the height of the portrait is more than 1,000 feet and that it includes only Beethoven\u2019s head and shoulders.Mr. Baker has been called a da Vinci of the lawn mower, an El Greco of the grass. He has done large-form cuttings of the Statue of Liberty, Albert Einstein, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley and the motorcycle builder and biker Larry Desmedt, better known as Indian Larry. He also snipped and trimmed an 850,000-square-foot Purple Heart medal.Beethoven, a high-culture idol, was a departure for Mr. Baker, who said he had never attended a classical-music concert. He dabbled with the clarinet and the saxophone when he was growing up on the Jersey Shore. But painting beckoned after high school.Now 62, he is a happy straggler when it comes to technology. He still has a flip phone, and he has never \u2014 yes, never \u2014 used Google. His main research tool is the World Book Encyclopedia, a 19-volume set from 1956 (those seeking further explanation of what that is can look it up on Google).That was where he found the image of Beethoven that he adapted for the field. As for the LPs at the yard sale \u2014 recordings of the pianist Alfred Brendel \u2014 \u201cI paid five bucks for them,\u201d he said.The records were in perfect condition, he said, and he played them over and over, carefully lowering the needle to avoid scratching the old vinyl surfaces. Before he settled on Beethoven, he considered other famous musicians who happened to have impressive hair: Leonard Bernstein, Luciano Pavarotti, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Franz Liszt, even Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Mr. Baker pulled Volume 11, the \u201cM\u201d volume of the World Book, off a shelf and read up on Mozart. He was unimpressed. \u201cMozart didn\u2019t have the verve,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI look at the portrait of Beethoven and think, \u2018dun-dun-dun-DUH.\u2019 Mozart was just kind of standing there.\u201dSo Beethoven it was, and not just the portrait. He sketched the nine letters of the composer\u2019s family name below the image. He decided ordinary-looking letters were not enough, so he copied Beethoven\u2019s signature. The \u201cB\u201d is more than 90 feet tall. And he got permission to use the field rent-free \u2014 it is owned by friends, he said.\u201cThe field dictated the size of the portrait,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cWhen I do fields, I have to count square feet. Acres, it doesn\u2019t sound as great.\u201d Beethoven covers about a million square feet. That works out to 23 acres, given the shape of the field.Mr. Baker figured out a grid system, dividing the field into 100-foot-by-100-foot squares. He subdivided each square into 10-by-10 chunks and waded into the grass, carrying a 3-foot-by-4-foot mock-up.He planted orange flags, some to mark off squares, some to warn of woodchuck holes. He and his mowing crew assigned nicknames to features of Beethoven\u2019s face that, in extra-large scale, look more like land formations on a map \u2014 \u201cMadagascar\u201d for a piece of the collar that had the shape of the island off Africa, \u201cThousand Islands\u201d for the cravat.The machines were lined up at the edge of the field, waiting to give Beethoven\u2019s chin a close shave or to add a bit of shadow to his cheek. The smallest was a push mower (for \u201cnarrow detail,\u201d Mr. Baker explained). Next was a riding mower (\u201cI use that to outline\u201d). A big blue tractor sat alongside a smaller orange one (for gradations).Mr. Baker, standing in the giant \u201cB\u201d of Beethoven\u2019s signature, said he had heard that before. He countered by saying that the project was not so far-fetched.\u201cWe\u2019re just mowing a lawn,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two More Top Law Firms Raise Associates\u2019 Pay", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byMilbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy said on Tuesday that it would match the raise Cravath announced on Monday, bringing the basic annual pay for new law school graduates to $180,000. On the heels of that announcement, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with some 900 lawyers, also said it would bump up its associates\u2019 pay scale to match.The three leading firms will now pay associates on a scale that rises from $180,000 for first-year associates to $315,000 a year, or slightly more, after eight years of service. In addition, associates can earn annual bonuses, which range from $15,000 for the newest lawyers to as much as $100,000 for more seasoned ones.Scott A. Edelman, Milbank\u2019s chairman, said the firm\u2019s new salary scale, set to take effect on July 1, did not come about \u201cbecause of agitation or demands from our associates\u201d but was intended \u201cto ensure the firm\u2019s attorneys were paid consistent with the top firms.\u201dThe decision to move speedily on raising salaries was made, he said, because \u201cwe wanted our associates to know how much we value them.

That is, being a central contact for the music business, someone who speaks the same language as artists and their managers, and can help secure content for the service.Mr. Carter declined to comment, and a spokesman for Spotify declined to speak further about the deal.Spotify, which has led the music industry\u2019s shift to streaming, continues to face strong competition from Apple, Tidal and other services, as it has for the last year. Exclusive content deals, like the ones that propelled new albums by Drake at Apple and Beyonc\u00e9 at Tidal, have emerged as the most potent form of warfare, helping those services draw millions of new subscribers and forge tight bonds with superstar acts.So far, Spotify has been reluctant to make such exclusive deals on new albums.\u201cWe believe long-term exclusives are bad for artists and they\u2019re bad for fans,\u201d Jonathan Prince, a Spotify spokesman, said in April after the release of the Beyonc\u00e9 album \u201cLemonade,\u201d which is widely available for sale but can be streamed only through Tidal.Spotify says it has at least 89 million regular users around the world, including 30 million who pay for subscriptions.

{"Headline": "One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cLet me explain why.\u201dJeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn \u201cto control our own destiny.\u201dBut there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn\u2019s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}

Kenneth Lerer, the venture capitalist who helped found The Huffington Post and is the chairman at BuzzFeed, and Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial, are being considered, according to people briefed on the discussions. Also on the list are Judith McHale, the former Discovery Communications chief, and Thomas J. May, the chairman of Eversource Energy utility company, these people said. It is unclear whether these people have formally accepted the positions. The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 board being illegitimate. There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed. If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws. Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in. Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash, but because it is so hard for banks to know the identity of the final customer, remittances companies and their agents are being categorized as high risk for money laundering.

Last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering and shut down its Banamex USA Unit.

{"Headline": "Chrysler Hopes New Pacifica Can Make Minivan Cool", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byWheelsFor years, automakers have been stumped by this question: How do you make a minivan seem cool?Adam Silverleib, who has been selling Honda Odyssey minivans for more than 25 years at his dealership in Raynham, Mass., says it is not easy.\u201cThere are not many people who come in and are just dying to buy an Odyssey,\u201d Mr. Silverleib said. \u201cThey buy one because they have four kids and it\u2019s the easiest way to get around, and they bite the bullet, even though they don\u2019t want to be seen in a minivan.\u201dNow Chrysler, which invented the minivan in the 1980s, hopes it has the answer in the Pacifica, a new model that has just started to roll out of a plant in Windsor, Ontario.The Pacifica, which replaces the venerable Town & Country minivan in the Chrysler lineup, has promising attributes, including improved fold-flat seats in the back and high-definition video screens for the children. Its sculptured design softens the most scorned characteristic of any minivan \u2014 the boring, boxy shape. A hybrid model, a first among minivans, will arrive this fall and should go about 80 miles on a gallon of gas, Chrysler said.Beyond that, the Pacifica now has an unexpected, influential fan: Google. As part of its push to develop self-driving cars, the tech giant announced a partnership with Chrysler\u2019s parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, last month. Together they will install Google\u2019s automated driving sensors and computers in about 100 specially modified Pacifica hybrids.Could this give Detroit\u2019s new minivan some Silicon Valley sheen? \u201cHaving this high-profile of Google technology going into the vehicle does give the vehicle a little more forward-looking image,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto researcher Edmunds.com. \u201cI imagine, in the short term, it will get a bump in interest.\u201dStill, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Google connection will obliterate the stigma attached to minivans.\u201dSuccess is crucial for Fiat Chrysler. Its minivans are an important source of profit, with its Jeeps and Ram trucks. It cannot afford a misstep with the Pacifica because its small and midsize cars \u2014 the Dodge Dart, the Chrysler 200 and the Fiat line \u2014 have performed poorly. The company spent billions of dollars to develop those cars and retool plants to make them, but sales have been so sluggish that Fiat Chrysler plans to stop making the Dart and 200, and it is allowing dealers to close Fiat showrooms.Even with Google\u2019s help, the Pacifica faces an uphill climb, given the lowly standing minivans have in the automobile market. The minivan was created when Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan in 1983, just as many baby boomers were entering child-rearing years.The minivan\u2019s roominess and the ease of loading children and cargo through its sliding doors revolutionized family travel. Before long, minivans dotted suburban driveways across the country. In 2000, 1.37 million minivans, from more than 15 automotive brands, were sold in the United States \u2014 one-sixth of all new cars sold that year.But by then, minivans had come to symbolize utilitarian drudgery, and Americans began migrating to sport utility vehicles, with their brawnier, more adventurous image. Sales of minivans have declined steadily since. Ford Motor and General Motors stopped making them.In 2015, while total United States auto sales surged to a record high, minivan sales fell 9 percent to 507,217 vehicles, accounting for just 3 percent of the market.Only six manufacturers still produce minivans. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s main competition comes from Honda and Toyota. Nissan, Hyundai and Kia are smaller minivan players.Pacifica\u2019s price ranges from around $29,000 for a basic model to about $44,000 for a fully loaded version, about the same as large S.U.V.s with three rows of seats.For car buyers like Nick Fohr, a hockey coach in Dexter, Mich., weighing a minivan against an S.U.V. is part of the math of a growing family.With two young sons, Mr. Fohr and his wife decided they could no longer get by with her driving a Ford Focus. They really wanted an S.U.V., but last week they traded the Ford for an Odyssey.\u201cWe looked at the space, the ease of getting the kids in and out, the DVD player,\u201d he said. With a laugh, he added, \u201cSo far she likes it, but she\u2019s getting a lot of grief from her friends for having a minivan.\u201dBruce Velisek, director of product marketing for Chrysler vehicles, acknowledges that the company is taking a risk with the Pacifica. Chrysler is retiring the well-known Town & Country name, and going with the name it used for a slow-selling model that was on the market for just five years, from 2004 through 2008.The automaker has also invested heavily in the new minivan. It improved fuel economy by making lightweight doors from aluminum and the liftgate from magnesium, added a noise canceling system to quiet the cabin, built in wireless connectivity for iPads and games and developed a nine-speed transmission.But after years of declining minivan sales, the company is counting on getting a lift from demographics, Mr. Velisek said. The millennial generation, the 83 million Americans born between 1982 and 2000, according to some estimates, outnumbers the baby boomer generation and is now starting families. Mr. Velisek said the number of children 13 and younger is going to rise significantly between now and 2025.\u201cWe think we can win back some people who migrated to S.U.V.s,\u201d he said.There is also the Google effect, something Barbara Rigney has already experienced. A psychologist in Ann Arbor, Mich., she bought a Pacifica in April, one of the first sold \u2014 it came with a bottle of Champagne. She liked the Pacifica\u2019s looks, but her three sons and daughter, all 18 or older, were hoping she would pick something sporty\u201cThey were kind of horrified when they saw I got another minivan,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they heard about the Google thing, they were like: \u2018Oh, I get it. I see why you got that.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

I can no longer remember exactly how I was introduced to Matter and to Corey, but I do remember the first demo day that I attended a few years ago, at an event space associated with WNYC. Somehow I had gotten an invitation, but I was on the fence about whether to go. I had recently started in a new role, and was feeling pressed for time. In the end, I went, mostly because an engineering lead I was trying to hire was likely to be there and I was hoping to stalk him in his natural habitat.When I got there, I recognized a face, then another, and another, and I realized I was walking into a room full of many of the most talented people in digital media in New York, with all sorts of opportunities for stalking talent! And this from an accelerator that was based in San Francisco. When the demos started, and the ideas began to flow, I was sure there was something special going on.Over the next several years I got to know Corey and his program better. I was more and more impressed. The rigorous application of design thinking, the selectiveness applied to the participating startups, the quality of the ideas and the people, the energy surrounding the whole process, all supported my initial reaction.I also loved the enthusiasm and optimism around the potential of digital media. Despite the very real disruption of the industry, Matter clearly believes in the potential of media to reinvent itself, evolve and thrive. I do too.However, it was never practical for my New York-based organization to actually work with Matter because they ran their program in San Francisco. While I understood the obvious appeal of the Bay Area, I thought it was a shame for Matter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence in New York to be limited to the demo day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a missed opportunity for both Matter and the city that is the undisputed media capital of the world.The Times, to me, has always manifested a masterful balance of innovation and tradition.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion, Reasserting Its Muscle", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft\u2019s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.The deal is Microsoft\u2019s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.It is also further evidence that Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, sees the company\u2019s future further and further removed from the PC software that once helped the company\u2019s co-founder Bill Gates turn Microsoft into the world\u2019s most valuable company.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition.\u201cThis deal is all about bringing together the professional cloud and professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a telephone interview.So valuable is the data that recruiters spend thousands of dollars a month to use it to fill job openings.\u201cThey know the interconnections of the business world,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \u201cThat could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.\u201dMicrosoft has bought its way into new businesses before, though most of its largest deals have not turned out well. In 2014, it paid nearly $9.4 billion for the smartphone operations of Nokia and some years earlier spent more than $6 billion for aQuantive, an internet advertising company, but ended up writing off most of the value of those deals after they performed poorly.In its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Nadella, who took over as chief executive in February 2014, was not involved in those deals. Since assuming leadership of the company, he has made mostly smaller acquisitions, with the exception of the $2.5 billion deal to acquire the maker of the game Minecraft.Mr. Nadella said that when Microsoft pursued deals that hewed closer to a strict set of criteria, one of which is that the acquired company operates in areas that are core to Microsoft\u2019s business, the deals have worked out.\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve gotten it right, we\u2019ve had success in those dimensions,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.In a joint interview, Mr. Nadella and Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, said that their conversations began in February, when the two began talking about different ways in which the companies could work together.Mr. Weiner, for his part, said he began thinking about a LinkedIn combination with Microsoft long before he sat down with Mr. Nadella. He and Mr. Nadella first met a couple of years ago at a conference for chief executives at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of admiration for the work Satya had done since taking over as C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.Microsoft was once a reviled company in Silicon Valley, where LinkedIn is based, but as its dominance in the industry ebbed it came to seem far less threatening.Mr. Nadella has further improved Microsoft\u2019s image in the technology industry by being more open to partnerships with once-bitter tech rivals like Salesforce.com. He has accelerated the company\u2019s shift from traditional software to cloud applications and services, and its stock has risen significantly under his leadership.And with more than $100 billion in cash and short-term investments as its disposal, Microsoft is an attractive suitor for companies that decide they are better off joining forces with a bigger entity.Microsoft is paying considerably less for LinkedIn than it would have just last fall, when LinkedIn shares were trading over $260 a share. Disappointing earnings helped slash the value of the company. The deal calls for Microsoft to pay $196 a share to buy LinkedIn, a healthy premium to the $131.08 its shares closed at on Friday.\u201cThis is a good time for LinkedIn to sell,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. \u201cThey lost money last year. They\u2019ve found it\u2019s very expensive to keep growing. They\u2019re probably as valuable as they will ever be.\u201dYet big challenges remain for the company in today\u2019s technology landscape, where new powerhouses like Amazon.com, the leader in cloud computing, have a significant head start.LinkedIn could help Microsoft accelerate its shift to the internet by giving it a large online property that has became the de facto standard for posting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s online. The site is heavily used by recruiters for finding new workers. Microsoft is one of LinkedIn\u2019s biggest customers.\u201cThe mission statements of LinkedIn and Microsoft have different words, but are essentially the same,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come at it from different perspectives. LinkedIn built a professional network. Microsoft built a professional cloud.\u201dLinkedIn will give Microsoft access to a lot of potentially sensitive information that it will have to be careful about guarding \u2014 for example, when LinkedIn users are talking to job recruiters.\u201cThe burden will be on them to put controls in place to ensure privacy is maintained,\u201d said Dimitri Sirota, chief executive of BigID, a start-up that provides privacy management tools.Microsoft was advised on the deal by Morgan Stanley and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, while Qatalyst Partners, Allen & Company L.L.C. and the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati advised LinkedIn.Microsoft\u2019s courtship of LinkedIn began to heat up in April. Wary of Microsoft\u2019s missteps with past acquisitions, the companies decided that allowing LinkedIn to operate independently was best.Mr. Weiner will remain chief executive of LinkedIn, which will operate as an independent brand, following the lead of other technology acquisitions like Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube and Facebook\u2019s buy of WhatsApp.In April, Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner had dinner to dig into details for how the deal would work, joined by Reid Hoffman, the co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn, and Qi Lu, a Microsoft executive who used to work at Yahoo with Mr. Weiner.On Sunday night, the Microsoft and LinkedIn executive teams had a final meeting together at Mr. Hoffman\u2019s house before the deal was announced. As a conversation starter, each participant had to share something with the group that was not on their personal LinkedIn profile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple, Uneasy Over Donald Trump, Won\u2019t Support Republican Convention", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byThe tech giant Apple will withhold its support from the Republican National Convention in July because of its discomfort with comments by Donald J. Trump, two people briefed on the company\u2019s decision said on Saturday.Apple is the latest in a string of companies dropping out as sponsors of the Republican convention. Few have attributed their decisions directly to Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but some have privately expressed worries about having their products associated with the candidate and his ideas.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s because of the company\u2019s use of Chinese manufacturing and its fight with the United States government over the encryption of data on its smartphones. One of those briefed on Apple\u2019s decision said the company objected not only to beliefs Mr. Trump has expressed on trade with China and data encryption, but also to his comments about Muslims and immigrants.Mr. Trump has promised to build a wall along the nation\u2019s border with Mexico, has characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals and has vowed to stop immigration from Muslim-dominated countries as a counterterrorism strategy.Asked to comment on Apple\u2019s decision, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee said, \u201cWe are working with a variety of major tech partners who are focused on being part of the American political process.\u201dApple\u2019s withdrawal is not by itself a large blow to the convention. It typically donates equipment; its contribution in 2008, for example, was valued at $140,000, according to federal election records. But it adds to the parade of major companies, including HP and Microsoft, curtailing or eliminating their monetary support of the Republican convention.Last week, Bloomberg Politics reported that JPMorgan Chase and Ford Motor would not sponsor the convention.Apple was still expected to provide support for the Democratic convention, though it was unclear Saturday if that decision was final.Some major technology firms, such as Google, are still planning to support the convention in some fashion.Mr. Trump\u2019s presence at the top of the Republican ticket has created a seismic split within his party \u2014 among down-ballot candidates, who do not want to answer to his frequent controversies, and among donors, many of whom do not want to fund the party as heavily as they have in the past. Last week, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that his endorsement of Mr. Trump was not a \u201cblank check\u201d and that he could rescind it.On Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the lack of support among other Republicans and took an unusual tack, threatening to stop raising money for the party and to self-fund his race.\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat Hillary, and it would helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, referring to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. He continued to criticize his party: \u201cI am raising a lot of money for the Republican Party, and there are a lot of beneficiaries of that. And I like doing it. But we have to have help.\u201dThe Trump campaign is relying heavily on the Republican Party apparatus to support his candidacy, in particular its field and data programs across the country, since he keeps a lean staff. Self-funding would require Mr. Trump to put up hundreds of millions of dollars, something he resisted for much of the primary race.\u201cIf the Republican Party, and I hope they all come together, because I want them to all come together, but if for any reason, they get a little bit like they don\u2019t want to help out as much, then I\u2019ll fund my own campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brooklyn Apartment Sticker Shock", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byThe HuntJerod Coker had been to New York three times in his life, most recently for job interviews. His fianc\u00e9e, Emily Scheele, had never been to New York.So when the couple began hunting for an apartment online from the Denver suburbs, where they were temporarily staying with Ms. Scheele\u2019s parents, they had no idea what they were in for. \u201cWe\u2019ve always ever rented apartments in a college town,\u201d Mr. Coker said. \u201cWe knew the pricing was going to be insane, and we na\u00efvely thought our budget would be $2,000 or $2,500, max.\u201dThat monthly amount was \u201cfairly arbitrary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t based on market intelligence.\u201d The going rent for a room in Norman, Okla., where they had both gone to the University of Oklahoma, had been around $350 a month, and the idea of paying \u201csix times the rent was brutal,\u201d he said.The couple had met at the university when Mr. Coker, now 25, was a senior and Ms. Scheele, 22, a freshman. Now, after two years of graduate school in England, Mr. Coker had taken a job as a management consultant based in Midtown Manhattan.On StreetEasy, they saw reasonable-looking one-bedrooms for rent in their price range, though they didn\u2019t initially realize how far those were from Midtown. They Googled phrases like \u201ctop places for young professionals to live in New York,\u201d and found no overlap.\u201cIt would have driven us insane to not draw some boundaries, even if arbitrary,\u201d Mr. Coker said. They already knew Manhattan was too expensive. Preferring a high-rise, they narrowed their territory to Long Island City and Brooklyn.Arriving at the start of the year with seven suitcases, they stayed with a cousin of Mr. Coker\u2019s in New Jersey, about two hours from New York.They began their hunt in Long Island City. They visited several rental buildings along the waterfront, unpleasantly surprised to find one-bedrooms cost more than $3,000 a month. And, Mr. Coker said, they thought \u201cwe should do the Brooklyn brownstone prewar history thing and look at a walk-up.\u201dSo they saw a one-bedroom, for $2,400 a month, in a renovated building, circa 1928, on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. It was nice enough inside.But then, Ms. Scheele said, \u201cthe roof of my mouth started itching.\u201d\u201cA lot of old buildings are rife with mold and fungus,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very sensitive to mold in the walls.\u201dThey moved on to the Instrata, opened about 2010, on traffic-laden Fourth Avenue on the edge of Park Slope and Gowanus. An alcove studio was going for $2,500 a month. But with a queen bed in place in the alcove, they feared the closet wouldn\u2019t open all the way.\u201cThere was a common area, but there were quite a few children, which is fine,\u201d Ms. Scheele said. \u201cBut it was not really a relaxing reading room.\u201dThey headed for the new construction in and around Downtown Brooklyn and connected with Zuriel Haskins, a salesman at Area New York, whom they had found via nakedapartments.com.\u201cUntil we talked to Zuriel, we hadn\u2019t factored in the train thing,\u201d Mr. Coker said. \u201cWe made a spreadsheet \u2014 because I\u2019m a consultant and that\u2019s what I do \u2014 of places we thought we would want to go to fairly regularly, and Brooklyn was always accessible because of so many trains.\u201dMr. Haskins told them a studio would cost in the high $2,000 range; one-bedrooms would be more.\u201cAt that point, minor stuff breaks the tie,\u201d Mr. Coker said. City Tower offered a walk-in closet and immediate availability.Mr. Haskins urged them to take a one-bedroom over a studio. \u201cI said, \u2018You might want to be in different rooms once in a while.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen a couple not have an argument.\u201dThey chose a one-bedroom with a 19-month lease, which included one month free. The lease will expire about the time Ms. Scheele plans to start medical school. (She is now applying.)Their rent is $3,150 a month \u2014 nine times their Oklahoma benchmark. \u201cWe have been told by so many people we are not paying so much, but it is hard to believe,\u201d Mr. Coker said.They moved in exactly one week after they started the hunt, among the first renters to arrive, and furnished the place out of Ikea, with an assist from Target.They were excited when neighbors started appearing. \u201cNow we see puppies in the elevator, and that makes my entire day,\u201d Ms. Scheele said. She can take the F train to work, \u201cbut I choose to take the Q because it goes over the bridge and I love the view,\u201d she said.The biggest downside is the combination microwave-convection oven. Her new cookie sheet didn\u2019t fit. A frozen pizza heats unevenly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that frozen pizzas are not standard in New York, and people just order a pizza,\u201d Ms. Scheele said. \u201cWe would cook a lot if it weren\u2019t for the oven. We eat out more than we would like.\u201dThe building is still not finished. The stores beneath, not yet open, will include Target, Trader Joe\u2019s and Century 21. \u201cTarget is hiring,\u201d Ms. Scheele said. \u201cI am very much looking forward to riding the elevator down to the grocery store and back up, instead of carrying my groceries on the subway and on the street.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The End of Reflection", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byFuture TenseThere are many moments throughout my average day that, lacking print reading material in a previous era, were once occupied by thinking or observing my surroundings: walking or waiting somewhere, riding the subway, lying in bed unable to sleep or before mustering the energy to get up.Neuroplasticity (or the brain\u2019s ability to change) due to technological use is a hot topic. Usually the tone is alarmist, though sometimes it\u2019s optimistic.But these cognitive abilities are distinct from mentally sequestered rumination. In a world in which a phone or computer is rarely more than arm\u2019s length away, are we eliminating introspection at times that may have formerly been conducive to it? And is the depth of that reflection compromised because we have retrained ourselves to seek out the immediate gratification of external stimuli?If the data is any indication, most of us use our phones more than we think: Participants estimated an average of 37 uses throughout the day (anything that turns on the screen, from hitting snooze to making a call), but the actual number was around 85. The slight majority took less than 30 seconds. (Participants also underestimated duration of use by about an hour \u2014 the real total was 5.05 hours \u2014 which included phone calls and listening to music when the screen was off.)If you are awake for 16 hours, turning on or checking your phone 85 times means doing so about once every 11 minutes (and doesn\u2019t account for internet use on a computer), and 5.05 hours is over 30 percent of the day. What might be the effect on reflection of this compulsive behavior?It is therefore \u201ca reasonable conjecture,\u201d Dr. Fleming said, if we think of navigating the world \u2014 physically, as a fl\u00e2neur might, or mentally, when pondering something \u2014 as a \u201cfirst task\u201d and looking at one\u2019s phone as a \u201csecond task,\u201d that the latter hinders our capacity to reflect.\u201cThe prefrontal cortex is good at doing one thing at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you put people in a dual-task setting, part of the reason things become impaired is because that secondary task interferes with the functions involved in introspection.\u201dIt seems counterintuitive to say that we are entering an unreflective cultural phase, as our time tends to be criticized for its self-absorption. But our solipsism is frequently given outward expression rather than inward exploration, with more emphasis than ever before on images. When there is text, new media such as Instagram commonly sideline the role of language.The selfie is too easy a fish to shoot in this particular barrel, but consider the tweet, its name phonically close to \u201cthought.\u201d Its brevity is the perfect length for an aphorism and little more (unless someone rattles off a sequence of tweets).For a certain percentage of the population, the thoughts that they may have kept private in a pre-smartphone age \u2014 letting them marinate and perhaps deepen till they could no longer be articulated in fewer than 140 characters \u2014 are now ejected into a public forum.\u201cThat hints at the way that, as our technologies increase the intensity of stimulation and the flow of new things, we adapt to that pace,\u201d Mr. Carr said. \u201cWe become less patient. When moments without stimulation arise, we start to feel panicked and don\u2019t know what to do with them, because we\u2019ve trained ourselves to expect this stimulation \u2014 new notifications and alerts and so on.\u201dWhat this often translates to in the discourse of the internet is demand for immediate and perfunctory \u201chot takes\u201d rather than carefully weighed judgments, whether they\u2019re about serious or superficial matters.Mr. Carr also noted counterarguments: Formulating relatively simple thoughts on the internet can yield more complex ones through real-time exchanges with others, and people whose reflex is to post a notion hastily rather than let it sit may not have been the most deliberative thinkers in a pre-smartphone time, either.Nevertheless, he sees our current direction as indicative of \u201cthe loss of the contemplative mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve adopted the Google ideal of the mind, which is that you have a question that you can answer quickly: close-ended, well-defined questions. Lost in that conception is that there\u2019s also this open-ended way of thinking where you\u2019re not always trying to answer a question. You\u2019re trying to go where that thought leads you. As a society, we\u2019re saying that that way of thinking isn\u2019t as important anymore. It\u2019s viewed as inefficient.\u201dMr. Carr observed that, for decades, Rodin\u2019s 1902 sculpture \u201cThe Thinker\u201d epitomized the highest form of contemplation: a figure with an imposing physique staring abstractly downward, hunched over to block out distraction, frozen because it\u2019s a statue, of course, but also because deep thinkers need time and don\u2019t fidget. It\u2019s hard to imagine a postmodern update called \u201cThe Tweeter\u201d being quite so inspirational.Advertisement"}

When one or two companies gain control over a market, it creates dangerous asymmetries that skew competitive balance. And the market we\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t making widgets. It delivers what we read and watch every day, and increasingly every minute: the news and information our democracy needs.While Google has usually been the chief villain here, Facebook seemed to have assumed the role of Frenemy No. 1. Two hours didn\u2019t go by here without some top executive telling me about how Facebook\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d makes it a new intermediary between brands and their customers, and between newspapers and their readers. That gives Facebook the potential to steal them all away if it ever chose to do so. (It says it won\u2019t.)Facebook, which maintained a fortresslike presence here within the Hotel Majestic as well on the beach, had a simple message: We Come in Peace, and we need the ad world.\u201cOur point of view on this is that the whole industry has to collaborate more than ever,\u201d Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global marketing solutions, told me. \u201cThere is a massive shift in the industry.\u201dThat shift is to mobile phones, where more and more digital advertising is going. But the industry hasn\u2019t quite figured out how to make us regularly watch more than three seconds of a telephone-based video ad, or to click on a mobile display ad on purpose.\u201cWe desperately need the agency ecosystem to support and drive this shift to mobile marketing,\u201d Ms. Everson said. Figuring it out is in everybody\u2019s interest.You can point to a clash between New York cynicism and West Coast idealism, but there is a history.But then it offered the brands a chance to increase visibility by paying for it \u2014 that is, to reach the customer fan base that Facebook had initially invited them to create free. You can imagine how that went over.Facebook has been doing a better job of avoiding such surprises, Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at OMD, told me at his company\u2019s beachside tent.But, he said, when Facebook is the mediator between advertisers and their customers, \u201cThey become Facebook\u2019s customers first and the brands\u2019 customers second,\u201d leaving the question, \u201cWho owns the customer data?\u201d The nearly universal complaint in Cannes was that Facebook was not doing enough to share that data, leaving an informational imbalance that, combined with Facebook\u2019s digital market share, gives it asymmetrical negotiating leverage.Ms. Everson said that Facebook\u2019s imperative to protect the privacy of its users precludes deeper sharing. But, she said, it has sophisticated tools to help its partners contact customers and likely customers without making them identifiable.Facebook\u2019s Madison Avenue \u201cpartners\u201d wonder if Facebook isn\u2019t hiding behind privacy to protect its own market advantage.\u201cWe fully understand that the users\u2019 privacy is sacrosanct,\u201d Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM Global, the huge advertising buying firm, told me. \u201cBut there are ways to share data without compromising it; everyone else has found ways to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Louis D. Brandeis: American Prophet,\u2019 Moral Vision and a True Believer\u2019s Zeal", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesLouis Brandeis geared up for combat when J. P. Morgan\u2019s New Haven Railroad tried to buy the Boston and Maine lines. Brandeis hated the thought of what he called \u201ca monster corporation controlling all transportation facilities of New England,\u201d and lobbied fiercely against the merger. Morgan prevailed, \u201cbut it took all the power of the Republican machine and of the bankers\u2019 money to do it,\u201d Brandeis wrote, \u201cand I am well content with the fight made.\u201dBrandeis would win many other battles on behalf of his people: consumers, workers, small-business men and other common folk. He rode his success as \u201cthe people\u2019s lawyer\u201d into President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inner circle as an influential economic adviser, and then onto the Supreme Court, where he was the first Jewish justice and a progressive champion.The brilliant, crusading Brandeis is the subject of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s excellent \u201cLouis D. Brandeis: American Prophet.\u201d The book, part of the Yale Jewish Lives series, is not a full biography \u2014 that ground is already well trod \u2014 but rather a concise and sympathetic exploration of Brandeis\u2019s main intellectual causes. It is well titled: Brandeis resembled an Old Testament prophet \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt called him \u201cold Isaiah\u201d \u2014 with his highly articulated moral vision and true believer\u2019s zeal. It is also well timed: Mr. Rosen persuasively makes his case that recognizing Brandeis as an \u201cAmerican prophet\u201d \u201cseems more important today than ever.\u201dBrandeis was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1856, to immigrant Jewish parents. Like many Southerners \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, whom he revered \u2014 Brandeis developed a strong sympathy for farmers and state governments, and a mistrust of big government and big business.It was not long after Brandeis graduated from Harvard Law School, at the top of his class, and began practicing law in Boston that he developed the first of his intellectual passions. He and his law partner wrote a groundbreaking Harvard Law Review article, \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d which warned that cutting-edge technologies like \u201cinstantaneous photographs\u201d were infringing on what he proposed as a new legal right: \u201cthe right to be let alone.\u201dAt first, Brandeis represented corporations, but he soon found another of his causes: the plight of workers. He won a major victory in 1908, in Muller v. Oregon, when he persuaded a pro-business Supreme Court to uphold a maximum-hours law for women. Brandeis, who had a reverence for facts and a deep interest in the real-world impact of law, transformed legal advocacy by filing what would later be known as a \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d: one with more facts and sociology than legal precedents.Brandeis\u2019s concerns about big corporations went beyond their labor practices: He saw them as antithetical to America\u2019s democratic ideals. In his view, it was the size of these corporations that was the problem \u2014 and this became another cause, a career-long battle against what he called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d Brandeis\u2019s prescription was aggressive trustbusting, and his public advocacy and work for President Wilson helped clear the way for the landmark Clayton Antitrust Act.There was one more cause Brandeis was passionate about: Zionism. When he represented striking New York garment workers, he got to know immigrant Jews who had fled the pogroms of Eastern Europe. Hearing their stories firsthand, Brandeis came to believe that the Jews needed a homeland where they could control their own destiny \u2014 and he soon became the leader of the American Zionist movement.Mr. Rosen is particularly original on this subject, showing how Brandeis rooted his Zionist thinking in American values of democracy and pluralism \u2014 and emphasizing Brandeis\u2019s insistence that any Jewish state had to proceed in a spirit of equality, with full political rights and economic inclusion for its Arab citizens.Wilson appointed Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916, and he was confirmed over the opposition of corporate interests and anti-Semites. On the court, he had many opportunities to give voice to his deeply held beliefs, sometimes in dissent.In Whitney v. California, a case about free-speech rights for radicals, Brandeis wrote a concurrence that is often called the most eloquent opinion ever written on the value of freedom of expression. His dissent in Olmstead v. United States, an early wiretapping case, was perhaps his most visionary, warning that \u201cdiscovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\u201dBecause of his deep distrust of big government, Brandeis was not always a reliable progressive vote on the court, and not all of his decisions have stood the test of time. He joined the majority in striking down a federal law aimed at ending child labor, and later voted to declare three New Deal laws unconstitutional in a single day, delivering a major blow to Roosevelt\u2019s plans for combating the Great Depression. In his deference to state legislatures, Brandeis voted to uphold some highly illiberal state laws, including \u2014 though his reasons for doing so are unclear \u2014 Virginia\u2019s 1924 law authorizing eugenic sterilizations.But despite Brandeis\u2019s occasional misfires, his philosophies, as Mr. Rosen convincingly argues, speak powerfully to our times \u2014 in his views on the threat that technology poses to privacy, on the importance of pluralism and equality in the Middle East and, perhaps most of all, on economic matters.Today\u2019s polemics about what unfettered capitalism is doing to ordinary Americans \u2014 from Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right \u2014 is terrain Brandeis covered, more deeply, with more cogent suggestions for reform. And his warnings about the \u201ccurse of bigness\u201d speak powerfully to an age in which the internet appears structurally inclined to create category-killing behemoths: Google for search, Amazon for retailing and Facebook, it seems, for just about everything else.Most of all, what the Gospel of Brandeis offers is a conviction that fact-based analysis and enlightened policy-making can help to set the world right. Brandeis never abandoned his pure faith that, with hard work and due deliberation, all things are possible. After all, he observed at an arbitration proceeding, \u201cmost of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.\u201dAdam Cohen, a former member of The New York Times editorial board, is the author, most recently, of \u201cImbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck.\u201dLouis D.

A large branch from a tree in the rear neighbor\u2019s yard came down in my yard in strong winds. The branch is too large for me to move, so it will have to be cut up and removed by a professional. Who is responsible for this expense \u2014 the owner of the house in whose yard the tree grows, or me?

Or does it come from a weak and sickly tree that looks like an accident waiting to happen?\u201cAll you need to do is look up,\u201d said Bruce F.

If the tree looks visibly sick, then the owner \u201cshould have known that the tree was falling apart.\u201d And if the owner knew about this problem, it should have been resolved before Mother Nature stepped in.If the tree was in poor condition before the windstorm, the tree\u2019s owner should pay to remove the fallen branch. But if the tree was healthy, then cleaning the debris from your property is your responsibility.Once you make contact, tell the owner about the fallen branch. If the tree is unhealthy, ask the owner to pay to remove the branch from your property and properly treat what remains of the tree.

The lucky few enjoy a suburban perk: free and convenient parking. Everyone else must park elsewhere.Whether the restaurant uses the garage for its intended purpose, it can still restrict parking in the driveway and at the curb cut, and post signs on its property publicizing the rules. It can even block the curb cut with its own vehicles.

{"Headline": "Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone Photos", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byTech FixIf your digital photos are a mirror of your life, they may also serve as a reminder that there is only so much you can control and that at some point you just need to let things go.That was the lesson I learned after trying to create a step-by-step guide to organizing and storing smartphone photos, based on interviews with professional photographers and a week of testing multiple photo-management services and gadgets.I spent days experimenting with neurotic tagging systems, tedious backup processes and album management, and finally turned to Brian Christian, a computer scientist and philosopher, for advice.The healthiest approach to managing photos, it turns out, is a Zen one: to not deal with them much at all.Mr. Christian said photo organization illustrates a computer-science principle known as the search-sort trade-off. If you spend tons of time rummaging for a specific photo, then sorting photos may be worthwhile. But if you hunt for a picture infrequently, sorting may be a waste of time.In other words, people need a photo-organization method that saves time \u2014 and that allows them to essentially throw out the need to sort and tag their enormous photo sprawl. So I tried several photo-management services and devices to determine what that method might be.Over a week, I tested three backup services with my iPhone photo library of about 8,000 images: Apple\u2019s iCloud photo library, Dropbox and Google Photos, which automatically take your photos and store them in the cloud. I also tested two data backup devices from SanDisk and Synology.My conclusion: For smartphone shooters, the secret to photo nirvana is to take a deep breath and let Google back up and organize everything.Google Photos quickly set itself apart with its smarter auto-sorting features. It scans your photos and organizes them in several ways. For one, it can detect the face of a person and group all the photos of that person into an album, which you can name. With photos taken within a short time span, like your trip to a beach over the weekend, Google Photos might create a video montage or an album with a label like \u201cA weekend in San Francisco.\u201d The service also managed to identify pictures of items, like receipts and food, and group them into their own albums with labels.Dropbox and Apple\u2019s photo services had auto-organizing features, but not the smarts of Google\u2019s service. Apple\u2019s app groups photos into collections based on when and where photos were taken; it can also organize photos by faces, similar to Google. Dropbox uploads photos into a folder labeled Camera Uploads and labels each file by the date and time it was taken.Another benefit of Google Photos is its free offering is the most generous \u2014 enough to let you try out the service thoroughly before deciding whether to pay. The service offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images at no cost. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.In contrast, Apple offers five gigabytes free and thereafter charges at least $1 a month for 50 gigs; Dropbox offers two gigabytes of free storage before charging at least $10 a month for a terabyte.Anil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos, said the company built Google Photos to make it easy to keep, manage and share photos and videos. Apple and Dropbox did not immediately have comment.The iXpand device was deeply flawed \u2014 it tried to back up all my photos for six hours before the iPhone ran out of battery and the backup failed entirely. Synology\u2019s photo-management software backed up my photos quickly and had some features like face and location tagging, but organizing photo albums still required lots of manual labor.SanDisk said the issue I experienced was a known problem affecting a small number of devices and that an app update would be released next week to fix the bug. A Synology spokeswoman said that with its network-attached storage systems, customers could back up a broad array of media on a private cloud.In the end, Google Photos solves multiple problems: It handles organization, making the search-sort trade-off minimal. It creates a backup of photos, so you can free up space on your smartphone while safeguarding pictures in case the device is lost or stolen.Once all your photos are on Google Photos, they need not live on the phone. Unfortunately, there is no quick way to delete thousands of photos. I plugged my iPhone into a Mac, imported my older photos and checked the box that says \u201cDelete items after import.\u201d Then I deleted them all from the computer. (In the future, it will be easier to delete smaller batches straight off the phone.)What about blurry, unwanted images? The most important lesson of Google Photos is to stop thinking of the digital photo album like a physical scrapbook. With a traditional photo album, you would spend time flipping through pages before landing on the right photo.With Google Photos, you can treat it like a giant searchable junk drawer: You can simply open the Google Photos app or Google Drive, type in a keyword for what you want to see, pull up that photo and ignore everything else. You can make some changes here and there \u2014 like renaming or adding photos to albums \u2014 but otherwise, why bother?One caveat: The Zen approach does not apply to those with professional cameras. For professional photographers, some organization is a plus and Google Photos and cloud services are not ideal because large photos would take too long to upload.\u201cI put tagging up there with flossing and stretching: things you know you\u2019re supposed to do and they\u2019re really a drag to do, but you just get in the habit of it,\u201d he said.For the rest of us, there\u2019s another reason to not bother deleting photos in Google Photos: Google adds creative touches to images that you thought were previously unwanted. If you took multiple shots of a sun setting or your child smiling, for example, it stitches them into an animation.\u201cThe lower the cost is of searching, then the more one should ask the question of, should I be organizing this at all?\u201d Mr. Christian said.After migrating my entire photo library to Google Photos, my answer is a resounding no.Advertisement"}

One day, at the end of seventh grade, she informed me she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be dropping my Latin class for her eighth grade year so she could have an additional study hall, time she needed to finish her other school work and participate in extracurricular activities. I signed off on her request, but I also sensed that the explanation she gave was not the whole story. Weeks later, she asked to meet with me and, voice shaking, admitted she had dropped my class because she did not feel as if her time was being well spent because she was not learning much.As she laid my failings bare, my mouth opened, defense at the ready. When I began to speak, however, she looked me in the eyes and thanked me for listening to her.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I shut my mouth and realized I had not been listening to her at all, not for the entire year she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been in my classroom.I write about education through the lens of my own teaching, so many of my most grievous errors are Google-able, available for public consumption for as long as the internet shall live.

But at the center of much of this conflict, we all have the same focus: the students.I believe our shared compass bearing will help us get this ship pointed in the right direction, toward a place where learning trumps expedience, knowledge confers power and listening is the new lecture.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

The question now is not just who will buy it, but what exactly they will be paying for.But while company\u2019s public image \u2014 and troubles \u2014 have centered around its aggressive and boundary-testing flagship news site, Gawker.com, potential buyers may be interested in a less visible part of its business: e-commerce.In recent years, Gawker Media has tried to build up its e-commerce revenue \u2014 earned from lucrative commissions taken from referrals to sites like Amazon \u2014 as a hedge against an increasingly uncertain online news environment, in which platforms like Google and Facebook take ever-larger shares of advertising revenue.But while that kind of revenue was growing, Gawker Media\u2019s commerce plans never fully came to fruition. The effort was hindered by an obsessive focus on developing Kinja, the company\u2019s internal content management and commenting system, as well as the creation of numerous subsites with distinct brands, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s financial situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.Now, with financial independence off the table, Gawker Media\u2019s e-commerce operation may nonetheless play an outsize role in determining the company\u2019s fate. Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, a technology publisher that entered a first bid for the company \u2014 reportedly between $90 million and $100 million \u2014 wrote in a memo to staff that \u201clike us, GMG is heavily active in driving commerce-based revenues, and has an impressive publishing and commerce platform with Kinja.\u201dMr. Denton also referred to the consumer component in his own announcement.While affirming his site\u2019s commitment to \u201ctelling the true stories that underpin credibility with our millions of readers,\u2019\u2019 he also wrote, \u201ca combination would marry Ziff Davis\u2019 strength in e-commerce, licensing and video with GMG\u2019s premium media brands.\u201dZiff Davis, a major presence in the pre-blog technology and gaming press, filed for bankruptcy itself in 2008, and is now, in a substantially different form, a subsidiary of the internet services and publishing conglomerate j2 Global.

In an email interview, she talked about female representation on \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the show\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence on the real Valley and the possible origin story of Jared, Pied Piper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheerful but bizarre head of business development.How does your experience in the real Silicon Valley compare to what happens on the show?I have to say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incredible how perfectly Mike Judge nailed Silicon Valley culture right off the bat, in the pilot of the show. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write on the first season, but I watched it thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that guy. And I know that guy. And I know that guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scenes in Erlich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hacker hostel kept reminding me of the countless hours I spent at the horribly filthy Stanford humor magazine office. For whatever reason, along with Humanities majors like me, the magazine attracted weird, funny computer science majors, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d often find myself creating bad comedy with CS guys at 3 in the morning. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley\u00e2\u0080\u009d writers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 room, whenever we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tasked with pitching \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall, observational stories,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think back to those days, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure I saw a guy who had been living in the office wash his feet in the sink, or when that same guy decided to move out of the office because a rat scampered across his body while he was sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley\u00e2\u0080\u009d makes fun of lots of aspects of tech and startup culture, from silly job titles like \u00e2\u0080\u009cchief evangelism officer\u00e2\u0080\u009d to grandiose ideas about changing the world. Three seasons in, do you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influencing that culture at all? Do people in Silicon Valley watch \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley\u00e2\u0080\u009d?I am continually surprised by the number of people working in the tech industry who watch the show. But I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a testament to the material, and to our brilliant tech consultants, and to the seemingly limitless human capacity for vanity.As far as the extent to which the show is influencing the culture, we did hear that one company no longer uses the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaking the world a better place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of its association with the show. (Which was actually very frustrating to them, because, as they insisted, they really are making the world a better place.)The show got criticism when it first aired for featuring relatively few women, though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s added some female characters since then. Is female representation something the writers talk about? And do you feel an added responsibility (or pressure) to think about gender as a female writer on the show?We definitely talk about female representation in the writers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 room, and both of our showrunners, Mike Judge and Alec Berg, are very sensitive to the issue. As a female writer, I sometimes worry too much about how our female characters are represented; I remember rewriting a scene in which Gavin Belson has one of his lackeys present a bulldog to the Hooli board on an office chair and then orders that same lackey to wheel the dog away. Everyone was picturing Patrice, played by the very funny actress Jill Alexander, as the lackey, and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, will that make it seem like Patrice is an assistant, and not an executive like Scott and Rogelio?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another writer pointed out that Jill would have the funniest reaction, and I realized that by trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cempower\u00e2\u0080\u009d a female character on the show, I almost cost a female actor a funny bit in the show that she ended up totally nailing.Your sister, Ellie, stars on \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What would a \u00e2\u0080\u009cKimmy Schmidt\u00e2\u0080\u009d/\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilicon Valley\u00e2\u0080\u009d crossover look like?Wow, excellent question. It would be a truly fascinating clash of comedic tone. But I think a Kimmy/Jared romance would make a lot of sense. At this point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to assume Jared was also held in an underground bunker for most of his childhood. Honestly, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to say Jared isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the boy in \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d all grown up?Would you rather work for Dunder Mifflin or Pied Piper? Why?Dunder Mifflin, hands down. As much as I enjoyed staying up until 3 am in college with CS nerds, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m 32 and pregnant now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Pam, dammit. I need sleep and a steady income.Also, close your eyes and think about how bad Erlich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house must smell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Says \u2018Special Relationship\u2019 With Britain Will Endure", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 President Obama on Friday sought to assure Britain and the European Union that the United States would not pick sides once the two are divorced. But he acknowledged, somewhat ruefully, that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the union, which he had publicly opposed, spoke \u201cto the ongoing changes and challenges raised by globalization.\u201d\u201cThe world has shrunk,\u201d he told the entrepreneurs, adding that they embodied this trend. \u201cIt promises to bring extraordinary benefits, but it also has challenges, and it also evokes concerns and fears.\u201dRather than dwell on the wrenching change to come, Mr. Obama emphasized continuity. \u201cOne thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will endure.\u201d And, he added, \u201cThe E.U. will remain one of our Indispensable partners.\u201dThe president said he had spoken with Prime Minister David Cameron, who told him Britain\u2019s departure would be orderly, and with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who will loom even larger as a partner for the United States in a European club that no longer has a Britain as a member.But Mr. Obama\u2019s soothing words did not disguise how personal a setback the vote was for him. In April, while visiting Mr. Cameron in London and celebrating the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, he implored Britons not to vote in favor of leaving. Britain, he warned, risked going \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d in negotiating trade deals with the United States.The \u201cBrexit\u201d vote runs counter to Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of open, interconnected societies, and it illustrates the frustrating cycle of his engagement with the world: \u201cAmerica\u2019s first Pacific president,\u201d as Mr. Obama has called himself, who tried to pull the United States out of the Middle East, now finds himself, near the end of his presidency, confronting a crisis in Europe fueled in part by the refugees attempting to flee the Middle East.As a practical matter, the terms of the divorce vote will consume Britain and Europe for at least two years, making both less valuable as trading partners and less reliable as allies in dealing with a dangerous world. It will also deal a blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious European trade deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which was already losing momentum on both sides because of growing anti-trade sentiment.\u201cFrom the start of the administration, we\u2019ve wanted to work with them on all the big global challenges,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, a former assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the interest of the U.S. to work with the E.U. on Iran sanctions, on Russia sanctions, and on military interventions in the Middle East, then it\u2019s a major setback.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.At the same time, Mr. Obama has had an ambivalent relationship with Europe during his presidency. His heavy emphasis on Asia \u2014 a policy dubbed the pivot \u2014 stoked suspicions in Europe that he was moving away from the continent to the faster-growing markets of the East. In his first term, the centerpiece of his Europe policy was an effort to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia.Critics said the tendency to take Europe for granted predated Mr. Obama. \u201cSince 2000, both the Bush and Obama administrations have acted as if Europe as a task had been solved and that we no longer needed to \u2018tend the garden\u2019 as George P. Shultz used to say,\u201d said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany, referring to Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cThe Europeans played their part by acting as if they didn\u2019t need us.\u201dEven after Mr. Obama worked closely with Europeans on difficult issues like the NATO air campaign in Libya, there was a sense that he looked on the trans-Atlantic alliance with a gimlet eye. In April, he struck a nerve by suggesting that Britain and France had been \u201cfree riders\u201d in that operation, leaving the United States to bear most of the military burden.Some critics suggest Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctance to be more militarily involved in Syria had an indirect effect on the British vote because of the flood of refugees the civil war has sent to Europe, destabilizing the continent and firing up nativist sentiment. Syrian refugees, however, account for far less of Britain\u2019s immigrant population than they do in Germany, for example.Mr. Obama has a chance to demonstrate his support for Europe at a NATO summit in Warsaw next month. But there again, the loss of Britain as a member of the European Union will be felt. Britain has historically been one of NATO\u2019s strongest boosters. It has resisted initiatives like a joint European military headquarters because it could compete with NATO. European officials said Germany and France might revive the proposal as a way to reinforce Europe\u2019s unity in the wake of the British vote.Britain\u2019s decision to leave Europe just as Mr. Obama was putting on an extravagant celebration of entrepreneurship and engagement in Silicon Valley undercut his message that innovation, open borders and free trade can improve people\u2019s lives. It is the same assertion that has also underpinned his efforts to forge a new dynamic in the Middle East.In his Cairo speech in 2009 promising a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in the Middle East, Mr. Obama first proposed to host entrepreneurship summits to explore ways to strengthen relationships between the United States and the Muslim world. The annual conferences proceeded as he envisioned, but the broader strategy has not been as simple to implement.Mr. Obama acknowledged that much of the upheaval gripping American voters \u2014 an angst that is propelling the campaign of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 is driven by fear of technology-driven globalization and anger at job losses prompted by automation. Mr. Trump has exploited such fears, Mr. Obama told National Public Radio in December, calling them \u201cjustified, but just misdirected.\u201dOn Friday, even as he held a Google-sponsored virtual conference with entrepreneurs in Britain, Iraq, South Korea and Mexico, the president conceded that interconnectivity still makes many people uncomfortable.\u201cWe are better off in a world in which we are trading, and networking, and communicating and sharing ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said before a panel discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, on Friday.\u201cBut that also means that cultures are colliding,\u201d he added, \u201cand sometimes it\u2019s disruptive, and people get worried.\u201dMark Landler contributed reporting from WashingtonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lanc\u00f4me Provokes Fury After Canceling a Concert in Hong Kong", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byWell, it turns out the energy was stoppable. With little explanation, Lanc\u00f4me canceled the show on Sunday.The singer, Denise Ho, said the reason was clear: Lanc\u00f4me, the French cosmetics company owned by L\u2019Or\u00e9al, wanted to avoid upsetting the government of China, one of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s largest markets.Many multinationals and global industries tread carefully in China, wary of risking the ire of the government and losing access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after that of the United States.The controversy for Lanc\u00f4me centers on an important market for the parent company.Fu King-wa, an associate professor at the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong, said the episode involving Ms. Ho would be a lesson in the need to better understand local culture and to formulate better communications strategies.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, maybe some miscommunication between headquarters and local branch,\u201d Dr. Fu said.\u201cInternational brands, if they want to do business in China, that always has certain kinds of risk,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you choose to stay in this market, either you pay attention to all these kinds of politically sensitive issues, or you just follow Google\u201d and leave the market.Polina Huard, a spokeswoman for the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group in Paris, said the company had no comment beyond a statement distributed on social media. Listerine, a brand that Ms. Ho also promotes, said on Tuesday that the company was still working with her.The first sign of trouble for Lanc\u00f4me came on Saturday, when The Global Times, a Chinese state-supported publication, posted on the microblog site Weibo that Lanc\u00f4me and Listerine had hired \u201cHong Kong Poison, Tibet Poison\u201d for publicity events. \u201cPoison\u201d and \u201cIndependence\u201d sound similar in Chinese.The Global Times asked its more than four million followers to comment, and thousands did. \u201cMaking Chinese people\u2019s money, and hiring this kind of person as a spokesperson? Let\u2019s boycott them, shall we?\u201d one user wrote.\u201cThe two brands probably don\u2019t want to do business in China anymore,\u201d another wrote.The largest pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong have called a protest on Wednesday at a busy Lanc\u00f4me retail location to condemn the brand for what they said amounted to \u201ckowtowing to money.\u201d The groups are calling for people in Hong Kong to boycott all brands under L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\u201cWhat is most ironic is that L\u2019Or\u00e9al is an international brand from France, known for its history of democracy and freedom movements against totalitarianism,\u201d the parties said in a joint statement on Tuesday.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Months, 45 National Parks, 11 Rules", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byRoad TripWhen I was 12, my family piled into a Honda Odyssey and headed west for a summer exploring the national parks. That trip changed my life. I tasted the freedom of the open road and experienced the wonders of America\u2019s wild places. I was hooked.I knew I would learn from every moment and every mile, but only if I paid attention to what was happening around me. So I adopted a series of daily practices \u2014 I called them my \u201croadtripology rules\u201d \u2014 to force myself to be as deliberate as possible about the trip.This might seem paradoxical. Aren\u2019t road trips supposed to be as spontaneous as possible? Of course. My rules sought to enhance spontaneity by making sure I noticed it when it happened. They made a big difference for my trip, and they should work for other travelers as well.I had no room in my shoestring budget for speeding tickets. More important, I wanted to take my time. Speed limits in the national parks are notoriously conservative, often ranging from 10 to 30 m.p.h. in popular areas. Drivers racing along at 55 m.p.h. gawking at El Capitan or Half Dome endanger wildlife and people alike.By following posted speed limits, I detached myself from the compulsive urgency so often associated with long-distance road travel. I set my cruise control and avoided the passing lane. In doing so, I experienced the freedom to focus. I no longer worried about catching the taillights up ahead. Instead, I channeled my energy toward appreciating the world around me.Taking 45 minutes to do this at each park gave me a historical, cultural and ecological foundation unique to that area, and enhanced everything I did there.In the age of Google Maps, the spirit of adventure can be sidelined by blindly following the seemingly omniscient blue line on the glowing screens in front of us. When I permit myself to follow that blue line, I sometimes lose track of where I am and forget the bigger picture. I was not going to let that happen on this trip.From Day 1, my trusty National Geographic Road Atlas rode shotgun. Its colorful pages tempted me with side trips at every turn, and never led me astray.It was one of the most memorable detours of my entire trip, but the blue line of a digital map would have ignored it.I tried to connect with someone every day: a handshake here, a hug there and conversation everywhere. These interactions helped me understand the many reasons people visit and care about the national parks \u2014 reasons often quite different from my own.Though we often think of a park visit as a solitary experience, there is so much to be gained from sharing it with other people. Groups of travelers come and go, but you can find community if you take the time to look, and you should.I never would have found the Chasm of Doom if I hadn\u2019t introduced myself to the climbers camped among the boulders of Hidden Valley. As we squeezed beneath the rock and lowered ourselves into cracks, we experienced a different side of Joshua Tree. Gone were the wide horizons and desert heat. In the Chasm, claustrophobic shadow ruled.I knew I could take years to fully explore the national parks. I didn\u2019t have that kind of time.Instead, I vowed to spend at least two days in every park, observing it in as many ways as I could: rain or shine, dawn to dusk. I chose to take my time, knowing that each moment I lingered would deepen my experience. I made time for the unpredictable.I did not necessarily seek out these experiences. I just made sure I had time to take them in whenever a park offered them.In these moments I felt personally connected with a place. Sharing views from the rim of the Grand Canyon with thousands of other travelers leaves a powerful impression, but I will never forget my 28-mile solo hike along the Tonto Platform, far below the crowds on the rim. As the shadow of the setting sun spread across the parched sea of blackbrush before me, my footsteps and breath fell into pace with the warm canyon winds. For those nine hours, I knew there was nowhere else in the universe that I should be.Early on, I traveled over 500 miles across most of Michigan in just one day. Later, on California\u2019s Lost Coast, I hiked just over five miles in a day. During an extended rock climb in Arches near the end of my trip, I think I traveled a couple hundred feet in eight hours.What do I remember from each of those days? I can taste the fresh vegetables I devoured outside Traverse City, Mich., as I listened to Michael Pollan\u2019s \u201cBotany of Desire.\u201d I can hear the yelps of seals, the cries of red-tailed hawks, and the crash of waves on rock and sand alike. I can still feel the dull pain in my knees and back as I shimmied up a tight sandstone chimney toward the top of Off Balance Rock in Arches.But even the most ardent motorist can benefit from unbuckling that seatbelt and getting away from the car. I found that leaving the confines of my vehicle brought me into contact with the natural forces that shape the parks, processes we need to experience if we want to understand them.My plan had always been that the last park on my journey would be Yellowstone \u2014 the nation\u2019s first. I visited it on my 25th birthday. It will surely be among the most memorable of my entire life, even though no one I met that day knew it was my birthday. It also proved to be the capstone of my trip.That day, I realized that I no longer needed to actively focus on my rules. They were now ingrained in my every decision. I could move spontaneously from experience to experience, living my values with each step.At Grand Prismatic Spring, I swapped stories of the road with a traveling photographer. Near Old Faithful, I had a close call with a grizzly being chased (by a ranger) right at me. I ate lunch overlooking the multihued Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.At Mammoth Hot Springs, I followed a herd of bison as they wandered through the steaming landscape. In the Lamar Valley, I watched a wolf pack settling down after picking over a deer carcass. Before I went to bed, I lounged in the Boiling River, shifting my body to find the optimal blend of frigid and scalding water.To me, it felt like the perfect end to my \u2014 or any \u2014 adventure.My constant companion on this journey was a 2008 atomic blue Honda Element named Sam.Behind Sam\u2019s boxy exterior, I had a palatial 75 cubic feet of living space (and an \u201cattic\u201d in my Yakima roof box). After combing the internet for design ideas, I settled on a system of interlocking birch boxes to create a solid bedframe. Within the boxes, I organized a four-season wardrobe, a modular kitchen and a mess of camping gear.After my mom and I constructed the boxes, we transformed the stark birch and plastic interior into a home. A pair of plush camping mattresses with a fitted sheet finished off the bed, and blackout panels with bungee curtains added a bit of privacy.Over the next 10 months, Sam proved a stalwart companion. Together, we bounced down more than a few dirt roads, trundled up snowy mountains, slept in parking lots and saw a lot of America. He gave me a home no matter where I was.And 32,000 miles later, we are still going strong.Advertisement"}

Those results, based on the researchers\u2019 use of basic coding, came despite the individuals\u2019 expressed efforts to remove their names from online searches.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cThis poses a threat to whether the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 can be maintained in the long term,\u201d said Keith Ross, the dean of engineering and computer science at N.Y.U. Shanghai who led the project and who said he had contacted Google with his research. \u201cIf a hacker can easily find 30 or 40 percent of people\u2019s names from delisted articles, what is the point?\u201d he said in an interview.Both Google and the French privacy agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, declined to comment.To get around Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules, the academic team turned to computer science to analyze more than 280 links to British news articles that Google had removed from online search results after individuals had successfully petitioned for the information to be taken down. People can ask for links to be removed if the information is no longer relevant or is out of date. Celebrities and other public figures cannot take advantage of the privacy decision.Using basic coding, the researchers created an algorithm that cross-referenced the names in each report with every article\u2019s headline on Google.co.uk, the company\u2019s British domain. If a link to the online article did not show up in results, the academics said, they could deduce that the individual they had searched for had asked for the link to be removed.Dr. Ross said that for the 283 articles analyzed, his team was able to identify 80 people\u2019s names within 103 articles. He added that, for privacy reasons, he would not be releasing the names.\u201cSomeone with an undergraduate computer science degree would be able to do what we did,\u201d Dr. Ross said. \u201cIt would be relatively straightforward to find the delisted links and republish people\u2019s names online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is especially true when browsing websites not hosted on a Chinese server.The report ranked the top five countries in internet speed as South Korea, Sweden, Norway, Japan and the Netherlands. The average broadband speed in South Korea was reported as 26.7 Mbps. In Sweden, it was 19.1 Mbps.The report promoted the fact that China now has 688 million people online, about half the population; that it added 40 million new internet users in 2015; and that 90 percent of users can get online via their mobile phones.It also said 358 million people now make financial transactions using online payment tools.The statistics showing China\u2019s poor internet speed were relegated to the bottom of the page.Many people in China do not watch videos hosted on non-Chinese servers because the videos download or stream too slowly.During politically sensitive periods, internet speed becomes molasseslike, especially in Beijing. This happens every spring around the time of the annual legislative conclave here.The report said that \u201cover the past year, the renewed emphasis on information control led to acts of unconcealed aggression against internet freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Maybe drones will fly over parking lots and map the heat of parked cars, to tell how long people are shopping. Maybe some kind of quadcopter crop or animal management is in the offing.If a lot of uses arise, without too many problems, it\u2019s likely the government will allow for additional drone uses, like package delivery or emergency rescue with larger vehicles. Laws and regulations, after all, tend to reflect changing social expectations.Upstate New York has companies working on remote sensing systems. One probable outcome is that drones will, once we\u2019re habituated to them, fly great distances with no human keeping an eye on them.The question now is when, not if. The F.A.A. by nature works more with companies than with the general public, so it would take a lot of citizen discontent to stop the drones. The bigger challenge will come from local communities, which are more responsive to individual complaints.Even so, that\u2019s unlikely to stop this industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Tesla Was Involved in Fatal Crash, U.S. Says", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The race by automakers and technology firms to develop self-driving cars has been fueled by the belief that computers can operate a vehicle more safely than human drivers.But that view is now in question after the revelation on Thursday that the driver of a Tesla Model S electric sedan was killed in an accident when the car was in self-driving mode.Federal regulators, who are in the early stages of setting guidelines for autonomous vehicles, have opened a formal investigation into the incident, which occurred on May 7 in Williston, Fla.In a statement, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said preliminary reports indicated that the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla, and the car failed to apply the brakes.It is the first known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself by means of sophisticated computer software, sensors, cameras and radar.The safety agency did not identify the Tesla driver who was killed. But the Florida Highway Patrol identified him as Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio.Mr. Brown posted videos of himself riding in autopilot mode. \u201cThe car\u2019s doing it all itself,\u2019\u2019 he said in one, smiling as he took his hands from the steering wheel.In another, he praised the system for saving his car from an accident.The death is a blow to Tesla at a time when the company is pushing to expand its product lineup from expensive electric vehicles to more mainstream models. The company on Thursday declined to say whether the technology or the driver or either were at fault in the accident.In its news release it said, \u201cNeither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\u201dThe crash also casts doubt on whether autonomous vehicles in general can consistently make split-second, life-or-death driving decisions on the highway.And other companies are increasing investments in self-driving technology. Google, for example, recently announced plans to adapt 100 Chrysler minivans for autonomous driving. Earlier this year, G.M. acquired the software firm Cruise Automation to accelerate its own self-driving applications.Even as the companies conduct many tests on autonomous vehicles at both private facilities and on public highways, there is skepticism that the technology has progressed far enough for the government to approve cars that totally drive themselves.The traffic safety agency said it was working with the Florida Highway Patrol in the inquiry into Mr. Brown\u2019s fatal accident. The agency cautioned that the opening of an investigation did not mean it thought there was a defect in the vehicle being examined.The federal traffic safety agency is nearing the release of a new set of guidelines and regulations regarding the testing of self-driving vehicles on public roads. They are expected to be released in July.At a recent technology conference in Novi, Mich., the agency\u2019s leader, Mark Rosekind, said self-driving cars should at least be twice as safe as human drivers to result in a significant reduction in roadway deaths. \u201cWe need to start with two times better,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rosekind said. \u201cWe need to set a higher bar if we expect safety to actually be a benefit here.\u201dKarl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book, said the accident served as a signal that the technology might not be as advanced and ready for the market as some proponents have suggested.\u201cThis is a bit of a wake-up call,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cPeople who were maybe too aggressive in taking the position that we\u2019re almost there, this technology is going to be in the market very soon, maybe need to reassess that.\u201dTesla said in its news release that it had informed the traffic safety agency about the accident \u201cimmediately after it occurred.\u201d But the company reported it publicly only on Thursday, after learning that the agency had begun to investigate.Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said Mr. Brown had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201dIn Iraq in 2006, he said, Mr. Brown played a crucial role in preparing captured explosive projectiles for shipment to the United States to support efforts to improve the armor on military vehicles.\u201cHe did it by being very aggressive,\u201d Mr. Hammer said, noting that Mr. Brown helped to collect the projectiles after raids on bomb-making shops and would X-ray them to determine their contents.But in its statement on Thursday, the company cautioned that it was still only a test feature and noted that its use \u2018\u2018requires explicit acknowledgment that the system is new technology.\u2019\u2019It noted that when a driver activated the system, an acknowledgment box popped up, explaining that the autopilot mode \u201cis an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of Williston, Fla. It is about 100 miles northwest of Orlando, not 100 miles northeast of it.

He said the video was \u201churting sentiments all over India\u201d and could undermine law and order.Mr. Shelar said the video was defamatory.Sangramsinh Nishandar, a spokesman for the Mumbai police, said on Tuesday that officers had taken no legal action over the video but were \u201clooking into the nitty-gritty\u201d of how it could be removed. He said the police had asked Facebook and YouTube to take it down.Gaurav Bhaskar, a spokesman in India for Google, which owns YouTube, would not confirm whether the company had been contacted by the police but said that it complies with valid requests from law enforcement authorities. A spokesman for Facebook in India would also would not confirm if the company had been contacted by the police but said the video was still on the site.Mr. Bhat depicts the two celebrities arguing, with the cricketer telling the singer that she is \u201c5,000 years old\u201d and suggesting she should die. \u201cHave you seen your face? It looks like someone has kept you in water for, like, eight days,\u201d he has Mr. Tendulkar say.The singer, her middle finger slowly rising, responds in a singsong tone, \u201cVinod is better than you,\u201d an apparent reference to the retired cricketer Vinod Kambli.In a post sharing the video on Facebook, Mr. Bhat wrote, \u201cAlso I obviously love Lata and Sachin, just having some fun.\u201dBut Mr. Shelar of the Bharatiya Janata Party said by telephone on Tuesday that the video was \u201ca public insult \u2014 it is defamation against Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar, who are public icons.\"Many people in India reacted on social media to Mr. Bhat\u2019s video, saying it was offensive, and some adding that he should be arrested. But others came to his defense, including Sanjay Jha, a spokesman for the Congress party who used the opportunity to take a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cWe endure Modi\u2019s one-sided bad jokes repeatedly with great grace in India,\u201d, Mr. Jha wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s apply the same yardstick\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Bhat\u2019s case.An earlier version of this article misstated the position held by Ashish Shelar. He is the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party for Mumbai, not for Maharashtra State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance.When Apple\u2019s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\u201cIs Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cTheir app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.\u201dAs the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Big outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services.Fanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them \u2014 \u201clike a street artist, but in an app,\u201d as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review.Apple\u2019s initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify\u2019s method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple\u2019s requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut.Ms. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place.\u201cIt ruined our whole launch,\u201d she said.Apple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created.Getting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple\u2019s system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque.\u201cIt used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,\u201d said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. \u201cNow it feels more like a lottery ticket.\u201dWhen an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous.Apple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. \u201cWe got a banner right on top of the App Store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 100,000 downloads in two weeks.\u201d When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple.The new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple\u2019s editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer.Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. \u201cSearch will be table stakes,\u201d he said.While overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry.The company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists.Apple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. \u201cIt signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cA lot of developers were asking and hoping for this.\u201dDevelopers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way.\u201cYou can\u2019t fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,\u201d Mr. Ryu said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201dWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201dIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201dEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201dBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201dYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201dIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You in Despair? That\u2019s Good", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byGray MatterWHEN the world gets you down, do you feel just generally \u201cbad\u201d? Or do you have more precise emotional experiences, such as grief or despair or gloom?My lab discovered emotional granularity in the 1990s. We asked hundreds of volunteers to keep track of their emotional experiences for weeks or months. Everyone we tested used the same stock of emotion words, such as \u201csad\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cafraid,\u201d to describe their experiences. However, we found that some people used these words to refer to distinct experiences \u2014 each word represented a different emotion concept \u2014 while other people lumped these words together as a single concept meaning, roughly, \u201cI feel miserable.\u201dThis is why emotional granularity can have such influence on your well-being and health: It gives your brain more precise tools for handling the myriad challenges that life throws at you.Suppose you\u2019re a resident of Flint, Mich., facing that city\u2019s troubles with water contamination. Suppose that each morning, as you turn on the tap or send your children off to school, you experience an unpleasant feeling of general badness. You are overcome and sink further into a funk.This process is like keeping a budget for your body. And just like a financial budget, a body budget needs to be kept balanced in order to be healthy.So in the Flint example, your brain anticipates a threat and your cortisol level spikes, readying your body for action, but a feeling of general badness calls for no specific action. You merely feel awful because your brain has made a needless withdrawal from your body budget. And the next time you\u2019re in a similar situation, your brain goes through the same process. Again you feel lousy and trapped by your circumstances. Over time, a poorly calibrated body budget can pave the road to illness.With higher emotional granularity, however, your brain may construct a more specific emotion, such as righteous indignation, which entails the possibility of specific actions. You might telephone a friend and rant about the water crisis. You might Google \u201clead poisoning\u201d to learn how to better protect your children. You might call your member of Congress and demand change. You are no longer an overwhelmed spectator but an active participant. You have choices. This flexibility ultimately reduces wear and tear on your body (e.g., unnecessary surges of cortisol).The good news is that emotional granularity is a skill, and many people can increase theirs by learning new emotion concepts. I mean this literally: learning new words and their specific meanings. If you weren\u2019t familiar with the term \u201cpena ajena\u201d that I mentioned earlier, for example, you\u2019ve now increased your potential for granularity. Schoolchildren who learn more emotion concepts have improved social behavior and academic performance, as research by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence shows. If you incorporate such concepts into your daily life, your brain will learn to apply them automatically.Emotion concepts are tools for living. The bigger your tool kit, the more flexibly your brain can anticipate and prescribe actions, and the better you can cope with life.Advertisement"}

My thyroid cancer had spread to my lungs. He suggested I see an oncologist right away.I let the phone go silent. My excitement over the job as foreign correspondent for The Associated Press had been building for months. We had sublet our Brooklyn apartment, put a deposit on one in Mexico City, and sold our car.We had also married \u2014 not just for love, but so that Ingrid, a Colombian doctor on a student visa, could travel freely across borders with me. My cancer had been stable in recent years, and I was itching to start my new life.Suddenly everything felt shaky. How could this happen? Now was the time for packing and saying goodbye to old friends, not visiting new doctors.Something hardened inside me. When Ingrid arrived home that evening, I played down the news. I had spots on my lungs, but they were all under a third of an inch. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t take care of in Mexico,\u201d I said. \u201cWe leave in three weeks. No way I\u2019m squeezing in another appointment.\u201dIngrid\u2019s eyes glistened. \u201cHave fun in Mexico,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going anywhere if you don\u2019t take care of yourself first.\u201dA passionate woman who speaks from the gut, Ingrid is no stranger to setbacks. She had watched her father die in a Colombian hospital, the victim of a carjacking gone awry. Speaking little English, she had fled the violence there to become a doctor in America, cleaning houses to pay her way. She married me knowing all about my disease, a rare, incurable form of thyroid cancer, which had required three neck operations. But she wasn\u2019t about to watch another man she loved die.\u201cMake the call,\u201d she said.A few days later, an oncologist was urging me to start a drug regimen at his clinic as soon as possible.I had a better idea. \u201cJust give me the recipe,\u201d I told him. I would share it with a doctor in Mexico and get treated there.Ingrid shot me a scolding look; the doctor frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re making enchiladas,\u201d he said. \u201cThese drugs can have nasty side effects. This is not the time to move to another country.\u201dOn the ride home, I said to Ingrid: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone understand? Being a foreign correspondent is my dream. It\u2019s like when you moved to America to practice medicine. Dreams are good for your health!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have lung spots, and I wasn\u2019t moving to the air pollution capital of Latin America,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of yourself, nothing else matters.\u201dThe next week, I canceled the appointment with the international movers, forfeited my deposit on the apartment in Mexico, and scanned the classified ads for a used car in Brooklyn. I settled back into my position on The A.P.\u2019s international desk, editing articles by reporters in exotic places that reminded me, painfully, of the job I had given up.My ordeal had barely begun. With chemotherapy starting in two months, the oncologist suggested I freeze my sperm for later use because the regimen can damage sex cells.Ingrid had another idea. We could make a baby now, \u201cthe natural way,\u201d she said.I suppressed a laugh. With my career sandbagged and chemotherapy looming, I couldn\u2019t even contemplate becoming a father. I would be nauseated and balding, in no shape to chase after a baby with a leaky diaper.Ingrid stood her ground. Thawed-out sperm are notoriously unreliable, she said. She had delivered hundreds of babies in Colombia, and believed bearing a child was a privilege, not to be taken lightly. This could be our last chance.I threw up my hands. I could only hope we would fail to conceive in the narrow window before the start of my regimen.But wouldn\u2019t you know: Three weeks later, Ingrid waved the positive test strip in my bewildered face, and our marriage entered a new phase. Around the time I underwent my first treatment, Ingrid was hit with morning sickness. Our side effects and symptoms were suddenly on parallel tracks.I woke up one morning feeling queasy and achy from my first treatment, listening to the whir of a portable pack pumping the drugs through a steel medical port in my chest. Bile crawled up my throat as I staggered to the bathroom and vomited into the toilet.Seconds later, Ingrid burst in, looking as pale as I felt, and vomited too.After gargling, she said: \u201cDo me a favor and vomit more softly. I don\u2019t want to hear your inner pig. You don\u2019t know how sick I feel.\u201d\u201cOh, but I think I do.\u201d In fact, I was that rare husband who knew exactly how sick my pregnant wife felt.A week later, our symptoms overlapped again. I discovered a clump of hair in the shower drain and a bald patch on my head. At the same time, Ingrid, her body flooded with hormones, discovered peach fuzz growing in surprising places, around her navel and on her neck. She was wide-eyed with concern.I reached into the shower drain and grabbed my hairball: \u201cYou think that\u2019s bad? I have a clump.\u201dShe touched my scalp, smiling weakly. \u201cWe both have nausea,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re losing hair. I have hair in new places. We both have growths inside us. Don\u2019t you see? Me and you, we\u2019re connected.\u201dIn no mood to celebrate our newfound solidarity, I drew away.\u201cIf your bad hair bothers you, let me shave you,\u201d she said. \u201cLots of sexy men are bald. Bruce Willis. Agassi. No need for your head to look like a bad lawn.\u201dI said: \u201cSure, go ahead. But first let me shave your peach fuzz.\u201dShe turned away: \u201cSo it will grow back as stubble? You\u2019re not helping one bit.\u201dIngrid and her hormones stalked out, sucking the air out of the bathroom. It wasn\u2019t so much that I didn\u2019t sympathize with my wife, but my own misery left me less able to cope with hers.Our similarities then dovetailed even more. As we both struggled to hold down food, I lost weight and Ingrid didn\u2019t gain enough. In fact, she was eating even less than me, preferring hot chocolate instead of dinner.I pictured our tiny child trapped in her womb, pumped up with sugar. For the first time, I started to worry more about the growth inside of her than the one in me. \u201cIngrid, listen to me,\u201d I said. \u201cThe baby needs to eat. And you\u2019re the only restaurant in town.\u201dThat night, I dreamed that Ingrid gave birth to a tumor while a surgeon extracted a fetus from my throat. I jerked awake to the glare of the morning sun, feeling famished and nauseated. Pulling a baseball cap over my patchy scalp, I went out to forage for food that wouldn\u2019t make me gag. At a bodega, an idea struck me. I bought a loaf of Bimbo, a crunchy Hispanic-style bread Ingrid once told me she liked, and brought it to her.She closed her eyes and took a bite, then blinked as if waking from a dream: \u201cWait until I tell my mother you\u2019re feeding our baby Colombian food.\u201d She crunched some more, reminiscing about how she ate Bimbo as a girl. \u201cAnd the fruits! In Colombia, the papayas are so ripe and sweet.\u201d A tear slipped down her cheek as she rambled on nostalgically.\u201cYou\u2019re eating,\u201d I whispered as I also ate a slice, feeling the tension in me dissipate. \u201cMaybe we can get a group rate on lumpectomies,\u201d I joked.\u201cPlease don\u2019t call our baby a lump,\u201d she said, cracking a smile.As the months to Ingrid\u2019s due date fell away, our baby grew big and strong inside her. Alas, in this, too, my wife and I were on similar paths. Despite the harsh chemotherapy regimen, the spots on my lungs were growing inside of me too, and the doctors seemed powerless to stop them.Finally, on a glorious evening in February, Ingrid gave birth by cesarean section to a healthy eight-pound girl, named Sophie, whose screams filled the room as a nurse handed her to me in a tightly wrapped bundle. I handed her to Ingrid, who brought her to her breast. As pale streetlight filtered in, all I heard was suckling.Our story could have ended here, with Sophie\u2019s face scrunched against my wife\u2019s milk-swollen bosom. That would have been enough for me.But it didn\u2019t end there. I went on medical leave to become a stay-at-home father. I switched from chemo to an experimental drug that, despite a few setbacks and scares, managed to hold my cancer at bay. The three of us moved from Brooklyn to upstate New York, where, come summers, we sow tomato and basil in our garden, and where our chemo baby, now 15, fills our home with art, laughter and piano music.Lumps and all, not a bad deal.David Kalish, who lives in upstate New York, is the author of \u201cThe Opposite of Everything,\u201d a comedic novel based on the events of this story.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulator\u2019s Plan to Rein In Trading Risks Raises Concerns", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission is overreaching in its quest for market safety and soundness.The agency wants the power to obtain access to the source codes of trading companies without a subpoena. Record retention is a worthy goal, but it is unclear whether the strapped regulator can protect such intellectual property. Worse, it may open the door for other officials to ask for the same unusual gateway.Market participants are justified in their concerns about the agency\u2019s proposal. As part of its plan to rein in the risks of automated trading, the regulator, which mainly looks after commodities markets, wants companies to store their source code in a repository, which would be easily accessible to its officials. The Justice Department would also be granted access.The intentions of the commission, led by its chairman, Timothy G. Massad, are valid given recent market-manipulation cases. One worry is that traders could spoof the market, the practice of making and then quickly canceling orders, and make the algorithms disappear. But the agency could require traders to maintain records without being given extraordinary powers. The commission has already successfully pursued several spoofing cases with its current authorities.There is reason to wonder whether the agency could protect the source codes it might obtain. Like the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is perennially underfunded. Every year, lawmakers either cut its expense requests or leave its budget flat. Even government entities with fewer resource problems, like the White House, are vulnerable to hacking.Other agencies could see this as an opening to push for unfettered access. For example, the Federal Trade Commission could argue it needed to regularly inspect the search algorithms of Alphabet\u2019s Google when examining antitrust concerns. The Justice Department was viewed as pushing legal boundaries when it sued Apple to force the company to provide access to a mass shooter\u2019s iPhone.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been hearing out the concerns. The agency reopened the comment period for the proposal and held a discussion with industry participants last week. Officials have repeatedly said they wanted to ensure that the rule enshrined confidentiality. Protecting the integrity of the markets is an important goal. But so is preventing the government agency from starting down a dangerous and slippery slope.Advertisement"}

(The short answer: challenging and quite sad at times.)Surprisingly, most respondents agreed to participate in the Matteses\u2019 artwork and were paid a few dollars for their time. Then the artists animated the interviews \u2014 with software downloaded from the internet, of course \u2014 and looped cartoonlike footage of the participants\u2019 talking heads on monitors set into the underside of desks, so that London gallerygoers have to peer around the banal-looking office furniture to watch.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a black box, for obvious reasons,\u201d Mr. Szoka said. \u201cJust as with cybersecurity, you don\u2019t want to make too clear what\u2019s happening, so that people can\u2019t circumnavigate the system.\u201d\u201cIt had been shown in museums, so when it was removed, we were surprised,\u201d said Mr. Mattes, who wrote to the company to find out why it was removed. He said he received legalese in response.He added: \u201cIt was hard for me to imagine that the internet is more conservative than art museums. I grew up with the idea that art is old and boring, and the Net is fun and exciting, the wild, wild web, where anything can happen.\u201dThat got them thinking about the process. \u201cWe wondered, is there some software?\u201d Mr. Mattes recalled. \u201cAn algorithm that compiles all the red flags? Most people believe the removal is done that way.\u201dThe moderators in general don\u2019t know which company they are working for, said Mr. Mattes. And they see truly disturbing graphic images on a daily basis.\u201cThe worst video I ever saw, personally, was an individual killing and dissecting cats,\u201d one moderator says in the current show.He goes on to recall the video as \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d and says, \u201cThe cats were killed in a majority of ways: running them over, electrocution, beating, stabbing.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI personally am just not going to continue answering this.\u201dOne particular incident came up over and over. \u201cA lot of them mentioned being asked to remove images of Osama Bin Laden after he was killed,\u201d Ms. Mattes said, which she thought was somehow \u201cpolitically related\u201d and therefore troubling.The Carroll/Fletcher show also features the Matteses\u2019 2016 series, \u201cImage Search Results\u201d (the phrase is from Google\u2019s comprehensive image search). One work renders the internet as a spooky undersea landscape with each water level representing a more unknowable depth. They had the result printed on a beach towel.A more lighthearted series, \u201cBy Everyone for No One Every Day (BEFNOED)\u201d (2014), is a comment on the universe of content online that may never have any viewers at all. It asks the question, If a tree falls online, does it make a sound?For it, the Matteses hired people anonymously on crowdsourcing sites to perform what Ms. Mattes called \u201csimple, absurd acts.\u201d One man does handstand push-ups with \u201cEva and Franco Mattes\u201d written on his belly.In the gallery, the monitors displaying the bizarre acts are awkwardly installed, so that people must contort themselves to watch, even lying on the floor, \u201cforcing the viewer into being a performer,\u201d Mr. Mattes said.The installation is typical in its blend of confrontation and playfulness. In an email, Mr. Vickers of the Serpentine Galleries placed the artists on a direct line with the post-World War I Dada movement: \u201c\u2018The beginnings of Dada,\u2019 poet Tristan Tzara recalled, \u2018were not the beginnings of art, but of disgust.\u2019\u201dChristiane Paul, an adjunct curator of new media arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said: \u201cThey have a reputation of being pranksters, but there\u2019s no posturing about it. It\u2019s driven by a deep engagement with the issues.\u201dMs. Paul cited \u201cLife Sharing\u201d (2000\u201303) as a \u201clandmark project\u201d by the Matteses. For that work, they made many intimate aspects of their lives \u2014 right down to their bank statements \u2014 available online.\u201cThey anticipated what would happen with social media platforms,\u201d Ms. Paul said of the now common sharing of mundane activities on blogs, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Both Ms. Mattes and Mr. Mattes hail from the Italian province of Brescia \u2014 and it\u2019s worth noting that they declined to say which towns, in an attempt to preserve a sliver of privacy.They met in 1995 through mutual friends while traveling in Spain, and have been together, and making art as a team, ever since. They\u2019ve been based in Brooklyn for seven years.The \u201cDark Content\u201d works have a journalistic aspect, but Mr. Mattes said he was amazed that there was not more literature shining a light on the topic of content monitoring.He rejected the idea that the radical duo was going soft by looking at the moderators as human beings.\u201cA lot of our work has been confrontational, like the one of me hanging myself,\u201d Mr. Mattes said. \u201c But we are not looking to punch people in the face, either. Hopefully there\u2019s something we can we learn from their experiences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel Tells Stories That Go Beyond Chips", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingMAYBE you associate Intel with the processor that makes your laptop work. On one hand, that\u2019s a triumph of branding: For a slogan from a company that doesn\u2019t actually sell directly to consumers, \u201cIntel Inside\u201d is a familiar idea.On the other hand, it\u2019s a potential problem. Years after the peak of the so-called Wintel era \u2014 when PCs with Windows operating systems and Intel chips dominated \u2014 Intel considers itself as a much more diversified technology creator and wants consumers to see it that way, too.Intel\u2019s effort to shift that brand perception has been going on for a couple of years. But perhaps the most interesting component of this push is only now establishing itself: an internal advertising group, formally started in February 2015, that is in a unique position to crank out stories promoting the most innovative happenings associated with Intel. In an amusing echo of the Wintel era, it is called Agency Inside.This internal creative group is on track to have 90 employees by the end of the year, according to Teresa Herd, the Intel global creative director heading the enterprise. The company has also started an internal video and digital studio, Intel Global Production Labs, led by Yogiraj Graham. These entities have produced a slew of original content and have played a crucial role in some of Intel\u2019s most mainstream branding efforts.The big picture, according to Intel\u2019s chief marketing officer, Steven Fund \u2014 who has worked at Procter & Gamble, Pepsi and Staples \u2014 is that Intel wasn\u2019t \u201cgetting credit for all the experiences that we enable.\u201d Not enough people realize, he said, that Intel\u2019s various processors and other technologies beyond PC chips play some role in all sorts of creative experiments in realms including fashion and art and science and medicine.\u201cWe were marketing ourselves as an ingredient brand,\u201d said Mr. Fund, who has been with Intel since 2014. He said Intel had become so associated with PCs that the company was \u201ca little bit of a victim of our branding success with \u2018Intel Inside.\u2019\u201dIntel, Mr. Fund said, \u201cdecided to bring a lot of advertising in-house,\u201d and hired Ms. Herd, then working at Staples, to oversee that effort. (Mr. Fund noted that Intel continued to work with outside agencies as well: \u201cIt\u2019s a good mash-up, if you will.\u201d)Ms. Herd says her team operates much like an external agency \u2014 by responding to the marketing needs of various departments \u2014 but enjoys far greater access to current and future projects at the company that, as she put it, \u201cnobody else knows about.\u201d Efficiency aside, this is also an appealing situation for those she\u2019s recruiting for the creative department.Ms. Herd noted that other tech companies, including Apple and Google, also had internal creative groups. But Intel\u2019s more indirect relationship to the mainstream consumer \u2014 \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a can of Intel,\u201d she said \u2014 is a challenge and an opportunity. While the company obviously still wants to sell more chips and other tech components, the role of Agency Inside is to make that happen by influencing how people \u201cfeel\u201d about Intel.\u201cWe have access to the maker side of the business, and the stories that are happening,\u201d Ms. Herd said. \u201cWe can go to the business and say, \u2018All right, what do you have now?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Devices That Deserve to Go Along on Vacation", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byTech FixCHILDREN are usually forced to pick just one or two of their beloved stuffed animals to take with them on summer vacation. Adults should consider doing the same with their electronic devices.You don\u2019t want to weigh down your travel bag with gear you will barely use. And you probably should leave your more expensive gadgets at home, unless you want to become a target for muggers.What to do? My personal packing starts with devices that are compact and lightweight. The price tag should not exceed $500, and if my smartphone can capably perform a task, I don\u2019t bother with something that does the same thing.This happens too often: After cramming into your airplane seat, you shut your eyes to relax and a baby starts screaming behind you. You need a media device to drown out the noise with music or a movie.As for earphones, I will skip recommending a fancy pair of earbuds \u2014 just another small, valuable item to lose on a trip. The earbuds that came with your smartphone, like the Apple EarPods, should sufficiently drown out the noise.Most hotels include cable television, but after channel surfing for a few hours, you will realize that the only movies that ever seem to air are \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201dThe most annoying part of renting a car is all the upsells, particularly the extra fee for a GPS device and a mount \u2014 as if your smartphone did not provide maps already.When renting a house on Airbnb or a similar site like HomeAway, the situation may be different from a hotel if a large group and a kitchen are involved.This may sound odd, but I have found it extremely useful to pack a sous vide precision cooker on Airbnb trips. First, a primer: A sous vide cooker heats water to a precise temperature; you seal food like steaks and salmon into plastic bags and immerse them in the water to cook them evenly at that temperature.The benefit of bringing along a sous vide cooker is the amount of time it frees up for you to enjoy other activities instead of paying attention to your food. Imagine going hiking for three hours and returning to a perfectly cooked medium-rare beef roast. It beats going to a restaurant.When you\u2019re outside, you don\u2019t need much technology other than a camera. Assuming you bought a smartphone in the last few years, don\u2019t bother packing an extra camera like a GoPro \u2014 that\u2019s just extra space and another power cable to carry around.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Weekend in Chicago", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "\u201cThe Newlywed Game\u201d is on the television. Julia Rhoden, 53, is sitting on her bed, exhausted from another long day at the health care center where she works as a nurse\u2019s aide. There is a loud boom and then another and another. She feels a sting as a bullet enters her back. \u201cI been shot! I been shot!\u201d she cries out to her children in the next room, as blood soaks through the summer dress she wears as a nightgown.That same night, 15-year-old Veronica Lopez is hit as she rides in a Jeep that is speeding along a waterfront drive. \u201cBabe, they shot me in the stomach,\u201d the girl tells a friend, who later says he covered her body with his own as the gunfire continued.\u201cHelp, I\u2019ve been shot!\u201d another teenager screams as he limps down a darkened street, a bullet having torn through his leg.It is Friday night in Chicago, and the Memorial Day weekend is just getting started. Police Department officials plan to deploy more than a thousand extra officers to deal with the violence they fear will intensify with the unofficial start of summer.There is no stopping the gunfire, which comes in bursts and waves, interrupting holiday barbecues, igniting gang rivalries, engulfing neighborhoods, blocks, families.From Friday evening to the end of Monday, 64 people will have been shot in this city of 2.7 million, six of them fatally. In a population made up of nearly equal numbers of whites, blacks and Hispanics, 52 of the shooting victims are black, 11 Hispanic and one white.  Eight are women, the rest men. Some 12 people are shot in cars, 11 along city sidewalks, and at least four on home porches.It is a level of violence that has become the terrifying norm, particularly in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. With far fewer residents, Chicago has more homicides than  Los Angeles or New York.In an effort to capture what is happening on Chicago\u2019s streets, and why, The New York Times dispatched a team of reporters, photographers and videographers to virtually all of the shooting scenes across the city. Working around the clock through the three-day weekend, The Times interviewed relatives, witnesses, police officers and others, and captured how much violence has become a part of the city\u2019s fabric. The Times intends to follow the cases throughout the year.  This weekend, among the six killed are a father, Garvin Whitmore, who loved to travel but was scared of riding on roller coasters, and Mark Lindsey, whose outsize personality brought him his nickname, Lavish. The oldest person struck by a bullet is 57. The youngest person to die is Ms. Lopez, a high school student and former cheerleader.And so the logic of one Chicago mother, who watches another mother weep over her dead son in their South Side neighborhood, is this: She is glad her own son is in jail, because the alternative is unbearable.\u201cHe was bound to be shot this summer,\u201d she says.Rain is in the forecast, but Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson wants to make sure that his officers won\u2019t let their guard down as they head into the holiday weekend.\u201cI think you all know how important this weekend is,\u201d Mr. Johnson tells nearly 20 of Chicago\u2019s highest-ranking police officials at Public Safety Headquarters. \u201cViolence from the previous Memorial Day weekends hasn\u2019t been good.\u201dThe year, so far, has been steeped in blood. Shootings \u2014 1,177 as of the Friday morning before Memorial Day \u2014 are up by 50 percent for the year. Two hundred and thirty-three people are dead.Mayor Rahm Emanuel is also pushing for a quiet weekend. At a community event promoting nonviolence on the South Side, he greets men playing basketball, watches children draw, and compliments a mural underway, which reads: \u201cHearts Up. \u2026 Guns Down.\u201dA few hours later, the shooting starts.Tim Miller and a group of friends are sitting on the steps in front of their apartment building drinking beer when they spot a teenager walking out of an alley between low-rise apartment buildings onto South Racine Avenue. He has been shot and cries out for help. Two of his friends coming down the street are also shouting for assistance. The wounded teenager is bleeding heavily from his thigh. Mr. Miller and his friends, all in their 20s, put pressure on it, and then an ice pack. One goes inside to call 911. The police and an ambulance are on the way. So is Pauley LaPointe. With the crackle of the police scanner, he steers his Ford Crown Victoria toward the scene and punches the gas. He makes his living by selling video to the city's television news stations, and is often the first to report at a shooting scene.Mark Lindsey is outside his mother\u2019s house after a visit. He has chopped off his signature dreadlocks, and a woman has sent him a compliment. He forwards her message to a cousin. It\u2019s working already, he writes.He is behind the wheel of his red Chevy Monte Carlo, a car he so prizes that neighbors see him wash it again and again. A  man approaches on foot and opens fire,  and Mr. Lindsey, 25, is hit. The car lurches forward and strikes a parked pickup truck.His mother hears the gunfire, runs out and yanks on the locked car door. \u201cSomeone get him out of the car!\u201d she shouts over and over.The screams continue for long minutes. They are jarring here. This section of Ashburn, on the city\u2019s Southwest Side, had seemed somewhat removed from the worst of the gun violence.This block on West 75th Place is a cluster of small, neatly edged lawns rolling toward a quiet street where children play soccer. Late at night, television screens glow in living rooms. \u201cThis stuff don\u2019t happen here,\u201d says Mr. Lindsey\u2019s cousin Lorenzo Carter, 28. \u201cWe know everybody in this neighborhood.\u201dIn only a matter of minutes the police and ambulance will arrive, but the mother is frantic. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d she shouts.Witnesses see Mr. Lindsey in the driver\u2019s seat, his head resting against the window. He is taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center and is pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m.Mr. Lindsey worked at a railroad management company, friends say. \u201cHe was one of the success stories,\u201d says Leroy Cook, 26.The police have made no arrests in the case, and a motive is uncertain. Mr. Lindsey was arrested just a day before on a domestic battery charge. He was released on bond.Neighbors say the shooting shows that the violence is trickling onto blocks that had long been considered safe. \u201cShooting in Chicago is like a cancer,\u201d says Charles Parker, 46, standing on the street with another neighbor. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to spread out, and I just figured it was a matter of time.\u201dCalvin Ward, 50, is smoking a cigarette on the front steps at his wife\u2019s home on Paxton Avenue just after 1 a.m. when two young men come up the street and fire in his direction six times.Four bullets pierce the screen on the front door. One round grazes Mr. Ward\u2019s arm. Another tears into the house, flies through the living room and penetrates the bedroom wall before striking his wife, Julia Rhoden, sitting on her bed. She jumps up and runs out of the room, calling for help. When he hears Ms. Rhoden\u2019s screams, Mr. Ward scrambles to get a towel, and applies pressure to the wound as he waits for an ambulanceThe violence in this city has long been concentrated along blocks like the one on Paxton, where sleep is often disturbed in the middle of the night by the sound of gunshots. It\u2019s a world away from the glimmering downtown skyline and the mostly white, wealthier neighborhoods north of the tourist-clogged Loop.\u201cIt starts to become normal,\u201d says Darryl Edwards Sr., a neighbor who was awakened by the shots.Three years ago, he and his wife consulted a Google map before moving here, trying to see if there were people hanging out on the corners. He\u2019s happy with his choice \u2013 even though he estimates there have been gunshots on this block about 10 times.\u201cYou get some gunshots every day in some neighborhoods \u2014 every day,\u201d Mr. Edwards says. \u201cSo I say 10 in three years, that ain\u2019t too bad.\u201dMr. Ward is separated from Ms. Rhoden, but he is at her house visiting a 16-year-old daughter. He says he has no idea why the two men shot at him. \u201cI ain\u2019t no gangbanger or nothing,\u201d he says.Records show that Mr. Ward has been convicted several times of battery, and in 2012 was found guilty of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.\u201cI hope they catch them,\u201d Mr. Ward said of assailant, \u201cbut I doubt it.\u201d   A day after Ms. Rhoden is sent home from the hospital, she is resting in bed, her feet swelling and the bullet still lodged in her back. It is too close to her spine to be removed, she says doctors told her.Still, she is confident she will  recover, physically. Her mental state is a different story.\u201cEmotionally, I\u2019m not good \u2014 this put a fear in me,\u201d Ms. Rhoden says.A group of friends are crammed into a blue Jeep Grand Cherokee,  music blaring. One of them, Jose Alvarez, calls himself \u201cChi Rack Alvarez\u201d on Facebook, a play on Chicago\u2019s war-inspired nickname, Chiraq. He records a video of himself flashing signs disrespecting a gang, and posts it to Snapchat.Mr. Alvarez, 28, is at the wheel as the Jeep heads north on Lake Shore Drive, speeding by the affluent neighborhoods of the North Side, when a dark vehicle pulls alongside and someone inside opens fire.There are 15 shots in all, Mr. Alvarez estimates later from his hospital bed. He escapes with minor injuries: a bullet wound in the arm and a graze of his forehead.Not his friend Veronica Lopez, 15. \u201cI turned around, put my whole body on her, and hold her wound while they are still shooting through the door,\u201d Mr. Alvarez says. \u201cI was trying to save her, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201dMs. Lopez, a high school freshman, becomes the youngest murder victim of the mayhem over Memorial Day weekend.So much of Chicago\u2019s street violence is documented electronically that detectives scour the internet for the gang ties and grudges that often spark the gunfire. The police describe Mr. Alvarez as a gang member and say he may have been the intended target of the shooting. Mr. Alvarez insists that the police are wrong in labeling him part of a gang.After Ms. Lopez\u2019s death, he changed his Facebook profile name to \u201cRip Princess Veronica.\u201d  He says he expects the killers to boast about the shooting on social media.Damien Cionzynski, a 25-year-old forklift operator, is killed at a BP gas station just within the city limits. He is the third fatality of the weekend. The police, citing surveillance video and a witness, say they have identified two persons of interest in the killing and soon have one of them in custody.  Mr. Cionzynski\u2019s landlord, Sue Harle, says he came from Poland as a child and grew up in the area. He rented a basement room in her house  just a few blocks from where he was killed. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t lived half a life,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope they find these guys.\u201dThe doors are open at the Universal Missionary Baptist Church in Austin, on the West Side, and  a steady stream of people are  dropping off rifles, revolvers, even replica guns \u2014 61 weapons by the end of the day. Some are  rusty. Some date to the 1920s. Most donors walk away with gift cards for $100, an incentive paid for by the city to get some firearms off the streets.  \u201cThat\u2019s one gun gone,\u201d says Cordelia Brooks, who turned in a weapon that had once belonged to her grandfather and had barely been touched in years.  Officer Bob Garcia strains to find the serial numbers etched on one revolver. It has a night sight guide and bullets that resemble shotgun shells.  \u201cA criminal would love to get his hands on this,\u201d Officer Garcia says.The Chicago Police have regularly seized more illegally possessed guns than New York or Los Angeles. People arrested here generally face a one-year minimum sentence for illegal possession. But efforts to make the laws more like New York\u2019s, which mandate a three-and-a-half-year minimum sentence for an illegal, loaded weapon, have so far failed in the state legislature, and Chicago\u2019s bans on handgun ownership and on gun sales have been struck down by the courts in recent years. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a South Side priest, says guns have become part of the \u201cwardrobe\u201d for some in the city. They would rather risk a short prison term than face the danger of walking the streets without a gun.Sharod Roper, 24, who grew up in the Englewood neighborhood, says he had occasionally carried a gun to protect himself from being robbed, but never used it. \u201cI have to have a gun to scare them off,\u201d he says.\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d Shorlanda Tutson cries. Her face is soaked with tears. Her hands stretch toward the sky.The body of her son, Garvin Whitmore, 27, is in the car he borrowed from her, now covered with a white sheet. Mr. Whitmore and his fianc\u00e9e, Ashley Harrison, 26, had been sitting in the car outside a liquor store, in a South Side neighborhood accustomed to gunfire, when, in broad daylight, shooting started. Mr. Whitmore was fatally shot in the head. Ms. Harrison, the mother of his two children, grabbed a gun from the car, jumped out and fired into the air. She was later charged with discharging the weapon, and the police say they are following leads from video and forensic evidence in the case. Standing off to the side is a woman, in tears. She does not know Mr. Whitmore's family, she says, but understands their  pain. The woman, Noel, says she does not want her last name used, for fear of bringing more troubles to her family. She says her nephew was killed a year ago as he left a party. Her 20-year-old son is a member of a gang. He has been shot each summer for the past three years. She is relieved that he is now in the Cook County jail.She says she tried to raise him right, but the forces outside her door were stronger. \u201cSomehow these streets suck my son in,\u201d she says. \u201cHis friends, they\u2019re dropping like flies. The boys, the girls, all of them. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\u201dIn a police command center packed wall to wall with computer screens, Officer Richard Walton  is tracking  in real time the shooting that left Mr. Whitmore dead. Witnesses say the suspect fled in a white sport utility vehicle. Officer Walton has views from all the city cameras mounted along nearby intersections, and there, on one monitor, comes a white S.U.V., making a sharp turn onto South Princeton Avenue.\u201cYou can even see a figure in the driver\u2019s seat, right there,\u201d Officer Walton says, after alerting officers on the scene which way the suspect is headed and sending them images of the car.From this nerve center, a dozen police officers monitor the city minute by minute. There is a map of the city overlaid with rectangles glowing red and orange to show current hot zones for gang disputes. A screen tracks the locations of the latest gunshots, capturing the sounds of shots and estimating their origin down to 15 feet. Facial recognition software helps narrow down suspects whose images are caught on security cameras.Sometimes only minutes after the gunshots end, a computer system takes a victim\u2019s name and displays any arrests and gang ties \u2014 as well as whether the victim has a rating on the department\u2019s list of people most likely to shoot someone or be shot. Police officials say most shootings involve a relatively small group of people with the worst ratings on the list. The police and social service workers have been going to some of their homes to warn that the authorities are watching them and offer job training and educational assistance as a way out of gangs. Of the 64 people shot over the weekend, 50 of them, or 78 percent, are included on the department\u2019s list. At least seven of the people shot over the weekend have been shot before. For one man, only 23 years old, it is his third time being shot.About a block away from the Lexington Street shooting, a fight breaks out. Now the anger is aimed at arriving police officers.         Distrust of the police flashes on the streets, again and again. \u201cPlease sir, don\u2019t beat me,\u201d one man yells, mockingly, at the scene of early morning gunfire that has left three men shot \u2014 two in their legs and another in his back \u2014 along West Walnut Street on the West Side. Four men in their 20s are watching as the police mark the scene. Shell casings speckle the street. The men, who say they have been drinking a concoction of Pineapple Crush, hard candy and cough syrup, call out tauntingly to the officers. \u201cMan, you remind me of Clint Eastwood,\u201d one says. The Chicago Police Department, the nation\u2019s second-largest municipal force, with about 12,000 officers, has a deeply strained history with its residents, particularly African- Americans. The distrust makes solving so many shootings all the harder. The distrust means hurdles for law enforcement. Witnesses say they cannot remember what happened. The wounded refuse to cooperate. Victims drive themselves to hospitals, rather than call the police. They give the same story, over and over again: I felt a sting and realized I had been shot; I didn\u2019t see anything.How residents feel about crime and the police in Chicago, according to a recent poll:CHICAGONeighborhoods where ...WEST SIDESOUTH SIDEHow residents feel about crime and the police in Chicago, according to a recent poll:CHICAGOWEST SIDESOUTHSIDENeighbor-hoods where ...So crimes go unsolved. In 2015, the authorities made arrests in just over a quarter of that year\u2019s approximately 470 homicides. That only frustrates residents and fuels resentment. Just before 3 a.m. on Saturday, a young man, bleeding badly, cries out for help after being shot on North Kimball Avenue. But then he begs the neighbors not to call the authorities. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018I want to call 911,\u2019 he\u2019s running from my house,\u201d Mauricio Sandoval, 37, says. \u201cHe don\u2019t say nothing. I see the shot in the back. I\u2019m scared too, you know.\u201dOver four decades, Herb Harrington, 64, has seen generations pass through his barber shop in the Austin neighborhood, and cut the hair of many of the neighborhood children who have since become involved in gangs.Mr. Harrington is trimming a customer\u2019s hair in his shop when he hears a series of loud bangs. They come from the direction of the nearby Christ Outreach Deliverance Center on West Chicago Avenue, where a 23-year-old man is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to his leg.  \u201cI heard five shots and I thought it was fireworks, but that was just wishful thinking,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cIt was real close, and one of the customers went outside and saw a young man laying on the ground.\u201d Mr. Harrington says he feels the area has become more violent. \u201cEvery week it\u2019s someone else,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s retaliation, this person for that person, and it doesn\u2019t stop. Every time there\u2019s a body down, there\u2019s going to be another one and another one.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re talking about poverty and families broken up and people not having opportunity and losing their way,\u201d he says. \u201cViolence is what we talk about in these chairs. We talk about it. We analyze it. But we don\u2019t have easy answers.\u201dA 34-year-old woman watches as an ex-boyfriend, his arm wobbly from alcohol, holds a gun to her cousin\u2019s head. Their dispute is over money. The cousin, Dontae Brock, pushes the gun away. They think it is a joke. But the ex-boyfriend pulls the trigger, she tells the police, the shots striking Mr. Brock in the torso. The woman, at the wheel of her Ford Explorer, says she sees what looks like a flash of fire on the floor of her car as the blasts hit. Moments  later, she jerks the Explorer into reverse, then speeds to a nearby hospital, where Mr. Brock, who was shot in the passenger seat, is told he will survive. Returning to her mother\u2019s rowhouse later, next to the scene of the shooting, the woman \u2014  a mother of four, her cousin\u2019s blood streaked across the back of her white T-shirt \u2014 says she has made up her mind: \u201cI got to leave this city.\u201d Her 56-year-old mother, wearing bright pink pants, plops down on her stoop, the John Hancock Center looming in the skyline about a mile away. For about six years, she has lived on this street of old sand-colored brick rowhouses that were part of Chicago\u2019s infamous Cabrini-Green housing project just north of downtown. She was cleaning ribs in the kitchen when she heard the gunfire and dropped to the floor. Now she smokes a cigarette and sinks her head into her hands.\u201cI hate the person that invented guns,\u201d she says.Police scanners announce Chicago\u2019s crime problem in staccato bursts, over and over, with the same words: \u201cShots fired.\u201dMany of the gunshots here hit no one, but they still leave a sense of worry and vulnerability. Since the start of the year, Chicagoans have called the police 28,000 times to report gunfire. Some are multiple calls about a single shooting and others turn out to be fireworks, but the possibility of being shot leaves its mark, even beyond those killed and wounded.At his home on the South Side, Rod Reeves, 42, turns on the spigot and shows how his garden hose, punctured by bullets, now leaks. Mr. Reeves says he and his family ducked behind a brick wall in their home to avoid stray shots when gunfire broke out on his block.\u201cI guess it\u2019s good to have a brick house,\u201d Mr. Reeves says.The police don\u2019t know exactly what led to a shooting in Roseland, on the city\u2019s far South Side. But the residents are fairly certain.\u201cThere\u2019s always retaliation,\u201d says one resident near where a 17-year-old was shot in the arm, insisting that her name and photograph not be published. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to come back and kill me.\u201dRetaliation drives a good share of Chicago\u2019s violence, scarring bystanders and relatives and, in a notorious case last year, killing a 9-year-old boy whose father was in a gang.Residents say it has gotten worse in recent years as gang structure has shifted. Some are vast and highly organized, while others span only a few blocks. New gang names pile on top of old ones, and they can change rapidly. So can their boundaries. And while once the violence associated with gangs was largely related to drug disputes, lately it is driven more by basic rivalries over turf and dominance, the police say.\u201cWhy did I gang bang?\u201d  asks Johnathan Hallman, 28, who lives on the South Side. \u201cJust to be around something, like just to be a part of something, man. Because when you growing up, man, you see all these other people, older people that\u2019s in the gang life or whatever. They making they little money and they doing they thing. You see the little ice, the car they driving. It\u2019s just an inspiration, man.\u201dMr. Hallman says he joined a gang at a young age, but eventually decided it was not all he thought it would be. He got out, he says.There is a routine in place whenever violence breaks out around the all-night laundromat in North Lawndale, on the West Side, which it frequently does. The employee on duty calls a co-worker, Frederick Clark, and says \u201cattack.\u201d Mr. Clark, 54, then alerts the police and heads into work. He has fielded about 20 such calls in the last six months, he says.\u201cI myself have been attacked 13 times in eight years here,\u201d Mr. Clark says. \u201cNever with guns, but I\u2019ve had to defend myself.\u201dSo when two men are shot just outside the laundromat, on South Harding Avenue, around 11 p.m. on Sunday, the business barely skips a beat. It doesn\u2019t close  or even slow much.For all the trauma, pain and anxiety that the illegal use of handguns has caused people in communities like North Lawndale, there is also a practical response: This is where people live and work. And so they do. Milk to pick up? Work to get to? Laundry to do? When the police secure the area after the shootings, reporters stand outside the perimeter and watch. But one man lifts the police tape to get to the laundromat. Another man grows angry when police officers stop him from doing the same. \u201cIt\u2019s yellow tape, not red,\u201d he shouts at the officers, so familiar with the rules of crime scenes that he knows red tape signals crucial evidence.More than 200 men and women are crammed into cells at the Cook County jail, awaiting their first appearances in court. Some sit with their eyes closed, trying to sleep. Others bounce their knees and stare anxiously from the cells. The police are still in the early stages of their investigations into the weekend\u2019s shootings, and not one of the people being held in the cells awaiting an appearance in Cook County bond court has been charged with shooting anyone over the weekend.Peter McDaniel is cleaning up behind a three-story apartment building in the 11th Police District on the West Side, the hardest hit area of the city this weekend. Signs of distress are everywhere, with brick and stone homes in decay, their expansive porches crumbling and windows boarded up. Many people have reinforced their homes with chained and padlocked gates. Signs warn of mean dogs. Streets are pockmarked by vacant and overgrown lots. Over the course of the weekend at least nine shootings took place in the 11th, one right near Mr. McDaniel.He hit the ground and emerged unhurt. But two men had gunshot wounds and the assailants, driving a black car, escaped.This year, at least 32 killings have occurred in this area of about six square miles.Mr. McDaniel blames a bitter and violent rivalry between two gangs, including one he says he has left. \u201cWe can\u2019t get along,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just always been that way.\u201dThe holiday is winding down. People toss out garbage from sidewalk parties. Coolers go back into car trunks for the rides home from the lakefront. The city gets ready to go back to work.Then a flurry of chaos bursts over the police scanner: Two men have been shot, on opposite sides of town, and neither one will survive. On the South Side, on a block of boarded businesses and apartments along Calumet Avenue, a woman wanders up to a police line. The body of James Taylor, 44, hit by multiple bullets, lies beside a car. The woman, a relative, asks if she can see the body, but an officer says no. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way you want to see that person,\u201d he tells her. On the far North Side, in a neighborhood of sari shops and kebab houses, police officers scan flashlights through bushes and behind buildings along North Rockwell Street, looking for evidence and for an assailant who is still on the loose. Johan Jean, 39, has been struck in the neck, and the police say a dispute earlier in the day in a Target store might  have led to the shooting. In the alleyway where he has died, smoke still swirls from an outdoor grill.Scanner audio via BroadcastifyDesign by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.
