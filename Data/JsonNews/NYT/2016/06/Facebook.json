{"Headline": "F.B.I. Steps Up Use of Stings in ISIS Cases", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. has significantly increased its use of stings in terrorism cases, employing agents and informants to pose as jihadists, bomb makers, gun dealers or online \u201cfriends\u201d in hundreds of investigations into Americans suspected of supporting the Islamic State, records and interviews show.Undercover operations, once seen as a last resort, are now used in about two of every three prosecutions involving people suspected of supporting the Islamic State, a sharp rise in the span of just two years, according to a New York Times analysis. Charges have been brought against nearly 90 Americans believed to be linked to the group.The increase in the number of these secret operations, which put operatives in the middle of purported plots, has come with little public or congressional scrutiny, and the stings rely on F.B.I. guidelines that predate the rise of the Islamic State.While F.B.I. officials say they are careful to avoid illegally entrapping suspects, their undercover operatives are far from bystanders. In recent investigations from Florida to California, agents have helped people suspected of being extremists acquire weapons, scope out bombing targets and find the best routes to Syria to join the Islamic State, records show.Officials said in interviews that because social media had given extremists a cloak of anonymity, these undercover stings \u2014 online and in person \u2014 had become increasingly vital to gathering evidence and deterring possible attacks in the United States.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait for the person to mobilize on his own time line,\u201d said Michael B. Steinbach, who leads the F.B.I.\u2019s national security branch. He added that the F.B.I. could not afford to \u201cjust sit and wait knowing the individual is actively plotting.\u201dCounterterrorism officials said the Islamic State had inspired loyalists to strike quickly, even within days or weeks of their radicalization. Unlike wiretaps or searches, undercover operations do not require a judge to sign a warrant. They are overseen by F.B.I. supervisors and Justice Department prosecutors, and so can usually be started more quickly.But defense lawyers, Muslim leaders and civil liberties advocates say that F.B.I. operatives coax suspects into saying and doing things that they might not otherwise do \u2014 the essence of entrapment.\u201cThey\u2019re manufacturing terrorism cases,\u201d said Michael German, a former undercover agent with the F.B.I. who researches national security law at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. In many of the recent prosecutions, he said, \u201cthese people are five steps away from being a danger to the United States.\u201dKaren J. Greenberg, the director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University, said undercover operations had become the norm for the F.B.I. in the most recent Islamic State cases, with little debate or understanding of how the bureau actually conducts its investigations, especially its online stings.\u201cI think the F.B.I. is really going down the wrong path with a lot of these ISIS cases,\u201d she said, using a common acronym for the Islamic State, also known as ISIL.Court records and interviews give a glimpse of the aggressive undercover methods that have become typical in investigations once the F.B.I. identifies someone as a possible threat.In Rochester, a paid informant went undercover and drove a man suspected of being an Islamic extremist, Emanuel Lutchman, to a Walmart in December to buy a machete, ski masks, zip ties and other supplies for a would-be terrorist attack on New Year\u2019s Eve. Because Mr. Lutchman, a mentally ill panhandler, had no money, the informant covered the $40 cost.In North Carolina, an undercover agent pressed another suspect, Justin Sullivan, on whether he was willing to commit acts of terrorism for the Islamic State \u2014 \u201cdo you think you can kill?\u201d the agent asked in one online message \u2014 before giving him a silencer for an AR-15 assault rifle in June 2015.And in Washington State, an undercover informant paid $1,100 to Daniel Franey, a former soldier, for acting as a lookout on several trips to buy duffel bags filled with assault weapons for a possible attack last summer.The F.B.I. arrested all three suspects before any attacks occurred, and has used similar undercover techniques to prosecute dozens of others it believes had ties to the Islamic State, court records show. While some defendants have pleaded guilty, most are still awaiting trial.\u201cWhen the bad guys turn to encrypted areas, we\u2019re dark, and the only way to gain a better understanding of what we\u2019re up against may be through an undercover,\u201d Mr. Steinbach said. He said using undercover agents online allowed the F.B.I. to \u201cflesh out\u201d suspects by gaining their trust and persuading them to disclose their real identities.The F.B.I. has about 1,000 open investigations into \u201chomegrown violent extremists,\u201d which it defines as Americans motivated by a foreign terrorist group, including the Islamic State, to conduct attacks at home, officials said. They said that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of cases \u2014 hundreds in all \u2014 had entailed undercover operations against people suspected of being Islamic extremists, but that the F.B.I. did not have precise numbers.But court records examined by The Times indicate that the F.B.I. has used undercover operations with increasing frequency in its Islamic State investigations since the earliest cases emerged in March 2014. (For years before that, the bureau had carried out similar sting investigations against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.)Only about 30 percent of the first few dozen prosecutions through late 2014 appear to have relied on evidence gathered through undercover operations. That number climbed to about 45 percent by early last year, with a string of undercover prosecutions in New York, Minnesota and Illinois. And since February 2015, about 40 of 60 Islamic State prosecutions, or 67 percent, have been based on undercover operations.The number of Islamic State prosecutions over all has slowed since January; officials believe a spate of prosecutions late last year may have deterred plotters. But undercover stings have remained the norm. So far this year, eight of the dozen Islamic State prosecutions have relied on undercover operatives, court records indicate.Undercover activity also appears to have risen in the hundreds of Islamic State investigations run by the F.B.I. in the last two years, but it is not as sharp a spike as seen in those cases that led to formal charges, officials said.Asked about The Times\u2019s data, F.B.I. officials said any increase in undercover activity probably reflected the emergence of what they believed to be a larger and more dangerous pool of Islamic State suspects. The officials said there had been no deliberate decision or policy change to rely more heavily on undercover agents.Often, the targets in the stings first attracted the F.B.I.\u2019s attention for espousing what agents saw as support for the Islamic State or violent extremism online, on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. The F.B.I. insists that its agents comb these sites not as \u201cthought police,\u201d but rather to look for people who are threatening acts of terrorism. Once the F.B.I. has identified someone as a potential threat, supervisors often have an undercover agent contact the suspect online.In Northern Illinois, for instance, an undercover agent sent a friend request on Facebook to Hasan Edmonds, a National Guardsman who had published posts on social media that the F.B.I. had deemed alarming. Over the next several months, Mr. Edmonds and the undercover agent exchanged numerous online messages, discussing the possibility of traveling to the Middle East to help the Islamic State, or perhaps mounting an attack at the Illinois armory where Mr. Edmonds trained.\u201cOaths have been given,\u201d Mr. Edmonds wrote to an informant in one online message in January 2015, according to a criminal complaint. \u201cWhen the time is right, we will strike.\u201dA few days later, Mr. Edmonds wrote that he and a cousin were eager to help the cause and \u201cwould love to do something like the brother in Paris did\u201d \u2014 a reference to the terrorist attack a few weeks earlier on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.The undercover agent responded by suggesting to Mr. Edmonds that if he could not make it overseas to fight with the Islamic State, he could show his commitment and achieve martyrdom in the United States, court filings said.The online messages led to a meeting in person in March 2015 between a second undercover operative and Mr. Edmonds\u2019s cousin, Jonas Edmonds, prosecutors said.In that case and in many others, F.B.I. undercover operatives have let plots play out until a suspect acquires a weapon, for instance, or buys a plane ticket to Turkey en route to Syria.An investigation that ended last month in Miami followed this pattern, with the normal tableau of undercover operatives and talk of a bloody attack. The F.B.I. received word \u2014 exactly how is unclear \u2014 that James Gonzalo Medina, 40, a Muslim convert who also went by James Muhammad, might have been considering attacking a synagogue, according to court records.It opened an investigation into Mr. Medina in March, but the initial evidence was spotty. At one meeting with an undercover informant and several other men, Mr. Medina accused a friend of wanting to blow up a synagogue; he seemed to distance himself from the idea.Five days later, as Mr. Medina was driving with the F.B.I. informant in a suburb of Miami, he pointed out a synagogue with what he called \u201cDavid\u2019s triangle star\u201d on the outside. The F.B.I. informant suggested attacking the synagogue during a Jewish holiday two weeks later, according to court files.\u201cNow that\u2019ll be a good day to go and bomb them,\u201d Mr. Medina responded, according to the files.The informant took the proposed plot a step further, introducing Mr. Medina to an acquaintance the informant said was experienced with explosives. The acquaintance was actually an undercover F.B.I. agent, who questioned Mr. Medina several times about why he wanted to bomb the synagogue.Mr. Medina said he wanted to carry out a bombing and claim responsibility on behalf of \u201cISIS in America.\u201d\u201cYou need to be sure, brother,\u201d the undercover agent told him, adding, \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to do any of this.\u201d Mr. Medina reaffirmed his commitment, according to the court files.Finally, in late April, the agent met Mr. Medina in a parking lot and gave him the bomb, which was inert and \u201cposed no danger to the public,\u201d prosecutors said. The two men drove toward the synagogue a few miles away, and after Mr. Medina stepped out of the car with the bomb in hand, he was arrested.Officials said they were keenly aware that such cases would almost inevitably lead defense lawyers to charge that the F.B.I. had entrapped their clients. That is why, the officials said, they often gauge suspects\u2019 commitment to carrying out an attack and give them an \u201cout\u201d to back away.F.B.I. officials are also quick to point out that, despite dozens of challenges to undercover terrorism cases brought since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a judge has yet to throw one out on the grounds of entrapment. Not that some judges have not considered it.The F.B.I. planted an undercover informant inside a mosque in Newburgh as part of what became an elaborate, nearly yearlong plot to launch a Stinger surface-to-air missile at a local air base and two synagogues. The F.B.I. even built a fake Stinger missile and had it delivered to the men.The stings have left many Muslim leaders wary, even as the F.B.I. has sought to build bridges to Muslim Americans. At mosques in Oregon, imams sometimes warn of F.B.I. informants and caution \u201cthat we have those among us who are not with us,\u201d said Tom Nelson, a Muslim lawyer in Portland who has represented a number of local men in terrorism-related cases.His message for his Muslim friends, Mr. Nelson said, is blunt.\u201cAvoid the F.B.I. like the plague,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely not an ally. That\u2019s what the F.B.I. does \u2014 they infiltrate.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the job held by Michael German at New York University. He researches national security law at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice; he does not teach law at the university.

But, I \u2014 the one single, childless friend you\u2019ve invited \u2014 do have some special requests for the birthday party I\u2019m hoping you can accommodate. To make this simple, I\u2019ve created a handy list for your reference to ensure you\u2019re planning an event I can enjoy. Or at least, almost enjoy.\u2022 Serve those cupcakes baked in ice cream cones.\u2022 Email me a list of nonoffensive gifts to get your kid. I\u2019ve read too many contradictory Facebook posts about expensive, plastic, gendered, Swedish, wooden toys to make this call myself. I promise my only gifting goal is to bribe your kid into liking me more than your other friends, not negate your parenting philosophy and/or way of life.\u2022 Dress your kid in overalls. Overalled kids are by far the cutest, and it\u2019s important to me that the one kid I know at the party is the cutest.\u2022 Set the party start time to later than 11 a.m. Since you had that baby, it seems you\u2019ve been magically transported to another time zone where people are caffeinated and accepting phone calls by dawn. Meanwhile, the rest of us need our full mornings to do stuff like frantically debate if my coffee maker\u2019s auto-brew timer stopped working or if I have a false memory of setting it, meaning I\u2019m completely losing my mind. Both cases are equally likely.\u2022 Tell everyone who is planning to inquire about my dating life to huddle at the entrance to the party. I want to get that out of the way first. It would be helpful if you placed the cupcake-cone platter immediately on the other side of this gaggle so I don\u2019t instantly flee.\u2022 Don\u2019t make me try those organic cheese doodle puffs this year. Not everything can or should be organic. It\u2019s hard enough connecting with you considering our current gap in life stages. Coating that chasm in organic orange cheese dust makes me feel like we may never again have any shared values or experiences.\u2022 Provide a list of preapproved conversation-starting questions that are appropriate to ask your stay-at-home mom friend who doesn\u2019t watch television. Look, you\u2019re the one who invited her, I\u2019m simply a feminist who respects everyone\u2019s decisions and doesn\u2019t like awkward silences.\u2022 Explain to the women from your Bumble Bee & Me music classes that I\u2019m going to walk away when they compare episiotomy experiences, but it\u2019s not because I\u2019m grossed out. It\u2019s that when they start with those stories, I feel an overwhelming need to immediately organize every single woman at the party into a group hug because being women is tough and sisterhood is important.\u2022 Serve booze. Not champagne cocktails. The hard stuff. Yes, of course I know it\u2019s before noon.\u2022 Time it so your kid has a meltdown right when a stranger glances at my midsection in this on-trend (I think) peplum top and asks when I\u2019m due. That way, there will at least be two of us crying in timeout behind the bouncy house.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fianc\u00e9e Was \u2018Happy-Go-Lucky\u2019 Days After Kayaker Died, Police Say", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byGOSHEN, N.Y. \u2014 Ten days after Vincent Viafore disappeared in the frigid waters of the Hudson River, Angelika Graswald, his fianc\u00e9e, had a run-in with police detectives that would prove pivotal in the case, an investigator testified on Tuesday at a pretrial hearing here.In his testimony, Aniello Moscato, a senior investigator with the New York State Police, said Ms. Graswald had called him that April morning. The two had been in touch daily during the search for the body.When investigators saw Ms. Graswald on the island, she seemed ill at ease. \u201cShe was pacing back and forth, holding her stomach, deep breathing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe more or less volunteered that there were problems with the relationship.\u201dAt that point, Mr. Moscato said, he suggested that Ms. Graswald might be more comfortable talking privately with Donald DeQuarto, the investigator with whom she had been working most closely.Shortly afterward, Mr. DeQuarto told Mr. Moscato that Ms. Graswald had admitted removing a plug from her fianc\u00e9\u2019s kayak, a detail that prosecutors have seized on as evidence in their murder case against her.\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me; she told you that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Moscato testified. \u201cI was in shock.\u201d He added that after Mr. Viafore vanished, \u201cshe was being treated like a widow, a grieving widow.\u201d The couple shared an apartment in Poughkeepsie and had planned to be married on the beach in Latvia, where Ms. Graswald was born.The pretrial hearing, known as a Huntley hearing, is an opportunity for the defense to challenge the way in which the police obtained their evidence. Ms. Graswald\u2019s lawyer, Richard A. Portale, has said he does not want jurors to have access to an 11-hour police interrogation video, arguing that incriminating remarks by his client were coerced.Mr. Moscato also testified that on the Friday after Mr. Viafore vanished, Ms. Graswald invited him to a nightclub, along with other search-and-rescue workers. \u201cShe wanted all the people assisting with the search to join her at the party,\u201d he said.When Mr. Moscato saw Ms. Graswald on April 29 on Bannerman Island, he and another investigator asked her to walk them through the places she had gone with Mr. Viafore in the hours before his kayak capsized. Mr. Portale has said the reason Mr. Viafore drowned is that he was not wearing a life jacket during their paddle through rough water back to shore.\u201cThey were there enjoying their day and some intimate time together,\u201d Mr. Moscato testified. \u201cThey brought a change of clothes and took some pictures in sexy poses in lingerie or whatever.\u201dMr. Moscato also testified that Ms. Graswald, who had arrived in the United States as an au pair, was cagey about where she and Mr. Viafore had beached their kayaks on their visit.After he heard that she had told Mr. DeQuarto about removing the kayak plug, Mr. Moscato said, he suggested that Ms. Graswald return with them on the police boat. (Kayaking experts have said that the absence of the tiny drain plug, located on top of the kayak, should not have caused it to sink.)On the ride across the water, Mr. Moscato said, Ms. Graswald threw out a flower in memory of Mr. Viafore. She then proceeded to act \u201chappy-go-lucky.\u201d\u201cWe were joking about the boat breaking down and if I fell into the water,\u201d Mr. Moscato said. \u201cShe would save me if I\u2019m not a good swimmer or whatever.\u201d The police had detected that type of behavior in the days following Mr. Viafore\u2019s drowning, when Ms. Graswald posted lighthearted photographs and videos to Facebook.In the 11-hour interrogation that soon followed, Ms. Graswald told the police about her frustration with Mr. Viafore\u2019s interest in pornography and sexual threesomes. At the end of the questioning, visibly frustrated, she said, \u201cI wanted him dead and now he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m O.K. with it.\u201dMs. Graswald has been in the Orange County Jail since her arrest on April 30 of last year. The hearing, which began on Monday, is to continue on Thursday. No trial date is scheduled.Nate Schweber reported from Goshen, and Lisa W. Foderaro from New York.Advertisement"}

We\u2019ll see what happens once the presidential election season is over.\u201dThe Sanders campaign has had a galvanizing effect for many people, on social media and in real life.  On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic nomination. In a speech after her victory in New Jersey, Mrs. Clinton noted the \"milestone\" the country had reached \u2014 and implored supporters of Mr. Sanders to join her. Those supporters have to figure out if that is what they'll do. In their own words, here is where Mr. Sanders\u2019s most dedicated fans plan to take the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d next.In conversations I had with more than a dozen Sanders supporters, many of them told me they were either disillusioned with or apathetic toward politics before this campaign. Mr. Sanders, a 74-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont, energized them unlike any candidate before. Now, they\u2019ll either resign themselves to voting for Hillary Clinton, redirect their efforts to local campaigns or drop out again.\u201cI was suicidal and using drugs and alcohol hard core for the first years after they booted me out,\u201d Mr. Manker said. \u201cIt infuriates me. It tells me there\u2019s something wrong with the system.\u201dNow, he is running for county state\u2019s attorney. He wants to fight public corruption and install a separate court system for veterans.\u201cWin, lose or draw, there\u2019s still all these millions of people like myself who are going to be far more involved,\u201d he said.Molly Grover, 30, is one of those people. She lives in Ithaca, N.Y., where she works part time as a nanny. She volunteers 20 to 30 hours a week for a People for Bernie affiliate, Women for Bernie.In the days leading up to the Tuesday primaries, Ms. Grover called voters in California and New Jersey, working to increase voter turnout. She said the superdelegate system was \u201cskewed\u201d to hurt Mr. Sanders\u2019s chances, and hopes he will stay in the race through the convention.\u201cI think he wants to see the superdelegate mess cleaned up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I doubt that he\u2019s just going to be pulling back and rolling over.\u201d\n\nShe said she had been able to meet dozens of like-minded progressive women through her work for the campaign, and felt grateful that it had brought a \u201cpolitical sisterhood\u201d into her life.\u201cCampaigns end, movements don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Coulombe said.\nLooking ahead to the possibility of a November ballot without Mr. Sanders\u2019s name on it, Mr. Keller had a plan: \"I will write in Bernie. Bernie\u2019s the one that earned my vote. Not a party, not a this or that.\u201d\nHe said the Democratic Party ignores Sanders supporters at its peril.\u201cWhen they don\u2019t embrace Bernie Sanders and the energy of the supporters, they\u2019re squandering this huge opportunity for the expandability of the party,\u201d he said.As the presumptive Democratic nominee, Mrs. Clinton will need to draw on the energy of Sanders supporters \u2014 especially young voters, who have consistently voted for Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton by enormous margins.Ms. Ahmed said she hoped millennials would be able to come together as a more powerful voting bloc to elect progressive candidates like Mr. Sanders in lower-tier primaries.\u201cWe\u2019re often marginalized from the whole process itself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really hopeful, regardless of the outcome, that we\u2019ll be able to build the kind of coalition that we haven\u2019t been able to build on the left.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Ahmed said she hopes that Mr. Sanders will stay in the race to continue to exert pressure on Mrs. Clinton -- if not for his own campaign, then for the sake of the movement he represents.\"He needs to be there,\" she said. \"He has to, because it\u2019s not about him.

{"Headline": "Religion\u2019s Wicked Neighbor", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byBarack Obama is clearly wrong when he refuses to use the word \u201cIslam\u201d in reference to Islamist terrorism. The people who commit these acts are inflamed by a version of an Islamist ideology. They claim an Islamist identity. They swear fealty to organizations like ISIS that govern themselves according to certain interpretations of the Quran.On the other hand, Donald Trump is abhorrently wrong in implying that these attacks are central to Islam. His attempt to ban Muslim immigration is an act of bigotry (applying the sins of the few to the whole group), which is sure to incite more terrorism. His implication that we are in a clash of civilizations is an insult to those Muslims who have risked and lost their lives in the fight against ISIS and the Taliban.The problem is that these two wrongs are feeding off each other. Obama is using language to engineer a reaction rather than to tell the truth, which is the definition of propaganda. Most world leaders talk about Islamist terror, but Obama apparently thinks that if he uses the phrase \u201cIslamic radicalism\u201d the rest of us will be too dim to be able to distinguish between the terrorists and the millions of good-hearted Muslims who want only to live in fellowship and peace.Worst of all, his decision to dance around an unpleasant reality is part of the enveloping cloud of political correctness that drives people to Donald Trump. Millions of Americans feel they can\u2019t say what they think, or even entertain views outside the boundaries laid down by elites, and so are drawn to the guy who rails against taboos and says what he believes.The fact is that 15 years after 9/11 we still haven\u2019t arrived at a true understanding of our enemy. How much is religion involved in jihadism, or psychology, or politics?And the core of our confusion is that we are unclear about what a religion is, and how it might relate to violence sometimes carried out in its name.For clarity on that question, it helps to start with William James\u2019s classic work, \u201cThe Varieties of Religious Experience.\u201d In that book, James distinguishes between various religious experiences and \u201creligion\u2019s wicked practical partner, the spirit of corporate dominion, and religion\u2019s wicked intellectual partner, the spirit of dogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down the law.\u201dIn other words, there is the spirit of religion and, frequently accompanying it, its wicked neighbors, the spirit of political and intellectual dominion.It seems blindingly obvious to say, but the spirit of religion begins with a sense that God exists. God is the primary reality, and out of that flows a set of values and experiences: prayer, praise, charity, contrition, grace and the desire to grow closer toward holiness. Sincere faith begins with humility in relation to the Almighty and a sense of being strengthened by his infinite love.In some sense the phrase \u201cIslamic radicalism\u201d is wrong because terrorism is not a radical extension of this kind of faith. People don\u2019t start out with this kind of faith and then turn into terrorists because they became more faithful.The spirit of dominion, on the other hand, does not start with an awareness of God. It starts with a sense of injury and a desire to heal injury through revenge and domination.For the terrorist, a sense of humiliation is the primary reality. Terrorism emerges from a psychic state, not a spiritual one. This turns into a grievance, the belief that some external enemy is the cause of this injury, rather than some internal weakness.It\u2019s only at this point in the pathway that religion enters the picture, or rather an absolutist, all-explaining political ideology that is the weed that grows up next to religion. Bin Ladinism explains all of history, and gives the injured a course of action that will make them feel grandiose and heroic. It is the human impulse for dominance and revenge that borrows righteous garb.For the religious person it\u2019s about God. For the terrorist, it\u2019s about himself. When Omar Mateen was in the midst of his rampage, he was posting on Facebook and calling a TV station. His audience was us, not the Divine.Omar Mateen wanted us to think he was martyring himself in the name of holiness. He was actually a sad loser obliterating himself for the sake of revenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rap Song on Credit Card Scheme Tells Broader Tale, Prosecutors Say", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPop Out Boyz, a rap collective from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, took their lyrics from real life when they released a single this spring all about the material rewards of a crime not often mentioned in urban pop music \u2014 credit card fraud, prosecutors said.The song, titled \u201cFor a Scammer,\u201d was rooted in experience, the prosecutors said. Members of the group and their associates have been indicted in Manhattan on grand larceny charges, accused of stealing more than $250,000 worth of luxury goods from Barneys and Saks Fifth Avenue over the last year.The song\u2019s chorus boasts, \u201cI\u2019m cracking cards \u2019cause I\u2019m a scammer,\u201d using a street term for card fraud. At one point, one of the vocalists raps, \u201cWatch the money do a back flip, early morning up at Saks Fifth, you see it, you want it, you have it.\u201dThe case reflects a broader trend in New York City, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said. As street crime and drug dealing have declined over the last two decades, there has been a surge in identity theft and credit card fraud, and these crimes are increasingly being committed by relatively unsophisticated young adults from working-class homes, the police and prosecutors said.\u201cCredit card fraud in Brooklyn is becoming a big issue,\u201d said Capt. Christopher Flanagan, the commander of the Financial Crimes Task Force for the New York Police Department. \u201cThe cards are easier to get now with the development of some of these dark websites, and as one person learns how to commit a fraud, they spread that knowledge to others.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a criminal mastermind to pull this off; it\u2019s not that hard to get the numbers,\u201d said Gary Shiffman, an economist specializing in illicit online markets who is the founder of Giant Oak, a data analytics company.But the sites have evolved and resemble other online retailers, featuring a shopping cart, customer service and a checkout process, said Damon McCoy, an assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering who researches the sites.Once registered, the customer can search for card numbers by bank, by ZIP code, by credit limit and by the length of time since the information was stolen. Some sites even have loyalty programs, frequent-buyer discounts and money-back guarantees, Mr. McCoy said.Adnan Baykal, the chief technical adviser at the Global Cyber Alliance, a nonprofit group, said law enforcement officials and banks can do little to shut down the sites. Many mask their locations and can be connected to only on the dark web. Others have multiple entry points on the internet, so when one is shut down, the owners can quickly switch to another.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, has made internet crime and fraud a major focus of his administration, winning convictions in more than a dozen similar cases. He has said one-quarter of the felony prosecutions by his office now involve internet crime or identity theft.The police said most of the 39 people arrested in the Pop Out Boyz case grew up together in the neighborhood around the Raymond Bush Playground at Madison Street and Marcus Garvey Boulevard. Three were rappers in the Pop Out Boyz, who performed at Brooklyn nightclubs, and several others were part of the group\u2019s entourage. Another defendant, Larry Dathan, rapped under the moniker Big B\u2019z.Prosecutors said a core group of 11 defendants bought card numbers from at least five websites, starting in May 2015, and shared them in emails and texts with one another. Several had also bought encoding machines and other equipment that they are accused of using to manufacture forged cards.The group recruited friends to shop at Barneys and Saks to buy luxury clothing and accessories \u2014 high-end shoes, Balmain jeans, Celine and Goyard handbags. Prosecutors said the group made 275 purchases at Barneys alone over 55 days, walking off with $258,000 worth of goods. Saks lost $11,000 worth of merchandise in two months. The group used more than 2,000 stolen credit card numbers from banks in France, Canada, Germany and Dubai, the police said.Most of the people in the group of 39, many of whom were arrested on April 26, were in their late teens and early 20s. One of the directors of the group, the prosecutors said, was Anthony McKoy, 21, who raps under the name Ant Stay Maccin. A high school graduate, he lives with his parents on Throop Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. His mother works for Gap, his father for a trucking company.Mr. McKoy has pleaded not guilty to the charges, his lawyer, Michael Fineman, said. But prosecutors said he played a key role, supplying stolen card numbers to others, manufacturing cards and even making $4,000 in purchases at Barneys and Saks himself. An embosser and encoding machine were found in his home, along with a gun, prosecutors said.In May 2015, Mr. McKoy started posting photos of himself holding wads of $100 bills on his Facebook page. The page also featured the Pop Out Boyz logo and concert posters.One of the most prolific shoppers in the group, prosecutors said, was Kaishaun Trisvan, who also pleaded not guilty. Mr. Trisvan, 21, lives with his mother, who works in the radiology department at Lenox Hill Hospital, his lawyer said in court. He graduated from high school and had no criminal record.Yet prosecutors said Mr. Trisvan had made more than 35 trips to Barneys, spending $44,000. And they said the police had found 120 forged cards at his house and $3,315 in cash.His lawyer, Eugene Conway, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.It is a sign of the times, investigators said, that some of the defendants in their 30s indicted in the Pop Out Boyz case have records for drug crimes and robberies but that most of the defendants in their teens and 20s either have no criminal record or have been arrested only for financial crimes.\u201cThese kids have grown up with computers,\u201d said Lt. Timothy Fenfert, who leads the Police Department\u2019s Special Fraud Squad in Brooklyn. \u201cThey have been downloading movies and music since they were 10 years old, so it\u2019s not much of a leap to download credit card numbers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To heck with the experts and political correctness was the predominant mood in the end. A majority of Britons had no time for the politicians that brought the world a disastrous war in Iraq, the 2008 financial meltdown, European austerity, stagnant working-class wages, high immigration and tax havens for the super-rich.That some of these issues have no direct link to the European Union or its much-maligned Brussels bureaucrats did not matter. It was a convenient target in this restive moment that has also made Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee \u2014 and may now take him further still on a similar wave of nativism and anti-establishment rage.Ever-greater unity was a foundation stone since the 1950s not only of peace in Europe, putting an end to the repetitive wars that had ravaged generations of Europeans, but also of the global political order. Now all bets are off. A process of European unraveling may have begun. A core assumption of American foreign policy \u2014 that a united Europe had overcomes its divisions \u2014 has been undermined.The colossal leap in the dark that a traditionally cautious people \u2014 the British \u2014 were prepared to take has to be taken seriously. It suggests that other such leaps could occur elsewhere, perhaps in Trump\u2019s America. A Trump victory in November is more plausible now because it has an immediate precedent in a developed democracy ready to trash the status quo for the high-risk unknown.Divisions were not only national. London voted overwhelmingly to remain. But the countryside, small towns and hard-hit industrial provincial industrial centers voted overwhelmingly to leave and carried the day. A Britain fissured between a liberal, metropolitan class centered in London and the rest was revealed.Europe\u2019s failings \u2014 and they have been conspicuous over the past decade \u2014 are simply not sufficient to explain what Britain has done to itself. This was a vote against the global economic and social order that the first 16 years of the 21st century have produced. Where it leads is unclear. The worst is not inevitable but it is plausible. Britain will remain an important power. But it will punch beneath its weight. It faces serious, long-term political and economic risk.Anger was most focused on the hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming into Britain each year, most from other European Union nations like Poland. Farage\u2019s U.K. Independence Party, abetted by much of the press, was able to whip up a storm that conflated E.U. immigration with the trickle from the Middle East. Wild myths, like imminent Turkish membership of the European Union, were cultivated. Violence entered the campaign on a wave of xenophobia and take-our-country back rhetoric.Trump arrived in Britain on Friday, a timely visit. He said the vote to quit the E.U. was \u201ca great thing\u201d and the British \u201ctook back their country.\u201d He did not say from whom, but the specter of our times is a dark, controlling global force stealing national identity.Timothy Garton Ash, the historian, paraphrasing Churchill on democracy, wrote before the referendum that: \u201cThe Europe we have today is the worst possible Europe, apart from all the other Europes that have been tried from time to time.\u201dIt was a wise call to prudence in the imperfect real world. Now, driven by myths about sovereignty and invading hordes, Britain has ushered in another time of treacherous trial for the European Continent and for itself.My nephew wrote on Facebook that he had never been less proud of his country.

My name, email address and phone number were among those of more than 4,000 journalists, including freelancers like me, as well as correspondents from this newspaper, Reuters, the BBC and other outlets. We were collectively labeled \u201cterrorist collaborators\u201d for gaining accreditation from the separatists.

The editors stated that they would not listen to the \u201cwhimpering\u201d about \u201cfreedom of speech.\u201d An adviser to the head of the Ukrainian Security Service announced that the journalists on the lists were being investigated as potential spies.These lists are nominally about who has interacted with the separatist rebels, but they create a wider \u2014 and more dangerous \u2014 precedent. The website and its supporters in government are suggesting that journalists can be divided into two camps: those who support the state and those who are against it, with the implication that journalists who criticize the government should be silenced.Most senior Ukrainian officials have avoided commenting on the release of journalists\u2019 names and information. But they should now act in accordance with the Western values that they claim to believe, and condemn the defamation of journalists just for working in separatist-controlled areas. They must also ensure that the offending website is shut down and that the investigation into who published the list results in criminal charges. This alone will not ensure that the country\u2019s news media is free and fair, but it will help set the right tone.

{"Headline": "The Dixie Chicks, Long Past Making Nice", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byCINCINNATI \u2014 In 2011, Martie Maguire of the Dixie Chicks took her twin daughters to a Taylor Swift concert, and it churned up some melancholy.\u201cI was feeling like maybe our time had passed, and this was Taylor\u2019s time,\u201d said Ms. Maguire. Then Ms. Swift covered the Chicks\u2019 1999 hit \u201cCowboy Take Me Away,\u201d much to her daughters\u2019 astonishment, and the crowd sang along. Loudly.Ms. Maguire said the moment was \u201csurreal\u201d and \u201csuper emotional.\u201d Apparently, the world had not forgotten about the Dixie Chicks, whose four studio albums sold more than 30 million copies. Now, the band \u2014 Ms. Maines, Ms. Maguire and Emily Strayer \u2014 is finding out how much of its fan base is still out there. When the group members realized that 2015 would be their 20th anniversary together, they started thinking about how to mark the occasion; last week, they set out on their first headlining tour in the United States in 10 years. (They play Madison Square Garden on Monday, June 13.)But live, the trio sounds like it has never been away. \u201cI just wait for it to feel right, and it felt right,\u201d said Ms. Maines, 41, on the night before the 53-city \u201cDCX MMXVI Tour\u201d kicked off. The Chicks gathered in a backstage lounge at the Riverbend Music Center, an outdoor amphitheater on the banks of the Ohio River here, and happily talked over one another, making their decision to return to the spotlight sound casual and carefree.If the Riverbend audience is representative, the Chicks\u2019 fans are primed for this comeback. The sold-out show cleared more than 20,000 tickets, one of their biggest crowds ever. Forty-something fans filled the more expensive seats under the roof, while packs of raucous college-age women in tank tops, jean shorts and boots packed the lawn area.The rise and fall of the Dixie Chicks, with its extreme highs and lows, seems practically scripted for maximum drama. Ms. Strayer, 43, who plays banjo and guitar, and Ms. Maguire, 46, a fiddle player, are sisters (born Emily and Martha Erwin), who were among the co-founders of the band. It took its name from Little Feat\u2019s hit \u201cDixie Chicken,\u201d in Dallas in the late 1980s. After a few independent releases and lineup changes, Ms. Maines stepped in as lead singer in 1995.The group seemed to come out of nowhere when its 1997 album, \u201cWide Open Spaces,\u201d spun off three No. 1 singles on the country charts and was certified 12 times platinum. Its 1999 follow-up, \u201cFly,\u201d slightly modernized the band\u2019s sound and style, and sold 10 million copies.As they racked up honors, including multiple Grammy Awards (13 to date), the Dixie Chicks were helping transform the playing field in Nashville and empowering a generation of female musicians.\u201cWhen we saw these women writing witty, intelligent music; playing instruments; and basically doing it all, it inspired us to do the same,\u201d wrote Madison Marlow, of the country duo Maddie & Tae, in an email.Her partner, Taylor Dye (who, like Ms. Marlow, was all of 2 when \u201cWide Open Spaces\u201d was released), added, \u201cThe Dixie Chicks encouraged us all to unapologetically be who we are.\u201dBut in March 2003, in the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq, Ms. Maines introduced the song \u201cTravelin\u2019 Soldier\u201d at a London concert. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re on the good side with y\u2019all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not want this war, this violence, and we\u2019re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.\u201dThough \u201cthe incident\u201d has come to largely define the public legacy of the Dixie Chicks, often overwhelming their musical contributions, the band members now seem to shrug it off. They laugh when Ms. Maguire recounts recently visiting a friend, who instructed her not to go into the bathroom because she might be offended by something on the wall \u2014 a picture of the family with President Bush.\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what went down,\u201d said Ms. Maines. \u201cI spoke up for what I believe \u2014 that\u2019s what art is about and what musicians should be about. And if I\u2019d known anybody was listening, I would have said something to really make a mark.\u201d\u201cI look at how much more polarized and intolerant people have become now,\u201d she continued. \u201cWith social media, opinions all start becoming noise, but at that point, people weren\u2019t really supposed to have an opinion.\u201dMs. Strayer said that the controversy \u201cfeels like another lifetime to me, it doesn\u2019t even feel real \u2014 our country\u2019s changed, we\u2019ve changed, the fans definitely have.\u201dShe described a recent phone call from her ex-husband. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, what\u2019s going to happen the day that the kids find that Entertainment Weekly cover, what are you going to tell them?\u2019 \u2014 like, \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 So I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll probably explain to them what happened to us, and how you have to stand up for yourself when something like that happens.\u2019\u201dMs. Maines added, with a guffaw, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them, \u2018This is how good Mommy\u2019s body looked before she had you!\u2019\u201dMs. Maines has remained active in various social causes. She has been a supporter of the West Memphis Three, a group of Arkansas men convicted of the 1993 murder of three young boys. And on the current tour, she is raising funds for Proclaim Justice, an organization that advocates for the wrongfully imprisoned. Ms. Maines expressed reluctance, though, about getting involved in the current presidential election.\u201cI hate politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s become an industry. It sickens me.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s great entertainment for a reality show,\u201d said Ms. Maines. \u201cHe\u2019s scary as hell for president of the United States.\u201d (Social media response was predictable, with the Dixie Chicks\u2019 Facebook page instantly filling up with comments like \u201cYou idiots should keep your politics to yourselves and stick to playing music.\u201d)The 24-song set at Riverbend illustrated some of the music that is closer to the band\u2019s heart these days, including covers of a song by Lana Del Rey and by the group favorite Beyonc\u00e9: a hoedown version of \u201cDaddy Lessons,\u201d which became a viral hit when they first performed it, just a week after the release of \u201cLemonade.\u201dMs. Maguire expressed the closest thing to regret about taking a decade away from the group. \u201cI don\u2019t love that we didn\u2019t do anything for 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m really proud that we focused so intently on our children.\u201dIn the end, the biggest deal about this tour for the Dixie Chicks may be that it offers the first chance for their sons and daughters \u2014 nine in total, ranging in age from 3 to 15 \u2014 to see their mothers at work. \u201cI realized that my second-oldest daughter had never even seen our videos,\u201d said Ms. Strayer, \u201cso about a month ago, we sat in bed and watched them all \u2014 and she was mortified. \u2018You did not wear that! You did not just do that!\u2019\u201dMs. Maines reiterated that, especially after their experiences, she had no problem walking away from the celebrity mountaintop. \u201cYou look at the stars who do maintain staying on top and honestly it looks like so much work and self-involvement,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done all this personal growth and become the person that I\u2019ve worked on becoming. There\u2019s something almost sad about that being what you\u2019re so hungry for \u2014 I just don\u2019t relate to that. So I was happy to pass the baton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Armed with perhaps sharper pencils and a more jaundiced eye than the typical 17-year-old, they noticed two questions that some thought could throw off the performance of girls.Their concerns are fueling a debate in the industry \u2014 on Facebook and in private emails \u2014 over whether the test items were sufficiently vetted for gender bias, and whether the exam was unfair to female students.The two items, one in the verbal portion and one in the math section, posed what some test-prep experts considered a textbook example of \u201cstereotype threat.\u201d When people are reminded during a test of a negative stereotype about their race or sex, psychologists say, it creates a kind of test anxiety that leads them to underperform.The math question involved a chart showing more boys than girls in math classes over all.The verbal section asked students to analyze a 19th-century polemic arguing that women\u2019s place was in the home.Officials from the College Board, which administers the test, said it had not presented negative stereotypes. They said the revamped SAT had been, if anything, more thoroughly vetted for fairness than older iterations. Content had been reviewed by experts and pretested on a representative sample of students.The results of the May 7 test have also been analyzed. No differences in the scores of boys and girls of comparable ability were found on the questions in dispute, College Board officials said.\u201cThis means the questions did not present an unfair advantage to either group,\u201d Kate Welk, the director of assessment communications, said in an email.But some test-prep tutors do not see it that way. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wait a minute: This test is really trying women in a way that\u2019s slightly different than it\u2019s testing men,\u2019\u201d said Sheila Akbar, the education director for Signet Education, a test-prep company. \u201cHere I am, a seasoned test taker, a 36-year-old woman, being distracted by this material. I wonder what 17-year-olds are thinking.\u201dThe standardized testing industry has long grappled with questions of racial, socioeconomic and gender fairness. On average historically, whites and Asians do better than blacks and Hispanics on the SAT; wealthier children do better than poorer ones; and boys do better than girls \u2014 slightly better in verbal skills and considerably better in math. It is unclear why these gaps persist, test designers and social scientists say, but the differences are the subject of much study, including the research on negative stereotypes.There have been hundreds of studies on the effects of stereotypes in test situations, but the testing industry says that effects on performance have not been well replicated in real life.The reading item paired 1837\u2019s \u201cEssay on Slavery and Abolitionism\u201d by Catharine E. Beecher with an 1838 reply from Angelina E. Grimk\u00e9, an abolitionist. It asked questions about how to interpret the passages.Christian references in the Beecher passage were edited out, suggesting to some critics that the board did not want to offend religious sensibilities. But Zachary Goldberg, a board spokesman, said the religious references had been edited out for \u201clength and focus.\u201d He described Beecher\u2019s essay as \u201cseparate-spheres feminism.\u201dThe questions related to the passage were not the problem, critics said. It was the placement of the passage at the beginning of the test, allowing it to linger in students\u2019 minds for the rest of the time.The math question was identical to one on a practice test, which showed a chart of 10th graders in which there were more boys than girls taking math.\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should put everybody in a rubber room so they couldn\u2019t possibly be touched by controversy,\u201d Dr. Aronson said. \u201cBut why would you go out of your way to couch a percentage problem as a girls-in-math problem?\u201dThe reading passage, he said, could induce \u201ccognitive fatigue\u201d for girls who were bothered by it. \u201cYou could imagine one girl really ruminating on it, and she would pay for it down the road,\u201d he said.Andrew McGlothlin, the owner of Summit Tutoring and Test Prep in Los Angeles, compared the reading item to pairing a segregationist and an integrationist. \u201cWe can\u2019t have George Wallace being given equal voice to Thurgood Marshall,\u201d said Mr. McGlothlin, who took the test in May. \u201cThat would be beyond the pale.\u201d\u201cI think you can defend it as a historical argument, but there was no historical perspective on it,\u201d Mr. McGlothlin said.Pamela Donnelly, the founder of GATE, a college consulting and test prep company in Los Angeles, said her daughter, Lily Berthold, took the test in May and remembered the Beecher passage as \u201cweird.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a mother of three daughters,\u201d she said, \u201cand to present something like that without historical context creates a kind of cognitive dissonance between that and what they believe is true as they try to wrestle their way through the rest of the test.\u201dCynthia Cowan, a Boston-based tutor, said she had a male student who had found Beecher\u2019s argument so alien that he was sure he had misunderstood it. \u201cThis is a good student who read the piece right and convinced himself that he had read it wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it has that strange effect on a guy, who knows what effect it can have on women?\u201dBoth positive and negative reinforcements can work in subtle ways, experts say. For example, some research has found that boys got a boost just from being asked to mark down their sex before taking the test, as if it helped to be reminded that they were boys, Dr. Aronson said.In the 2013-14 school year, the College Board stopped asking students to mark their sex on the SAT answer sheet; a spokesman said this was done to save time.In an intriguing twist, Dr. Aronson said, recent studies have found that girls are not as aware of female stereotypes as women were when the original research was done. \u201cWhat I think is in part responsible for that is that in the last 25 years, the gender roles for boys and girls have totally reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cGirls are the good students now; boys are a mess.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s no difference, so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m certain that it bothers some girls and not others. In fact, that\u2019s where the stereotype research is going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For many, it is a frustrating, if not hellish, cycle of waiting and trying, getting caught and waiting again.Like so many other unaccompanied minors with little money and big dreams, they make their way from Morocco, lured by images sent by others who managed to get to Europe. They see images of young men inside gleaming malls, surrounded by the brand-name totems of commercial culture. Mind you, those cellphone selfies are more likely of phantasms surrounded by items that are props inside a store display.Try telling that to these young men, children, really. For years now, they have sneaked past Melilla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s border fence, where they end up \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if lucky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a shelter for minors. Others wind up being sent back \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite their age, advocates say \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when officials mark them down as older than they actually are. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would think this was a lie, that this is happening in Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Valle said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMelilla is next to Morocco, but it is Europe. It is shocking that this situation could be happening there. This is serious.\u201dMr. Col\u00c3\u00b3n went there first to scout out the story, which immediately struck him as important. He persuaded Mr. Valle, who also does video, to go back with him. The two men have similar styles, Mr. Col\u00c3\u00b3n said, to the point that you would think the same person made the images.Mr. Col\u00c3\u00b3n said the young people sneak in through control points or a gate for day workers who clean homes or carry goods, past border guards who barely pay them any attention. Once inside Melilla, he said, they can end up in shelters for minors, where he said some have complained about poor conditions and mistreatment. Many of them, he said, are from the Moroccan city of Fez, and know each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see kids in the city, minors, who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even taken care of by the institutions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Col\u00c3\u00b3n said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are the ones worst off.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Valle said some minors were sent back to Morocco after the authorities detained them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe police will say they are adults so they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to get social services for minors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Valle said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey get deported back to Morocco. These kids try to get in again. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a constant loop. The Spanish state is saving money, even though they know they are deporting minors.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is hardly better for those who remain in Melilla and attempt to cross the Mediterranean to the Spanish city of Malaga. Few, Mr. Col\u00c3\u00b3n said, are successful in their quest.

But these children wonder, why bother to study? They need to work. Their mother is sick and they are poor. And they dream of being well dressed, with Nikes and European clothes. In this city the television is always on, and they think what they see on television is easy to get. But it really is just a fiction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

We might feel that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting by fine on less sleep, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deluding ourselves, Dr. Veasey said, largely because lack of sleep skews our self-awareness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more you deprive yourself of sleep over long periods of time, the less accurate you are at judging your own sleep perception,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Extended vacations are the best times to assess how much sleep you truly need. Once you catch up on lost sleep and are not sleep deprived, the amount you end up sleeping is a good measure how much you need every night. You can ask yourself the questions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you feel that your brain is much sharper, your temper is better, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying attention more effectively? If those answers are yes, than definitely get the sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Veasey, who realized -- to her chagrin -- that she needs nine hours of sleep a night to function effectively.Health issues like pain, sleep apnea or autoimmune disease can increase people's need for sleep, said Andrea Meredith, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.A misalignment of the clock that governs our sleep-wake cycle can also drive up the need for sleep, Dr. Meredith said. The brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock can get misaligned by being stimulated at the wrong time of day, she said, such as from caffeine in the afternoon or evening, digital screen use too close to bedtime, or even exercise at a time of day when the body wants to be winding down.

The image remained on the site for 36 hours before Facebook removed it.The man, Kenneth Alan Amyx, 45, told the authorities that he and his girlfriend, Jennifer Streit-Spears, 43, had discussed a suicide pact for months. They had been drinking at an apartment in Plano, Tex., and had agreed to stab each other until both died, according to a Plano Police Department affidavit. But Ms. Streit-Spears \u201cchickened out,\u201d Mr. Amyx said, and he had to \u201cfinish her off,\u201d according to the affidavit.Officer David Tilley, a spokesman for the department, said that Mr. Amyx not only posted a photo of Ms. Streit-Spears \u2014 nude and with her neck cut \u2014 on her page, he also posted a selfie of his face covered in blood and the words \u201cPray for us,\u201d the officer said.Officer Tilley said the photo of the body was dark, as though the lights had been out and the photo had been taken without a flash. Still, he said, \u201cit was quite disturbing.\u201dThe privacy settings on the Ms. Streit-Spears\u2019s Facebook account did not allow access to the public, Officer Tilley said, though he added, \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere for family and friends to see.\u201dMs. Streit-Spears\u2019s mother called 911 around 10 a.m. on Sunday after seeing the photos on Facebook and after Mr. Amyx had texted them to her, the police said. But the photos remained on Facebook for about 36 hours, even after Ms. Streit-Spears\u2019s relatives asked the social media giant to remove them.Facebook, which receives one million reports a week about possible violations of community standards, said the image of the body at first did not appear to violate its policies, because it was not immediately clear what it depicted and that it had been posted by someone other than the account user.\u201cWe remove graphic images when they are shared to celebrate violence,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAs soon as it was clear what the facts were behind this photograph, we removed it.\u201dAs for what could lead someone to post incriminating evidence on Facebook to be seen by so many, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cThere is no rational answer to it.\u201dThe couple took turns cutting each other, Mr. Amyx told the authorities, but after she was cut, she became too weak to continue, he said. Officer Tilley said the police found Mr. Amyx naked and bloody in a bedroom. The police initially thought he was dead until he started to make noises. He had superficial cuts and one wound on his neck, which required stitches, the officer said.Two knives, one of them a six-inch carving knife, were found at the scene. As he was being taken to the hospital, the police said, Mr. Amyx told a firefighter: \u201cOh, I killed her. Oh, I lost her. I\u2019ll never get her back. Just kill me.\u201dMr. Amyx\u2019s father, Charles, declined to comment on Tuesday night, citing the instructions of his lawyer.

But on the same day, a few hours north in McKinney, Tex., another valedictorian, Larissa Martinez, did.Speaking to her class, Ms. Martinez, who says she\u2019s headed to Yale, declared that she is undocumented, and indirectly addressed anti-immigrant sentiments voiced by Mr. Trump. According to the website Mic, she crossed the border in 2010 from Mexico with her mother and sister.But some observers saw the students\u2019 decision to express pride in being undocumented as an affront, and criticized them on social media.In Ms. Lara\u2019s case, the outrage over her tweet led her to delete her Twitter account. One critic, Hillary Shay Davis, who has a daughter who graduated with Ms. Lara, said she believed that the teenager was proud of \u201ctaking advantage of the system.\u201dVersions of this sentiment echoed throughout social media.Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the University of Texas, said that federal law prevented him from discussing the cases of individual students, but he offered a statement that said that the university grants two-semester tuition waivers to all valedictorians of Texas public high schools regardless of their residency status.\u201cState law also does not distinguish between documented and undocumented graduates of Texas high schools in admissions and financial aid decisions,\u201d the statement said. \u201cUniversity policies reflect that law.\u201d\u201cBeing undocumented is part of her identity, as is being a Latina,\u201d he said Thursday.

{"Headline": "Apple to Offer App Developers Access to Siri and iMessage", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With sales sluggish and stiffening competition from rivals like Google and Facebook, Apple announced on Monday coming improvements to the software that runs its devices, including a revamped Music app, an easier login process and better information-sharing across devices.More significantly, it also made it easier for app developers to tap the full power of Apple\u2019s technology \u2014 from its Siri voice assistant to instant messaging and Apple Pay \u2014 in their own apps.\u201cWe believe it is crucial that we provide the best tools so you can produce the best apps,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, told a crowd of about 5,000 assembled here for the company\u2019s annual worldwide developer conference.On Monday, Apple said it was allowing access to two of its crown jewels \u2014 Siri and its messaging app, iMessage \u2014 hoping that the creativity of outside developers will spur a round of innovation to make the iPhone seem as magical as it did when the first apps were introduced eight years ago.Showing off how developers could use messaging, an Apple executive opened the food-delivery app DoorDash from inside Apple iMessage and put together a joint order with friends.Earlier this year, Facebook opened up Messenger to bots, automated software assistants that can accomplish various tasks. Google also announced plans to introduce a messaging service with similar capabilities.\u201cA lot of the messaging apps are moving toward this,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with Gartner who attended the event. \u201cIf Apple hadn\u2019t announced developer access to messages, I would have been really surprised.\u201dDevelopers were also pleased to get access to Siri so they could incorporate voice commands into their own apps. Until now, Siri has mostly been limited to Apple services and has been used for tasks like conducting searches, getting directions or asking the virtual assistant to make a call.Faizan Buzdar, chief executive of Convo, a business collaboration software maker, said his company had already been using Siri to a limited extent so that customers could bookmark items that pop up in the Convo app.\u201cBut my vision would be to say, \u2018What\u2019s our revenue this week?\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Siri would then open Convo, which would pull in data from its app and partner apps, and provide the answer. \u201cThat kind of natural language can really push the barriers of business.\u201dInitially, Siri will only be available for certain categories of apps like those providing ride-hailing, messaging and photo-search services.Apple has been a leader on mobile devices since the introduction of the iPhone a decade ago. But in some critical respects, it is now playing catch-up.For example, Google, whose Android smartphone software is more popular than Apple\u2019s globally, uses sophisticated facial recognition technology to organize a user\u2019s photos, and Google\u2019s mapping service works closely with other apps to identify important locations and automatically provide directions to appointments.Apple said on Monday that it would offer similar features in the next version of its iPhone software, iOS 10, which will be released in the fall with a new crop of iPhones.Similarly, Apple\u2019s integration of other services into iMessage mirrors what Facebook has done with Messenger and what Tencent, a major Apple rival in China, has done with WeChat messaging.Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on uploading a user\u2019s data to the cloud, Apple said the new features will keep data on the phone to protect user privacy.\u201cIn some ways the star of the show wasn\u2019t a particular product but Apple\u2019s refutation of accusations that it can\u2019t compete with Google and Facebook in artificial intelligence and deep learning,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, in an email after the presentation.Apple is a clear leader in some areas, particularly the nascent field of smartwatches. Announcing improvements to its year-old Watch platform, Apple said that the new version of the watch\u2019s operating system would start apps instantly. Users will also be able to scribble responses to messages one letter at time, instead of relying on the canned responses that are currently available.The Watch remains tethered to the iPhone for most uses, and the company seems to be repositioning it as a healthy-living accessory, offering improved activity tracking and sharing. There is even a new deep-breathing app.In an attempt to persuade customers to buy more Apple products, the company also introduced a host of planned features to share data between devices. The documents on the desktop of a Mac, for example, will be accessible on iPads and iPhones. Photos taken with the iPhone can be viewed on the Apple TV.Apple signaled its desire to be a player in global e-commerce, where sales are expected to total $2 trillion this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.Apple said that retailers\u2019 websites would soon be able to use Apple Pay as a checkout method, and customers could authorize a purchase with their fingerprint on their iPhone. Currently, the digital payment service is restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response.A few days before the conference, Apple made two other major announcements affecting developers.

{"Headline": "Leaks of Answers Before Egypt\u2019s National Exams Embarrass Government", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 As Egyptian high school students take their final exams this month, the government is facing a wave of criticism and mockery after copies of at least two test papers \u2014 and their answers \u2014 were leaked on Facebook.The leaks, which caused one of the tests to be canceled, have resulted in a barrage of criticism of the Education Ministry, and the police and military officers who guard the wax-sealed boxes that the exams are kept in before students take them.The exams were leaked on a Facebook page by someone, or a group, called Chao Ming (the reason for the Chinese-sounding name is unclear). For the past four years, Chao Ming posted answers during testing, allowing cheating by students flouting a ban on cellphones. This year is believed to be the first time Chao Ming has posted copies of the exams and answers before testing takes place.Chao Ming has spawned a host of imitators who use Facebook and other online platforms to help students cheat \u2014 and taunt the authorities. Some of the sites say they are acting to embarrass the Education Ministry and to change the educational system in Egypt.The scandal has highlighted disgruntlement with the declining quality of public education in Egypt, but has also drawn contrasts between the government\u2019s bumbling efforts to stanch the leaks and its harsh crackdown on free speech and political freedoms in Egypt.\u201cThe regime can\u2019t protect\u201d a couple of papers, Mina Salib, a political activist in Alexandria, wrote in a Facebook post that was widely liked. \u201cExcuse me, but how are they supposed to protect a country?\u201dAbout 570,000 Egyptian high school students are taking the exams, known as Thanaweya Amma tests, which determine admission to state-run universities and institutes. The pressure to succeed is intense, and many describe the tests as a nerve-racking experience that often leaves students crying outside exam centers.This year\u2019s tests started on June 5 and were due to end on June 28. The Facebook leaks led to the cancellation of a theology exam, which will be held again on June 29.The police arrested Mohanad Ahmed, an 18-year-old high school student from Alexandria, who later appeared on television confessing to running \u201cChao Ming helps Thanaweya Amma cheat,\u201d the series of Facebook pages that posted the exams. But many students and parents have questioned whether Mr. Ahmed is the originator of the leaks because of widespread doubts about the official narrative.Experts say the quality of state education in Egypt has declined in recent years because of overcrowded classrooms, poorly trained teachers and exams based on rote learning. At the same time, the importance of the Thanaweya Amma tests has increased because greater economic hardship in the country has put private colleges beyond the reach of many Egyptians.In Parliament on June 11, the education minister, El-Hilali El-Sherbini, blamed the leaks on the use of electronic devices such as credit cards that can function as telephones, surgically inserted headphones and high-tech reading glasses.Mr. Sherbini proposed cutting internet access across Egypt for an hour before all exams, to counter future leaks, and disrupting cellphone signals in examination halls, according to several lawmakers present at the session.\u201cIt was absurd,\u201d said one lawmaker, Ghareeb Hassaan.Another, Gamal Shiha, said the education minister\u2019s list of high-tech devices seemed to be a diversionary tactic. \u201cHe just kept talking and talking about this internet thing for half an hour,\u201d Mr. Shiha said.Cellphones are forbidden in Egyptian exam halls, but the Education Ministry acknowledges that the ban is hard to enforce. \u201cThey hide the phones in sensitive areas,\u201d Bashir Hassan, the ministry\u2019s spokesman, said. \u201cNo one is going to search those areas, so what are we supposed to do about it?\u201dPolice and education officials said 25 people had been arrested in connection with the leaks and for helping with cheating in general. They include seven Education Ministry employees and four officials from the country\u2019s seat of Sunni scholarship, Al-Azhar. If convicted, they could be sentenced to a year in prison and fined up to about $5,600.But many students said they believed that the police had not found the true culprit, whom some had lionized as a sort of Robin Hood for exam cheaters. They said they expected further leaks to surface.On Wednesday, local news outlets reported that the administrator of another Chao Ming page had gone live on Facebook, wearing a mask.\u201cI don\u2019t fear arrest,\u201d he was reported as saying. \u201cThis is going to happen again next year unless the education system in Egypt improves and corruption is eradicated.\u201dDeclan Walsh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

Read the label carefully and make sure that whole grains \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not sugar or a sugar equivalent like corn syrup \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are among the first few ingredients.Intact whole grains are grains in which all three components of grain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the bran, the germ and the endosperm \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are preserved, such as in steel cut oats, barley, brown rice, buckwheat, farro and millet, Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic, said in an email.Ground into a flour, these grains may still be considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to the Food and Drug Administration, she said, while refined grains, in which the bran and germ are stripped, are not. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the chemistry of the grain changes\u00e2\u0080\u009d with grinding, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe glycemic index and calories go up as fiber goes down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She cited whole grain bread, whole grain cereal and whole grain pasta as examples of foods that typically contain ground whole grains.     \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy advice is to add only intact grains to your smoothies, like steel cut oats, barley, millet or farro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Kirkpatrick said. Though grinding up whole grains robs them of some of their fiber, said David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University, it also makes them more palatable. Whole grain cereals may not be as good as whole grains in their natural form, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than zero.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDifferent grains respond differently to being ground. Flaxseed, for instance, is more nutritious ground up, because the body can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t absorb its nutrients as well whole, Ms. Rodriguez said.If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to drink smoothies, pay attention to the sugar and fiber levels, Ms. Rodriguez advises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would keep sugar content to 15 to 30 grams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, noting that some have 60 grams of sugar from fruit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural sugars, but some of them are juice extractions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with little fiber.

{"Headline": "Facebook, a News Giant That Would Rather Show Us Baby Pictures", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, invited conservative luminaries to Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, and over some fancy snacks, they seemed to make peace. The issue blew over. Yet it also seemed to raise deeper questions about Facebook\u2019s power to influence how we understand what\u2019s going on in the world.Should we be thinking of Facebook as a news site? Is that how Facebook thinks of itself?Though it is couched in the anodyne language of a corporate news release, the document\u2019s message should come as a shock to everyone in the media business. According to these values, Facebook has a single overriding purpose, and it isn\u2019t news. Facebook is mainly for telling you what\u2019s up with your friends and family.Adam Mosseri, the Facebook manager in charge of the news feed, said in a recent interview that informing and entertaining users was also part of the company\u2019s mission. But he made clear that news and entertainment were secondary pursuits.\u201cWe think more, spend more time and work on more projects that try to help people express themselves with their friends or learn about their friends or have conversations with their friends,\u201d he said.These moves highlight a truth that tends to get lost in commentary about the social network\u2019s influence over the news: At Facebook, informing users about the world will always take a back seat to cute pictures of babies (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that).Because Facebook does not think of itself primarily as a news company, it seems to want us to stop expecting it to act like one. Whether we should, though, is a more complicated matter.The company has long been hounded by journalists and activists over its power to shape the news through its algorithms, or the code that determines which stories you see, in the news feed.The question of how to think about Facebook\u2019s role in the news \u2014 and whether we should demand the same standards of accuracy, objectivity, transparency and fairness that we expect from traditional outlets \u2014 may be the primary puzzle of our new media age.According to Facebook, the values outlined in the document have been the informal governing philosophy of its news feed since it was started a decade ago, and Mr. Zuckerberg and Chris Cox, Facebook\u2019s chief product officer, were deeply involved in drafting the new document.Mr. Mosseri says Facebook uses a variety of tools to make sure that the feed is delivering what users want. One of the main ones, he said, is user surveys, which give Facebook a rich trove of data. These surveys, and the fact that about 200 people are involved in building the news feed, act as a bulwark against any one person\u2019s bias infecting it, Mr. Mosseri said. People\u2019s preferences, and how Facebook adjusts to them, also mean that the feature will constantly change. \u201cWe view our work as only 1 percent finished,\u201d the post says.But in another way, Facebook\u2019s values only further complicate our picture of the network. If Facebook does not think of its main mission as news, what should we make of all its recent overtures to news companies?And how should news companies think about ever deeper partnerships with Facebook, in some instances relying on the company as a primary part of their business models, if Facebook is disclaiming news as its main mission \u2014 and is also promising to keep changing the news feed as it sees fit?\u201cThis is a funny kind of transparency,\u201d said Robyn Caplan, an analyst at the research group Data & Society. \u201cEven though they appear to have been making a bet that news is where they want their business to go, they\u2019re now indicating that their first priority is to maintain that environment that they\u2019ve been known for, which is information from friends and family.\u201dMs. Caplan pointed out that even when Facebook\u2019s values do superficially align with those of the news business, at a deeper level the two sides seem to see things in very different ways.For instance, Facebook\u2019s document takes no stand on what kind of content it considers \u201cinformative.\u201d Instead, informative content is in the eye of the user.\u201cSomething that one person finds informative or interesting may be different from what another person finds informative or interesting \u2014 this could be a post about a current event, a story about your favorite celebrity, a piece of local news or a recipe,\u201d the document says.Facebook also steps back from any responsibility for choosing certain ideas over others. Its news feed, it says, is instead about giving you more of what you want: \u201cOur aim is to deliver the types of stories we\u2019ve gotten feedback that an individual person most wants to see.\u201dIn a newsroom, news isn\u2019t just what people want to see, and ideas worth promoting aren\u2019t just those that people click on. News is supposed to exist outside those desires; it\u2019s supposed to be an objective good.So while it\u2019s good that Facebook is telling us how it thinks about the news, it\u2019s hard not to see a turbulent future as the views of Facebook and the news industry collide.Facebook isn\u2019t primarily a news site, and it doesn\u2019t see itself as a news site, except that for many users, it functions as the world\u2019s biggest news site \u2014 and its sway, partnerships and money are now consuming the news industry.

For this year, at least, the New York Asian Film Festival is having a Southeast Asian moment.\u201cClearly, these cinemas and industries were underrepresented,\u201d Samuel Jamier, executive director of Subway Cinema (which produces the festival with the Film Society of Lincoln Center) and lead programmer of this year\u2019s edition, wrote in an email. \u201cSo I felt it was time for us to remedy this.\u201dThe festival\u2019s Southeast Asian films can require some adjusting of expectations. Generally speaking, budgets are lower, and crews and actors less seasoned, and the films can have rough edges.But there\u2019s an immediacy \u2014 a raw vitality in storytelling \u2014 in the best Southeast Asian films that can be lacking in the most polished and high-tech Japanese, South Korean and Chinese productions. Mr. Jamier agrees with me on that, writing, \u201cI feel there\u2019s a different energy, or vibe perhaps, an innocence that\u2019s specific to these films.\u201d Here, a few highlights:Like \u201cPixote,\u201d \u201cHamog\u201d builds considerable power, despite its narrative stumbles. It kills off its most engaging character just as the story seems to get started, and after spending a half-hour on a moving and detailed account of how to procure a funeral for an unclaimed child, it circles back and starts over again, picking up a second story line that it had seemed to drop.But Mr. Jover never bores you \u2014 the awkwardness and occasional purple streak in his screenplay are more than made up for by the zest of his direction, Pipo Domagas\u2019s fluid cinematography and gripping performances from a pair of child actors, Bon Andrew Lentejas and Therese Malvar.\u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d shares, with most of the other Southeast Asian selections, a sense of moral outrage \u2014 Mr. Jamier wrote that the programmers this year kept seeing films with \u201ca realization that something\u2019s not right with the world.\u201d Edgar and his wife are among the innocent victims of her father\u2019s fraud, but that doesn\u2019t save them, because their friends\u2019 and neighbors\u2019 get-rich-quick dreams are too powerful, too desperate.Or do they? No spoilers here. \u201cHeart Attack\u201d doesn\u2019t actually need to be two hours long, but its sendup of the 24-7 life is consistently amusing. \u201cDoes this temple have wifi?\u201d the hero asks in the middle of a funeral, and a helpful Buddhist monk gives him the password for his home network (indiansubcontinent79).

(The misspelling might explain why nobody, including the Swensons, had noticed this account before.)On the same romancescam.com page, you can read a come-on by a person engaged in this act of seduction. \u201cI\u2019m a loving caring tender man and I always respect my woman,\u201d wrote an ersatz wooer, beside photos of Mr. Swenson, in a snippet culled from a site called DateHookup. \u201cI\u2019m here looking for good honest kind woman.\u201dIrresistible, huh?All that was left for the Haggler was a question for Facebook. The company deleted the resilient fake account that Carl Swenson had complained about as soon as the Haggler wrote to Facebook\u2019s media relations office. That\u2019s nice. But why did the company tell the elder Swenson, over and over, that the account met its community standards?\u201cAs our team processes millions of reports each week, we occasionally make a mistake,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman wrote in an email. \u201cThat is what happened in this case.\u201dThe team is vastly outnumbered by the complaints it is supposed to assess, and the result is human error. It can happen. And apparently it has already happened again. On Wednesday, the Haggler showed Carl Swenson the \u201cWilliam Awenson\u201d Facebook account. He promptly used the \u201creport\u201d feature to request deletion of this blatant fake. You\u2019d think that by now the guy has some credibility. Nope. He soon received a familiar note from Facebook, which stated that the account met its community standards.Listen, Facebook. You\u2019re now worth more than $300 billion. How about throwing a few bucks at your fraud-prevention team? Maybe adding more humans will cut down on the errors.EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT.

{"Headline": "Four Arrested in Beating Death of Transgender Man in Vermont Homeless Camp", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byFour homeless people face murder charges after using their fists and feet to fatally beat a transgender man in an encampment in Vermont, and then fleeing across the country to a San Diego beach, where they were arrested, officials said on Friday.Law enforcement officials said they were not ruling out the possibility that the \u201cbrute force\u201d assault on Mr. Beede had been a bias attack.The suspects \u2014 two men and two women \u2014 were arrested Thursday night at Dog Beach in San Diego, a gathering place for the homeless. The police in at least three states joined forces to find them, partly with the help of technology that reads license plates and that tracks phones, officials said.They fled Vermont after the attack and ended up in Roswell, N.M., where one of them had relatives, the police said. There, one suspect, Erik Averill, 21, was briefly taken into police custody after being accused of assaulting his partner, Myia Barber, 22, who is also a suspect in the fatal beating. But Mr. Averill was released, and the four continued their journey to California.The police identified the other two suspects as Allison Gee, 25, and Jordan Paul, 21.The four are being held in California on warrants accusing them of second-degree murder, Chief del Pozo said. It was not immediately clear when they would be sent to Vermont to face the charges.The chief said the beating started over a dispute in the homeless camp; someone smeared feces on a tent from the south side of the encampment, and Mr. Beede was believed to have reacted by dumping urine in a north-side tent, the chief said.Mr. Beede, 38, was not homeless. He had an apartment in Milton, but he was staying with friends at the encampment over the weekend because the local bus was not running, the police said.Mr. Averill allegedly enlisted the help of the others to attack Mr. Beede, the chief said. Then the four fled in a Chevy Malibu. Officers in New Mexico helped track the suspects\u2019 car, the police said.\u201cThere probably was not an elaborate escape plan,\u201d Chief del Pozo said.There were many witnesses to the beating, but further details were not available. The arrest warrant is sealed, the police said.The mayor of Burlington, Miro Weinberger, said that the city had a chronic homelessness problem despite initiatives to remove the encampments in a \u201chumane\u201d way. The tents are in an industrial area known as the Pine Street Barge Canal.\u201cThey really are full of squalor,\u201d Chief del Pozo said.\u201cAnd that is what Amos was about, was helping others,\u201d said his sister, Ina McKinney.Sitting next to their mother, Ms. McKinney said her family knew that Mr. Beede was \u201cnot going to make it\u201d as soon as they saw him after the attack.\u201cHe had motions in his arms, and it seemed like the same motion as if he was reaching for us to let us know that he knew we were there,\u201d she said.\u201cWe wanted him to wake up, and he couldn\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Muhammad Ali.Peter W. Kunhardt Jr., the foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive director, had known that the boxing great was seriously ill. But when he got a call from The New York Times requesting Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dramatic, close-up portrait of Ali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, Mr. Kunhardt knew death was imminent. Indeed, by Saturday morning, the world would know that the champ had died. While many newspapers ran the image of Ali looming triumphantly over the fallen Sonny Liston, The Times ran Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introspective portrait (slide #6) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 two days in a row, no less.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the other pictures I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen of Ali have been in the fight, in the moment, in the ring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kunhardt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomeone said to me, this picture is like the Mona Lisa of Ali. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a portrait of Gordon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ali. It has Ali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essence and spirit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Champion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which opened on Monday at the foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pleasantville, N.Y., exhibition space, features about two dozen black-and-white images \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including several never seen before publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Parks took of Ali between 1966 and 1970 on assignment for Life magazine. Of course, some of the images show Ali\u2019s sleek athleticism or his personality, by turns playful and brash. Others show quieter moments at home or even in prayer.  Together, they offer a well-rounded portrait of Ali taken by a photographer he grew to respect and trust.Maurice Berger, who curated the exhibit \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor All the World to See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Parks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach straddled the world between the showman and the athlete chronicled \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and, often, scorned \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by the white news media, and the hero and family man portrayed in the black press.\u201cGordon Parks\u2019s pictures of Ali were particularly positive, important and consequential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Berger, who writes the Race Stories feature for Lens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cParks was able to convey both Ali\u2019s greatness and humanity. Too much writing on and imagery of Ali in the 1960s and 1970s turned him into a stereotype, indeed a full range of stereotypes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from uneducated or a draft dodger to a superhuman athlete or black saint. Parks captured Ali\u2019s complexity, and not just his extraordinary grace and physical prowess but also his emotional, intellectual and spiritual life. In these pictures, we get a sense of Ali\u2019s wisdom, benevolence and generous personality.\u201dThose images, Mr. Kunhardt said, were a result of a bond that formed between the two men. In 1966, after the young champ had joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name, Parks went to Miami on assignment for Life, where Mr. Kunhardt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandfather Philip B. Kunhardt Jr. was the managing editor. The images from that assignment, for which Parks also wrote the text, show a young man enjoying the attention from his early victories. Four years later, under fire for his refusal to serve in the military, Ali was again photographed by Parks as he prepared to fight Jerry Quarry. Those images show a man determined, intense and unbowed. There is a quiet intensity born of struggle.What the images will not show you is a man battered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember Gordon telling stories to my family about these pictures of Ali after a fight, and his face was all gushed up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kunhardt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGordon said he was going to destroy them. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want those pictures of his swollen face and battered eyes out in the world. They had this trust with each other. Gordon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with him came first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More often, Parks would just put down his camera, and let the moment remain uncaptured.The Pleasantville show includes not just well-known images but also several that appeared in a 12-print portfolio that the foundation put out in 2014, also called \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Champion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mr. Kunhardt said that in 2019, the foundation would mount a major Parks exhibit on Ali at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo.In a way, Mr. Kunhardt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to Parks reflects the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Ali. In recent days, he has been swamped by calls and emails seeking images of Ali. He has been holding off on responding. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI grew up having Gordon at my house for Thanksgiving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kunhardt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not just a job for me, but a personal role I have to fulfill to not only keep Gordon relevant, but to also make sure he is not exploited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Deimoni Brewington, 17, is taunted at his Las Vegas high school and even by some relatives for choosing musical theater over macho pursuits like football.\u201cYeah, I cried a lot,\u201d he said of the teasing. \u201cBut when I go into rehearsal, I put away all the mess and drama of my life and have fun. Musical theater gave me my identity.\u201dAt the end, two graduating seniors walked off with the top honors: Amina Faye, from the Central Academy of Technology and Arts in Monroe, N.C., and Josh Strobl, from John Burroughs High School in Burbank, Calif. Accepting her award, Ms. Faye told the other performers, \u201cI love you all and I can\u2019t wait to see where the future takes us all.\u201dThe winners received $10,000 toward their college educations and a chance to audition for acceptance and a scholarship to the Tisch School of the Arts at N.Y.U. Finalists and other award winners got $2,500 scholarship grants.To make the cut, each student first won a competition as the best male or female high school performer in one of 31 regions. More than 1,000 schools and 50,000 students competed for honors. The prizes are known as the Jimmy Awards, in honor of the Broadway producer and theater owner James M. Nederlander, 94.For four students, the trip was their first time in an airplane. But for Ms. Quick, who began taking music classes at 10 weeks, the show was familiar; it was her third time performing at the awards and her second time as a finalist, singing \u201cSafer\u201d from \u201cFirst Date\u201d in this year\u2019s competition.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy,\u201d she said of the past year, which was upended when she smashed her cheek and hip on a concrete floor while acting in a student film. A concussion left her \u201cmuddy\u201d for months afterward, setting her behind in school and hurting her auditions for colleges.\u201cI was talking to my mom about how different I am since 2014,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m more open, not afraid to try new things. Getting through the concussion and dislocation is a big deal. When I get home, I\u2019m going straight into physical therapy.\u201dThe two winners arrived by different paths. Ms. Faye, who sang \u201cYour Daddy\u2019s Son,\u201d from \u201cRagtime,\u201d in a group medley and then \u201cA New Life,\u201d from \u201cJekyll & Hyde,\u201d for her solo, has pursued musical theater seriously since ninth grade and plans to major in it at Penn State next year.\u201cShe said to me a year and a half ago, \u2018I love musical theater, but I\u2019m going into law,\u2019\u201d her high school\u2019s music director, Marty Gregory, said. \u201cAnd I said to her: \u2018Yeah, right. Let\u2019s not get carried away here with reality. Dream the dream.\u2019\u201dMr. Strobl, by contrast, was more interested in singing in alternative-rock bands until an audience member at a show encouraged him to give musical theater a shot. \u201cI hadn\u2019t gotten into acting until this year,\u201d he said.This year\u2019s upbeat awards, in which the students were repeatedly hailed as Broadway\u2019s future, came during a season in which seven of the 11 new musicals on Broadway have closed or are closing. The opening number included snippets from some of the successes, including \u201cWaitress\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d The awards M.C., Zachary Levi, noted that his own show, the Tony-nominated musical \u201cShe Loves Me,\u201d was closing in two weeks, and encouraged the audience to buy tickets. \u201cTime is money, folks,\u201d he said.Besides solo performances, many of the students performed in costume in small-group medleys. (One Wednesday and two Gomezes from \u201cThe Addams Family\u201d musical turned up, for example.) Watching a group of boys, Van Kaplan, a co-founder of the awards program and the show\u2019s director, said it was often hard to remember that the performers were high school students: \u201cI have to stop and say, some of them are just 16.\u201dMany parents also came to New York for the event, but they were kept away from their children until after the final ceremony. Until then, the students were in the care of chaperones.\u201cI text my mom, but I haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d Sarah Chico, 17, a junior from Tucson, Ariz., said on Saturday, the last day of coaching before the students performed for judges behind closed doors on Sunday. Ms. Chico said the group had formed close bonds during the week.\u201cI don\u2019t look at it as competition,\u201d she said, echoing others. \u201cIt\u2019s being with a group of people who are not just from my little town. We talk about our favorite food, our favorite app.\u201dAs part of the week\u2019s program, the students received an hour of media training from the Broadway publicist Chris Boneau, who told them, among other things, that journalists weren\u2019t their friends, and that if they wanted to look vulnerable while answering a tough question, to take off their glasses in the middle. Also, to smile \u2014 and to be careful about their Facebook posts.Ms. Chico, who aspires to be an animator for Disney, said she was not viewing the Monday night performance as a springboard for a Broadway career.\u201cMy hopes are to be confident and walk down the street and know I can do anything,\u201d she said. Musical theater \u201cgives my personality a place to go, so I\u2019m not just being loud in some inappropriate place, like a library.\u201dOn Monday morning, the students took their first steps on the Minskoff stage, which is normally home to \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d Some, like Mark Mitrano, 16, a sophomore from Greece Athena High School in Rochester, cried when they looked out at the house. \u201cIt was unbelievable that they could make this happen,\u201d he said.Ms. Lalama, the choreographer, squeezed Mr. Brewington\u2019s face with her thumbs and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cHe\u2019s my baby squinchy,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could take him home.\u201dCellphones were not permitted onstage, but the teenagers did not seem to mind. During downtime, they talked in small groups, sprawled over one another or gave back rubs.J. R. Heckman, 15, a freshman from Cleveland and the youngest boy in the group, was unabashedly star-struck, both by his fellow students and his coach, the Broadway performer Howard McGillin. \u201cTo get personal feedback from the Phantom of the Opera is amazing,\u201d he said.After the ceremony, Ms. Faye reunited with her high school teachers and family members and tried to catch her breath.\u201cExpectations were really high,\u201d she said. \u201cI found myself thinking, oh my goodness, I can\u2019t do this. The hardest part was the perseverance, to just keep going when you haven\u2019t gotten any sleep.\u201dA picture caption on Wednesday with an article about the National High School Musical Theater Awards misidentified a contestant.

Nehls said.On Monday, the sheriff\u2019s office released more details about the shootings, though a motive was not immediately clear. It said Christy Sheats had called a family meeting, and when her husband, Jason Sheats, 45, and their daughters gathered in the living room, the mother opened fire.The daughters and the father ran out the front door in the 6000 block of Remson Hollow Lane, and Madison Sheats collapsed, the authorities said. Mr. Sheats ran to the end of a cul-de-sac, Taylor Sheats ran into the street, and the mother followed, shooting her.Christy Sheats went back inside to reload her weapon, returned and shot the older daughter again, according to a witness. Taylor Sheats was taken to a hospital, where she died.The police found a .38-caliber handgun at the scene, the statement said.Sheriff Nehls said that crisis intervention teams had been sent to the home more than once in recent years over turmoil that seemed to revolve around the mother.The statement on Monday said the police had responded to 14 calls to the house since 2012, including for alarms. But the statement added that \u201clegal constraints\u201d prevented the release of any further information, including 911 calls.The bloodshed on a quiet middle-class street in the city, which is about 30 miles west of Houston, left neighbors and the victims\u2019 loved ones shattered.Sheriff Nehls said Sunday that Mr. Sheats was \u201c having a very difficult time with this.\u201d\u201cThey seemed to be an all-American family,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThen you realize that what happens behind closed doors \u2014 you just don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThis is not the Christy that I know \u2014 it\u2019s just not,\u201d Ms. Knowles said. \u201cI thought it was the wrong person.

{"Headline": "The \u2018Active Shooter\u2019 Is Never Far Away", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsThirty-two hours after Omar Mateen began murdering people with a Sig Sauer MCX rifle at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. \u2014 the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history \u2014 an entrepreneur named Jeffrey Isquith arrived at the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, a cavernous Art Deco building overlooking the Chicago River, for the NeoCon trade show, which bills itself as \u201cNorth America\u2019s most important design exposition and conference for commercial interiors.\u201d The show would bring the official debut of a product that his company, Ballistic Furniture Systems, had been developing for five years: bullet-\u00adresistant panels that could be fitted inside chairs, cubicles and doors.That morning, several manufacturers of commercial furniture \u2014 the kind you find in hospital waiting rooms, offices and hotel lobbies \u2014 were rolling out models using the new technology. When I reached Isquith on his cellphone, on the convention floor, he said that for furniture makers, \u201csecurity is the big new frontier, if you will. It\u2019s kind of sad to say that, but it\u2019s true.\u201d In a news release that morning, he noted that the kind of \u201cviolence and terror\u201d seen in Orlando was \u201cnot going away anytime soon.\u201d His product, the release said, offered \u201ca 21st-century solution to saving lives and reducing injuries to innocent people in public spaces during an active-shooter event.\u201dThere are some cultural milestones that you don\u2019t even know exist until you trip over them: the moment, for instance, when an \u201cactive shooter\u201d becomes the kind of thing a furniture manufacturer might factor into its product design in the same way it considers ergonomics or biodegradability. The migration of the term \u201cactive shooter\u201d from law-\u00adenforcement training manuals into the world of cable-\u00adnews chyrons, Twitter rumors and uploaded cellphone videos is itself an indicator of how a once-\u00adanomalous tragedy has become just another event to prepare for, like the Fourth of July or a tornado. Among the many contractors that now offer active-shooter training is G4S, the global \u00adsecurity firm that employed one Omar Mateen.The concept of the active shooter has its origins on the morning of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold arrived at the west exit of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., armed with an arsenal of sawed-\u00adoff shotguns, semiautomatics and homemade explosives. If not for their incompetence as bomb makers, we might not remember the Columbine massacre as principally a shooting at all; the plotters had intended a spectacular explosion, courtesy of two large bombs with timers planted in the cafeteria, after which they would shoot the survivors spilling out into the parking lot before presumably dying in a hail of SWAT-team bullets themselves. It was only after the bombs failed to detonate that Harris and Klebold advanced on the school.If the idea of the active shooter was new for law enforcement, it was even more so for everyone else. Columbine was far from the first mass shooting in America, but it was the first that a national audience experienced as a protracted, televised live event. This was even true for many Columbine students: As they hid in classrooms equipped with TVs, they watched coverage of the chaos unfolding around them, and the stories they told sheriff\u2019s deputies and reporters in furtive phone calls to the outside world were informed by the stories they had heard reporters tell already. This was one factor in the fog of confusion that prolonged the standoff into an hourslong, mostly imaginary siege; Harris and Klebold had, in fact, committed suicide in the school library less than an hour after their rampage began. But students and teachers were inhabiting a media narrative as much as an actual one, the line between event and perception blurred beyond definition.Even after Columbine, it took several years for \u201cactive shooter\u201d to fully shed its quotation marks and explanatory parentheticals and take its place in the national lexicon. That it has done so \u2014 less than an hour after the Pulse attack began, Twitter users had identified it as an \u201cactive shooter\u201d situation \u2014 says something not just about the proliferation of mass shootings in America but also about the way technology has transformed our experience of them.In 1999, social media as we now know it did not exist and 24-7 news was a niche commodity. When Harris was plotting the Columbine massacre, he thought of his project in what now seem like antiquated Hollywood terms, recording in videos that he wanted \u201ca lot of foreshadow\u00ading and dramatic irony\u201d and debating with Klebold whether Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino would better handle their story. Contrast that with Vester Lee Flanagan II, the troubled TV reporter who fatally shot two former colleagues, a reporter and a cameraman, in Virginia during a live broadcast last August. After the shooting, Flanagan detailed his motives on Twitter and uploaded a video of the murders, which he had filmed with his phone as he committed them, before killing himself.The active shooter has always seemed a particularly \u2014 if not exclusively \u2014 American menace, a dark confluence of the country\u2019s mania for guns, self-\u00addefinition, reinvention and fame. This is part of what makes the shooting rampage\u2019s belated adoption by self-\u00adstyled Islamic State martyrs \u2014 even American-\u00adborn wannabes with limited or nonexistent links to the aspirant caliphate \u2014 more jarring, in its own way, than any suicide bombing or airplane hijacking. As Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminal-justice professor who studies mass shooters and suicide bombers, points out, this development may be simple pragmatism: This is a country, after all, in which an AR-15 can be bought in some states in a matter of minutes by virtually anyone with valid identification, but a bulk order of ammonium-\u00adnitrate-\u00adbased fertilizer may well produce a visit from the F.B.I.But it\u2019s also true that the propaganda that the Islamic State addresses to the West \u2014 the beheading videos, the martyrs\u2019 testimonies, the social-\u00admedia exhortations to potential lone wolves \u2014 has always owed less to the world-\u00adhistorical ambition of Sept. 11 than it does to the awful intimacy of Columbine, an act of killing that fell far short of its architects\u2019 ambitions but haunts us all the more for having bound us to it as distant witnesses. The active shooter is never far away here; there are too many guns in America for us to ever delude ourselves into thinking otherwise. And the footage is always streaming, optimized for our many platforms.The writer William S. Burroughs \u2014 who, having drunkenly killed his wife with a pistol, knew of which he spoke \u2014 once observed that \u201cno one owns life, but anyone who can pick up a frying pan owns death.\u201d The active shooter owns something that, in a distraction-\u00adaddled world, is perhaps even more coveted: our attention. This is certainly what Mateen wanted. In the final moments of his life, he reportedly stopped shooting long enough to search Facebook for responses to his own performance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gawker, Filing for Bankruptcy After Hulk Hogan Suit, Is for Sale", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byGawker Media, the irreverent company that pioneered the wry tone and take-no-prisoners approach that came to embody a certain style of web journalism, put itself up for sale on Friday in an acknowledgment that its future as an independent news organization was in doubt.Gawker said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would conduct a sale through an auction. The company is under significant financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan and facing a determined foe in the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who is funding legal cases against it.Ziff Davis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid, which a person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans said was in the range of $90 million to $100 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sale process. Gawker expects a sale to close by the end of the summer.But even as Gawker took stock of its next steps, it remained, in typical fashion, defiant.Since its founding in 2002, Gawker has espoused a conversational tone that came to be mimicked across the internet and on social platforms like Twitter. Gawker and its affiliated sites \u2014 including the sports-focused Deadspin and Jezebel, which is aimed at women \u2014 have relentlessly and gleefully chronicled the lives of the powerful, and often delivered attention-grabbing, exclusive stories, some of them too over-the-edge for other publications. The company was also an incubator of talent: Employees went on to found websites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time.Gawker also had many detractors, who said it often went too far and published items with little news value that aimed to embarrass individuals. But over the last year Gawker.com has been going through something of a cultural transformation. Mr. Denton has vowed to make the site nicer and Gawker has shifted to politics and away from coverage of the New York media world and celebrity gossip.\u201cIt really was an incredibly bad year,\u201d said Hamilton Nolan, a writer who has worked at Gawker for eight years. \u201cI think they\u2019ll study this in journalism schools one day as being the single worst year in media company history.\u201dIn Gawker\u2019s new offices in Manhattan on Friday, the mood was somber. Around noon, Mr. Denton and Heather Dietrick, the company\u2019s president and general counsel, held a meeting to inform employees of the company\u2019s plans and provide reassurance that Gawker would operate as usual during the sale process.\u201cThey emphasized that the future is uncertain, but for now we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do, and that was useful for people to hear,\u201d said Alex Pareene, the editor in chief of Gawker.Employees said that few people had known before the meeting of the company\u2019s decision to file for bankruptcy. A keg of beer was brought in and pizzas were ordered.\u201cIt was not a raucous or even particularly depressing affair,\u201d Mr. Pareene said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more depressing meetings and we\u2019ve had more argumentative meetings.\u201dGawker\u2019s sites published posts assuring readers they were not going anywhere.Filing for Chapter 11 stays claims from creditors, including court judgments \u2014 meaning Gawker will not need to begin paying the $140 million that was awarded in March to Mr. Bollea.It also allows companies more time and more control as they reorganize themselves. In its bankruptcy filing, Gawker listed $50 million to $100 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. The company still plans to appeal the case.Also on Friday, a judge in Pinellas County Circuit Court in Florida granted Gawker\u2019s request for a stay of the judgment against it in the lawsuit, pending an appeal. That decision essentially became redundant once Gawker filed for bankruptcy.\u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d Mr. Thiel said of his supporting Gawker\u2019s legal opponents. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not return a request for comment on Friday. Gawker is also exploring at least one lawsuit against Mr. Thiel, according to the person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans.The offer by Ziff Davis, whose online properties include IGN, Geek.com and AskMen.com, is what is known as a \u201cstalking-horse bid,\u201d essentially setting a floor in a court-supervised auction. Money from a sale would be held aside to cover creditor claims, including any damages after the appeals process.In an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, Ziff Davis\u2019s chief executive, Vivek Shah, said that under the terms of a potential agreement, the company would acquire Gawker Media\u2019s properties but none of its liabilities. When discussing its plans for Gawker Media, he referred to the benefits of having all of the company\u2019s sites, but conspicuously omitted any mention of Gawker.com.He said the auction would most likely take place at the end of July. Other bidders, which will probably include other media publishers, are expected, particularly with the threat of assuming legal claims removed with the bankruptcy filing.In January, Gawker sold a minority stake in the company to the investment company Columbus Nova Technology Partners, partly in preparation for the lawsuit by Mr. Bollea.Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over Gawker.com\u2019s publication of a black-and-white tape that showed Mr. Bollea having sex with a woman who was at the time the wife of a friend of his.In March, after a two-week trial, a Florida jury awarded $115 million in damages to Mr. Bollea. A jury later awarded $25 million more in punitive damages, bringing the total to $140 million.On Friday, some Gawker employees remained hopeful that a new owner might mean a fresh start, but there was also perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that Gawker as everyone knew it could soon be a thing of the past.\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be the magical happy ending to the story,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to be the worst ending to the story, but we\u2019re not just going to go back to everything being how it was.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield, John Koblin, Nick Madigan and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mob Shaming: The Pillory at the Center of the Global Village", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byRetro ReportShame has been part of the human condition ever since Eve fell for the serpent\u2019s patter and she and Adam then realized that they were naked.In this country, shaming punishments have been woven into the communal fabric at least since the days when scarlet letters were doled out and reprobates were slammed into stocks. To chasten defendants through means other than jail terms, modern judges have resorted to actions like forcing shoplifters to announce their crimes in newspaper advertisements, or making deadbeat fathers carry signs proclaiming their child-support delinquency.Ms. Connell\u2019s perceived sin was suing a boy who was a close relative, and who simply wanted to hug her. Among those in the Twitterati for whom nuance is a scarce commodity, she was cast as a woman who deserved nothing short of flogging.Reality was more complex. In 2011, Ms. Connell went to a birthday party in Connecticut for an 8-year-old cousin, Sean Tarala, who regarded her as an aunt. Excited to see her, the boy leapt into her arms. She was caught off balance and fell backward. With the boy\u2019s full weight on her, she landed badly, breaking her wrist so severely that she needed three operations and ran up $120,000 in medical bills.Ms. Connell\u2019s troubles were only beginning. When her relatives\u2019 homeowners insurance would not cover the bills, her lawyers felt her only recourse was to go to court and let a jury determine liability. Under Connecticut law, someone had to be named as a defendant. So she sued the person whose actions had led to the injury: Sean.Plainly, this was just a legal formality. The real target was the insurance company, not the boy. But that was too subtle a notion for many on social media. Vituperation poured down on Ms. Connell, including a suggestion that her other wrist should be broken \u2014 and maybe her legs, too. Tabloid headline writers labeled her \u201cthe Auntie-Christ.\u201d The fact that the woman and the boy had close bonds \u2014 Sean understood the tactical nature of the lawsuit \u2014 was ignored.In cyberspace, rage turned to glee when a jury rejected Ms. Connell\u2019s claim in October. By then, the hounding had hurt her professionally. A human resources consultant, she had difficulty finding work. \u201cPeople reached out and then canceled interviews, or then said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve changed our direction,\u2019 or you know, \u2018Mmm, we\u2019ve decided not to move forward,\u2019\u201d she told Retro Report.She had to \u201ctake certain measures,\u201d she said, \u201cin order to re-establish myself.\u201d They included altering her appearance in the hope that she might not be instantly recognized.So was Lindsey Stone, who lost her job helping people with learning disabilities. This was after Ms. Stone posed in 2012 for a photograph by a sign at Arlington National Cemetery. The photo, intended as a visual joke to be shared with friends, was in questionable taste, but was not born of malice. Nonetheless, after its posting on Facebook, the calls for her head were unforgiving.Once upon a time, miscreants subjected to public ridicule were pilloried for perhaps a few hours. In internet life, that can last forever. \u201cYou never escape it,\u201d Danielle Keats Citron said. She is a law professor at the University of Maryland and author of \u201cHate Crimes in Cyberspace\u201d (2014).\u201cWhen you post something really damaging, reputationally damaging, about someone online, it\u2019s searchable and seeable,\u201d she told Retro Report. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t erase it.\u201dDoes shame have a legitimate place in our lives? Mark Twain seemed to think so. \u201cMan is the only animal that blushes,\u201d Twain wrote in 1897.\u201cOr needs to,\u201d he added.She is not opposed to chastising individuals publicly, as long as the tactics are not abusive, but her preference is to call out governments and large organizations that behave badly. \u201cShaming is better used for the collective well-being,\u201d she said in an interview.Other modes of shaming keep arising. New York, for instance, is one of several cities requiring restaurants to post letter grades issued by the health department, and to display the ratings prominently in their front windows. This is intended as a guide for consumers. But what self-respecting restaurant owner wants to live with the disgrace of a poor grade in full view?Although Professor Jacquet sees benefits accruing from certain forms of finger-pointing, she also feels they can do only so much to improve bad behavior. \u201cIf shaming was the most efficient method, we wouldn\u2019t have harsher forms of punishment,\u201d she said.For one thing, the targets would have to be capable of feeling shame. All it takes is a glance at current politics to realize that some people are absolutely shameless.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: How Badly Do You Want That New Rail Line?", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Across California, public transit agencies are pushing ballot measures in search of money for just about everything related to transit: new rail lines, highway widening and even pothole filling.Similar measures will be on the ballot in Sacramento County and, very likely, San Diego County. Possibly several other Bay Area counties as well.These small sales tax increases have become perhaps the only realistic way to pay for ambitious transportation projects, said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at U.C.L.A.\u201cVoters and elected officials have become very hostile to increases in fuel taxes,\u201d he said.In 2008, voters in Los Angeles approved a half-cent sales tax increase for 30 years. That has financed projects like the long-awaited rail line connecting downtown to the beach, which just opened.Four years later, voters rejected a plan to extend that Los Angeles County sales tax another 30 years.Now we\u2019re headed to the ballot box again \u2014 only this time, the sales tax hike would be permanent.You know this bear.It flies on the state flag, and dances on the sideline at U.C.L.A. football games.But how well, exactly, do you want to know this bear?

In the continental United States, they live only in Yellowstone National Park and a few other remote locations.The bears, the group said, would not be running around downtown San Francisco.They could be safely reintroduced in the remote Sierra Nevada.(Not exactly reassuring.)Grizzlies are far larger and more aggressive than black bears.For now, federal and state officials, convinced that a 1,100-pound grizzly bear would eventually end up in a campground, have not yet shown interest in bringing them back.California Today is a weekday roundup that stays live from 6 a.m. Pacific time until late morning.Advertisement"}

The shooting began around 2 a.m., and some patrons thought at first that the booming reports they heard were firecrackers or part of the loud, thumping dance music.Hundreds of people gathered in the glare of flashing red lights on the fringes of the law enforcement cordon around the nightclub, and later at area hospitals, hoping desperately for some word on the fates of their relatives and friends.\u201cWe are here suffering, knowing nothing,\u201d said Baron Serrano, whose brother, Juan Rivera, 36, had been celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday with his husband and was now unaccounted for. \u201cI cannot understand why they can\u2019t tell me anything because my brother is a very well-known person here in Orlando. He is a hairstylist, and everybody knows him.\u201d16 PhotosA tally of victims whose relatives had been notified began slowly building on a city website; by 6 p.m., it had six names. Among them was Juan Ramon Guerrero, a 22-year-old man of Dominican descent who had gone to the club with his boyfriend, Christopher Leinonen, who goes by the name Drew, because they wanted to listen to salsa. A friend, Brandon Wolf, watched people carry Mr. Guerrero outside, his body riddled with gunshot wounds.But no one knew what had become of Mr. Leinonen. His mother, Christine, anxious because of health problems, had woken at 3 a.m. to news of the shooting, and learned from Mr. Wolf that her son had been inside.A three-hour standoff followed the initial assault, with people inside effectively held hostage until around 5 a.m., when law enforcement officials led by a SWAT team raided the club, using an armored vehicle and explosives designed to disorient and distract. Over a dozen police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, leaving him dead and an officer wounded, his life saved by a Kevlar helmet that deflected a bullet.16 PhotosAt least 30 people inside were rescued, and even the hardened police veterans who took the building and combed through it, aiding the living and identifying the dead, were shaken by what they saw, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief. \u201cJust to look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story,\u201d he said.It was the worst act of terrorism on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001, and the deadliest attack on a gay target in the nation\u2019s history, though officials said it was not clear whether some victims had been accidentally shot by law enforcement officers.The toll of 50 dead is larger than the number of murders in Orlando over the previous three years. Of an estimated 320 people in the club, nearly one-third were shot. The casualties far exceeded those in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where 26 people died.\u201cIn the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,\u201d President Obama said in a special address from the White House. \u201cWe will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.\u201dAs he had done after several previous mass shootings, the president said the shooting demonstrated the need for what he called \u201ccommon-sense\u201d gun measures.\u201cThis massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or a house of worship or a movie theater or a nightclub,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe have to decide if that\u2019s the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.\u201dAccounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.The shooting quickly made its way into the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has accused Mr. Obama of weakness on radical Islam and has called for barring Muslim immigrants, suggested on Twitter that the president should resign.\u201cAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!\u201dHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, released a statement saying: \u201cWe need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home.\u201dFears of violence led to heightened security at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender events and gathering places around the country. Law enforcement officials in Santa Monica, Calif., confirmed the arrest on Sunday of a heavily armed man who said he was in the area for West Hollywood\u2019s gay pride parade. The authorities, however, said they did not know of any connection between the California arrest and the Orlando shooting.Mr. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., was able to continue working as a security guard with the security firm G4S, where he had worked since 2007, and he was able to buy guns. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Mr. Mateen had legally bought a long gun and a pistol in the past week or two, though it was not clear whether those were the weapons used in the assault, which officials described as a handgun and an AR-15 type of assault rifle.A former co-worker, Daniel Gilroy, said Mr. Mateen had talked often about killing people and had voiced hatred of gays, blacks, women and Jews.Around the time of the massacre, Mr. Mateen called 911 and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, the brutal group that has taken over parts of Syria, Iraq and Libya, Agent Hopper said. Other law enforcement officials said he called after beginning his assault.Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group. It stated that the attack \u201cwas carried out by an Islamic State fighter,\u201d according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda.American Muslim groups condemned the shooting. \u201cThe Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,\u201d said Rasha Mubarak, the Orlando regional coordinator of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Lizette Alvarez reported from Orlando, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "With Cataracts, My Own Private Light Show", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Over the past three years I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been plagued by one of the common curses of aging: cataracts. During that time my vision gradually deteriorated, as the normally transparent natural lenses of my eyes became increasingly opaque, going from a gentle soft focus, to gauzy, then cloudy, and ultimately downright foggy. This was apparently the result of some unhappy combination of sun exposure, age, a number of potentially insidious environmental and dietary factors, and just plain genetic bad luck. (My mother and two of my brothers also suffered from this condition.)Every patient experiences the development of cataracts a little differently. For me, the symptoms weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the inevitable cloudiness and fogginess. They also included a problem with diminished depth perception, which I became aware of one evening when I went to pour my wife a glass of wine and ended up suavely splashing it across the adjacent tablecloth. Even more disturbing, for a period of half a year or so, I had occasional brief episodes of double vision. Naturally I feared these were serious neurological red flags, perhaps indicating small strokes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my father and one of my brothers had those \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until my eye doctor reassured me that they were much more likely just another, if somewhat rarer and scarier, symptom of cataracts. Along with these daylight deficits, I also experienced the phenomenon of night glare. On the road, the headlights of approaching vehicles struck me as painfully bright and disorienting, like some kind of blazing \u00e2\u0080\u009cClose Encounters\u00e2\u0080\u009d spacecraft streaking toward me out of the darkness. In addition, my night glare symptoms took the only slightly more benign form of halos appearing around light sources. If I looked up at, say, a full moon on a clear night I would see not just the old face of the man in the moon, but that familiar glowing visage wreathed by a ring of smaller spheres \u00e2\u0080\u0094 half a dozen mini-moons sprouting around its circumference like the petals of a flower.  Likewise, if I directed my attention toward smaller light sources \u00e2\u0080\u0094 say the windows of distant buildings across from my apartment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of registering as single bright points of light, each little window appeared as an arcade of stars, a shimmering necklace of gleaming beads. Thus my normally prosaic neighborhood cityscape of gray and beige high-rises became a jeweled fairyland, reminding me of the famous Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. (Actually, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been to that storied old amusement park, but the travel-poster images I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen invariably show a radiant nighttime lightscape of sparkling fountains, shimmering ponds, rainbow rows of colored lanterns and, on summer nights, dazzling displays of fireworks.) Of course, that magical panorama outside my window was ultimately more the result of pathology than pixie dust. And unfortunately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no little pill you can pop that will miraculously make things clear up.  So as time went by and my cataracts gradually \u00e2\u0080\u009cripened\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my ophthalmologist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charming expression for getting worse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 my only option became surgery.Not surprisingly, the very thought of anyone wielding sharp, shiny objects anywhere near my eyes induced a case of the major willies.  Modern cataract-removal surgery, though, turned out to be hardly the nightmare assault I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d feared. The operation involves removing the diseased natural lens and replacing it with a synthetic one, much as hip replacement surgery consists of removing an arthritic or damaged hip and inserting a metal and plastic version in its place. Certainly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a delicate procedure, but not one that requires flashy recent advances like prosthetic robot arms that move in response to mere thought. In fact, cataract surgery is among the most commonly performed operations in the country. The procedure for each eye took less than an hour, during which I remained awake but comfortably sedated. I was aware of lights, sounds and occasional gentle pressure, but it was all virtually painless. And the results have been remarkable. The new world that floated into focus on an ocean of post-surgical eyedrops over the next few days has been strikingly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes even alarmingly \u00e2\u0080\u0094 clear, crisp and bright. And for the first time in years I find myself able to effortlessly read a book (including footnotes), peruse restaurant menus in low light and make out the fine print on medicine bottles. I can decipher distant road signs and foreign film subtitles, recognize faces from afar, and even distinguish the expressions on those faces. The only downside has been that when I now scan the neighborhood outside my window at night, my private Tivoli is nowhere in sight. The curtain has descended on that alluring light show. Not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m complaining.

He pledged allegiance to the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said, \u201cmay Allah accept me,\u201d Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive.\u201cYou kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes,\u201d Mr. Mateen wrote, according to the letter. \u201cNow taste the Islamic state vengeance.\u201d And in what Mr. Johnson described as the gunman\u2019s final post, he wrote, \u201cIn the next few days you will see attacks from the Islamic state in the usa.\u201dMr. Johnson, a Republican who leads the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote in his letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that officials had found that \u201cfive Facebook accounts were apparently associated with Omar Mateen.\u201d The letter asked Facebook to share all data on accounts tied to the gunman.Mr. Mateen frequently used Facebook to search for information on law enforcement agencies and terrorist groups, Mr. Johnson wrote. And on Sunday morning, during the siege at Pulse, \u201cMateen apparently searched for \u2018Pulse Orlando\u2019 and \u2018Shooting.\u2019\u201dMore information came to light Thursday about Mr. Mateen\u2019s troubled work and school history, and about his actions leading up to the slaughter at Pulse nightclub on Sunday that left 49 people dead and 53 wounded in the worst mass shooting in United States history.In the weeks before the shooting, Mr. Mateen, 29, went to a gun store here in Jensen Beach, Fla., and tried to buy high-grade body armor and at least 1,000 rounds of ammunition, said a co-owner of the store, Robert Abell. He said the store, Lotus Gunworks, did not stock the type of armor sought by Mr. Mateen, who lived nearby, and a salesman grew suspicious of Mr. Mateen\u2019s behavior during a visit that lasted perhaps five minutes, including a telephone conversation he conducted in a foreign language, and refused to sell him bulk ammunition.Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, has asked the chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, to provide details of the postings of Omar Mateen, the gunman in the Orlando shooting.\u201cSomething in his gut told him it was wrong,\u201d Mr. Abell said of the employee. He said the store contacted the F.B.I., but had no information by which to identify the customer; only after the killings did an employee recognize Mr. Mateen, who used an assault rifle and a handgun in the attack.\u201cUnfortunately, nobody connected the dots, and he slipped under the cracks, and this is where we\u2019re at now,\u201d he said.School records released under public records requests showed that Mr. Mateen, who was born in Queens and grew up in Florida, was frequently in trouble as a child, and struggled to keep pace academically, especially in the early grades. He was disciplined 31 times in elementary and middle school, with one report when he was in third grade including a sweeping list of concerns. He was \u201cconstantly moving, verbally abusive, rude, aggressive,\u201d the report said, often put his hands on other students, disrupted class and engaged in \u201cmuch talk about violence & sex.\u201dIn high school, he was repeatedly suspended, for a total of 48 days, in a span of less than two years, and attended three different schools. The last suspension came two days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The Martin County School District found no detailed records of what prompted the penalty, said Kim Sabol, a lawyer for the district, but former classmates have told news organizations that he celebrated the attacks, sparking conflicts with other students.In May 2001, when he was 14, he was suspended twice for fighting, and one of those times he was arrested, according to personnel records from his later work for the State Department of Corrections. In a note explaining the incident to the department, he wrote he was not taken to jail, and \u201cthe charge of battery was adjudicated and the charge of disturbing school function was dropped.\u201dFrom October 2006 to April 2007, Mr. Mateen worked for the Florida Department of Corrections as a corrections officer trainee, earning $1,123.35 every two weeks, according to state records. He was dismissed but the records do not say why, except that it was not for misconduct. He received middling scores on a performance evaluation.He worked for a private security company, where, according to law enforcement officials and a former co-worker, he talked of killing people, and claimed to support or belong to Islamist extremist groups. He also expressed hatred of gay people.The leader of the Orlando police SWAT team added new detail to accounts of the massacre and defended the handling of the siege, saying that a lot of people believe, wrongly, that \u201cwe weren\u2019t doing anything for a long period of time.\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning of this, officers were running inside and trying to save people,\u201d Capt. Mark Canty said. \u201cThey were setting up around the outside trying to figure out how to get people out.\u201dOfficers rescued people escape throughout a three-hour standoff, including removing an air conditioner from a wall to allow several people in one room to climb out.Officials decided to storm the club after Mr. Mateen threatened to strap himself and hostages with explosives, which later turned out to have been a bluff. Law enforcement teams used explosives to try to blow a hole in the outer wall of the club, but they did not completely breach it. Then they used an armored vehicle to make a hole by ramming the building, but they had to do it repeatedly, Mr. Canty said, trying to find the spot where some people were trapped.A battery pack that officers saw through the bomb squad robot camera \u2014 which led them to believe there were explosives inside \u2014 turned out to have been from an exit sign or a smoke detector, Mayor Buddy Dyer said.Federal law enforcement officials said Thursday that the F.B.I. is increasingly skeptical of reports that Mr. Mateen was gay but \u201ccloseted,\u201d that he had been visiting gay clubs or that he had used gay dating apps. The bureau has recovered the Samsung phone he used the night of the attack, and is trying to retrieve data from it.Investigators believe his wife, Noor Zahi Salman, drove Mr. Mateen to Pulse within a week or two of the shooting, apparently to assess the target, the officials said. She has told agents that she tried to talk her husband out of mounting an attack, and Justice Department say it is not clear if she will face criminal charges.Officials and eyewitnesses have said that during the siege at Pulse, Mr. Mateen, a son of Afghan immigrants, declared allegiance to Mr. al-Baghdadi.Officials say he was influenced by radical propaganda that he found online, but so far have found no direct connection to any larger organization.On Thursday, the Central Intelligence Agency director, John O. Brennan, gave a grim assessment of the prospects for more attacks. Though the Islamic State has been pushed back on battlefields in the Middle East, he said in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, \u201cour efforts have not reduced the group\u2019s terrorism capabilities and global reach.\u201dThe Islamic State is intensifying plans to attack in the West, he said, and continues to use propaganda to inspire \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks like Mr. Mateen\u2019s.Alan Blinder reported from Jensen Beach, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York, and Frances Robles from Orlando.

{"Headline": "Man Inadvertently Broadcasts His Own Killing on Facebook Live", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byIn the latest example, Antonio Perkins, 28, was taking his friends through a quiet evening in his neighborhood in Chicago on Wednesday, using Facebook to broadcast video live, when, suddenly, gunshots were heard.The camera fell to the ground, first showing grass, then darkness. But the audio continued. Screams followed: \u201cOh, my God!\u201d \u201cCall the police!\u201d \u201cTony! No!\u201dMr. Perkins was declared dead a short time later in a hospital. A police spokeswoman, Laura Amezaga, said Friday that detectives had confirmed that Mr. Perkins was the man mortally wounded in the video.As the video shows, the ability to broadcast live carries with it risks that once were considered only by TV stations.The allure of live television, and live Facebooking, is partly in not knowing what will happen next, which is why car chases get frequent live coverage, said Mike Conway, an associate professor at Indiana University.But when they have time to edit, TV stations have generally avoided showing the grisliest of footage because viewers complain when they see it, he said.Three days, 64 people shot, six of them dead: Memorial Day on the streets, and the violence that has engulfed families and neighborhoods.\u201cNow in this world, there\u2019s no gatekeeper,\u201d he said.Facebook moderators take videos down if they glorify violence, but allows them to remain if they appear to be trying to raise awareness. In some cases, as in the video of Mr. Perkins, Facebook adds a disclaimer: \u201cWarning \u2014 Graphic Video. Videos that contain graphic content can shock, offend and upset. Are you sure you want to see this?\u201d\u201cShe was swept up by the gravity of the situation,\u201d her lawyer, Sam Shamansky, said in April. \u201cAnd as she immediately told the police, she was filming in order to preserve, not to embarrass or to shame or to titillate anybody.\u201dOfficers used her live stream to determine her location, and she was charged with drunken driving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visitors to the U.S. May Be Asked for Social Media Information", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government has proposed adding a line to forms filled out by visitors to the United States that would ask them to voluntarily disclose their social media accounts, a step that it said would help in screening for ties to terrorism.Visitors entering the country under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of some countries to visit up to 90 days without a visa, would not be required to list their social media accounts, and the forms would not ask for passwords. But Customs and Border Protection, which announced the proposal last week in the Federal Register, said the social media information would give it extra investigative tools.\u201cCollecting social media data will enhance the existing investigative process and provide D.H.S. greater clarity and visibility to possible nefarious activity,\u201d the border agency said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security, its parent organization.The proposal comes after Congress passed legislation last year to add restrictions to the Visa Waiver Program. The legislation was a response to the November terrorist attacks in Paris, which led to fears that European-born or naturalized citizens with terrorist ties could enter the United States without being properly vetted.Legislation pending in Congress would require the Department of Homeland Security to collect social media information from foreign visitors. The bills were spurred by the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. The couple who carried out the assault had exchanged private messages online discussing their commitment to jihad and martyrdom, law enforcement officials said, but they did not post any public messages about their plans.Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, who has introduced one of the bills requiring social media information, called the Customs and Border Protection proposal \u201clame.\u201d\u201cVoluntary disclosure won\u2019t keep anyone safe,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said. \u201cIf we want to win on the digital battlefield, mandatory screening is required.\u201dMr. Buchanan\u2019s bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to review all public records, including Facebook and other forms of social media, before admitting foreign travelers.The department said that while it does not consistently examine social media accounts of applicants for visas or immigration, it has a list of nearly three dozen situations in which social media can be examined to screen applicants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Early Signs of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Upheaval", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own \u201cremain\u201d vote \u2014 with his feet. Mr. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial start-up with him.The looming question on Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain\u2019s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.The long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \u201cremain\u201d camp\u2019s warnings of economic tumult could come true.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo on Friday that in months to come \u201cwe may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\u201d Mr. Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London\u2019s real estate boom.J\u00fcrgen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.\u201cAll companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\u201d said Mr. Maier, Siemens\u2019s chief executive for Britain.For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain\u2019s coattails out of the union.It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain cheaper to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the \u201cleave\u201d forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe.But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive decision-making could be paralyzed and investment could come to a standstill.Britain\u2019s financial services industry, which employs 1.2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage.Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe.James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees \u2014 many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume \u2014 they said they might \u201cconsider adjustments to our operating model.\u201dEven Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,\u201d said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. \u201cAt this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there\u2019s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides.\u201dPerhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15,000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers.Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. \u201cThis is a lose-lose result for both Britain and Europe,\u201d said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. \u201cWe will review our U.K. investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201dOther sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. \u201cUncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,\u201d BP said in a statement Friday.United States technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1,000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe\u2019s common marketplace.The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany\u2019s third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the mid-1980s into a world-class factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475,000 vehicles, about a third of Britain\u2019s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union.Yet despite the European Union\u2019s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said on Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond.Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative.Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14,000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Mr. Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions.For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like self-driving cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out.\u201cThe question is more about future investment, future research and development,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThat\u2019s hanging in the balance.\u201dHe embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Mr. Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives.\u201cIt\u2019s usually a really buzzing office,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThis morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren\u2019t calling. That\u2019s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in.\u201dContributing reporting were Chad Bray and Stanley Reed from London, Nathaniel Popper and Michael Corkery from New York, Mark Scott from Rome and David Jolly from ParisAdvertisement"}

It puts LinkedIn\u2019s enterprise value at 79 times the social network\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the 12 months that ended on March 31.On the basis of that multiple, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIn\u2019s monthly active users. By comparison, when Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion two years ago, it spent $40 for every user.For LinkedIn, the attractions of the deal are obvious: Its shares fell nearly 42 percent from the beginning of the year through last week, as investors expressed disappointment over a weak earnings forecast for 2016. Finding a buyer with deep pockets dulls the pain of being a publicly traded company.The question is whether other suitors will emerge with rich offers in hand.One perennial subject of deal rumors is another social network: Twitter.Shares of Twitter jumped nearly 7 percent in trading on Monday, borne aloft by investors\u2019 hopes that the struggling tech company might finally receive a takeover offer. Twitter shares have fallen 64 percent since the company went public in 2013, as the social network has struggled to show growth in the face of tough competition from the likes of Facebook and Snapchat.Potential buyers for Twitter include Google and Facebook, analysts say, though they caution that Twitter\u2019s valuation may need to fall more before a suitor steps up.At the price-to-sales multiple that Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn, roughly 7.2 times the social network\u2019s revenue for the last 12 months, Twitter would fetch roughly $18.7 billion \u2014 or nearly double its current market value of $10 billion.Microsoft\u2019s bet on LinkedIn \u2014 which less than five months ago was trading above the acquisition price of $196 a share \u2014 suggests that tech has more room to run, even as some bears are projecting that another bubble is bound to pop.\u201cMicrosoft just paid on the assumption that we\u2019re going back to the multiples we had a year ago, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening,\u201d said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falluja Restaurant Is Reborn in Baghdad, Offering Nostalgia With Its Kebab", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byBaghdad JournalBAGHDAD \u2014 Long before Falluja was known the world over for deadly jihadists, it was known all over Iraq for its kebab \u2014 fatty lamb, ground and mixed with onion, grilled on a skewer over an open fire and served with a pinch of sumac \u2014 at a joint called Haji Hussein.The restaurant was damaged by bombs multiple times, and entirely flattened once by an American airstrike. It was rebuilt, embraced as a symbol of Falluja\u2019s own rebirth after years of war, only to be abandoned when the city fell to the Islamic State more than two years ago.Now the much-loved kebab restaurant has been reborn again, this time in Baghdad, in a modern, three-story building in the upscale Mansour neighborhood.A new entrant on the capital\u2019s thriving restaurant scene, it offers great kebab and a dose of nostalgia for a time when Baghdadis thought nothing of zipping off to Falluja for lunch at Haji Hussein.\u201cThis was the craft of my grandfather,\u201d said Mohammed Hussein, who runs the business that has been in his family since the 1930s, when Falluja was a city of agriculture, smuggling and tribal traditions, not a jihadist haven.The restaurant, shiny and well lit, is packed most nights, and patrons wait for tables \u2014 15 to 20 minutes or so, something almost unheard-of in Iraq. There are two flat-screen televisions on the first floor, tuned to news channels reporting on the military campaign to retake Falluja from the Islamic State.\u201cI can\u2019t bear to watch the news,\u201d Mr. Hussein said.There was one news flash recently that did not escape his notice: The Iraqi Air Force, like the Americans 12 years ago, announced that it had struck his restaurant site in Falluja because leaders with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were meeting there.A statement from Iraq\u2019s Joint Operation Command appeared on the television: \u201cBased on intelligence information about a meeting for ISIS leaders in Haji Hussein restaurant inside the center of Falluja an airstrike was launched on the restaurant, which led to the killing of tens of ISIS terrorists.\u201dBut the restaurant, Mr. Hussein said, has been deserted for two and a half years.When Iraqi forces recently made gains inside Falluja, people almost immediately began talking about Haji Hussein. The federal police released a combat video saying they were fighting near the restaurant, and a glimpse of the rust-colored facade showed it damaged but not destroyed. On state television, commentators expressed hope that Haji Hussein might reopen soon in Falluja.Patrick Graham, a Canadian journalist who covered the Iraq war, likened Haji Hussein to a Nova Scotia branch of a popular Canadian doughnut chain.This being the holy month of Ramadan, the Baghdad restaurant has been busy lately serving iftar, the evening meal to break the day\u2019s fast. The parking lot is also a beehive of activity: a security guard checking cars for bombs; a man selling balloons to families; children begging.As Mr. Hussein, 49, sat down to chat one recent evening, he was surrounded by bow-tied waiters \u2014 much of the staff from Falluja now works in the new place \u2014 filling the tables with dishes of mezze, or appetizers, as diners waited to break their fast.In addition to heaping platters of the famous kebab, there were dates coated with sesame paste, watermelon, hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, pickles and soup. There were some new items on the menu that were not served in Falluja: grilled river carp, called masgoof; a Yemeni chicken-and-rice meal called mandi; and maklouba, a dish of chicken and eggplant and rice that is originally Palestinian.As customers streamed in, Mr. Hussein tried to recall how many times his restaurant in Falluja had been damaged or destroyed by the war.\u201cToo many to count,\u201d he said.At times, he said, he would have to call a local windowpane salesman once or twice a week. \u201cIt was a funny joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d call and he\u2019d say, \u2018Which size?\u2019 He would have all the sizes for my windows on hand, ready.\u201dMr. Hussein recalled an American officer who used to stop by, and grab his kebab right off the grill with a piece of flatbread. But he kept his distance from the occupiers.\u201cWe tried not to become friends with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say hi, we would say hi, that was it.\u201dHe said peace would not be easy in Falluja, even after liberation from the Islamic State, without political compromises between the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the Sunni community. Speaking of the people of Falluja, he said, \u201cThere were reasons they joined ISIS \u2014 oppression, random arrests.\u201dAt least in his restaurant, Iraq does not seem hopelessly divided by sect. Sunnis and Shiites break their fast at slightly different times, and as sundown approached one of the televisions was tuned to a Sunni channel, the other to Iraqiya, the channel of the Shiite-led government.When the call to prayer \u2014 the signal that the day\u2019s fast was over \u2014 went out on one, the Sunnis began eating. Fifteen minutes or so later, the Shiite customers began eating.Anas al-Sarraf, who is perhaps Baghdad\u2019s only restaurant critic, has praised Haji Hussein on his widely followed Baghdad Restaurant Guide on Facebook, for its kebab, cleanliness and service.One Iraqi exile, pining for home, posted a comment on Mr. Sarraf\u2019s site: \u201cI have been out of Iraq for 13 years, and there is no Iraqi food or Iraqi kebab like Haji Hussein. Inshallah, I will come back one day to eat at Haji Hussein in Falluja and in Baghdad.\u201dIn the kitchen, Mr. Hussein\u2019s nephew, Marwan Mohammed, was working the grill. Now 26, he has been working in the family business since he was 8, washing the skewers.Mr. Mohammed said the secret to his kebab is fresh lamb, as opposed to low-quality imported meats that he said many Iraqi restaurants use. The family still raises its own sheep in a government-held area near Falluja, and usually serves the kebab on the same day the sheep is slaughtered, or the next day.\u201cWe only feed them grass and special food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never let them go out in the open and eat garbage.\u201dThe only other ingredient mixed with the minced lamb is onions. Sumac and a squeeze of lemon at the table add more flavor.Mr. Hussein\u2019s fortune may now be in Baghdad, but his heart is in Falluja.His hometown, he said, \u201cis like a sacred place for me.\u201d He added, \u201cMy heart beats faster when Falluja comes to my mind.\u201dHe began to cry as he described what Falluja used to be.\u201cSimple people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tribal society. We\u2019ve never even had a hotel. There was hospitality for everyone. All homes were hotels for visitors.\u201dOmar Al-Jawoshy contributed reporting.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The End of American Childhood,\u2019 by Paula S. Fass", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Paula S. Fass, a prominent historian of childhood and education at the University of California, Berkeley, is very much at home in the distant past. She knows where and how to find primary source material that can make long-dormant voices come to life on the page. In her new book, \u201cThe End of American Childhood: A History of Parenting From Life on the Frontier to the Managed Child,\u201d she puts this knowledge and skill to valuable use in defining a uniquely American form of childhood \u2014 characterized by a combination of pluck, grit, autonomy and self-sufficiency \u2014 that came into being in the early 19th century. She also shows how that idea of childhood was accompanied by parenting practices that survived, despite challenges, in the century and a half that followed.Children in the United States from the very earliest days of the Republic, Fass shows, were raised with practices conceived in direct opposition to Old World notions of authoritarian power and natural hierarchy. This was part ideology \u2014 a filtering down to the family level of the democratizing spirit that drove the American Revolution \u2014 and it was part necessity. American families were caught up in the tough realities of life in a new country, on a huge continent, where family survival depended on every member pitching in, and where children at a very young age worked and bore a degree of family responsibility all but unimaginable today. The early American experience, Fass writes, created \u201ca formula or recipe that shifted the standard of what might be expected in the relationship between parents and children.\u201d This formula \u201cemphasized children\u2019s independence and limited parental control.\u201dFass is aware of the limitations of this formula. Her chapters on the 19th and \u00adearly-20th centuries, which describe the exclusion of slave parents and children from all notions of \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d and explore the ugly underbelly of the American immigrant experience, are fascinating. Immigrant fathers in particular, she shows, often battled mightily, and even violently, to retain some semblance of Old World power and hierarchy in homes where rapidly Americanizing children wanted nothing more than to break free.Unfortunately, however, as Fass moves beyond the distant past and starts to write about the period that corresponds to her own life, her historian\u2019s remove falls away. Her discerning eye for primary source material does as well. As we move through the late 1940s and 1950s, and into Fass\u2019s coming-of-age in the campus protest era of the 1960s, parental voices fade. We get a great deal of expository material about the dawn of the civil rights movement, changes in family structure, and campus protest, and all but entirely miss the psychological experience of parenting from the 1960s through the 1980s. Fass makes clear that a highlight of her own life was being on the Columbia campus in the late 1960s: \u201cSomeone who grew up during the student revolts of the 1960s, as I did, even one who was just marginally involved, often finds it hard to believe that anything truly important might have happened elsewhere than on campus or as a result of the shocks imposed by the revolts there.\u201dHer experience not only forms her expectations about the nature of \u00adparent-child relationships but also sets her intellectual center of gravity. What this means, unfortunately, is that Fass has a hard time apprehending the parenting period that followed her own \u2014 one in which there has been a radical shift in parent-child relations from the generally hostile \u201cgeneration gap\u201d of the late 1960s to the much-\u00adremarked-upon boomer-\u00admillennial bond. Looking at our contemporary era \u2014 a time when the overtly acrimonious generation gap of the Woodstock era has yielded, according to the Pew Research Center, to \u201csomething approximating peace\u201d \u2014 Fass\u2019s capacity to engage with her material runs aground. Not understanding what she sees, and unable to fit it into the intellectual superstructure that otherwise organizes her thinking about American childhood and parenthood, she concludes that everyone else is uncomprehending and confused: \u201cAmerican parents no longer understand how their children move from childhood into adulthood.\u201d A few pages later, she reiterates: \u201cWithout a means to understand them, parents felt helpless to figure out where they were going.\u201d Millennials are lost as well \u2014 \u201ca generation with unclear goals, embedded in a new world of internet rules and Facebook friendships.\u201d She disdains the world of internet content, including parenting blogs (\u201cThe online world likes short words, so \u2018Mom\u2019 has been rescued from its ignominy\u201d is as far as she goes), and consequently a rich universe of contemporary parental expression is largely ignored. Perhaps this is why her summing up of the issues that concern parents \u2014 \u201cwhether their emphasis on independence and on allowing children flexibility to choose their own future is the right course\u201d \u2014 feels so off target.Fass states that popular books on our current culture of parenthood suffer from historical shortsightedness; the value of her own work, she implies, lies in her ability, as a historian, to take the long view, and thus more accurately see the big picture. And yet, her treatment of the period since the mid-1980s, in marked contrast with her chapters on our earlier history, is no less a polemic than other standard parenting fare.Since the late 1980s, Fass asserts, \u201ccontrol, above all, became the guiding principle of \u2018successful\u2019 parenting. .\u2008.\u2008. Protection became more important to parents than independence, more important than giving children the freedom to choose their own futures. In that sense, American childhood as it had evolved over 200 years of changes had come to an end.\u201d Her focus on today\u2019s anxious, micromanaging parents, who \u201cworry too much and provide their children with too little space to grow,\u201d places her book squarely among familiar jeremiads, like Hara Estroff Marano\u2019s \u201cA Nation of Wimps.\u201d For the past decade or so, these books have argued that our self-\u00adesteem-boosting, \u201cGood job!\u201d-shouting parenting ethos has produced a denatured bunch of ninnies who don\u2019t play outside or do chores while they\u2019re growing up, and call in Mom and Dad to yell at their professors when they don\u2019t like their grades in college.In fact, this sort of worry about the wreck of American children long predates the current era: In particular, the \u201cmyth\u201d that \u201cchildhood is disappearing,\u201d the University of Texas at Austin historian Steven Mintz argues in his excellent 2004 book, \u201cHuck\u2019s Raft: A History of American Childhood,\u201d has recurred frequently during times of stress and rapid social change in our nation\u2019s history. Adults yearn for the familiar \u2014 their own childhoods \u2014 at moments when they feel particularly unmoored.Fass knows this. \u201cParents love their children, but they also love themselves. In fact, they often love and cherish their memories of their own childhood when they worry about their children,\u201d she writes, toward the end of her book. Yet she seems unaware of how deeply a kind of narcissistic bias infects her own vision of recent history.That\u2019s a shame. The material Fass provides on America in the 19th and \u00adearly-20th centuries is important, and highly relevant to the really essential issues driving parenting behavior in our day. It tells a story that places the American experience of childhood and parenthood in a larger context of rising and falling levels of social concern. We see how a basic libertarian impulse \u2014 great for those with the privilege to be winners in their place and time \u2014 is intercut, periodically, with waves of communitarian conscience. Telling details remind us of how long it has been since caring for our country\u2019s most vulnerable children was seen as an integral part of our \u201cnational welfare.\u201dIn 1897, the National Congress of Mothers (the precursor to today\u2019s PTA), Fass notes, set as its goal that each member \u201cmust take into her heart all homes, all children, all motherhood.\u201d Today, as well-off mothers with time on their hands hunker down to fund-raise and volunteer, so that their children\u2019s public schools can have top-flight athletic equipment and organic vegetable gardens \u2014 while, outside their ZIP code, lower-income schools struggle to get money for art classes or even pencils and paper \u2014 the social aims of those Progressive Era reformers seem very distant indeed.Judith Warner is the author of \u201cPerfect \u00adMadness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Killing Twice for ISIS and Saying So Live on Facebook", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 He stabbed an off-duty police officer and left him bleeding to death on his own doorstep. He forced his way inside the home and stabbed and killed the officer\u2019s female companion. He then sat down and videotaped himself live on Facebook declaring allegiance to the Islamic State, according to the French law enforcement authorities.Sitting just behind him was the couple\u2019s son, a terrified 3-year-old boy, of whom Larossi Abballa, the killer, said dismissively, \u201cI have not decided what to do with him,\u201d according to David Thomson, a French journalist for Radio France Internationale and the author of a book on jihadists who saw Mr. Abballa\u2019s online posts before they were taken down.The events that unfolded between about 8 p.m. and midnight on Monday \u2014 when elite police forces broke into the house in the small town of Magnanville, fatally shot Mr. Abballa, 25, and rescued the boy \u2014 were the second time within 48 hours in which a person appearing to act alone claimed to kill in the name of the Islamic State.In the attacks in both Magnanville and Orlando, Fla., the killers had more than just brushed up against the authorities before, in what has become a distressingly familiar pattern \u2014 from the set of attacks in Paris in November, to those in Brussels in March and beyond. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, had been interviewed twice by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for his possible links to terrorism, and Mr. Abballa had been convicted for having links to a terrorist network and served about two years in jail before being released.Further complicating the job of protecting Western nations are governments\u2019 dual goal of preserving civil liberties while trying to make people feel secure.The attack in France was shocking not only to neighbors in Magnanville, about 35 miles from Paris, but across the country because it underscored that extremist attacks can happen in the most ordinary places, above all in those where people believe they are safe.Mr. Abballa\u2019s Facebook post from Monday night made clear that he wanted to terrify and destroy those he deemed \u201cunbelievers,\u201d people he had come to hate. He also wanted to encourage other lone wolves to do the same.\u201cIt\u2019s super simple,\u201d he said, looking into the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to wait for them in front of their offices; don\u2019t give them any respite. Know this, whether you are a policeman or a journalist, you will never feel calm again. One will wait for you in front of your homes. This is what you have earned.\u201dBoasting that he had \u201cjust killed a policeman and I just killed his wife,\u201d he called on fellow believers to give priority to killing \u201cpolice, prison guards, journalists.\u201d He specifically named several writers and journalists, adding rappers to the list because, he said, they \u201care the allies of Satan.\u201dEven more chillingly, he warned that jihadists had \u201creserved some other surprises for the Euro; I am not going to say more.\u2019\u2019\u201cThe Euro will be a cemetery,\u201d he said, referring to the Euro 2016 soccer tournament being played over the next several weeks in 10 French cities.It was unclear whether Mr. Abballa had specific knowledge of a potential attack on the matches or the crowds gathered for them.The version of the video released by the Islamic State\u2019s Amaq news agency was trimmed by a couple of minutes to omit images of the boy and Mr. Abballa\u2019s references to him. On Twitter, opinion was divided between those who thought the images of a defenseless child were tasteless even by the standards of the Islamic State\u2019s hardened propagandists and those who speculated that the extremist news agency did not want to show Mr. Abballa as unwilling to kill a child.As the special police forces surrounded the murdered officer\u2019s house, where Mr. Abballa was holed up, cordoning off the modest neighborhood that is home to both non-Muslims and Muslims, Mr. Abballa asked his \u201cbrothers\u201d to pray to Allah that he might become a martyr.The video was posted a little before 9 p.m. on Monday as the police began to try to negotiate with him.By the time the security forces reached the couple\u2019s son three hours later, he was in a \u201cstunned\u201d state as people are after a profound shock, said Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister.Many questions remain about Mr. Abballa\u2019s path from his birth and early life in nearby Meulan, France, as the child of parents of Moroccan origin, to his death at the hands of a police SWAT team. Along the way, he spent time in prison and proselytized to other inmates about Islam, said Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the Paris prosecutor.When he was released, he started a small fast-food business, which he named Dr. Food. It delivered sandwiches, according to a Facebook clip he posted.He was one of eight men convicted in Paris in 2013 of aiding a group that had been intending to commit terrorist acts and had planned to go to Pakistan for training.He received a three-year sentence on Sept. 30, 2013, including a six-month suspended sentence. He was allowed to go free after his conviction because he had spent two years and two months in jail awaiting trial.However, he was under surveillance for another two years and two months, until Nov. 30, 2015, said Mr. Molins, the prosecutor.\u201cAt the trial, Abballa seemed like someone who was not dangerous but was rather stupid,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Denis, a lawyer who represented Zohab Ifzar, one of the other defendants.The officer killed on Monday had nothing to do with the investigation that resulted in Mr. Abballa\u2019s imprisonment, Mr. Denis said.\u201cHe appeared to be the perfect soldier,\u201d Mr. Denis said \u2014 someone who would do whatever was needed to help the effort \u2014 and was \u201cvery determined.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Abballa came to the attention of the French law enforcement authorities when he was among several people questioned in a counterterrorism inquiry that Mr. Molins\u2019s office began on Feb. 11 into a group believed to be planning to go to Syria.As part of that inquiry, investigators gathered intelligence from telephone intercepts and various geocoding technologies, but none of the findings indicated that Mr. Abballa was on the verge of violence, Mr. Molins said.Three men in Mr. Abballa\u2019s circle \u2014 ages 27, 29 and 44 \u2014 were detained for questioning after the killings on Monday.The attack in Magnanville has already prompted calls in France for more stringent handling of those convicted of terrorism-related activities.On early morning broadcasts on Tuesday, some members of Parliament called for all people suspected of potential terrorist leanings to be placed in detention.But France is already stretched to the limit, both in prison capacity and in the numbers of suspects it can monitor. The police and intelligence agencies are described as working constantly to track would-be jihadists.The antiterrorism directorate of the judicial police and of the internal security department of the Interior Ministry have detained 100 people this year over their suspected ties to terrorism, Mr. Cazeneuve, the interior minister, said Tuesday. He added that the terrorism threat in France was \u201cvery high.\u201dIn testimony before members of the French Parliament on May 10, Patrick Calvar, head of domestic intelligence, said about 2,000 French citizens or residents were of concern to the security forces.He testified that at least 645 French citizens or residents of France were in Syria and that about 400 of those were fighting with militant groups.In addition, Mr. Calvar said, 244 French citizens have returned to France from Syria or Iraq, and the French intelligence services say they have identified an additional 818 people who they believe want to join extremists.The French authorities have repeatedly said it is impossible to monitor all of them at all times.Reporting was contributed by Daphn\u00e9 Angl\u00e8s, Rukmini Callimachi, Beno\u00eet Morenne and Milan Schreuer from Paris, and Sewell Chan from London.Advertisement"}

The tradition goes back centuries. Galileo and Darwin fought mightily to use observation, logic, and mathematics to create a reality-based view of the universe and humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been easy. For Galileo, who used observations of the planets and stars to show that the Earth was not the center of the universe, the result was house arrest for the final years of his life as religious leaders fought the erosion of world views based on faith. Darwin meticulously and patiently spent more than twenty years assembling his argument and evidence for evolution before the publication of The Origin of Species, yet a large portion of society still rejects that firmly established theory.By fostering the capacity for critical thinking rather than simply providing examples, \u00c2\u00a0invaluable given that science and technology will\u00c2\u00a0always be providing new material for myth makers to latch on to. The existing debate over nuclear power and genetically modified foods will soon give way to battles over synthetic biology and nanotechnology.With \u201cHow to Fake a Moon Landing,\u201d Cunningham reveals the roots of misinformation and intentional disinformation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of both out there. But, more important, he provides a road map for how anyone can do this. One of the great challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0094and opportunities\u00e2\u0080\u0094in twenty-first-century life lies in finding ways to navigate the sea of assertions and facts we face on the Internet and come away with some sense of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really known and unknown, or simply feared or imagined, in a complicated, dynamic world. When I was coming of age in the mid-twentieth century, there was usually some authority doing the work for you, whether a silver-haired anchorman on the nightly news or the printed front page of a newspaper. Now, no matter what your predispositions, you can probe the web\u00c2\u00a0 and, seconds later, come away with information or ideas that bolster them.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Cunningham would be happy to have readers finish his book and raise their own questions about his conclusions. That would mean they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve absorbed his prime message. As he explains in the foreword, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis book is pro-science and pro-critical thinking. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a book promoting a scientific \u00c3\u00a9lite whom we must all follow, sheep-like.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the end, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoping that after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read this book, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dead set on becoming your own best myth buster\u00c2\u00a0.

{"Headline": "Orlando and Trump\u2019s America", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byOmar Mateen, the Florida shooter who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, just ushered Donald Trump to the White House, Britain out of the European Union, Marine Le Pen to the French presidency, and the world into a downward spiral of escalating violence.Aged 29, Mateen is the Gavrilo Princip of the early 21st century, the young man who ripped up an old, decaying political order. Like the 19-year-old Bosnian Serb nationalist whose bullets ignited World War I, Mateen has set a spark to a time of inflammable anger.Of course, these somber imaginings may prove to be no more than that. Mateen has not yet changed the world; he may never.But there is no question that the largest mass shooting in American history comes at a time of particular unease. In both the United States and Europe, political and economic frustrations have produced a groundswell against the status quo and an apparent readiness to make a leap in the dark. Washington and Brussels have become bywords for paralysis.Trump and \u201cBrexit\u201d represent action \u2014 any action \u2014 to shake things up. They are, to their supporters, the comeuppance smug elites deserve.On top of this, and feeding this, Islam is in epochal crisis. Its Sunni and Shiite branches are mired in violent confrontation. Its adjustment to the modern world has proved faltering and agonized enough to produce a metastasizing strain of violent anti-Western jihadist beliefs to which Mateen \u2014 like the San Bernardino shooters \u2014 was apparently susceptible.That he shot revelers in a gay club suggests once again that Islam and sexuality constitute a particularly combustible realm. Liberal Western sexual mores are the most troubling affront to a certain strain of Islam. The resultant confrontation incubates explosive violence.It is 12 years since Theo van Gogh was murdered in Amsterdam by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim jihadi for making a movie about the treatment of women in Islam; and now homosexuals at the Pulse club in Orlando are targeted by an American citizen of Afghan descent who, it seems, had also found in Islamic extremism the ideological answer to his troubles.It is poisonous to blame all the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims for this crisis of their religion. Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory reiteration of his call for a temporary ban on non-American Muslims entering the United States exemplifies his violence-tinged politics of division. Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States, told an Israeli journalist: \u201cIf I were Donald Trump I\u2019d come out the minute the F.B.I. decided to start leaking this morning that we are talking about a man who acted out of Islamic motives, with connections. First of all the name itself, Omar Siddiqui Mateen, a Muslim name, the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, who apparently was somehow in touch with extremist Islamic organizations. This already has a significant influence on the race for the presidency.\u201d Later, he tweeted that Trump would do this, not that he had recommended it.It is, however, also dangerous to ignore or belittle the potency of ISIS ideology, the core role it has played in recent violence from Paris to California, and the link between that ideology and the broader crisis of Islam. The favored phrase of the Obama administration in addressing this scourge \u2014 \u201cviolent extremism\u201d \u2014 is vague to the point of evasive meaninglessness. Yes, jihadi terrorists are \u201cviolent extremists\u201d but calling them that is like calling Nazism a reaction to German humiliation in World War I: true but wholly inadequate.Mateen demonstrated again just how potent the mix of ISIS and National Rifle Association ideology is. America is the perfect setting for \u201clone wolf\u201d ISIS followers because they have access to the weapons they need to do their worst. Despite having been investigated twice in recent years by the F.B.I. for possible ties to terrorism, Mateen was able to walk into a Florida gun dealership recently, and acquire a \u201clong gun\u201d and a pistol. This, by any reasonable standard, is madness.The AR-15 assault rifle used by Mateen was also the weapon used by the San Bernardino shooters. The former N.R.A. president, David Keene, once described the weapons as the \u201cgun liberals love to hate.\u201d It is in fact the rifle that illustrates why lax American gun laws make American lives cheap. The laws are an aberration.President Barack Obama described the shooting as \u201can act of terror and an act of hate.\u201d He made clear his disapproval of gun laws. He called for solidarity. He said nothing about ISIS, or the way the Islamic State\u2019s hold on territory in Syria and Iraq reinforces the charismatic potency of its ideological appeal, disseminated from that base through the internet.He also said this: \u201cTo actively do nothing is a decision as well.\u201dYes, to have actively done nothing in Syria over more than five years of war \u2014 so allowing part of the country to become an ISIS stronghold, contributing to a massive refugee crisis in Europe, acquiescing to slaughter and displacement on a devastating scale, undermining America\u2019s word in the world, and granting open season for President Vladimir Putin to strut his stuff \u2014 amounts to the greatest foreign policy failure of the Obama administration.It has made the world far more dangerous. I hope for the best but fear the victory of the politics of anger in America and Europe.An earlier version of this column included an Israeli journalist\u2019s tweet that quoted Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, as saying: \u201cIf I were Trump, I\u2019d emphasize the Muslim name, Omar Saddiqui Mateen. This changes race.\u201d In fact this was a paraphrase of Mr. Oren\u2019s comment. Translated from Hebrew, the comment was: \u201cIf I were Donald Trump I\u2019d come out the minute the F.B.I. decided to start leaking this morning that we are talking about a man who acted out of Islamic motives, with connections. First of all the name itself, Omar Siddiqui Mateen, a Muslim name, the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, who apparently was somehow in touch with extremist Islamic organizations.

{"Headline": "The Web\u2019s Creator Looks to Reinvent It", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt controls what people see, creates mechanisms for how people interact,\u201d he said of the modern day web. \u201cIt\u2019s been great, but spying, blocking sites, repurposing people\u2019s content, taking you to the wrong websites \u2014 that completely undermines the spirit of helping people create.\u201dSo on Tuesday, Mr. Berners-Lee gathered in San Francisco with other top computer scientists \u2014 including Brewster Kahle, head of the nonprofit Internet Archive and an internet activist \u2014 to discuss a new phase for the web.\u201cNational histories, the story of a country, now happen on the web,\u201d said Vinton G. Cerf, another founder of the internet and chief internet evangelist at Google, in a phone interview ahead of a speech to the group scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cPeople think making things digital means they\u2019ll last forever, but that isn\u2019t true now.\u201dThe project is in its early days, but the discussions \u2014 and caliber of the people involved \u2014 underscored how the World Wide Web\u2019s direction in recent years has stirred a deep anxiety among some technologists. The revelations by Edward J. Snowden that the web has been used by governments for spying and the realization that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have become gatekeepers to our digital lives have added to concerns.Efforts at creating greater amounts of privacy and accountability, by adding more encryption to various parts of the web and archiving all versions of a web page, also came up. Such efforts would make it harder to censor content.\u201cEdward Snowden showed we\u2019ve inadvertently built the world\u2019s largest surveillance network with the web,\u201d said Mr. Kahle, whose group organized the conference. \u201cChina can make it impossible for people there to read things, and just a few big service providers are the de facto organizers of your experience. We have the ability to change all that.\u201dMany people conflate the internet\u2019s online services and the web as one and the same \u2014 yet they are technically quite different. The internet is a networking infrastructure, where any two machines can communicate over a variety of paths, and one local network of computers can connect with other networks.The web, on the other hand, is a popular means to access that network of networks. But because of the way web pages are created, managed and named, the web is not fully decentralized. Take down a certain server and a certain web page becomes unavailable. Links to pages can corrode over time. Censorship systems like China\u2019s Great Firewall eliminate access to much information for most of its people. By looking at internet addresses, it is possible for governments and companies to get a good idea of who is reading which web pages.In some ways, the efforts to change the technology of creating the web are a kind of coming-of-age story. Mr. Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, as a tool for scientists. Today, the web still runs on technologies of the older world.Consider payments. In many cases, people pay for things online by entering credit card information, not much different from handing a card to a merchant for an imprint.At the session on Tuesday, computer scientists talked about how new payment technologies could increase individual control over money. For example, if people adapted the so-called ledger system by which digital currencies are used, a musician might potentially be able to sell records without intermediaries like Apple\u2019s iTunes. News sites might be able to have a system of micropayments for reading a single article, instead of counting on web ads for money.\u201cAd revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cPeople assume today\u2019s consumer has to make a deal with a marketing machine to get stuff for \u2018free,\u2019 even if they\u2019re horrified by what happens with their data. Imagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.\u201dTo make that work now, Mr. Kahle has to search and capture a page, then give it a brand new web address. With the right kind of distributed system, he said, \u201cthe archive can have all of the versions, because there would be a permanent record located across many sites.\u201dThe movement to change how the web is built, like a surprising number of technology discussions, has an almost religious dimension.Still, not all the major players agree on whether the web needs decentralizing.\u201cThe web is already decentralized,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cThe problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We don\u2019t have a technology problem, we have a social problem.\u201dOne that can, perhaps, be solved by more technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Challenges of Male Friendships", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Christopher Beemer, a 75-year-old Brooklynite, is impressed with how well his wife, Carol, maintains friendships with other women and wonders why this valuable benefit to health and longevity \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come so easily to men.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Beemer urged me to explore ways to promote male friendships, especially for retired men who often lose regular contact with colleagues who may have similar interests and experiences.After Marla Paul, a Chicago-area writer, wrote a book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Friendship Crisis: Finding, Making, and Keeping Friends When You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Not a Kid Anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d about establishing meaningful friendships with other women, she was inundated with requests from men to give equal treatment to male friendships.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of men were upset because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Paul told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey felt that making and keeping friends was a lot harder for men, that close friendships were not part of their culture. They pointed out that women have all kinds of clubs, that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more cultural support for friendships among women than there is for men.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn a study in the 1980s about the effect on marriage of child care arrangements, two Boston-area psychiatrists, Dr. Jacqueline Olds and Dr. Richard Stanton Schwartz, found that, \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost to a man, the men were so caught up in working, building their careers and being more involved with their children than their own fathers had been, something had to give,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what gave was connection with male friends. Their lives just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow time for friendships.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen these men are older and work no longer defines their social contacts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of rebuilding that has to be done\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they are to have meaningful friendships with other men, Dr. Schwartz said in an interview.From childhood on, Dr. Olds said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendships are more often based on mutual activities like sports and work rather than what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening to them psychologically. Women are taught to draw one another out; men are not.\u00e2\u0080\u009dConsciously or otherwise, many men believe that talking about personal matters with other men is not manly. The result is often less intimate, more casual friendships between men, making the connections more tenuous and harder to sustain.Dr. Olds said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a number of men in my practice who feel bad about having lost touch with old friends. Yet it turns out men are delighted when an old friend reaches out to revive the relationship. Men might need a stronger signal than women do to reconnect. It may not be enough to send an email to an old friend. It may be better to invite him to visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome married men consider their wives to be their best friend, and many depend on their wives to establish and maintain the couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social connections, which can all but disappear when a couple divorces or the wife dies.Differences between male and female friendships start at an early age. Observing how his four young granddaughters interact socially, Mr. Beemer said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have way more of that kind of activity than boys have. It may explain why as adults they continue to do a much better job of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn defense of his gender, he observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen have a harder time reaching their emotions and are less likely than women to reveal their emotional side. But when you have a real friendship, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done just that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe has found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to expose yourself and be honest about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. If you reveal yourself in the right way to the right person, it will be just fine. There are risks, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force it. Sometimes it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you get a don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-burden-me-with-that kind of response and you know to back off. But more often men will respond in kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Beemer has worked hard to establish and maintain valuable relationships with other men of a similar vintage. He joined a men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book group that meets monthly, and after about two years, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit became a group where the members really mean something to one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also in a men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walking group that meets three times a week and gathers after each walk to share more conversation and a snack at a local cafe. When one member of the group had a heart attack, they visited him, cheering him up with the latest gossip and a favorite cafe snack.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat sustains relationships over time is a regular rhythm of seeing each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to build a regular pattern of activities rather than having to make a special effort to see one another.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe recalls \u00e2\u0080\u009ccuring\u00e2\u0080\u009d a 70-year-old patient of his loneliness by encouraging him to join a bunch of guys who regularly dined and joked around at a neighborhood Panera Bread. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of cafes in the Boston area where small groups of older men get together for breakfast everyday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Schwartz said.Dr. Olds said of her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRichard has a regular group phone call with friends who live in different parts of the country. We program it into our schedule or it would disappear.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAmong other ways men can make new friends in their later years are participating in classes, activities, trips and meals at senior centers; taking continuing education courses at a local college; joining a gym or Y and taking classes with people you then see every week; volunteering at a local museum, hospital, school or animal shelter; attending worship services at a religious center; forming a group that plays cards or board games together; perhaps even getting a dog to walk in the neighborhood.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "A Poster Family for Diversity", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "A weekly essay exploring the complex connections of modern families.Clicking through the new website of the private school my three children attend, I landed on a close-up photo of my oldest child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smiling face. I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have felt jarred, but I did. The picture, accompanied by a short interview highlighting everything she loves about the school, had been posted on the admissions page. Born in India and adopted by my husband and me, who are white, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a minority student at a majority white school that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striving to become more diverse. Her interview was one of many, but for me, her mother, it generated a spotlight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heat.My older daughter is 14. Our son and younger daughter, siblings born in Ethiopia, are 13 and 12. When the children were small, strangers often mistook them for adorable, boisterous triplets. The kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 friendly smiles and our family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s multicultural makeup ensured that we attracted attention everywhere we went. More than once, professional photographers stopped us on the street to propose a photo shoot. Religious strangers felt compelled to thank my husband and me for \u00e2\u0080\u009cloving the Lord and loving orphans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shoppers in the grocery store flagged me down to gush, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour family is beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The idea of us made a lot of people feel good, hopeful even, but I quickly grasped that we could also be perceived by some as a kind of entertaining novelty. For years, another mom at our elementary school referred to me, in public and private, as \u00e2\u0080\u009cAngelina Jolie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I did my best to shield the kids, and myself, from the attention, so that our family could be just that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a family, not a symbol of post-racial equality or evidence of a supposed Hollywood trend, a trend some critics characterized as white celebrities adopting black babies as fashion accessories.By virtue of their white parents, transracial adoptees often move in majority white spaces, inadvertently providing diversity for others. Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always tried to place my kids in environments where they encounter peers and role models of the same race, they inevitably end up in the minority at school, at camps, in enrichment classes and on sports teams. Early on I noticed how schools and kids\u00e2\u0080\u0099 programs love to feature children of color in their marketing materials to highlight their commitment to diversity, just as the big corporations do. As much as I wanted pictures of my three to entice more minority children to join my children in their activities, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring myself to sign the blanket photo releases that came with every registration packet. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want my children being used to promote an ideal of diversity that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist in reality.But complications arose. Without my release, my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth-grade teacher couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t post group pictures to her classroom website, an inconvenience that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem fair to her. Then a photo of my daughter, taken without my knowledge at our town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Christmas parade, popped up in a catalog for the recreation department. A picture of all three kids appeared in a brochure for their favorite summer camp, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d specified no photos. Complaining after the fact felt petty and pointless when I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t identify any tangible harm done.And then there was the problem of my work as a writer. Frequently when I published a parenting essay, the editor would want to run a family photo. For years I resisted, putting myself at a distinct disadvantage in the world of mommy blogs and image-centric parenting websites. As the kids matured, I discussed the pros and cons of every photo request with the whole family. The kids voted to publish the photo every time, and sometimes I did. Although I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been careful to never include their real names in my work to guard their privacy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that using my children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos on occasion has helped my professional career, a reality I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m conflicted about, even if my kids are not.And so I gave up. These days I sign all the photo releases for schools and camps and teams because this is the way the world works. All I can do as a parent is maintain an ongoing dialogue with my children about the hidden messages in advertising, about the ways minorities are portrayed in the media, and about why I feel so protective of their likenesses.Sometimes, when I find a picture of my daughter playing bass guitar on the girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rock camp Facebook page or discover a video of my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deft footwork being tweeted by his soccer club, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thrilled. To see my kids promoted for what they do, not what they look like, feels good. Finding them featured in a camp catalog or a school brochure doing nothing but looking \u00e2\u0080\u009cethnic\u00e2\u0080\u009d alongside their white peers brings up less positive emotions. The photo and interview on the school admissions page felt like a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo nothing\u00e2\u0080\u009d at first, even though the school does a good job representing students of all backgrounds in its marketing as a whole.

(\u201cThey were like, \u2018Congratulations on the birth of your child,\u2019\u201d she said.)Mr. Countee and Ms. Wigfield soon discovered they had both grown up in close-knit families in New Jersey (she in Wayne, he in Watchung), making home movies with siblings and dreaming about careers in show business.\u201cThey talked for 20 minutes about what malls they went to growing up,\u201d said Mindy Kaling, the creator and star of \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d \u201cIn a way that I can only describe as shocking, and kind of unconscionable, how boring it was.\u201dFor Mr. Countee, it was riveting. \u201cI\u2019d never heard my brother talk about anyone or anything like that in his entire life,\u201d his brother Brendan said.\u201cWeirdly, now she won\u2019t return my phone calls,\u201d Mr. Burnett quipped.Ms. Wigfield moved to Los Angeles for Ms. Kaling\u2019s show, and she was homesick. Mr. Countee, who has an infectious smile and James Brown-caliber dance moves, \u201cfelt like home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d be sent off on writing tasks together and would just laugh until you cry.\u201dBut while Ms. Wigfield did not have a baby or a husband, she did have a boyfriend back in New York, whom she had dated since college. Mr. Countee\u2019s entreaties fell flat.\u201cHe kept inviting me to go to a farmers\u2019 market with him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Do people in L.A. just do that? Walk around and get their vegetables together?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t really on my radar.\u201dFor Mr. Countee, 35, who had been rejected from NBC\u2019s page program three times, finding gigs in Hollywood had meant no time for a serious relationship. \u201cI was getting comfortable with the idea that maybe I could be the cool uncle for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cBring a different chick home to Thanksgiving every year.\u201dBut his co-worker stood out. \u201cI probably laughed a little too loud at all her jokes, and was a little too stung when she didn\u2019t laugh loud enough at mine,\u201d he said.(Told this, Ms. Wigfield laughed. \u201cHe likes to paint this picture: \u2018I never loved another woman until I met you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe did fine!

Sensing his final chance, Mr. Countee asked Ms. Wigfield to what she thought was a casual dinner.Afterward, he confessed his feelings in a clumsy soliloquy \u2014 at one point, he dropped his ChapStick on the sidewalk and chased after it \u2014 that was delivered through the passenger-side window of her car. \u201cI think I\u2019m crazy about you,\u201d he said.Ms. Wigfield listened in what she described as a state of mounting horror.\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, God, this cannot be,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got to shut this down.\u2019\u201d Mr. Countee wincingly recalled her exact response: \u201cOh. O.K.\u201dHe went home, she flew east. They did not speak for three months. \u201cI would have been more angry at myself for not saying anything,\u201d he remembered thinking.Ms. Wigfield\u2019s relationship soon ended. But when she decided to return to Los Angeles that summer, she and Mr. Countee, their last conversation still lingering, kept their distance.\u201cI just needed some space,\u201d she said. \u201cI had been in a long relationship. I very much wanted to be single, just single for a while.\u201d And Mr. Countee\u2019s earnestness left her feeling \u201cvery scared to reconnect.\u201d\u201cHe was so sure about it, almost in a way that made me kind of nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do you know this? That we\u2019re the one for each other? Is this guy crazy? Why is he this confident?\u201dWhen Ms. Wigfield and her sister, Ashley, moved into a new Los Angeles apartment around Labor Day, she invited Mr. Countee to a housewarming. He texted: \u201cDo you feel like our friendship hiatus can be called off?\u201dThey resumed being friends, though she continued to see other people. Still, she said, on those dates, \u201cin the back of my mind, I was like, \u2018Nobody\u2019s as fun as him.\u2019\u201dMr. Countee, meanwhile, was working an inside source: Ashley. At a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of the actor Ike Barinholtz, she advised him to be patient but persistent. \u201cThis was the first time I had really been invested in trying to build a serious relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to flail on the gas too hard.\u201dEncouraged, he sent Tracey an e-vite for a formal date, which she found charming. \u201cO.K., you\u2019re being stupid,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cYou should go out with him. This is a fool\u2019s errand to try to find something else.\u201dThey began spending more time together, and Mr. Countee visited the Wigfield homestead in New Jersey over Christmas. Ms. Wigfield\u2019s best friend, Lang Fisher, sensed a change. \u201cI know you\u2019re in love with this guy, and you should be with him,\u201d she told her.Finally, Mr. Countee heard what he had been waiting for. \u201cTracey was hilariously perfunctory about it,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018So do you want to just date only each other or what?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u2019\u201d\u201cI just started feeling like I don\u2019t ever want to not be with him,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sort of brash and confident and loud and quick to judgment, and he softens my edges a little bit. He does so much to make me a kinder, better person.\u201dTheir professional collaboration had helped, too. \u201cBeing in a writers\u2019 room is essentially just sitting around a table with 10 other people telling personal stories and eating all your meals together,\u201d Ms. Wigfield said. By the time they started dating, she already knew that he secretly traced Disney characters into his teenage years.In March 2015, Mr. Countee invited her to a Santa Monica hotel suite, which he had decorated with rose petals and votive candles. \u201cShe was three and a half hours late,\u201d he said. \u201cI was sitting in the dark while the candles burned down to the wicks.\u201dUnaware of his plot, she had decided to try a far-flung Mexican restaurant. When she finally arrived, he proposed. Their siblings were waiting downstairs. \u201cHe knew I\u2019d want my sister to be there,\u201d she said.On May 21, beneath the soaring apse of the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in Manhattan, they were married in a formal Roman Catholic ceremony before 244 guests. Ms. Wigfield\u2019s childhood pastor, the Rev. Kevin Downey, led the service.The bride wore a cascading white Anna Maier dress, with a chapel-length veil that stretched nearly seven feet. The groom wore a black Ralph Lauren tuxedo with patent-leather shoes. Neither could stop smiling.Afterward, Ms. Wigfield switched her formal shoes for a pair of red Chuck Taylor sneakers. Guests made their way across town to Cipriani 42nd Street, where they found cherry blossom centerpieces and a rollicking rhythm-and-blues band.Mr. Countee moonwalked into the reception hall and immediately began to break-dance. He had swapped his tuxedo jacket for a sparkling gold blazer, a wedding gift from the bride (no Glitterator, though).By midnight, Ms. Fey had danced on a chair, cheering along to a gospel number, and the groom was declaring the celebration \u201cthe best night of my life.\u201dMr. Countee, who writes for \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and is developing a project for HBO, helped with the pilot. \u201cIt\u2019s such a blessing to have a smart, funny writer living in your house,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flip side is when you\u2019ve had a long day at work and just want to hide in the dark and watch an episode of \u2018Fargo\u2019 and your partner keeps yelling from the other room, \u2018Is there a funny thing where a character falls in a toilet?\u2019\u201dMs. Kaling, in her toast at the rehearsal dinner, took credit for bringing the couple to the same writers\u2019 table.\u201cThough it would have been nice,\u201d Ms. Kaling said, smiling, \u201cif people were actually focusing on working and making the show better, instead of falling in love with each other.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thai Officials Find 40 Dead Cubs in Freezer at Tiger Temple", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 The Thai wildlife authorities found 40 dead tiger cubs in a freezer on Wednesday at the Tiger Temple, a controversial tourist attraction in western Thailand, and were investigating whether the carcasses were evidence of the temple\u2019s involvement in the illegal wildlife trade.Wildlife officials said that only one of the dead cubs found on Wednesday had been reported to the government as required by law and that the police were investigating.Representatives of the temple, Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua, said that Thailand\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Office had been notified of all of the cubs\u2019 births and deaths and that the bodies were kept as proof that none of them were sold on the black market.\u201cWe have declared all the deaths to the officials over years,\u201d said Supitpong Pakdjarung, a former police colonel who runs the temple\u2019s business operation. \u201cThey\u2019ve known about these carcasses for a long time.\u201dThe wildlife agency has been trying for months to shut down the Tiger Temple\u2019s zoo. The temple has promoted itself as a spiritual center where people and tigers lived in harmony, and it has charged tourists as much as $140 apiece for the chance to bathe, hand-feed and play with the tigers.The temple was already under investigation on suspicion of illegally trading in tigers after a former veterinarian reported that three live adult tigers had vanished.Adisorn Noochdumrong, deputy director general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, which oversees the Wildlife Conservation Office, said a temple staff member had told the authorities about the dead cubs in the freezer.\u201cWe just found them this morning,\u201d Mr. Adisorn said. \u201cThere are 40 tiger cubs.\u201dHe said the department would perform DNA tests on the seized tigers and the dead cubs to see how they might be related.Temple officials, however, denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Supitpong said he notified officials in December when they came to see how many tigers were at the temple.Teunchai Noochdumrong, director of Thailand\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Office and the wife of Mr. Adisorn, said the cubs did not appear to be missing any parts. There was no indication yet how they died, she said.Debbie Banks, campaign leader on tigers and wildlife crime for the London-based Environmental Investigative Agency, said the discovery of the cubs was disturbing given the underground market in frozen cubs.While adult tigers have more value, particularly for their pelts, teeth and claws, the cubs can be sold for their meat and for their bones, which are said to have medicinal value, she said.Tiger cubs also are sold in large jars of wine, either on their own or with bear paws, snakes and scorpions, she said. Some people believe such \u201cwildlife wine\u201d provides a health benefit, she said.Zoos that offer tourists close contact with the animals and selfie opportunities are often fronts for breeding operations that supply the black market trade, Ms. Banks said.\u201cForty frozen tiger cubs?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy would you keep them? When we know there is a market for frozen tiger cubs, it raises a lot of issues. I think it suggests something far more sinister.\u201dAt its peak, the temple reported having 148 tigers, nearly all of them adults. The wildlife agency seized 10 of the big cats earlier this year before the temple won a court order halting the operation. After the authorities successfully challenged that order, they resumed removing the animals on Monday.By Wednesday evening, rangers had taken 64 more tigers, Ms. Teunchai said. The authorities estimated that 73 tigers remained at the zoo and hoped to have all of them removed by Saturday. They said that the temple lacked documentation proving ownership of the tigers and that therefore, under Thai endangered species law, they belonged to the government.By Wednesday, Mr. Supitpong appeared resigned to the tigers\u2019 removal and the closure of the temple\u2019s tourist attraction. The temple recently won approval to build and operate a zoo on a nearby site, and Mr. Supitpong said he was ready to move forward with that plan.\u201cRight now, we want everything to come to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease hurry and remove all the tigers. Once the state tigers are all removed, we will proceed with the zoo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of adult tigers taken from the temple by Wednesday evening and the number estimated to remain. Government rangers removed 64 tigers, not 100, and about 73 remained, not less than 40.Poypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.slide showAdvertisement"}

Last year, Yellowstone reported a record four million visitors and is likely to meet or exceed that number this year, she said.\u201cThe rules in the park aren\u2019t just arbitrary,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cThey\u2019re really here to protect people who are visiting the park and the things that they\u2019re here to see.\u201dVisitors can walk more than two miles of trails and boardwalks that snake through the basin, bringing them close to geysers, steam vents and acidic water. Some boardwalks over Yellowstone hot springs do not have guardrails, and more visitors have died in them than in any other natural feature.Since 1890, there have been 22 fatalities involving thermal waters in Yellowstone, Ms. Reid said.

The television was still on. Purses and cellphones were strewn about the floor. And there were bodies everywhere.\u201cWhat you saw was drinks that were just served. You saw bills that were about to be paid. You saw half-eaten food,\u201d said Dr. Stephany, 41, who was called into duty hours after Omar Mateen barged into the popular gay nightclub and opened fire. Forty-nine people were killed in the attack. \u201cTime just stopped.\u201dAlthough he had been filling in for about a year, Dr. Stephany was officially made Orange County\u2019s chief medical examiner two days after the slaughter at Pulse. On his first real day on the job, his office completed 18 autopsies. He said he performed at least seven of the 49 autopsies. The exact number he is not certain of. He lost count.He and his four colleagues, aided by two state pathologists called in from elsewhere in Florida, have now conducted autopsies on all 49 victims as well as the assailant. Out of respect for those who were killed, Mr. Mateen\u2019s corpse is being held in a different part of the morgue, in an area typically used for decomposing bodies.Determining the cause of death was routine in this case, as all of the victims had bullet wound after bullet wound.\u201cSo you kind of take a typical homicide scene, multiply it by 50, even that just won\u2019t prepare you for what you see,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find anybody more experienced than medical examiners to go to that type of events, but to see the sheer number of decedent is almost surreal.\u201dThe pathologists put aside their emotions, he said, as they sought to identify everyone.The technicians photographed, X-rayed and fingerprinted the bodies to confirm their identities. They inspected tattoos. They washed blood off the victims\u2019 faces so they could be compared to photographs from their driver\u2019s licenses and Facebook profiles.The identity of one victim frustrated the team for dozens of hours, until Dr. Stephany realized that a wallet he had picked up off the ground at the club as evidence contained the person\u2019s name.In autopsy after autopsy, the doctors documented every wound and plucked every bullet, noting where it entered and the direction it traveled.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear anyone suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone went down where they were.

{"Headline": "China Wins New Bragging Rights in Supercomputers", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers provides more evidence that the once-yawning technology gap between the United States and China is closing.Also for the first time, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer uses Chinese-made microprocessor chips instead of chips from Silicon Valley\u2019s Intel.Supercomputers are viewed in scientific circles as an indicator of national technology leadership, and they are vital for research in areas ranging from the development of new weapons and medicines, to the design of cars and consumer products. American computing experts and business executives have warned for years that leadership in supercomputing is vital to a range of national interests.\u201cToday even consumer detergent bottles are designed with supercomputers,\u201d said Eric D. Isaacs, a physicist and provost of the University of Chicago. \u201cThe Chinese are getting good at building these computers, and it\u2019s a competitive issue now for U.S. industry and national security.\u201dThe United States primacy on the Top500 list has slipped for a number of reasons. Government support for supercomputing has been slowed by long-running debates on the level of federal spending on basic scientific research, as well as opposition to funding for industrial innovation that is not directly related to national security.In the private sector, companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon invested billions of dollars in cloud-computing centers that don\u2019t focus as much on solving scientific problems.And last year, the United States blocked the sale of a number of advanced microprocessors to China over concerns they were being used in nuclear weapon development, which most likely accelerated the development of China\u2019s own technology, said Jack Dongarra, a University of Tennessee computer scientist who helped create the list of the world\u2019s fastest computers in 1993.The Top500 list is maintained by Dr. Dongarra and Erich Strohmaier, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Individual computing centers report descriptions and performance to them twice a year.In 2001, there were no Chinese supercomputers on the Top500. Now, China has 167 systems on the list compared to 165 from the United States. China also leads a more obscure category \u2014 total processing power, or the combined computing speeds of all of its supercomputers on the list.The fastest machine, the Sunway TaihuLight System, was installed this year at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, in China\u2019s Jiangsu province.Despite those achievements, Intel still provided the chips for 91 percent of the machines on the list. And China is still catching up with the United States in state-of-the-art technologies, like software and the networking that links the thousands of chips in a modern supercomputer.But that could soon change. Officials at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the Chinese government has an ambitious $150 billion program to acquire as well as develop new technologies in various kinds of chips.After years of neglect, the United States does appear to be taking the competitive threat seriously, said John Neuffer, president of the S.I.A. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to double down on supercomputing and get ourselves back on track,\u201d he said.While the Chinese have perfected the manufacture of traditional supercomputers pioneered by American companies like IBM and Cray, the United States may focus on new, more efficient supercomputers that might lead to machines intended for challenges like artificial intelligence, according to Larry Smarr, a physicist who directs the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.One of the design challenges of the fastest computers is their vast power consumption. The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer in China, which could fill a large warehouse, requires the same electric power needed to run roughly 15,000 homes. An exascale supercomputer will very likely require more than twice that amount of power, or roughly the amount of power produced by the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, the largest producer of solar power in the United States.At the same time, even if the United States is able to design an exascale computer within the next decade, the Chinese could get there first. According to Dr. Dongarra, the Chinese government is committed to reaching the exascale goal by the end of this decade.Because of funding shortages and technology challenges, \u201cthere has been a delay in getting the exascale launched in the U.S., and as a result, we\u2019re further behind than we should be,\u201d he said.The Sunway supercomputer in Wuxi is a marvel of Chinese manufacturing prowess, Dr. Dongorra noted. The computer is based on 10.6 million processor \u201ccores\u201d spread across 40,960 microprocessors that work together. The chips are relatively slow individually \u2014 about the speed of the processor in Apple\u2019s iPhone 6.The Sunway machine does have its shortcomings. It has older memory-chip technology, meaning it is limited in the speed with which it can move data in and out of each processor when compared with the most powerful American supercomputers. And the new Chinese supercomputer is still based on American-made optical network technology that is used to connect the thousands of microprocessor chips.Despite the fact that the Chinese now have the most supercomputers on the list, the United States still dominates the top 20, with 10 machines. There are now 105 supercomputers in Europe. Japan has 29 systems on the list, down from 37 systems in November.Several American scientists compared what is going on now to the 1980s, when they worried that the nation was losing ground to Japanese supercomputers.\u201cScientists might be saying, \u2018I have to go to China to run my computations,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Smarr.Advertisement"}

Even now, I just stared at the previous sentence for 30 minutes. My dad, Clarence John Williams Jr. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 C.J. to the rest of the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was truly a unique cat. When I tell stories about him, many of my friends squint in disbelief, with a look that says, \u201cCome on, dude!\u201d When I was a baby, he went to the main Philadelphia Library and placed 100 children\u2019s books upon one of those old wood tables. He noted the names of all the main characters. During the late 1960s, according to his informal experiment, \u201cBilly\u201d was the most common name. So my pops figured if I saw my name a lot while I was learning to read, I would love to read. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how he chose my nickname. Who does that? My father, C.J., that\u2019s who. I have had several names, and if I\u2019m honest I have been many people. But my extended family and the Philadelphia communities I grew up in still call me \u00e2\u0080\u009cBilly.\u201d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m O.K. with my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. My pops did it right through most of life, and defiantly went against the norm how he died. He was told he had liver and pancreatic cancer in September of 2004. He refused treatment. He died 30 days later.Of course, I miss him. But nothing was left unsaid before his final walk. We had been saying it all through my entire life. He was my best friend, my most vocal cheerleader, the smartest person I ever met, an honest moral guide and true example.My dad was the baseball coach, the Scout leader, the father to many: basically, the black man who is ignored, looked over and left out of so many national conversations today.Finding out that my father was at the end of his life changed mine. And it did so \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hard to believe sometimes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the better. My father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parting gift to me was the blessing of knowing the importance of love: love of family, love of my people, love for the struggle, love for the blessing of passion, love for words, love for education, love for being kind, love for giving, love for a personal understanding of God and love for my calling as a photojournalist. And, surprisingly, a love for being an educator. He was a career teacher.My father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death pushed me to be the man I must be. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working as a photojournalist when his diagnosis was made. I was either off to Ghana to try to freelance on my own, or saying I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get out of the business altogether and head to Kennebunkport, Me., to build sailboats.  Perhaps I was so devastated from my dealings with corporate American journalism that I was truly crazy. I was a broken man. By becoming my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caretaker, fulfilling his final wishes while documenting through the tears, vomit and blood, I began to heal. I began to become whole. When my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death was imminent, his requests were simple. He wanted his son to take care of him. He wanted to die in New Orleans, a place he called home though his mother sent him up North at age 12 hoping he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find a better life. C.J. did not want to be embalmed. The oldest of 15 siblings, he wanted his younger brothers to bury him: Joe to perform his service, Sid and Chester to build his coffin. We embarked on a road trip to make this happen, with me at the wheel. We all completed our missions.  Now, I have so much work to do, so many stories to tell, so much love to give. But that new phase started with C.J. leaving this earth."}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Campaign Showed How to Turn Viral Moments Into Money", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a serendipitous moment during an otherwise uneventful Bernie Sanders campaign rally in Portland, Ore.: A small bird landed on Mr. Sanders\u2019s lectern mid-speech and locked eyes with him before flying away to applause from an appreciative crowd.As Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters posted photos and videos of the amusing interruption to their social networks, his small digital team sprang into action. They edited the video and pushed it out on Twitter to more than two million followers. They created animated graphics of Mr. Sanders and his new friend, \u201cBirdie,\u201d depicted with a scraggly white coif of hair to match the candidate\u2019s. They sent emails and created Facebook ads asking supporters to donate in exchange for stickers and images of \u201cBirdie.\u201dIn doing so, they turned a viral moment into a small-dollar fund-raising windfall: The Sanders campaign raised $3.6 million in just a few days, all of it from online donations. It was illustrative of the approach the campaign took throughout the Democratic presidential primary, during which it raised roughly $216 million of its nearly $230 million total online.But the campaign was also able to harness social media networks \u2014 which, until recently, most candidates had used primarily for messaging purposes \u2014 and turn them into fund-raising engines, allowing Mr. Sanders\u2019s team to raise money almost exclusively online.\u201cIn those early days, when he had just launched and he was still a novel concept, we were bombarding liberals on social media, people who we thought would like his message, and it was just going gangbusters,\u201d said Keegan Goudiss, the campaign\u2019s director of digital advertising and a partner at Revolution Messaging.Mr. Goudiss said that early on, more than 40 percent of the money being raised was driven by digital ads. And unlike most campaigns he had worked on, where converting supporters into donors was a prolonged process, he said, \u201cwith Bernie, especially early on, people were signing the petition and giving right away.\u201dThe initial success allowed the Sanders campaign to invest much more heavily in its online fund-raising operation and eschew traditional donor events. His team held just nine in-person fund-raisers during the entire campaign and did not have a single staff member dedicated to in-person fund-raising.Though digital advertising costs much less than broadcast, it still requires a significant investment. The campaign spent $15 million on these efforts and had a digital budget of more than $30 million.\u201cTheir campaign spent substantially more building and maintaining a community of online donors,\u201d said Matt Lira, a digital strategist who has worked with Republican candidates. \u201cAs with both Obama and Romney in 2012, this community will echo long past their campaign, creating an advantage for candidates they support.\u201dThe decision to invest heavily, and eventually almost exclusively, in digital advertising was made very early in the campaign.\u201cThe room was silent,\u201d Mr. Goudiss recalled, but Mr. Sanders and his closest advisers recognized the immediate impact. \u201cWe left that meeting with a commitment of $250,000 and a promise for more if we could prove the value of the ads we were placing,\u201d Mr. Goudiss said.They would not have to wait long: Millions of dollars began to flow steadily through the apparatus of the fledgling campaign, propelling Mr. Sanders from a fringe candidate to a cash-rich populist powerhouse who would win 22 primaries and caucuses.The campaign learned early on that digital platforms and social networks were where his supporters could be reached. Mr. Sanders\u2019s digital team made ads for Snapchat, the video messaging service, and tailored their emails and donation pages to a mobile-first audience, efforts that paid off: 43 percent of donations were made from mobile devices.The reach of Mr. Sanders\u2019s online ads also allowed his team to wait before releasing more expensive broadcast ads. In July 2015, for example, a promoted ad on Facebook that focused on health care quickly received 46,000 likes, significantly higher than the normal reach of a post. Ads like this kept the campaign afloat and climbing in the polls for the first six months, and Mr. Sanders did not run a television ad until November.Though the campaign put significant resources behind its online advertising and social media outreach, its email program was still the king in terms of fund-raising, accounting for more than $114 million in donations.\u201cWe scrapped the draft we had, even though there were 200,000 that already got the initial email mid-debate,\u201d said Michael Whitney, a senior strategist at Revolution Messaging who serves as digital fund-raising manager for the Sanders campaign. \u201cWe were out with a new email within 15 to 20 minutes.\u201d The campaign raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after that debate.The Sanders team was not alone in its ability to capture moments and turn them into money; the Clinton campaign turned Donald J. Trump\u2019s accusation that Mrs. Clinton was playing the \u201cwoman card\u201d into millions of dollars, for example.The online successes point to a new reality for digital campaigning, one that future candidates can expect to build on.\u201cThe bird thing, it\u2019s like, you have this envy of the technology available and their prowess and the moment,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who ran Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign. \u201cIf that had happened in 2004, there is not a damn thing we could have done. Now, you have the prowess to take advantage of it and the network that they built on, and you can do amazing things with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bob Kerrey\u2019s War Record Fuels Debate in Vietnam on His Role at New University", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 The appointment of former Senator Bob Kerrey to lead a new American-backed university in Vietnam has set off a sharp debate among Vietnamese over whether he should be disqualified because of his part in killing women and children as a Navy SEAL during the Vietnam War.\u201cWhile the Vietnamese are willing to let bygones be bygones,\u201d Ton Nu Thi Ninh, Vietnam\u2019s former ambassador to the European Union, said by email, \u201cthe decision to appoint Bob Kerrey to be chairman of the board of the first American-style university in Vietnam strikes me as insensitive to the Vietnamese at best, and taking us for granted at worst.\u201d\u201cIt was not a military victory,\u201d Mr. Kerrey acknowledged in speech then. \u201cIt was a tragedy, and I had ordered it.\u201d\u201cI have been haunted by it for 32 years,\u201d he said.The discussion of Mr. Kerrey\u2019s war history \u2014 which has bubbled up in posts on Facebook and in articles at online news portals \u2014 threatens to reopen old wounds from what is known in Vietnam as the American War. About three million people died in the war, including more than 58,000 Americans.\u201cI cannot look at his face,\u201d Pham Thuy Huong, 40, of Hanoi, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAll the gruesome details of that genocide are still there.\u201dBut since the war ended in 1975, the Vietnamese government and many Vietnamese have adopted an attitude of forgiveness, and that view was also widely represented.\u201cIt is easy to hate Bob Kerrey and ask him to resign as the head of the board of Fulbright University Vietnam,\u201d Luong Hoai Nam, an aviation businessman, wrote in a column in the online newspaper VnExpress. \u201cI can do that. But after a half-day of thinking, I decided on the harder choice. That is to forgive. I forgive Bob Kerrey, and I want many Vietnamese also to forgive him.\u201dResponding to questions by email, Mr. Kerrey said that he would resign if he felt his role was jeopardizing the American-Vietnamese joint education venture.\u201cIf I have cause to believe that remaining chairman puts this project at risk, I will step down,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to admire the Vietnamese people greatly and intend to continue doing all I can to help them.\u201dHe said he had been involved since 1991 in establishing the university, including helping win congressional financing while in the Senate. He said his primary role as board chairman would be helping the university raise money.The university aims to accept its first students in the fall of 2017.Mr. Kerrey was a gung-ho Navy SEAL lieutenant when he led his squad, known as Kerrey\u2019s Raiders, into Thanh Phong on Feb. 25, 1969. Their mission was to hunt down a Viet Cong leader believed to be operating in the village.The squad members first encountered a hut they had not expected. To avoid giving away their position, they used knives to kill five people, witnesses said, slitting the throats of an elderly couple and stabbing their three grandchildren.Although Mr. Kerrey has taken responsibility for ordering the killings as squad leader, he has said he did not participate in them. However two other members of his unit say Mr. Kerrey helped kill the grandfather, later identified as Bui Van Vat, 65.When they reached the main part of the village, they encountered women and children. According to Mr. Kerrey\u2019s account, someone fired on the squad and the commandos returned fire, killing the civilians in the darkness and confusion.\u201cThe baby was the last one alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were blood and guts splattering everywhere.\u201dMr. Kerrey was later wounded on another mission and lost part of a leg. He and his raiders were never held to account for the killings.Mr. Kerrey served as Nebraska\u2019s governor and senator, ran for president in 1992, and retired from elective office in 2000. He served as president of the New School, a university in New York City, from 2001 to 2010.Bao Anh Thai, a lawyer in Ho Chi Minh City, said that leading a university was not the proper place for a man with Mr. Kerrey\u2019s war record.\u201cPlease tell me the name of any prestigious university in this world, where a killer in cold blood of women and children \u2014 he admitted it and he is not charged for it \u2014 could be the president,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\u201cIt is not about the Vietnam War, it is not about reconciliation between the two countries, it is a common sense of education. Would you send your children to a university like that?\u201dNguyen Duc Hien, a journalist at a legal newspaper in Ho Chi Minh City, noted that Mr. Kerrey kept quiet about the atrocities for more than 30 years and only spoke publicly about them when journalists forced his hand.\u201cAfter killing and lying, he should not represent knowledge and contributing the values of America in Vietnam!\u201d Mr. Hien wrote on Facebook.\u201cI welcome Fulbright, but America has no shortage of people to choose as a representative for America.\u201dOthers were more willing to let Mr. Kerrey atone for his actions by helping the country.\u201cGive him a chance to correct his mistake by doing something useful for the Vietnamese people with his new job,\u201d said Thao Dan, a literature teacher in Haiphong.But Nguyen Van Tho, a writer and a veteran of the war, said there was a difference between forgiving and forgetting.\u201cIf I had a chance to meet Bob Kerrey, I would still welcome him,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cI want to forgive and forget all the pain of war. People can forgive soldier Bob Kerrey but people are not allowed to forget all the killing of innocent civilians. That is a crime the world should condemn forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: That Business of Microsoft Buying LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byBitsAnd, really, in most cases, a good rule of thumb for internet users is: If it\u2019s bad for AT&T and Verizon, it\u2019s probably good for you.Here\u2019s my best guess: Microsoft is buying a social graph. That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.To my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)So what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.Is all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.There are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.For instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)Granted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.Oh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn?

I remember crying with joy in 1989 when the Berlin wall came down.But now I look at my 16-year-old son, and wonder if he will experience more than a half century of such peace.And I am angry with David Cameron for inadvertently fostering the hate that was such a prominent part of the campaign and bodes so badly for the future.Racism was always key to the British feelings of superiority that lay behind this campaign, just as it is to the American equivalent championed by Trump.And the kind of bullying both campaigns fosters is a major threat to world peace.\u2014 Kate in DublinI love Europe and I look forward to negotiating new fresh agreements that fit our interests and aspirations.I also immediately felt stronger and safer knowing that democracy and power have been restored to my elected govt.\u2014 Akila Deram in London, writing on The Times\u2019s Facebook Page.It\u2019s the ability of being at home in Paris as well as Berlin and Madrid, it is the feeling of being part of something greater than yourself.And this, this feels like a breakup: the bitterness, the misunderstandings, the whys, the feeling of being unwelcomed, unwanted, unsafe.It is both personal and emotional.England has lost so much more than just money and trade with this vote. What they failed to understand is that history does not go back if you stomp your feet and blame someone else.Illegal is illegal, and the rule of law prevails.When you break the law by entering the United States illegally, you do not deserve to be rewarded with a free pass to stay here, much less a straight line path to citizenship.My grandparents came here from Russia.

They were white. Very white. Translucent white. And being from England, they were English speaking.Read the history of U.S. immigration laws sometime. They\u2019re slapdash, arbitrary, and capricious products of racism and jingoism.Are you really sure that you\u2019re here legitimately?

Raises $150 Million", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byTwilio, which makes software that helps companies such as Uber and Nordstrom communicate with their customers, raised $150 million in an initial public offering that priced late Wednesday, the largest within the technology sector so far this year.The move is perhaps a brave one, given that the market has not been very receptive to new tech I.P.O.s. Only three have debuted so far in 2016. Additionally, Twilio\u2019s first day of trading coincides with Britain\u2019s vote to stay or leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit, which could roil the markets.Twilio\u2019s new investors did not seem too fazed. The company said on Wednesday that it sold 10 million shares for $15 apiece, which was above the $12 to $14 range it had been marketing to investors. The I.P.O. price yields a market valuation of $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.1 billion valuation Twilio received in a private funding round a year ago.Twilio, based in San Francisco, is being hailed as a trailblazer compared with the almost 170 unicorns \u2014 or companies with valuations above $1 billion \u2014 that have opted to stay private for now. Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software company\u2019s finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets become more uncertain, investors have preferred companies doing I.P.O.s to turn a profit.Twilio generated $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.Bessemer Venture Partners first backed Twilio in 2009 and is its largest shareholder, owning about 25 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Fidelity Investments and Union Square Ventures also hold significant stakes. These entities as well as select executives hold 98.6 percent of the voting power after the I.P.O., because of their ownership of supervoting stock.Jeff Lawson, 38, founded the company eight years ago and currently serves as its chief executive. Before Twilio, he started Nine Star, a retailer of equipment and apparel for the skate, ski, surf and BMX sports crowd.

Now, a federal court has ruled, it is an essential part of American life.But of what kind?That means Netflix, Google and your neighbor\u2019s gardening blog all get treated the same, in terms of how fast they make it to a customer\u2019s device. And the company sending high-definition films, which use a lot of bits, can\u2019t be charged more or discriminated against by the service providers.It is clear that the Netflixes of the world, and probably most consumers, like this decision, since it means there aren\u2019t impediments on what can be shipped and seen.Equally clear is that the service providers are not happy, since this means they can\u2019t control their biggest users, whose increasingly heavy usage can force them to make expensive upgrades.Count on an appeal, and most likely a final decision by the Supreme Court, because the concept of net neutrality touches on key philosophical and pragmatic aspects of modern life.Is fast internet service now essential, since we need it to get a job or find out when the movie is on? Is broadband so essential that companies providing it must be regulated by the F.C.C. in how they treat customers?What sort of essential commodity is the delivery of bits \u2014 is it like electricity, which is often priced against periods of peak usage? Is it like water, which must be provided at all times, but has different costs around the country based on difficulty of delivery? Is it something new?On the other side, shouldn\u2019t a company developing a new product have to consider how many bits it will be using, or other constraints it is putting on a system counted on by millions of people? When companies build a network for one purpose, and the network is overwhelmed by a new digital product that uses more bandwidth, should the old pricing rules apply?The last is not an idle question. Just as high-definition video challenges a network used to, say, text-based email, the online gaming and virtual reality systems planned by the likes of Microsoft and Facebook will likely tax most existing service providers\u2019 systems.Advertisement"}

Rest in Power. Rest in Joy. #SayTheirNames. I want to invoke words that will help us all heal the damage from generations of violence. But those words are so rarely found on the page. Most often the words we need well up within our bodies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and still we know that it will take more than words to set us free. Each of us is tending to different wounds, and each day gives us new cuts, and historical erasure is also a violence against our stories of resistance and pride. While I seek my own sources of healing, I send love and honor to my queer and trans sisters of color who bear disproportionate violence, as they have for centuries. Seven years ago in Brooklyn, I stumbled into Sugarland, a smoky hideout of the radical queer underground. I spent the next year creeping along the moonlit edges of our parties and fire escapes, detaching from tender moments so I could capture them forever and visibly honor the beloved community we built by practicing radical love. My people are the wild unicorns and glitterponies of the night, the drag queens and go-go princes, hard femmes and faeries, sex workers and hustlers, trans and cis and nowhere in between. An extended chosen family of soul twins and lovers, star lighters and fire starters; our bonds cemented with birthday cake frosting, lube and eyelash glue.

{"Headline": "Afghanistan and Pakistan Exchange Heavy Gunfire Along Border", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byPESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistani and Afghan forces exchanged heavy gunfire on Sunday and Monday in an unusually serious escalation of tensions at the border, leaving at least 13 people wounded on the Pakistani side and killing at least one Afghan police officer, according to the police and military officials in both countries.The fighting, which began on Sunday night and resumed Monday, forced the closing of the Torkham border crossing, the busiest between the two countries.The escalation followed the closing of the Torkham crossing last month after Afghan border security guards objected to the construction of a gate on the Pakistani side. That objection also apparently contributed to the conflict on Sunday, according to official accounts from both sides.The border remained closed for five days last month but was reopened after a meeting between the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal, and Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif.An official statement by the Pakistan Army late on Sunday accused the Afghan border guards of resorting to an unprovoked attack when work began on the installation of a gate on the Pakistani side.\u201cTorkham is the most frequented crossing point at Pak-Afghan border, and recently even, most of the terrorists have been found using this gate for entry,\u201d the brief statement said. \u201cIn order to check movement of terrorists through Torkham, Pakistan is constructing a gate on own side of the border as a necessity to check unwanted and illegal movement.\u201dThe Pakistani Army statement said that one Pakistani soldier had been wounded but that \u201csecurity forces responded to Afghan firing effectively.\u201dA senior civil officer of the Khyber tribal region of Pakistan, the site of the Torkham crossing, claimed that the Afghans had fired mortars, rockets and artillery into Pakistani territory starting at 9:20 p.m. Sunday.\u201cShortly before beginning the construction work, we duly informed the Afghan side, although we are under no obligation to do so under international law,\u201d the top civilian administrator in Khyber, Khalid Mehmood, said by telephone from the area.\u201cThe Afghan commander went back, switched off the lights on the other side and, before we could figure out what had happened, they started shelling and firing in our direction,\u201d Mr. Mehmood said.A mortar shell hit a house in a nearby Pakistani village, wounding six civilians, the administrator said. Two more civilians were hit by splinters and two paramilitary soldiers were also wounded in the exchange of fire, he added.After a lull of several hours on Monday, fighting resumed in the late afternoon. Zarawar Zahid, the police chief of Nangarhar Province, on the Afghan side of the crossing, posted a video on Facebook saying that he was near the front line and ordering a mortar barrage against Pakistan.He appears next to two mortars shouting to his men, \u201cStrike hard enough to blow up Nawaz Sharif\u2019s home,\u201d referring to the prime minister of Pakistan who lives in Islamabad, the capital, 150 miles from the border.When fighting resumed Monday afternoon, both sides began firing with heavy weapons, and Pakistani authorities reported that two paramilitary soldiers were wounded. \u201cThere is a heavy exchange of fire,\u201d Mr. Mehmood said by phone from the area. He said the firing resumed from the Afghan side when the Pakistanis continued construction of the disputed border gate.Afghan officials blamed Pakistan for initiating the fighting, saying the Pakistanis had fired after the Afghan Border Police tried to stop work on the gate. The Afghan Border Police officer\u2019s body was flown to Kabul, the Afghan capital.Haroon Chakhansuri, the spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, said Pakistan was violating agreements to work jointly on construction of border crossing facilities.\u201cThey opened fire first, then the Afghan security forces responded to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe emphasize that Afghan security forces should always be ready to defend their people.\u201dMr. Chakhansuri said diplomatic efforts were underway to resolve the dispute. But officials on both sides of the border said the situation remained tense.Contributing to the tensions has been an intensifying offensive by the Afghan Taliban, whose leadership shelters in Pakistan. Afghan officials from Mr. Ghani on down have blamed Pakistan for the collapse of peace talks with the Taliban and for continuing to provide sanctuaries for Taliban leaders and fighters inside Pakistan.Pakistan has responded by cracking down on Afghan refugees in Pakistan and tightening controls along the normally porous border, making it more difficult than usual for Afghans to travel to Pakistan for education, medical care or trade.Ismail Khan reported from Peshawar, and Rod Nordland from Kabul, Afghanistan. Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting from Kabul, and Khalid Alokozay from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Wedding Toast. What Could Go Wrong?", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byClick here for tips, and videos of terrible on-screen toasts.Eric Winikoff was pacing in a park near the White House talking to himself. His childhood best friend was getting married that afternoon at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, and as the best man, Mr. Winikoff, a partner in an executive compensation firm in Los Angeles, was to deliver the wedding toast. He recited his speech aloud over and over as he strolled, after practicing in front of his wife dozens of times before that.\u201cI get really nervous, and I kept rewording the punch line so it would have the biggest impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re such close friends, so I wanted the speech to be good.\u201dIf public speaking is the No. 1 fear in America, as Jerry Seinfeld joked, then being asked to give a wedding toast can send someone into a tailspin.The thought of standing in front of friends, families and strangers, and pouring your heart out (or trying to be funny) can be terrifying. There is so much that can go wrong. Nearly every wedding planner can tell stories of the maid-of-honor who listed off inside jokes with the bride, as the audience stifled yawns. The best man, who rather than toast the groom, started to roast him, talking too long about former girlfriends, drunken escapades and other personal details that everyone, especially the groom, would have preferred not to hear at that moment. Then there are the people who drink too much before getting up to talk, which can muck things up entirely.\u201cWhen couples come to us and say they\u2019re worried about someone in their wedding party giving a toast, I tell them \u2018You should be worried,\u2019\u201d said Josh Brooks, a co-owner of F\u00eate Event Planning and Design in New York City. \u201cSo often people say the wrong thing, they go on too long, or they do something that detracts from the couple.\u201dPart of the problem is that people don\u2019t prepare enough, said Peggy Klaus, a speech and presentations coach in Berkeley, Calif., who has helped hundreds of people, both famous and not, write wedding toasts. People start writing the speech a few days before the wedding, or they get up in front of the crowd and wing it, which inevitably leads to stumbling through the speech.\u201cYou should start writing a wedding toast months before,\u201d Ms. Klaus said she tells her clients. And it is critical that you practice it in front of a mirror several times to nail the delivery. \u201cIf you don\u2019t prepare, your nerves will take over,\u201d she said, \u201cand it just won\u2019t work.\u201dMr. Winikoff, who was a bundle of nerves when he finally stood up to give his speech, built his toast around offering the bride pieces of advice about marrying the groom, each one with a punch line.\u201cWhen you are spending that much time with Ivan, remember these four words: Breathe and stay calm,\u201d he told the crowd, recalling: \u201cWhen it\u2019s junior year and everyone is applying to college and he asks you if you\u2019ve ever heard of the SAT, breathe and stay calm. When trying to dislodge a stuck passenger door from the sidewalk and he puts the car in reverse, breathe and stay calm.\u201dMr. Winikoff, who has delivered several wedding speeches since, three as a best man, said it was his most successful toast, partly because it was good-natured despite the central theme that his friend can be exasperating. \u201cI roasted him, but in the nicest of ways,\u201d Mr. Winikoff said.Laura Fenton, the lifestyle director for Parents Magazine, has given several wedding toasts, and she has helped others write their own. A terrible speech can stay with the bride or groom, even leaving a sour note for years, she said.She knows of one husband who still cringes when he thinks back to the toast his brothers gave the couple on their wedding day: \u201cIt was clear they didn\u2019t prepare, and they focused on his hapless days, how he was a lost bachelor in the city without acknowledging all that he accomplished,\u201d Ms. Fenton said. \u201cThey ribbed him a little too much.\u201dShe said the key to a memorable toast is a \u201chook.\u201d \u201cIncorporate a theme at the beginning of the toast, then return to it at the end,\u201d she said. At the wedding of her best friend, who happened to be the groom, she started the speech by mentioning that she was disappointed she wasn\u2019t asked to be the best man. The speech made a case for why she should be the best man, despite being a woman, by giving examples of all the sweet moments she had experienced with the couple. \u201cHaving that hook to come back to made the speech more satisfying for people,\u201d she said.Some young people are finding more creative ways to deliver their heartfelt sentiments to the bride and groom. Kelsey Hallerman, 25, and her sister, Maddie, 24, gave their older sister, Caitlin, a wedding toast that brought wedding guests to tears. You know, the tears that come when you\u2019re laughing hysterically. Instead of a speech, the sisters sang a goofy and out-of-tune, but incredibly heartfelt, mash-up of Tracy Chapman, the Jackson 5 and Backstreet Boys songs, rewritten with lyrics about their sister\u2019s relationship with her new husband.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be boring or do anything too serious,\u201d Kelsey Hallerman said. \u201cPerforming is more in our wheelhouse than a traditional speech. We were terrible, but we had so much fun.\u201dOf the 50 weddings Hollywood Pop Gallery, an entertainment event firm with offices in New York City, London and Greenwich, Conn., helped plan last year, 15 featured an untraditional wedding toast, said Brett Galley, director of special events at the company.\u201cPeople like to be funny, and millennials are very creative,\u201d she said. She has helped a few best man and maid of honor pairs organize a flash mob dance \u2014 where everyone surprises the audience with a choreographed group dance. Others have rapped their toasts. One couple allowed guests to \u201ctweet their toast,\u201d assigning the wedding a hashtag; the tweets were projected around the reception hall like a live ticker. Another maid of honor made a seven-minute video about the bride and groom. \u201cIt was very dramatic because the lights went down, people were laughing and crying,\u201d Ms. Galley said. \u201cIt was sweet.\u201d\u201cThese toasts make for good entertainment,\u201d said Ms. Klaus, the speech and presentations coach. But she cautioned anyone going in this direction because, she said, it can be a bit self-indulgent. \u201cRemember, the toast is not about you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the couple.\u201dWhen writing a wedding toast, experts say to think of it as an amazing opportunity, not a burden. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift to the bride and groom,\u201d said Sarah Parker, who wrote a how-to book on wedding speeches after witnessing too many failed toasts.Ms. Parker advised: \u201cKeep it short and simple \u2014 no more than three minutes. Tell one good story that illustrates the point you want to make, and make sure you talk about the bride and the groom. Then wish them well and raise your glass.\u201dClick here to watch a Facebook live recording of a chat with Chris Anderson, TED Talks curator, on how to give a great toast.Advertisement"}

You don\u2019t get much funkier than that, as George Clinton reminds us.You will need sharp eyes to see the theme in Mr. Kaye\u2019s puzzle, so look closely. It might help to have a piece of paper, an index card or even your finger to help you read the theme. At this point in the week, the theme could be living anywhere, including in the clues, and that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019re dealing with today.Right now, what we\u2019ve got is a mysterious set of numbers and letters that don\u2019t make much sense, and a revealer at 38A. Trust me when I tell you that you will never be so happy to solve a revealer, because it took me a while to realize what was going on. Let\u2019s take a closer look at 27A, for example: The clue is \u201cTB8L\u201d and the answer is ADORED SUPERSTAR. I know what you\u2019re thinking and no, neither Mr. Kaye nor Will Shortz has suffered a breakdown. What we have to do is follow the instructions in the revealer at 38- and 39A.If you TOP OFF a drink, you are simply being a good host, but what happens if you think about that phrase a bit differently? If you take the TOP OFF the clues, you might see something different. Put that piece of paper or your finger over the top of the clue at 27A and look at what\u2019s left at the bottom: where there once was \u201cTB8L,\u201d we now have IDOL. And an IDOL can be defined as an ADORED SUPERSTAR.How cool is that?Now for the others. If we take the TOP OFF all four theme clues, we get:17A: B0B = DEFECTIVE BULLET = DUD27A: TB8L = ADORED SUPERSTAR = IDOL46A: 8V8TB  = SHAPED LIKE AN EGG = OVOID61A: VMB = BRIGHTLY COLORED = VIVID The word \u201cVIVID\u201d at 61A was tough to make out (I kept seeing \u201cVIID\u201d), but if you include the \u201cv\u201d in the capital M, it does, in fact, say \u201cVIVID.\u201d\u2013 15A: Caligula, the Roman emperor, was accused of loving a lot of people in his time, but in this case, the clue is a bit of misdirection. It\u2019s asking you to fill in the Latin word for love, because Latin was the language of the ancient Romans, so the answer is AMOR.\u2013 36A: \u201cAnd thereby hangs A TALE\u201d is from the play \u201cAs You Like It\u201d by William Shakespeare. There have been other plays with variations on that line, like \u201cThereby hangs a tale\u201d from \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew.\u201d\u2013 42A: This gets my vote for Clue of the Day.

I\u2019m grateful to them for their willingness to work with a novice constructor, their suggestion that I revise the grid with cleaner fill and their expert edits to the clues.  I hope solvers enjoy this puzzle and its unusual theme.In developing the \u201cTOP OFF\u201d effect, I found only seven letters that could be \u201chidden\u201d in a way that looked natural to me: D, I, J, L, O, U, V.   I used these to make a list of about 20 words that might be good candidates, and settled on DUD, IDOL, OVOID and VIVID after finding that each had a simple definition that could span the grid.  (In retrospect, I realize that I overlooked some nice J words in making my list, and could have used the clue J0B8 B8J8 (or B8J8 by itself) with the answer MARTIAL ARTS SITE.)In cognitive psychology, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cfunctional fixedness\u201d that may explain the difficulty in \u201cseeing\u201d the four words hidden in plain sight: we have a mental bias for associating a tool only with its most common function.  We tend to see letters and numbers only as representations of sounds and amounts.  Their shapes are arbitrary and used only for recognition, and not as possible hiding places for other information.A bit about me:  I live in the American University Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with my wife, son and dog.  For the last 11 years I\u2019ve been privileged to serve as a senior counsel (in-house attorney) for the American Red Cross.Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaye.

{"Headline": "Fianc\u00e9e of Drowned Kayaker Said He Postponed Wedding, Officer Testifies", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byAs Angelika Graswald revisited Bannerman Island a year ago, after the drowning of her fianc\u00e9, she told investigators that there were problems in their relationship \u2014 specifically that he had postponed their wedding, according to an officer\u2019s testimony at a pretrial hearing on Thursday.It was the first time the police had revealed that Ms. Graswald, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of her fianc\u00e9, Vincent Viafore, had indicated that their nuptials were in jeopardy.The testimony, by Anthony DaSilva, one of the three investigators who were also on Bannerman Island on April 29, 2015, 10 days after Mr. Viafore\u2019s kayak capsized, came on the third day of the hearing in Goshen, N.Y. The purpose of the hearing is to examine how investigators obtained evidence, which in the case against Ms. Graswald relies heavily on her own words.On the return to shore, the boat capsized and Mr. Viafore, who was not wearing a life vest, disappeared under the choppy water, which was 46 degrees \u2014 cold enough to instantly bring on hypothermia. For 10 days, Ms. Graswald was treated as a grieving fianc\u00e9e while rescuers searched for Mr. Viafore\u2019s body.She was charged with murder the following day, after an 11-hour police interrogation. Her lawyer, Richard A. Portale, is seeking to suppress a videotape of the questioning.The testimony on Thursday also expanded on the unusual behavior that detectives observed in the days after Mr. Viafore\u2019s drowning. (His body was found a month after the kayak capsized.) Among Ms. Graswald\u2019s posts to Facebook were lewd jokes, video clips of her cartwheeling and visiting an animal shelter, and smiling selfies.The authorites said Ms. Graswald confessed to removing the kayak plug to Donald DeQuarto, an investigator with whom she spoke privately on the island, and agreed to return to the New York State Police barracks for more questioning. On the boat ride back, she was whistling and declared at one point, \u201cI\u2019m free,\u201d according to Mr. DaSilva, who testified that her demeanor was \u201csurreal.\u201dAs she neared the police barracks, Mr. DaSilva added, Ms. Graswald said that when she first saw Mr. DeQuarto, she thought he was cute.The testimony this week also centered on Ms. Graswald\u2019s cellphone. She initially told police that she had lost it in the water when her own kayak went over, moments before a rescue boat reached her. But, according to the police, she tried to make a call on the rescue boat, explaining that she had a missed call.In questioning, Mr. Portale has tried to cast doubt on Ms. Graswald\u2019s supposed confession on the island about the removal of the kayak plug. To that end, he asked Mr. DaSilva why he had let her go to the bathroom on the island after he said she made such an incriminating statement.In response, Mr. DaSilva testified that she was within view of investigators.Mr. Portale has also suggested that Ms. Graswald, who is a native of Latvia, struggled with a language barrier during the long police interrogation, in which she said, \u201cI wanted him dead and now he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m O.K. with it.\u201dTo emphasize Ms. Graswald\u2019s grasp of English, an assistant district attorney on Thursday asked Mr. DaSilva if the investigators had spoken in English with her on the island.

In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units \u2014 emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs \u2014 tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them.If emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media \u2014 film, TV or amateur video \u2014 and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs \u2014 those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation \u2014 feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising.Buying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet.The commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces.With Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue; Ansel Elgort pouting; Ansel Elgort wearing headphones.Meanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut.For the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other sport-themed glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The victim, Hallel Yaffa Ariel, 13, had been sleeping in after staying up late for a dance performance the night before. Her father found her in her room, according to the Israeli news media and the head of the settlement\u2019s volunteer security team.The killing, in the Kiryat Arba settlement, was the latest in a series of attacks that surged in October and have left more than 30 Israelis dead. Several of the victims, including Hallel, have been dual citizens of the United States, according to the State Department. More than 210 Palestinians have also been killed, most while carrying out attacks or when thought to be about to do so.Thursday\u2019s attack was particularly gruesome.Mr. Tarayreh, from Bani Naim, a sprawling town separated from Kiryat Arba by hills, a highway and a barrier surrounding the Jewish settlement, managed to cross over the fence early Thursday, Eyal Gelman, the head of the Kiryat Arba security team, told Israeli radio. He entered the Ariels\u2019 house and locked himself in.

{"Headline": "\u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 Season 3, Episode 7: Stop, Beta Time", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported bySilicon ValleySunday night\u2019s episode opens with Richard feeling exposed. He has fought hard to get his idea off the ground, but there was a certain amount of comfort in not getting what he wanted. Action Jack\u2019s push for a clunky data storage appliance may have insulted his vision of an elegant compression engine with mass utility, but he could still hide behind the box. If Jack had prevailed, Richard could grouse forever about how his brilliant algorithm was squandered by a small-minded businessman and no one could question it. Bringing the pure, uncompromised Pied Piper into the world is a dream that nonetheless puts Richard on the precipice of a true, lasting, fatal disaster.\u201cTo Build a Better Beta\u201d is about the release of the beta version of Pied Piper, which is an important period for any tech company to work out the kinks before an official launch. It\u2019s not one of the funnier episodes this season, because there\u2019s so much heavy lifting required from a plotting standpoint, but it touches smartly on themes of trust, friendship and the lies we tell our friends and ourselves. That\u2019s the benefit of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d constantly bogging down its characters with setbacks and high-stakes conflict: Their response clarifies who they are and brings their relationships into sharper focus.The good news for Richard is that almost everybody loves the platform, including one notoriously critical user who calls it the best beta he\u2019s seen in 15 years in the Valley. A beaming Jared enthuses, \u201cI don\u2019t want to count our chickens before they\u2019re hatched \u2014 I mean, 3 percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead \u2014 but we may have a healthy brood on our hands.\u201dThe bad news is that Monica, whose opinion he values the most, so dislikes it that she initially lies to him about ever trying it at all. Her reassurances are comforting: She passed on a 20 percent stake in Slack, which she still doesn\u2019t get (\u201cIs it email? Is it a chat room?\u201d), and besides, in this business, investing in people is wiser than investing in products. And yet her general complaint about Pied Piper feeling too \u201cengineered\u201d seems on point, given the distance between the hyper-competent coding nerds on Richard\u2019s team and the ordinary flesh sacks who would actually be using the platform. \u201cTo Build a Better Beta\u201d makes a joke out of Dinesh and Gilfoyle\u2019s failure to fill out a 10-friend invite list. It stands to reason that users would find their software off-putting, too.The guys at Pied Piper know code, but they don\u2019t know people (or business or fashion or social cues or other people-related matters), which is in large part of what makes \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d so funny. Gilfoyle and Dinesh each have a cover for their personal dysfunction. Gilfoyle writes off the whole of humankind as inherently venal and untrustworthy: \u201cIt\u2019s a war of all against all. The history of humanity is a book written in blood. We\u2019re all just animals in a pit.\u201d (Jared\u2019s deadpan response, \u201cI feel very sad now,\u201d may be the funniest moment of the episode.) Dinesh merely makes up friends in the dim hope that no one will try to verify them. These cool dudes are too busy \u201csnowboarding in Tahoe\u201d to answer questions about the beta. (As ever, Jared is sympathetic, recalling all the escape plans he hatched with his imaginary friend, Harriet Tubman.)So underneath all the lies told in \u201cTo Build a Better Beta,\u201d there\u2019s a pitiful, childlike vulnerability. Monica doesn\u2019t want to hurt Richard\u2019s feelings when his confidence is at its most fragile. Gilfoyle and Dinesh don\u2019t want to admit that they\u2019re the only true friends each has. Only Jared seems comfortable in his own skin, which he\u2019s described as his \u201chome\u201d when he has no place to sleep. Now that they\u2019re finally releasing Pied Piper to an internet of faceless, unsympathetic, often hostile users, they\u2019ll be totally defenseless. The creators of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d surely know the feeling.Bytes\u2022 The unraveling of Bachmanity continues apace, with Erlich and Big Head scrambling to recover $6 million in funds their devious money manager has tucked away for tax purposes. The succession of disastrous meetings gives T.J. Miller an opportunity to hold court, which is always comedy gold. I particularly liked Erlich\u2019s upset mood over the poor recovery efforts on his missing tiki head.\u2022 The episode makes a subtle point about the total disregard Silicon Valley has for matters of privacy. Hooli finds out about the Pied Piper beta by spying on company email. Gilfoyle finds out about Hooli scamming an invite code through the \u201cGod view\u201d he installed in the platform. The show doesn\u2019t make them equivalent violations \u2014 Hooli\u2019s is more nefarious, Pied Piper\u2019s more useful \u2014 but it\u2019s taken as a matter of course that privacy concerns are a joke in the tech world.\u2022 Big Head has lost his entire $20 million settlement, but he gets to keep both of the cannonballs he rented. He\u2019s going to be O.K.\u2022 Jian-Yang isn\u2019t my favorite character, but his presence as a Erlich\u2019s unwelcome tenant and tormentor this season has been good for a few stray laughs, none heartier than his prank phone call in the seconds before launch. \u201cErlich Bachman, this is your mom.

Surveillance", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byFORT PIERCE, Fla. \u2014 Omar Mateen\u2019s life seemed to be on a successful trajectory a decade before he carried out one of the worst cases of mass murder in American history.He earned an associate degree in criminal justice technology in 2006. A year later, he was hired by one of the world\u2019s premier private security companies, G4S. And then, in 2009, he got married and bought a home.Soon, though, signs of troubles emerged. His wife, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, divorced him in 2011, after he abused her.Two years after that, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in after reports from Mr. Mateen\u2019s co-workers that he, the American-born son of Afghan immigrants, had suggested he may have had terrorist ties. The F.B.I. interviewed him twice, but after surveillance, records checks and witness interviews, agents were unable to verify any terrorist links and closed their investigation.After the terrorist investigations cleared Mr. Mateen, he maintained both his Florida security-officer license and his job. He also kept his Florida firearms license, and within the last few days he legally purchased a handgun and a \u201clong gun.\u201dLabeling the attack an act of domestic terrorism, law enforcement officials said Mr. Mateen had called 911 once the attacks began and swore allegiance over the phone to the Islamic State.\u201cThey were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, \u2018Look at that. In front of my son, they are doing that,\u2019 \u201d the elder Mr. Mateen said.Mr. Mateen\u2019s father said the killing had nothing to do with religion, and he apologized for his son. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aware of any action he is taking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in shock like the whole country.\u201dIn an interview at her home near Boulder, Colo., Ms. Yusufiy said that when she first met Mr. Mateen online through Myspace in 2008, he was a funny charmer with a decent job and aspirations to become a police officer.But after they were married, he made her hand over her paychecks from her day care job, prevented her from calling her parents and hit her, sometimes as she slept, she said. He also kept a handgun in the house.\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to go anywhere except work,\u201d she said.Mr. Mateen was an observant Muslim, but never expressed sympathies for terrorist organizations or radical Islamists, she said.He also made anti-gay comments when he was angry. \u201cThere were definitely moments when he\u2019d express his intolerance towards homosexuals,\u201d she said.Ms. Yusify said she left Mr. Mateen in 2009 after her parents flew down from New Jersey and rescued her from the marriage, and had no contact with him since, save for one time when he tried to message her on Facebook.\u201cI thought I had closed the chapter on this horrible mistake,\u201d said Ms. Yusufiy, who said she learned of the tragedy from her parents.After the shooting, law enforcement officials swarmed a condominium complex in Fort Pierce, Fla., where Mr. Mateen owned a unit that property records show he purchased in 2009. The complex, wedged between Interstate 95 and the shore, now sits among some of Fort Pierce\u2019s working-class blocks.The authorities also focused on at least two other homes in the area, both in nearby Port St. Lucie, and spent hours canvassing a pair of properties connected to Mr. Mateen\u2019s family.Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.It appeared that Mr. Mateen may have contacted another Orlando club in the days leading up to the shooting.After the attack this morning Mr. Bass thought the name of the man looked familiar. When he searched the name on Google he realized it was in fact the same person who had contacted him.The imam firmly denied that Mr. Mateen had heard any teachings at the mosque that would radicalize him.Mr. Mateen\u2019s father is an outspoken Afghan political activist, but that played no part in the investigations of his son that the F.B.I. carried out in 2013 and 2014, a law enforcement official said.A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.His father, Sediqque, hosted a talk show for a television channel broadcasting to the Afghan diaspora.Recently, the elder Mr. Mateen has taken to posting videos on his Facebook page where, dressed in a military uniform in front of the Afghan flag, he sharply criticizes the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani.The statement confirmed that Mr. Mateen had worked for the company since Sept. 10, 2007, and expressed the company\u2019s sadness at Sunday\u2019s attack. It also said Mr. Mateen underwent screening and background checks both when he was recruited in 2007 as well as in 2013, and nothing of concern surfaced either time.Yet the statement did not address whether company officials had ever asked the F.B.I. why it had investigated Mr. Mateen. The company also did not respond to questions about Mr. Mateen\u2019s conduct raised by one of his former co-workers.\u201cHe talked about killing people all the time,\u201d said Mr. Gilroy, who joined G4S after a career with the Fort Pierce police and later left the security firm. He said he could not provide names of any other co-workers who could support his account of Mr. Mateen\u2019s behavior.Advertisement"}

But the ones based in the Midwest have tended to be more about sprinkling digital dust on the dirtiest industries.SMS Assist connects property managers with outside vendors, such as snow removal services, landscapers and window washers, through a cloud-based digital platform. SMS\u2019s customers include retailers like Family Dollar and O\u2019Reilly Automotive, as well as real estate operators, such as Colony Starwood Homes.Using the SMS technology, a snowplow serviceman can take pictures with his phone before and after the work is done and submit them to the property manager to show a task is completed. All invoicing is done through SMS\u2019s cloud-based technology, and ratings are given to all vendor to assess their work. It allows companies with a lot of offices or real estate a way to keep tabs on the upkeep of properties.On Tuesday, SMS announced that it had raised $150 million in new capital from the same Goldman Sachs team that invested in Uber, Facebook and Spotify, according to a news release. The new round, its Series D, sets SMS\u2019s valuation at $1 billion, a spokesman for the company said.That is almost double its valuation from a year ago, when a previous round of fund-raising was led by Insight Venture Partners.

Vote Nears", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 The Scottish referendum of September 2014 was notable for its bitterness and nastiness, especially on social media.Douglas Alexander was one of the victims of this massive swing. A national figure as the Labour Party\u2019s shadow foreign secretary and the manager of Ed Miliband\u2019s doomed campaign for prime minister, Mr. Alexander lost his seat in his hometown, Paisley, to the youngest person elected to Parliament in centuries, Mhairi Black, then 20.And he has some lessons from the Scottish experience to impart.So it will be vital to manage the news cycle in the last 10 days, to shape the anxieties and aspirations of voters. In Scotland, opponents of independence focused on the economic risks and the inability of the \u201cyes\u201d side to answer crucial questions about currency and the sustainability of the oil-based economy.\u201cCost versus control,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.But \u201cyou also need a movement, not just an argument,\u201d since for voters, \u201cemotion matters as much as facts,\u201d he said.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe Remain side must speak to British patriotism and the benefits of the European Union, not just spout statistics. It is quite possible, as he understood at some point during the Scottish campaign, \u201cto win the argument but lose the audience.\u201d\u201cIt needs to be a conversation within the country about the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a conversation on the Eurostar. You need to give people emotional permission to accept the evidence,\u201d so sincerity matters more than any choice of words.While social media can be ugly and even painful, it is vital \u201cto get people to voluntarily share information with their contacts and friends.\u201d Information garnered that way is \u201cmore credible,\u201d because it comes from someone a voter has already decided to follow and trust.In the Scottish vote, Mr. Alexander said, \u201csocial media and Facebook mattered more than the print media.\u201dLastly, Mr. Alexander warns that anger and bitterness last long after the vote.\u201cReferendums have an afterlife,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not settle it for a generation,\u201d contrary to what Prime Minister David Cameron has said, any more than the Scottish referendum has settled the issue of independence.Voters politicized on such a vital issue don\u2019t go back to sleep, much as newlyweds buy bridal magazines a year after the wedding, Mr. Alexander noted.\u201cThe experience remains in the mind and in the memory,\u201d he said.For this referendum, unlike in Scotland, has been driven by a decades-long split in the Conservative Party; underneath, it is also a battle for party leadership and ultimately for 10 Downing Street.Advertisement"}

They, in turn, showed him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the world around them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 lives lived fully.\u201cDavid, you have to look out for me!\u201dI was 5 years old and had just walked my dad into a stairway. He wasn\u2019t hurt, but I remember his irritation. He was blind and I was his son and guide-in-training. Whenever we walked together for the next 34 years, I made sure his path was clear.My sister, Ellen, and I were raised by our parents, Harold and Gail Snider. They were born blind, and we were sighted. We were the perfect double pair, joined arm-in-arm in a mutual bond of love and caring for each other. Inside our Washington home, our family routine was nothing out of the ordinary: Mom and Dad cared care for us and laid down the rules, while we helped them. Mostly, we read stuff they couldn\u2019t see, like the mail or restaurant menus, or we described things like clothes and movie scenes.As a child, I was incredibly uncomfortable with the nonstop looks we received whenever we went outside. Everyone, everywhere, looked at my parents and me, all the time. I know that seeing two blind adults, with their long white canes, walking with their two sighted children is a statistically rare event in our society, but to me it felt awful to get unwanted attention. As much as I loved my parents, I just hated being stared at. I didn\u2019t want them to be unique. Of course my parents were unbothered because they couldn\u2019t see. But my dad gave me permission to stick out my tongue, which was rude, if it would help me vent some of my anger and frustration.One incident in elementary school changed how I saw Mom and Dad. One of my teachers had asked me who cooked in our home. I said that my mother did, and somehow I was reprimanded for lying. My parents were used to the routine insults and low expectations from sighted people, which they vigorously protested. Dad offered to do a presentation at my school about blind people and what their lives were really like.So there I was, sitting with 50 kids and my teacher, while my father demonstrated how blind people adjusted to their lack of eyesight by reading Braille books and magazines and using canes for independent travel. He discussed how blind people made their own meals, went to school, earned college degrees, competed for jobs and paid their bills. They enjoy regular pastimes that sighted people do, like music and card games, and they take care of their children and have a good life. By the time he was finished, I\u2019d never been prouder to have unique parents.As a teenager, my passion for documentary photography was so all-encompassing that I decided to attend college at the School of Visual Arts. I thought that my family would be a good subject, as I wasn\u2019t aware of any photo essays on a blind couple photographed by their son. Using my camera to distill Mom and Dad\u2019s routines at home and at work, it became a series that showed the sighted what my dad had talked about to my class all those years ago. "}
{"Headline": "She\u2019s the Hidden Architect of Modern Comedy", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 As soon as Charna Halpern walked backstage at the iO theater here, the 20 or so comedians in the room got quiet, their eyes focused on her. They were about to perform for a full house, but she was the only audience that mattered.Every year, Ms. Halpern, 63, the co-founder and owner of the iO, sees hundreds of performers do five minutes before she picks 15 to present to the producers of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in a summer showcase. Getting to this final 15 is the golden ticket of Chicago comedy, and there are many stories of unknowns, like the current cast members Cecily Strong and Vanessa Bayer, cashing it in for stardom. Ms. Halpern, wearing a blue shirt with slits down the arms and comfortable slippers, told the comics to not be nervous, then asked for questions. Silence. Walking out the door, on her way to her front-row seat, Ms. Halpern described what she just saw with characteristic bluntness: \u201cYoung and afraid.\u201dThe name Del Close is better known, and Second City here and the Upright Citizens Brigade in New York get the lion\u2019s share of attention, but Ms. Halpern is the overlooked powerhouse of improv, the woman who with little fanfare has played a major role in shaping the current comedy boom. She provided a launching pad to some of comedy\u2019s most famous names \u2014 she introduced Tina Fey to Amy Poehler, who took her first improv class from Ms. Halpern \u2014 and helped transform improvisation from a marginal art form into a bustling business (with five theaters in New York alone devoted to it and thousands of students taking classes around the world) and cultural force that rivals stand-up.Adam McKay, the director and former improviser who thanked Ms. Halpern when he won an Oscar for \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d compares her to the producers who brought hip-hop to the mainstream. \u201cIn the early days, it was an art in the neighborhoods, but you needed entrepreneurs like Russell Simmons to provide a framework for it to explode,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Charna did for improv.\u201dImprov comedy had long been a male-dominated field, and Mr. Close had a reputation for sexism, one Ms. Halpern disputes. But part of the reason she remains obscure may be because their relationship tracked a certain gender stereotype: The man as genius guru supported by the tough woman who does the less glamorous behind-the-scenes work.\u201cShe was not the artist that Del was, nor did she pretend to be,\u201d said Ms. Strong, whom Ms. Halpern encouraged to audition for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s great at choosing the right people and creating this home,\u201d Ms. Strong added.Ms. Poehler described her as an inspirational model of female leadership. \u201cAt iO, there were a lot of funny, powerful women onstage, and Charna was running the joint,\u201d Ms. Poehler said, adding that when Ms. Poehler started the Upright Citizens Brigade, she gained a new appreciation for Ms. Halpern. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to maintain the longevity she has. People come and go, but she stays and cleans up the mess, literally and figuratively.\u201dIt\u2019s a sign of the complexity of her public profile that Ms. Halpern is seen by some as a godmother of the current explosion of women in comedy, but a symbol of its sexism by others.Ms. Halpern stopped improvising years ago after experiencing hearing loss \u2014 she wears two aids \u2014 but offstage, she performs the part of the gritty old-school producer with brio and charm. Bring up New York comedy with Ms. Halpern in an interview at the iO, and she says with swagger, \u201cIf you want to get good, you come to Chicago: This is Mecca.\u201dThis comment set off a ferocious backlash in the comedy world that migrated from her page to the news media and theaters across the country, where a discussion about sexism had been moving into the open. \u201cAs long as I\u2019ve been in Chicago, the conversation about creepy dudes at iO has been a constant,\u201d Julia Weiss, a comedian, said in an interview. \u201cCharna pretends she had no idea. Ridiculous.\u201dSusan Messing, a former student and improv teacher and performer here, offers a slightly more sympathetic view: \u201cCharna comes from a world of \u2018Suck it up,\u2019\u201d she said, sitting in the lobby of Second City. \u201cShe trusts her employees, and when you run a $7 million theater and want to think the best of people, you get selective hearing.\u201dAmong other things, the episode illustrated the challenge of transforming a scrappy comedy clubhouse into a huge institution that now includes a new complex with four theaters, event spaces and beer garden. \u201cShe did not have the human resources department or the management, which results in the problems they had,\u201d said Andrew Alexander, chief executive and executive producer of Second City. Ms. Halpern said, \u201cPeople felt scared to come to me \u2014 that broke my heart,\u201d adding that the claims of sexism surprised her. \u201cWhen I started, we never thought of that. I never thought about men, women. I was never harassed or assaulted or mistreated. But I see it now.\u201d She also said, speaking of the backlash: \u201cAs horrible as it was for me, in the long run, something great came out of it. In L.A., everyone is much happier.\u201dImprovisation is as old as creativity itself. But the modern improv theater began in a very specific place and time: 55th Street on the South Side of Chicago in 1955, when the Compass Players put on a cabaret revue. After Second City opened, it dominated the scene. By the 1980s, the Second City style focused on short scenes and using improvisation as a tool to make sketches. Del Close, who joined the Compass Players at 23, had a more ambitious vision: that improvisation could lean on longer narratives, take on more elements of theater and stand alone as a distinct art form.While he dabbled in the 1960s in the Harold \u2014 the long-form structure of interweaving scenes that is a foundation of improv today \u2014 he didn\u2019t test his theories until he paired up with Ms. Halpern in 1982. \u201cI told him I thought it was the future,\u201d she said.Together they brought structure to the Harold, adding an element from a short-form game called Time-Dash that moved scenes forward or backward in time. \u201cWe came up with the idea,\u201d Ms. Halpern said, \u201cthat three time-dashes would be the body of the Harold.\u201dMs. Halpern, who grew up in a lower-middle-class Jewish home in the West Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago, started producing shows as a kid in her backyard. She knew parents would pay the quarter ticket price if their children were involved, so she hired a big cast. After a stint teaching juvenile delinquents \u2014 where, she said, she learned improvisation by dealing with students \u2014 she took an improv class from the teacher Jo Forsberg in the 1970s and became inspired.Even then, Mr. Close had a storied reputation as a teacher of John Belushi and Bill Murray. A former drug addict, Mr. Close had fallen on hard times, estranged from Second City and living in an apartment with no electricity. Ms. Halpern suggested they go into business together. She took classes from him, found him a new place and helped him open a bank account. While they were never romantically involved, he called her his old lady and acted like a jealous boyfriend when she brought dates around. \u201cI had someone who told me you will never have a boyfriend as long as Del is alive,\u201d said Ms. Halpern, who is not married.In the early years, Ms. Halpern ran a school at the iO (known as the ImprovOlympic before the International Olympic Committee threatened litigation), taught classes and was one of the few female improvisers. Mr. Close was the face of the theater, the resident genius, while she was the approachable one. \u201cDel was a curmudgeon while Charna explained things to you,\u201d said Rachel Dratch, who studied and performed at the iO before being cast on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 1999. \u201cCharna was warm and human. Del was on a cloud.\u201dMs. Halpern encouraged Mr. Close to codify his theories and write them down. When he refused, she took the initiative and wrote the first draft of \u201cTruth in Comedy,\u201d the first long-form-improv bible. It explained basic improv concepts like agreement (known as \u201cYes and\u201d).\u201cIn Chicago, when that book came out, there was a lot of criticism, that it name-dropped celebrities and this and that,\u201d Mr. McKay said. \u201cBut I remember going to Dallas and seeing an improv troupe doing a damn good Harold based purely on that book.\u201dThe year after the book was published, in 1994, Ms. Halpern opened her first permanent theater space, which became a magnet for talented performers like Mr. McKay, Ms. Fey, Ms. Poehler and David Koechner (\u201cAnchorman\u201d). Ms. Halpern still considers this her golden era, and when Mr. Close died in 1999, the same year the Upright Citizens Brigade opened its first permanent space in New York, she worried her teachers and audience would vanish. They didn\u2019t.\u201cOne thing I learned early on: It\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about your army \u2014 and that\u2019s where I was strong,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when I was thrown out of a place in the early days, Andy Richter would call and say: \u2018Where are we going? I got the set and the truck.\u2019 Sometimes I felt: We\u2019re going where? I\u2019m the leader. Wait for me!\u201dLast month, Ms. Halpern received the ultimate honor in comedy, a reference on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d During our interview, an employee from the iO\u2019s financial division, a former boyfriend, handed her a screen shot of Homer Simpson holding a copy of \u201cTruth in Comedy,\u201d with her byline displayed. Yet only Del Close\u2019s name was mentioned. \u201cIt bugs me a little,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cNothing I can do about it.\u201dA pioneer benefiting from and occasionally haunted by the demons of her charismatic former partner, Ms. Halpern can at times evoke a certain presidential candidate. And while she rejects the idea that gender has held her back, when the subject turns to the double standard facing Hillary Clinton, she nodded her head, telling a story about a female improviser who thought her notes were meanspirited, but accepted similar ones from a male competitor. \u201cI was a bitch, and he was the genius who inspired her and told her things she just would not hear from me,\u201d Ms. Halpern said. Her eyes glassy, she added that she understands this comes with the territory.What she\u2019s more worried about, she said, is how her intimidating reputation could affect her performers. That\u2019s why, she said, she goes backstage before shows, to put performers at ease. \u201cPeople are scared because I can make decisions about who can get up in front of Lorne Michaels, but that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said, pausing before driving home a point. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for fear onstage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lu Wei, China\u2019s Internet Czar, Will Step Down From Post", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The outspoken gatekeeper of China\u2019s internet, who led a global push for the country\u2019s growing state surveillance and online censorship, is relinquishing his post, state news media reported on Wednesday.Given the opacity of the Chinese government, it was not clear whether Mr. Lu was in trouble or in line for a promotion.In recent years, he has become emblematic of China\u2019s assertive stance on blocking websites, censoring content and tracking users within its borders.One indication of his influence is that he has been the director of a powerful Chinese Communist Party committee set up to form internet policy. He has also headed the Cyberspace Administration of China since it was created by Mr. Xi in 2014.Mr. Lu will hand over his position as head of the Cyberspace Administration to its deputy director, Xu Lin, who worked directly under Mr. Xi when the president was made the Shanghai party secretary in 2007 after a corruption scandal. A number of officials who worked with Mr. Xi during his seven months in Shanghai have been promoted in recent years.If his new appointment undoubtedly makes Mr. Xu a figure to watch, Mr. Lu\u2019s fate is less clear. Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the fact that Mr. Lu had retained his title as the deputy head of China\u2019s propaganda department meant it was not clear whether his departure from the Cyberspace Administration was a demotion.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to draw the conclusion that he\u2019s out,\u201d Mr. Lam said.\u201cHe might end up getting a promotion in another area of the bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for these important positions to be moved around frequently.\u201dAs head of the Cyberspace Administration, Mr. Lu personally led the charge to rein in some of China\u2019s most outspoken social media stars. He also helped create laws dealing with technology and worked to bring China\u2019s largest internet companies, all of them private, into closer cooperation with Beijing.Still, others expressed skepticism that such complaints would have any major impact on Chinese government personnel moves. Rogier Creemers, a researcher in Chinese law and governance at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said he believed the next move for Mr. Lu would most likely be a promotion in the propaganda department or perhaps a position running a Chinese province.\u201cI think we would have seen different signs if he had been taken out,\u201d Mr. Creemers said. \u201cGenerally there would be more rumors about it. Pretty much every senior leader who has been taken out has been preceded by rumors, and we haven\u2019t really seen anything big about Lu Wei.\u201dCiting a recent decline in the influence of China\u2019s propaganda arm, Mr. Creemers said Mr. Lu might well be given the task of reinvigorating it, especially given how quickly he was able to establish the Cyberspace Administration\u2019s control of the internet in the country.\u201cLu Wei\u2019s biggest victory was he took the government from a place where they feared technology and were behind to one where they were in control of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe nailed Jell-O to the wall.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Why LinkedIn Will Make You Hate Microsoft Word", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe companies\u2019 chief executives, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, explained their reasons for the deal in a PowerPoint presentation distributed to investors. In the center of a graphic titled, \u201cA professional\u2019s profile everywhere,\u201d was a picture of an anonymous LinkedIn \u201cprofessional\u201d with arrows pointed outward to seven Microsoft products.Outlook and Skype were two of these, and the usefulness of bringing in information from LinkedIn to those applications is pretty clear \u2014 you could put faces to the annoyingly persistent invitations from strangers on LinkedIn \u2014 if a little underwhelming.But there were also arrows to Windows, to PowerPoint, to Excel and, most surprisingly, to Word. I\u2019m not a Microsoft shareholder myself, but I am one of the 1.2 billion users of Microsoft Office, and I was baffled to see my workhorse word-processing software show up in the rationale for this deal.Mr. Nadella supplied one explanatory clue in an email that he sent to Microsoft employees. \u201cThis combination will make it possible for new experiences,\u201d he wrote, such as \u201cOffice suggesting an expert to connect with via LinkedIn to help with a task you\u2019re trying to complete.\u201d He went on to predict that such experiences would \u201cget more intelligent and delightful.\u201d\u201cDelightful\u201d is not the first adjective that comes to mind here, or even the 10th. If I\u2019m working in Word, I can\u2019t see why I\u2019d welcome the intrusion of even a close friend, let alone a bot telling me about a stranger pulled from LinkedIn\u2019s database.My version of Word, a relatively recent one, is not that different from the original, born in software\u2019s Pleistocene epoch. It isn\u2019t networked to my friends, family and professional contacts, and that\u2019s the point. Writing on Word may be the only time I spend on my computer in which I can keep the endless distractions in the networked world out of sight.Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, an associate professor of English at the University of Maryland and author of \u201cTrack Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing,\u201d said the move reflected a failure to understand what writers need. \u201cMost of the most innovative writing tools now on the market position themselves precisely as distraction-free platforms,\u201d he said.But he also said that the idea of a LinkedIn-infused Microsoft Word was very much in keeping with the flawed \u201cOffice Everywhere\u201d strategy of Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessors, Steven A. Ballmer and, before him, Bill Gates. One of the hallmarks of the Gates-Ballmer years was the too-high priority accorded to new products closely tied to Windows and Office. That strategy invited antitrust suits, and it also helped prevent the company from creating new businesses wholly independent of the two cash cows.Until now, Mr. Nadella has actively eschewed that strategy and unwound many of his predecessors\u2019 bad decisions. But I suspect that both Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner are afflicted with extremely bad cases of Facebook envy. Every tech company, including Microsoft, contemplated buying, or actually tried to buy, Facebook in its early days, and all are haunted by the thought of the deal that got away. Today, Facebook\u2019s market capitalization is about $320 billion, not that far behind Microsoft\u2019s $394 billion.But if chief executives of the other tech companies can no longer buy Facebook, they can still borrow the language that its founder Mark Zuckerberg uses, especially his key phrase, the \u201csocial graph.\u201dIn a joint conference call with Mr. Weiner on Monday, Mr. Nadella spoke of \u201csocial selling\u201d and the \u201cMicrosoft graph,\u201d the latter of which Mr. Weiner immediately renamed the \u201ccorporate graph.\u201d That, in turn, is to be mated with LinkedIn\u2019s \u201cprofessional graph,\u201d producing a new thing, \u201cthe world\u2019s first economic graph.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s and LinkedIn\u2019s \u201cgraphs\u201d will be connected, Mr. Nadella said, and \u201cthat\u2019s when the magic starts to happen in terms of how digital work gets completed.\u201d What Mr. Nadella fails to see is how extending LinkedIn\u2019s \u201csocial fabric\u201d to Word will kill the magic, not speed it up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: China Has the World\u2019s Most Powerful Computer (Again)", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byBitsBy some measures, China now has the world\u2019s best computer. The question is whether America should worry about it.The United States was a strong second, but it used to dominate the list. From the American point of view, not good.Perhaps as impressive as the outcome is the means by which the machines\u2019 engineers arrived at the output. The United States does not allow the shipment of advanced semiconductors to China, because chips of that kind can be used in weapons design. So the winning team figured out how to string together over 40,000 Chinese-made chips, each with the processing power of a nice smartphone.That achievement also underlines some shortcomings in viewing this as a straightforward competition, however. The winning computer required as much power as would be needed for 15,000 American homes, and seemed to hit that power level by using relatively little memory.It is a fine machine, but it may not be a very practical machine. The real race now may be how quickly China can develop its own artificial intelligence industry, along with high-performance semiconductors. These could, if combined with the networking know-how shown by this machine, make a severely daunting computer. It is spending billions on that effort.Even more than for the bragging rights, supercomputers now matter for everything from weather forecasting to packaged-goods design. They are increasingly important for the great number of products and processes that are being developed using A.I.The United States lost the race to the top in supercomputers, but it still placed pretty well. It had 165 machines on the list, compared with 167 for China. Japan, which came in third, had 29 computers on the list. The United States had the largest number of supercomputers in the top 20.And the United States has leading researchers in A.I., both in universities and at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The companies matter because they have lots and lots of data on which to train machines, a critical part of making algorithms work better.Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of semiconductors, is now focusing on the use of high-performance chips in commercial A.I., particularly as part of overall computing systems of chips and data. On Monday, Intel showed the latest A.I. features of its high-end commercial chips at an international supercomputing conference in Germany.One feature that figured in the presentation was the ability to deliver nine times the performance of other commercial A.I. systems for the same money. That is a metric the supercomputing list doesn\u2019t consider. But, as they say, it\u2019s money that matters.\u201cPeople miss the importance of making powerful machines accessible to everyone,\u201d said Nidhi Campbell, who runs Intel\u2019s work in this area. \u201cThis has implications for lots of things in the future, like autonomous cars, but first it has to work easily and well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It doesn\u2019t exist.)The biggest enemy of women, we\u2019re warned, is a powerful woman. Queen bees refuse to help other women. If you approach one for advice, instead of opening a door, she\u2019ll shut the door before you can even get your foot in. We\u2019ve often heard women lower their voices and confess, \u201cIt hurts me to say this, but the worst boss I ever had was a woman.\u201dBut statistically that isn\u2019t true.But the person blocking the second woman\u2019s path wasn\u2019t usually a queen bee; it was a male chief executive. When a woman was made chief executive, the opposite was true. In those companies, a woman had a better chance of joining senior management than when the chief executive was a man.And it\u2019s time for all of us to stop judging the same behavior more harshly when it comes from a woman rather than a man. Women can disagree \u2014 even compete \u2014 and still have one another\u2019s backs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.The policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.Last month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.Kanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201dMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.Opening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201dThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.Mr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.Apple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bad Faith of the White Working Class", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byI THINK I was 11 when, teary-eyed and exhausted, I asked my grandmother whether God loved us. It had been an unusually terrible day for my sister and me. Our mother had called us worthless, threatened us, and then nearly crashed our car during a violent outburst. Things like this happened often in my family and among my friends, but not all on the same day.At the time, it was a profoundly important question. The evangelical Christian faith I\u2019d grown up with sustained me. It demanded that I refuse the drugs and alcohol on offer in our southwestern Ohio town, that I treat my friends and family kindly and that I work hard in school. Most of all, when times were toughest, it gave me reason to hope.I\u2019m hardly alone in benefiting from that faith. Research suggests that children who attend church perform better in school, divorce less as adults and commit fewer crimes. Regular church attendees even exhibit less racial prejudice than their nonreligious peers. The M.I.T. economist Jonathan Gruber found that for many of these traits, this relationship is causal: It\u2019s not just that privileged kids who attend church skew the data, but that attending services produces good character.These benefits apply broadly, across a range of faiths, so the phenomenon appears unrelated to doctrine or place. Undoubtedly, church fish fries and picnics help build social cohesion. It was at my dad\u2019s medium-size evangelical church \u2014 my first real exposure to a sustained religious community \u2014 that I first saw people of different races and classes worshiping together. The church even collected money to help families in need and established a small school and home for single expectant mothers.Though many working-class whites have lost any ties to church, they haven\u2019t necessarily abandoned their faith. More than one in three identify as evangelical, and well over 75 percent claim some Christian affiliation. But that faith has become deinstitutionalized. They may watch megachurch broadcasts or join prayer circles on Facebook, but they largely avoid the pews on Sunday. Consequently, many absorb the vernacular and teachings of modern Christianity, but miss out on the advantages of church itself.This deinstitutionalization of the faith has occurred alongside its politicization. It\u2019s hard to believe that in 1976, evangelicals helped deliver the White House to the liberal Democrat Jimmy Carter. But fueled by social issues like abortion, the religious right soon began to exercise broad influence among American Christians. By 2004, \u201cvalues voters\u201d became so synonymous with the Republican Party that George W. Bush\u2019s re-election was largely attributed to them.While it\u2019s hard to fault people for voting their conscience, this fusion of religion and politics necessarily forces people to look externally. The sometimes tough love of the Christian faith of my childhood demanded a certain amount of self-reflection and, occasionally, self-criticism. While faith need not be monolithic \u2014 it can motivate both voting behavior and character development \u2014 focus matters. A Christianity constantly looking for political answers to moral and spiritual problems gives believers an excuse to blame other people when they should be looking in the mirror.Evangelicals appear to have taken this message to heart. The most significant evangelical contribution to fiction in the past 20 years was the apocalyptic \u201cLeft Behind\u201d series. The books are riveting, but their core message is that corrupt, evil elites have gone to war against Christians. Some version of this idea \u2014 whether delivered in church or on TV \u2014 finds its way into many topics in a modern evangelical sermon: Evolution is a lie that secular science tells to counter the biblical creation story, the gay rights movement usurps God\u2019s law. Recently, a friend sent me the online musings of a televangelist who advised his thousands of followers that the Federal Reserve achieved satanic ends by manipulating the world\u2019s money supply. Paranoia has replaced piety.This paranoia harms the most vulnerable Christians the most of all. A few months ago I visited with a few teachers from my old high school and asked them how we might give kids in our community a better shot \u2014 at a good job, perhaps, or at least a peaceful family life. The mood grew somber. One told me that after a student, a bright young man from a \u201crough home,\u201d stopped showing up to class, she drove to his house on a school day to check on him. She found him and his seven siblings home alone, her promising student too preoccupied with tending to his brothers and sisters to care much about school. A younger teacher, listening intently, sighed: \u201cThey want us to be shepherds to these kids, but so many of them are raised by wolves.\u201dIn the white working class, there are far too many wolves: heroin, broken families, joblessness and, more often than we\u2019d like to believe, abusive and neglectful parents. Confronted with those forces, we need, most of all, a faith that provides the things my faith gave to me: introspection, moral guidance and social support. Yet the most important institution in our lives, if it exists at all, encourages us to point a finger at faceless elites in Washington. It encourages us to further withdraw from our communities and country, even as we need to do the opposite.It\u2019s hardly surprising that into that vacuum has stepped Donald J. Trump. For many, he is the only thing left that offers camaraderie, community and a sense of purpose. Predictably, Mr. Trump fared best among evangelicals who rarely attended church. In Missouri, for instance, Ted Cruz beat Mr. Trump 56 percent to 30 percent among frequent churchgoers; among those attending church only \u201ca few\u201d times per year, Mr. Trump won handily.Mr. Trump, like too much of the church, offers little more than an excuse to project complex problems onto simple villains. Yet the white working class needs neither more finger-pointing nor more fiery sermons. What it needs is the same thing I needed many years ago: a reassurance that God does indeed love us, and a church that demonstrates that love to a broken community.J. D.

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Dropout Army", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHE battle between Gawker and the tech titan Peter Thiel has made him look like a spiteful manipulator with a bully wallet. But this characterization is incomplete. The stakes and ambitions of Mr. Thiel\u2019s back-room lawsuit-jiggering are fairly trivial compared with many of his endeavors \u2014 some stealthy, some gleefully public \u2014 to rewire the world to his liking.For Mr. Thiel, business is never just business. His original vision for PayPal, which he helped found in 1998, was to create \u201ca new world currency, free from all government control and dilution \u2014 the end of monetary sovereignty.\u201d He considered his prescient investment in Facebook, in 2004, as \u201ca means to create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states.\u201dHow seriously should we take this billionaire libertarian who recently signed on to be one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s delegates? As one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most influential investors and talent-spotters, Mr. Thiel says he wants to steer entrepreneurs away from quick-and-profitable apps, toward ambitious, world-changing technology. In the manifesto for his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, he lamented, \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d But is Mr. Thiel capable of meaningfully changing the world \u2014 or even Silicon Valley?Consider his beef against academia. He has two degrees from Stanford \u2014 a B.A. and a J.D. \u2014 but in a conversation with me last year, he compared elite universities to the pre-Reformation Catholic Church. \u201cYou have this priestly class of professors who aren\u2019t doing a whole lot of work, supported by a system dedicated to convincing people to buy indulgences and amass enormous debt for the dubious salvation that a diploma represents,\u201d he said.America\u2019s approximately $1.3 trillion in student debt \u201chas gone mostly to pay for lies that people tell about how great their education was,\u201d he added. He argues that the pressures of financing college often draw the best students into less useful careers like investment banking, \u201cholding back innovation and leading to a technology deficit that could have catastrophic economic consequences.\u201dIn 2010, this would-be Martin Luther announced his solution: The Thiel Fellowship, which each year would offer 20 \u201cuniquely talented\u201d teenagers $100,000 to forgo college and pursue \u201cradical innovation that will benefit society.\u201d Today\u2019s future Zuckerbergs shouldn\u2019t be wasting time in lecture halls and football stadiums; they should be building businesses.The idea is, according to Larry Summers, a former president of Harvard, \u201cthe single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade.\u201d Yes, there is a need for reform, Mr. Summers told me recently, \u201cbut the idea of using philanthropic dollars to bribe people to drop out of college is a very dangerous one.\u201dFellows were selected via a competition that culminated in a two-minute pitch to Mr. Thiel and a team of judges \u2014 a gentler version of \u201cShark Tank.\u201d The winning dropouts included the 17-year-old biology prodigy Laura Deming, who had entered M.I.T. at 14 with the goal of eliminating aging-related disease \u2014 a pursuit that has become one of Mr. Thiel\u2019s core personal and investment interests. \u201cIt\u2019s theoretically possible for humans to live for hundreds of years,\u201d Ms. Deming told the judges. \u201cI want to figure out how.\u201dThese fellows were an impressive lot; they drew on their benefactor\u2019s connections to capitalize projects that ranged from cancer immunotherapy to a device for synthesizing genomes to artificial neural networks that can \u201cdream.\u201d\u201cPeter Thiel promised flying cars, we got caffeine spray instead,\u201d wrote the technology writer and entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa.To have a lasting impact, Mr. Thiel must move past the first iteration of Silicon Valley and toward the hardware and science revolutions that will usher in Silicon Valley 2.0. We already have enough OKCupids. We don\u2019t have enough of the desperately needed inventions \u2014 nuclear fusion energy or cancer cures \u2014 that emerge when credentialed scientists tinker away for years on expensive machines that have nothing to do with Snapchat. Of course, this sort of tinkering most often happens in the academic institutions that Mr. Thiel reviles, despite their role in the foundational breakthroughs \u2014 such as the internet \u2014 that enabled Mr. Thiel to build his $2.7 billion fortune.As his fellowship program matures, each class begins to look a little more like the creator himself; there are fewer ambitious research projects, and more of the kind of tech start-ups that fed Mr. Thiel\u2019s appetite for investing. Such a drift may have been inevitable. But there\u2019s also the fact that hard science is \u2026 well, hard.\u201cIt\u2019s true that civilization won\u2019t get to the next level if we\u2019re just doing thin software solutions,\u201d Mr. Thiel acknowledged. \u201cBut we need to consider not just whether an idea can change the world, but also whether it\u2019s feasible and has a clear path to market.\u201dMr. Thiel\u2019s fellow PayPal founder, Elon Musk, has managed to do both, parlaying his dot-com profits into space exploration, solar power and electric cars.Then again, if Mr. Thiel\u2019s role is limited to provocateur, that may not be a bad thing. It may be enough that he is forcing conversations \u2014 about news media misbehavior, about the costs and benefits of higher education, about the shape of future societies \u2014 that we need to have.\u201cEven if the fellowship has been just a $15 million P.R. campaign to get parents to think more cogently about their investments in their children\u2019s futures,\u201d said Dale J. Stephens, a Thiel Fellow who founded an experiential learning program called UnCollege, \u201cthen I think it\u2019s been wildly successful.\u201dOf all Mr. Thiel\u2019s social-engineering enthusiasms, one I would have most loved to see play out is Seasteading, an initiative to create libertarian utopias on artificial islands in the middle of oceans. In 2008 Mr. Thiel and the activist Patri Friedman founded the Seasteading Institute, with the goal of building these communities. Seasteading, Mr. Thiel wrote, could \u201ccreate a new space for freedom\u201d where entrepreneurial leaders, working beyond the reach of governments and their pesky laws, could take society forward.Recently Mr. Thiel suggested that he\u2019d gone cold on Seasteading, because of cost and practicality. Unmentioned was the possibility that the experiment would have come to an ideologically inconvenient conclusion: that a small island \u2014 whether created by nature or man \u2014 would be an astonishingly bad place to live without rules.Perhaps there are some conversations Mr. Thiel would rather not push too far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Wimbledon Wild Card, Life Feels Lifted From a Hollywood Script", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 \u201cWimbledon,\u201d a movie released 12 years ago, was a romantic comedy about a British tennis player on the verge of retirement who finds love, and then unlikely success at the tournament.Over the past four months, Marcus Willis, a 25-year-old from Slough, England, has starred in a real-life version of the film, all but re-enacting its implausible plot points on the way to his unlikely spot in the Wimbledon main draw, scheduled to begin Monday.Willis, ranked 775th before the qualifying tournament, had nearly given up on his dreams of reaching Wimbledon and was planning to move to Philadelphia, where offers of coaching jobs were waiting.\u201cI was adamant I was going to go to America to coach,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI had called up someone about the visa \u2014 and then I met a girl. She basically told me I was an idiot and that I should keep going, and I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201dShortly before he had planned to leave in February, Willis met Jennifer Bate, a dentist and a mother of two. Bate said she was out on the town with a cousin as each tried to shake off \u201cwrong relationships\u201d that had just ended.\u201cWe just met, and honestly, it was a blur after that,\u201d Bate said. \u201cWe went on a little walk to get some fresh air before we\u2019d get a cab. He said, \u2018I\u2019m meant to be going to America soon,\u2019 and I was like: \u2018What? You can\u2019t go to America.\u2019 The night we met, I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just met me; you can\u2019t just move to America.\u2019 I said it jokingly, and then he told me he was a tennis player. I thought, \u2018Yeah, right, whatever.\u2019 \u201dAfter experiencing what she called \u201clove at first sight,\u201d Bate rushed home to tell her mother she had met \u201cthe one,\u201d and Willis postponed his plans to leave England. With Bate\u2019s encouragement, Willis rededicated himself to tennis, despite having endured injuries and financial hardships in recent years. In 2014, struggling with touring expenses, Willis had started a crowdfunding campaign seeking support in getting to his \u201cchildhood dream\u201d tournament.In 2016, he had played only one event, a January tournament in Tunisia at the lowest rung of sanctioned professional tennis, earning just $356. But his falling ATP ranking was just high enough to get him the last direct entry into a Wimbledon qualifying wild-card playoffs for British players. Once there, he won three matches to reach the tournament\u2019s main qualifying event.Though British wild cards often prove to be overmatched cannon fodder in the qualifying tournament, Willis played with confidence. In his first match, against the 99th-ranked Yuichi Sugita, Willis came back from losing the first set, 6-1, to notch his first career victory over a top-100 opponent. With his unorthodox left-handed barrage of chunked slices and serve-and-volley, Willis continued his winning ways in the next two matches, beating the Russians Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev and becoming the first British player to reach the Wimbledon singles main draw through qualifying since 2008. By doing so, he guaranteed himself prize money of at least 30,000 British pounds.Andy Murray, who ended 77 years without a British men\u2019s singles champion at Wimbledon when he won here in 2013, had practiced with Willis at the Davis Cup years earlier and called Willis\u2019s qualifying a \u201creally cool story.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s an awkward player, has got quite a different sort of game style,\u201d Murray said. \u201cServe-and-volleys a little bit. He\u2019s got really good touch, good volleys, puts a lot of slice on his slice backhand, quite a spinny forehand. He\u2019s quite an unusual player.\u201dThose unnerving, unconventional weapons were on display when Willis made his previous best career run, to the quarterfinals of a Challenger-level tournament in Knoxville, Tenn., in 2014. There, Willis also gained notice for his tubby physique, which inspired one Facebook heckler to call him Cartman, after Eric Cartman, the corpulent cartoon 10-year-old from \u201cSouth Park.\u201dWillis embraced the nickname, and while he is still bulkier than many in the sport, he has dropped 55 pounds. He still readily pokes fun at himself.\u201cIt\u2019s good banter; I enjoy it,\u201d he said.If he wins his opening-round match Monday against the 53rd-ranked Ricardas Berankis on Court 17, a possible second-round encounter with the seven-time champion Roger Federer looms.His weekend at Wimbledon playing among the game\u2019s best \u2014 \u201cI saw Djokovic earlier, and my jaw dropped; I\u2019m going to act cool and pretend it\u2019s all normal now,\u201d he said \u2014 has proved equally invigorating.\u201cI\u2019m delighted, but it makes me realize I want it week in, week out now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep working, keep my head down, and get on with it.\u201dBate, who was unable to cancel her Monday dental patients\u2019 appointments, will follow his first-round match from afar. She said she believed she would have many more opportunities to watch Willis continue toward a Hollywood ending.\u201cSomething in his mind has just clicked, and he\u2019s ready now,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking it all in, and he\u2019s got plenty more in him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A bull might be more appropriate.The company, which is famous across Asia for its use of cute, animated emoticons it calls stickers, is seeking to raise about $1 billion in listings in New York and Tokyo next month, according to a filing on Friday. That would value Line at more than $5 billion, which could make it the biggest market debut for a technology company so far this year.Line also lets people share images and make voice calls. It makes money by selling stickers of characters like Brown, its poker-faced ursine mascot, and through video games and conventional advertising.Like other Asian rivals, Line allows celebrities and brands to host official accounts to engage with users over social media. More recently, it has added ride-hailing and online payments to increase its sources of revenue.Line, which has more than 200 million users, is the messaging mainstay in Japan, the third-largest economy in the world, after the United States and China. It has been competing with the likes of WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, and WeChat, owned by Tencent of China, to draw smartphone users in markets across Asia.

{"Headline": "Facebook Envy Lures Egyptian Teenagers to Europe and the Migrant Life", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byBURG MIGHEIZIL, Egypt \u2014 In the raggedy fishing village of Burg Migheizil on Egypt\u2019s north coast, where the mighty Nile pours silently into the sea, restless teenage boys are plotting their escape, lured by illusory dreams of money and glamour.One 15-year-old said that five of his friends had already made it to Italy after perilous sea journeys that started in the hush of night. Some worked for the smugglers, piloting boats filled with paying migrants in exchange for free passage. Others paid their way.Nearly all sent home, on Facebook, envy-inducing photos and bravura accounts of new lives: money, girls, flashy new sneakers. The teenager, Ashraf, who asked not to be identified because his father worked for the local government, said he intends to leave soon, too.Experts are struggling to understand what lies behind the soaring figures. Unlike other migrant countries, Egypt does not suffer a raging civil war or debilitating poverty. Instead they point to a crippling cocktail of factors: a stalling local economy; permissive Italian laws that indirectly encourage child migration; a proliferation of smuggling networks; and El Dorado-like examples of other Egyptian teenagers who have made it.The teenagers are oblivious to the calamitous images of death at sea \u2014 capsizing boats, bodies floating to shore \u2014 that dominate news coverage. Instead, they fixate on images of apparent success sent back via social media \u2014 even if those images often mask a grittier and more dangerous reality that includes exploitation, petty crime and prostitution.In Burg Migheizil, which has been devastated by decades of overfishing in Egyptian waters, smuggling has become the anchor of the local economy. At night, buses from Alexandria and Cairo bump through the dusty streets, carrying migrants on their way to a nearby beach, where they are hustled onto waiting boats.Unemployed fishermen moonlight as smugglers, piloting boats across the Mediterranean. Farmers harbor African and Syrian migrants before they clamber aboard. The local shipyard has enjoyed a small boom, as laborers fashion steel-hulled vessels that carry people instead of fish.None are breaking the law \u2014 under a quirk of Egyptian law, smuggling people is not illegal.Often, though, the trade takes a dark turn. In early June, villagers said, dozens of African migrants were stranded there after an argument between rival human traffickers caused them to miss their boat.Weeks before that, two bodies washed up on a local beach. Egyptian news reports identified the dead as a 20-year-old Egyptian and a Somali man.In Europe, many smugglers end up in jail. In interviews, several tearful parents and spouses told of how their young relatives had been arrested by the European police. A local fishermen\u2019s group said that more than 4,000 men from Kafr el Sheikh, the governorate that includes Burg Migheizil, have been imprisoned or detained in Europe on smuggling charges.The families of departed teenagers are caught between their desire for their children to find a better life and regret that they have left. At her home at the end of an alleyway, Nasara Shawky clutched a photo of her two sons, 16 and 17 years old, now in Rome. \u201cI feel so lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cThis entire village has been destroyed by the sea.\u201dFor restless young men, little can deter their dreams of flight. Ehab Nasser, 21, said he hated his job as a fisherman. Life at sea was cruel and lonely, he said \u2014 long trips into the dangerous waters of war-torn Libya in search of fish, often for as little as $100 a month. Two years ago he smuggled himself into Greece, after pawning his mother\u2019s wedding dowry, at a price of 2,500 euros (about $2,800).That trip ended in a Greek detention center, and with eventual deportation back to Egypt. But he will try again soon. His eyes lit up as he showed a picture on Facebook of his neighbor Ismail, now in London. In the picture, a young man fanned a wad of British pounds, his thumb raised, while casually dragging on a cigarette.\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.But every success story is countered by a tear-stained episode. At a farmhouse surrounding by towering date palms, Mohamed El Ghatani, a farmer, told of how he learned that his 16-year-old nephew, Amir, drowned on his way to Europe last month.Only two years earlier, Mr. Ghatani said, his own son died in the same manner. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said, his eyes reddening at the memory. \u201cThey think they\u2019ll get to Europe and find an amazing life. That\u2019s not true, of course, but they don\u2019t know that.\u201dThe main problem, said Naela Gabr, a senior diplomat who heads Egypt\u2019s official efforts to stem illegal migration, is Italian law, which forbids the involuntary deportation of unaccompanied minors.The Italian state provides foreign minors with schooling and temporary papers. Once they reach the age of 18, they can apply for permanent residency \u2014 a powerful draw for families to send their teenage boys.A lot of the time, though, it doesn\u2019t work so simply, said Ms. Valastro, the aid worker in Rome. Desperate to start repaying their parents\u2019 loans, many Egyptian migrants seek to start work immediately, which hurts their chances of getting schooling or official papers.Last year, some reports described Egyptian youths selling drugs or engaging in prostitution at Rome\u2019s main train station. But mostly, Ms. Valastro said, they end up working for pitiful wages in restaurants or fruit markets.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand the meaning of the word \u2018exploitation,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey think these people are helping them because they are giving them money, even if it\u2019s just 10 euros for eight hours work.\u201dNow the Egyptian government is taking the fight to Facebook. Ms. Gabr said she had prepared a public-relations campaign to persuade young Egyptians not to leave their homeland.But Ehab Nasser, the restless young fisherman, said he was determined to leave regardless, and his family was firmly behind him.His mother, Azza Abdel Fattah, gestured at the room of flaking paint and crumbling walls they were sitting in. \u201cWe wanted him to get to Europe and build a future and save us from this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what we are praying for.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Immigrant\u2019s Contribution to Mount Rushmore Is Recognized, 75 Years Later", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported bySet in stone is supposed to mean immutable, but Luigi Del Bianco\u2019s determined descendants just now appear to be winning the official affirmation that the Italian-American from Westchester County deserved long ago for shaping one of the nation\u2019s most famous monuments.\u201cIf being the chief carver at Mount Rushmore is not the American dream for an immigrant to these lands, what is?\u201d said Douglas Gladstone, the author of the 2014 book, \u201cCarving a Niche for Himself: The Untold Story of Luigi Del Bianco.\u201dHundreds of workers finished sculpting the faces of four American presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lincoln) into Rushmore\u2019s granite southeast slope in the Black Hills of South Dakota 75 years ago. They toiled under the direction of Gutzon Borglum, the designer and chief engineer, and his son Lincoln, and their names are listed at the monument as part of a team effort.Cameron Sholly, the director of the Midwest region for the National Park Service, which includes South Dakota, said that when he assumed the position last year he began reassessing Del Bianco\u2019s role at the request of the carver\u2019s 53-year-old grandson Lou.Correspondence provided by Lou Del Bianco, who lives in Port Chester, and research by park service historians, convinced Mr. Sholly that for whatever reason, Luigi Del Bianco\u2019s contribution had been overlooked.\u201cHe is worth any three men I could find in America, for this particular type of work,\u201d Borglum wrote, in documents that Lou Del Bianco and an uncle, Caesar Del Bianco, discovered at the Library of Congress. \u201cHe is the only intelligent, efficient stone carver on the work who understands the language of the sculptor.\u201dDel Bianco was born in 1892 aboard a ship near Le Havre, France, as his parents were returning to Italy from the United States. Raised in Meduno, northeast of Venice, he studied stone carving in Vienna and Venice starting when he was 11. He immigrated to Vermont when a cousin wrote that skilled carvers were in demand there.He returned to fight for Italy in World War I, went back to Vermont in 1920 and finally settled in Port Chester, where a fellow carver introduced him to Borglum, who hired him to work at his studio in North Stamford, Conn., as well as to his future wife, Nicoletta Cardarelli.Del Bianco and Borglum worked together briefly on the Confederate Memorial on Stone Mountain in Georgia, and on the Wars of America Memorial in Newark (Del Bianco was a model for a number of the figures). In 1933, Del Bianco was recruited to Mount Rushmore, eventually as chief carver at $1.50 an hour, or $72 a week. (He quit twice when financing ran out.)As chief carver, his priority was refining the facial expressions on the presidents\u2019 60-foot-high heads. He fixed a foot-deep crack in Jefferson\u2019s lip with a patch and he sculpted Lincoln\u2019s eyes, highlighting the pupils with wedge-shaped granite stones to reflect the light.\u201cI know every line and ridge, each small bump and all the details of that head so well,\u201d he told The Herald Statesman of Yonkers in 1966.In 1941, the elder Borglum died, financing dried up, plans to carve the torsos of the presidents to the waist were abandoned and Del Bianco returned to Port Chester, where his company carved hundreds of tombstones. He died in 1969 at 78 of silicosis, which is caused by inhaling dust from crushed stone.\u201cThe doctors were amazed that he lived as long as he lived,\u201d his daughter Gloria told National Public Radio in 2012, \u201cbecause the dust in his lungs was like a rock.\u201dA campaign by Luigi\u2019s son Caesar to rectify the official oversight began in the late 1980s after he read Rex Allen Smith\u2019s \u201cThe Carving of Mount Rushmore,\u201d in which his father\u2019s role was ignored. Caesar, who died in 2009, enlisted his nephew Lou.Mr. Gladstone, the author of \u201cCarving a Niche for Himself,\u201d said that was like writing about the Yankees without mentioning Joe DiMaggio.\u201cAfter years of being dismissive to the family, the agency at last did the right thing,\u201d Mr. Gladstone said.The recognition on Facebook was also welcomed by Joseph Scelsa, the founder and president of the Italian American Museum in Manhattan.\u201cAfter 25 years, the National Park Service has finally acknowledged that Luigi Del Bianco was in fact the chief carver,\u201d Lou Del Bianco said. \u201cPermanent recognition at the mountain is what we are really after, but this is a breakthrough and a start in the right direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was more a matter of cleaning up shop. Her shop.\u201cThe Buddha is about all that\u2019s left,\u201d Ms. Gilbert, 46, said over the phone from Miami, where she was taking a break from promoting \u201cBig Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,\u201d her 2015 self-help book.\u201cIt was great and a really fun project, but my husband and I share this similar trait where once we\u2019ve made or built something, we no longer have any interest in it,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said.\u201cSo once we got that building renovated and the business was sort of running itself,\u201d she continued, \u201che very sheepishly came to me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t really feel like doing this Two Buttons thing anymore.\u2019 And around the same time, right after we had finished renovating this big house in Frenchtown, I very sheepishly said to him, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to live here anymore.\u2019\u201dMs. Gilbert and Mr. Nunes have since bought and renovated a smaller house in Frenchtown. \u201cWe\u2019re good at creating, but we\u2019re not good at sustaining things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we always let the other person have an out.\u201dThe experience was \u201cterrifying,\u201d she recalled. \u201cImmediately I started to see these really talented people coming in \u2014 this is a Midtown bar where people are coming from jobs on Broadway, a very different scene from hanging out at the National Hotel in Frenchtown.\u201d She decided to take her name off the waiting list for the microphone.Then her inner scold grabbed hold of her.\u201cI said to myself, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to do that anymore. You spend your life telling people they have to take creative risks, and you\u2019re about to publish this book that\u2019s essentially a manifesto,\u2019\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Israeli Worker Wins Case Claiming Abusive Treatment by Sara Netanyahu", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 An Israeli labor court on Tuesday awarded compensation to a former maintenance man in the official residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accepting the worker\u2019s claims of abusive terms of employment at the hands of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara.The court award was the latest blow to the Netanyahus, who are under scrutiny over the use of public funds and the management of their official and private households, and longstanding accusations that they have been living the high life at the expense of others.The Netanyahus have denied any wrongdoing. The Netanyahu family attorneys in the law office of Dr. J. Weinroth and Co. described the allegations of the maintenance worker as \u201cmendacious\u201d and said they had no basis in reality.The court award came two days after the police announced that they had completed a 15-month investigation of the prime minister\u2019s residences that focused on \u201ca number of issues that raised the suspicion of the commission of criminal offenses\u201d including fraud and breach of trust.Unusually, the police statement did not include the names of those involved or any recommendation of how to proceed with the case, saying only that the findings had been given to the Jerusalem district attorney for a decision on whether to press charges.But the Israeli news media widely reported that the police believed that there was sufficient evidence for indictments against Mrs. Netanyahu and two others: an electrician connected to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party and the deputy director for operations at the prime minister\u2019s office, Ezra Saidoff. Mr. Saidoff was also a defendant in the case decided on Tuesday.The Netanyahu family responded to the police announcement in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cContrary to the press reports Mrs. Netanyahu has not committed any crime.\u201d It added, \u201cThe various allegations raised by the news media will turn out to be baseless, like all the other allegations leveled against the Netanyahu family over the years.\u201dThe report also said that the Netanyahus had bypassed regulations to hire the electrician for repairs at the couple\u2019s private residence in Caesarea on weekends and holidays.The latest report by the state comptroller, published last week, revived long-running suspicions relating to some of the Netanyahu family\u2019s travels more than a decade ago, when Mr. Netanyahu was finance minister.Those suspicions, known as \u201cBibi Tours,\u201d involve allegations that Mr. Netanyahu, who is nicknamed Bibi, had private donors and organizations cover many of his flights abroad, and sometimes pay travel expenses for his wife and children, without informing the parliamentary authorities.The prime minister\u2019s office responded that after \u201cyears of bombastic headlines\u201d and reams of press reports, \u201cthe mountain has turned out to be a molehill. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s trips involved no conflict of interest, no double billing, nothing illegal.\u201dThe Netanyahus have accused critics in the Israeli news media of a long campaign to besmirch them and to undermine the Likud\u2019s hold on power. Many Israelis view Mrs. Netanyahu, a psychologist, as a highhanded, hot-tempered boss who has grown accustomed to the good life and wields immense influence over her husband.Mr. Netanyahu has won election after election. He is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all.Lawyers for the Netanyahu family said that because Mrs. Netanyahu was not a party to the case brought against the state by the former maintenance worker, Guy Eliyahu, she was unable to defend herself and bring \u201cdozens of witnesses\u201d who, according to the lawyers, would have refuted the allegations \u201cone by one.\u201dAccording to the court ruling, Mr. Eliyahu endured \u201creprimands, shouting, humiliation, excessive and even unreasonable demands.\u201d It said there was \u201can atmosphere of fear in the residence\u201d during the period of Mr. Eliyahu\u2019s employment, from June 2011 until June 2012, and that he was also made to work extraordinarily long hours.Mr. Eliyahu, who was awarded compensation of about 120,000 shekels (more than $30,000) from the state and the contracting company that employed him, was not the first to complain. In February the same court awarded compensation to a former caretaker of the prime minister\u2019s official residence, Meni Naftali, on similar grounds.Mr. Eliyahu told the court that one night he had gone home after midnight, but that Mrs. Netanyahu called him back to the residence because he had received the prime minister\u2019s permission to leave but not hers. In another episode, Mrs. Netanyahu is said to have pulled the tablecloth off a table that had been set on a patio for a Saturday lunch because she feared dust had gotten into the salads. She told Mr. Eliyahu and another worker to pick up everything and reset the table within five minutes, which they did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Costco\u2019s Transition to Visa Cards Riddled With Problems", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byOn Monday, Costco took the final step in severing its 17-year relationship with American Express and began exclusively accepting Visa for credit card purchases at its stores. For more than 11 million customers, the switch meant cutting up their Costco-branded American Express cards and swapping them for a new Visa card issued by Citigroup.A transition that executives promised would be seamless has turned into a customer service fiasco.Citigroup has logged more than 1.5 million customer service calls, according to Jennifer Bombardier, a spokeswoman for Citigroup.Costco\u2019s social media pages are filled with thousands of scathing complaints. Many customers say their new cards have not yet arrived, and some report problems activating or using their cards or getting access to their accounts online.The service issues have confounded regular customers. Derek Gamble, a Costco shopper who called Citigroup on Thursday to ask why he hadn\u2019t yet received his new card, reached a service representative but says he came away from the call feeling more puzzled than when he started.\u201cThe rep talked in circles for a while and said they\u2019re doing all they can and that I should have a card in five to seven business days,\u201d said Mr. Gamble, a lawyer in Temecula, Calif., in an interview. His request for a faster shipment was rebuffed. Until the card arrives, he says he\u2019s holding off on his weekly Costco shopping trip.Many retailers offer branded credit cards, but Costco\u2019s is uniquely powerful. The company made sales of nearly $114 billion last year to its 81 million members. For nearly two decades, it accepted no cards other than American Express at its retail stores.But last year, the companies said they would sever their relationship after a disagreement about renewal terms. \u201cThe numbers didn\u2019t add up,\u201d Kenneth I. Chenault, American Express\u2019s chief executive, said in a presentation to investors.Costco stopped accepting new card applications in November and has been working on its card transition plan for more than a year. But for customers, the switch came with an unusually abrupt deadline: As of Monday, their Costco-branded American Express cards stopped working for all new purchases, and customer information and account balances were transferred to Citigroup.Citigroup spent last weekend feverishly working to convert the millions of new cardholders it inherited onto its system.\u201cCiti completed one of the single largest portfolio conversions in history,\u201d Ms. Bombardier said. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to those who have been inconvenienced.\u201dCostco representatives did not return calls seeking comment.The last major store-branded card switch, when Walmart moved its cards from Discover to MasterCard in 2014, was done in phases, and customers were able to continue using their existing cards until they received and activated their new ones.That helped reduce the customer service load and avoid the deluge Citigroup is experiencing, said Matt Schulz, an analyst for CreditCards.com.\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be friction in these sorts of things, but the hubbub surrounding Costco is the biggest outcry that I can remember,\u201d he said.He expects the storm to subside in a few days as Citigroup smooths out its problems, but customers are also facing other irritations at the cash register, namely chip cards.Advertisement"}

More than 33 million people in Britain use Facebook each month, according to estimates by eMarketer, a research company.A few data points about the vast online conversation before the vote suggest that the people supporting the \u201cleave\u201d campaign were far more engaged on the issue than their opponents on social media.Using data pulled from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics firm that has a partnership with Facebook, The New York Times ranked Facebook pages that had the most engagement \u2014 how many people liked, shared and commented on posts \u2014 around the term \u201cEuropean Union\u201d over the last 30 days.Seven of the top 20 pages with the most engagement around \u201cEuropean Union,\u201d including the top two, were explicitly pro-exit. Together, these seven pages produced more than 1.3 million interactions \u2014 including the page for Nigel Farage, a leading proponent of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign, at No. 6.Only two pages \u2014 those of the group Britain Stronger in Europe, No. 8, and the British Prime Minister David Cameron, No. 18 \u2014 were clearly associated with \u201cremain\u201d campaigns, and together, they accounted for just under 150,000 interactions.A search for \u201cBrexit,\u201d the widely used shorthand for the vote, produced a similar ranking. Other top pages included British and American news organizations that had broad news coverage, as well as pro-leave and pro-remain opinion columns.An analysis of two opposing campaign pages underscores the wide gap in reader activity. By Friday, a primary page for the \u201cremain\u201d campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe, had passed 558,000 followers. Its close counterpart \u2014 Leave. EU \u2014 led in followers, at just over 767,000. But the pages\u2019 total engagement figures, which approximate total conversations around all their posts, were far more disparate.Over the last six months, posts on \u201cremain\u201d pages resulted in more than 3.3 million interactions \u2014 that is likes, shares and comments \u2014 averaging about 475,000 a month. The \u201cleave\u201d page produced more than 11 million, or about three times as many.Between these groups, the official \u201cleave\u201d message, in other words, landed harder and most likely spread further on Facebook by a large margin.This month, Vyacheslav Polonski, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, published a study of Brexit campaigns\u2019 activity on Instagram. Mr. Polonski analyzed the activities of over 15,000 users who engaged in the referendum debate.Social media, by nature, is both a catalyst and a place for conversation. As such, the apparent dominance of pro-leave posts on Facebook and Instagram is neither a pure reflection of popular will nor a product of the services, but more likely something in between.A full picture of voter sentiment on social media is visible only to the social media companies themselves. And the rate at which sharing and engaging on a social media platform translates into action is difficult to quantify.Leave.

He said he was now \u201cterrified\u201d about the country\u2019s economic prospects.Louise Driscoll, a 21-year-old barista in London, spent most of the day crying. \u201cI had a bad feeling in my gut,\u201d she said of Britain\u2019s referendum on Europe. \u201cWhat do we do now? I\u2019m very scared.\u201d Her parents both voted to leave the bloc, she said, and \u201cwill probably be gloating.\u201dAccording to pre-election surveys by the polling organization Survation, 57 percent of Britons between the ages of 18 and 34 who intended to take part in Thursday\u2019s referendum supported remaining in the bloc, while an identical proportion \u2014 57 percent \u2014 of Britons over 55 supported the opposite: leaving Europe behind.For those under 25, the desire to remain in the union was especially high: Three-quarters wanted Britain to stay in Europe.Many young people in Britain have grown up thinking of European integration as a given, not a political experiment that would be rolled back before they could fully take part in it.They are often more comfortable living in a multicultural society than their elders are, particularly in cities like London and Edinburgh, which are flooded by people from across the Continent to study and work.Many young Britons expressed astonishment, anger or despair that their parents and grandparents would seek to limit the travel, exposure to other cultures and opportunities to work and study abroad that being part of the European Union has afforded them.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.It failed, but the Remain campaign still pushed to register young voters, with some success: The deadline to register was extended by two days after a voter-registration website crashed because it was overwhelmed by visitors.But it was not enough.The vote \u201cis very damaging,\u201d Mr. Jack said, adding that he now welcomed a second referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, because \u201cit\u2019s better being inside the European Union.\u201dOf course, many young people supported the push to rid themselves of Europe. Ben Kew, 21, said he spent 30 hours at the Leave headquarters, watching the results come in.\u201cI was surprised; I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d go through with it, but I\u2019m pleased that the establishment has been given a kick,\u201d he said, adding that the vote was a moment when Britons expressed a desire for real change.But many young voters wondered what would happen to European Union funding for research and sciences. British universities currently receive about 16 percent of their research money and staff members from the European Union.James Calderbank, 21, a student at Falmouth University in Cornwall, England, wrote in an email: \u201cSince the early hours of this morning my Facebook newsfeed has been filled with my friends\u2019 disappointment that we are leaving the E.U.\u201dHe added: \u201cOur campus was part-funded by the E.U., so things are really not looking good for my university and its source of funds.\u201d Cornwall, as a fairly rural and less-developed part of southwest England, was also a beneficiary of economic aid from Brussels, he noted.Anxiety about the economy and immigration drove the Leave campaign\u2019s victory. But many young people said they thought the decision would only set back their prospects.\u201cI\u2019m already part of a generation stuck in rented property unable to buy my own house,\u201d Hannah Shaw, 25, who works at a National Health Service hospital and lives with her parents, wrote in an email. \u201cThe older generation seem so happy with the result, almost smug like it\u2019s some sort of victory completely unaware of the chaos they\u2019ve caused for my generation. I\u2019m dreading what will happen to employment, workers\u2019 rights, the environment and our economy.\u201dShe added that she had friends from countries like Slovakia, Poland, Spain and Romania.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see it affect them and think of the amazing people I\u2019ll never meet after we leave the E.U.,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.K. suddenly feels very small.\u201dMs. Shaw blamed the news media for spreading misinformation about European Union membership. \u201cA lot of the older generation rely on newspapers for all their facts and don\u2019t actually do any of their own research unlike my generation.\u201dJenna Ives-Moody, 19, a journalism student at the University of Huddersfield in northern England, wrote in an email that \u201cserious fact-based journalism within the U.K. is not valued by the majority of the English population.\u201dShe said the Leave campaign was driven by \u201ca misplaced ideal of reclaiming former glories within Britain,\u201d which she said was not common among young people \u201cwho embrace all aspects of being European.\u201dFear was palpable among the young people in London who have thronged the capital from elsewhere in Europe.\u201cWe\u2019ve already sent money to our countries because we know that in the following days the value of the pound is going to be down,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is sending money already.\u201dHe said he hoped to stay in London, where job opportunities are more plentiful than in Spain, but was unsure of his prospects.\u201cThere is a lot of worry about whether free control between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be affected,\u201d said Mr. Canavan.Mr. Canavan wasn\u2019t sure he would stay in Britain. \u201cI was thinking of going back in the future, but this could speed up the process,\u201d he said.Claire Barthelemy reported from London, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Edinburgh.

{"Headline": "Warriors, Tech\u2019s Team, Are Soaring Out of Reach", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 As soon as I got to Oracle Arena last week for the first game of the N.B.A. finals, I started scanning the floor for tech bigwigs.Now, in Oakland, the Golden State Warriors have \u2026 Eddy Cue.In other words, you can almost see the Warriors as a metaphor for the way the tech industry improves, but also unexpectedly risks ruining, pretty much everything it touches.\u201cOne of the tensions that exists with the Warriors now is the owners seem to have a feeling that, \u2018Oh, we bought this team, they got really good, but we do live in a market where there are people who are accustomed to paying ever-increasing prices for everything, so let\u2019s raise the prices for our tickets,\u2019\u201d said Josh Williams, a designer and basketball fanatic who holds Warriors season tickets. \u201cI do have a real concern that we might price out the quote-unquote real fans.\u201dMr. Williams is a recent convert to Warriors fandom. He moved to the Bay Area from Austin, Tex., a few years ago after selling his start-up, Gowalla, to Facebook. His seats, in the upper corner of the arena, cost about $50 a game, and are set to go up by about 40 percent next season.Prices have become a bigger issue in the last few weeks, as the Warriors landed in the finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. For the finals, the team sent prices through the roof.Given the prices and the team\u2019s connection with tech, I expected the crowd at Warriors games to resemble a venture capital firm\u2019s cocktail party \u2014 young, vaguely geeky, demure business types, mostly white, mostly men. I also felt a sense of embarrassment for jumping on the bandwagon. A couple of years ago, I barely knew the rules of basketball, but as the team kept defying odds and breaking records, I got a bad case of Warriors fever.Yet the crowd at the two games I attended this year, including the first finals game, was not a bunch of bandwagoners like myself. Warriors fandom is one of the few Bay Area experiences that still seems to cut across a wide swath of the population. The people who attend the games seem diverse in just about every way \u2014 by race, age, willingness to yell out and make a fool of oneself \u2014 except one: pretty much everyone wears a yellow Warriors T-shirt, and pretty much everyone looks overjoyed to be there.Katie Jansen, the chief marketing officer of a start-up called AppLovin, which owns a suite at the arena that it shares with employees and customers, echoed that idea.\u201cI\u2019ve met the owners of a suite a few suites down from us, and it\u2019s literally a bunch of Oakland natives, a group of men who\u2019ve been Warriors fans their whole lives, and they\u2019ve owned this box for 30 years,\u201d she said.Many of the techies who now flock to Oakland told me they love this vibe. \u201cThere is a real die-hard fan base there in Oakland, and there\u2019s something special happening in that arena right now,\u201d said Craig Butler, Spotify\u2019s newly hired vice president for engineering, who owns season tickets with a few of his buddies. \u201cThe energy level at Oracle right now is double what it is anywhere else \u2014 it\u2019s just the best show in town.\u201dAnd according to the team, the fan base isn\u2019t changing. Despite price increases, about 99.5 percent of season ticket holders decided to renew for next year \u2014 meaning only 23 people did not renew. The wait-list for season tickets is now over 30,000 names long. Many fans are likely gratified by the fact that their tickets are a good investment even at current prices.On average last year, Warriors tickets could be resold for 119 percent above face price, so a $100 ticket would fetch $219 on the secondary market, meaning that if you bought a season\u2019s pass and sold half your tickets, you would most likely recoup your investment.But how do you preserve the fan base as the entry price rises? The problem for the Warriors resembles, in broad strokes, the problem of housing in the Bay Area. There is a finite supply of tickets to the games, and in an industry that produces astonishing wealth, there will always be enough people with enough money to pay nearly any price for tickets.Basketball is a business, of course, and it is within the Warriors owners\u2019 rights to profit from the team\u2019s amazing success.\u201cMost people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on something, they want to get a return on their investment,\u201d Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who studies sports at Smith College, told me with some exasperation when I asked him if there was some way for the team to avoid raising prices and changing its fan culture now that it has found success.Another plan would be to increase ticket prices only on the wealthy. Mr. Williams, a lifelong fan of the Dallas Mavericks, pointed out that when Mark Cuban, another tech billionaire, purchased and revitalized that team, he went out of his way to keep ticket prices low.\u201cOne year my season tickets cost $24 a ticket, and I got my renewal package and they had dropped the price to $14,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt turned out what Mark was doing was jacking up the price on the lower bowl, where he knew the purchases were corporations, and reducing the price on the real fans upstairs.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Cuban confirmed that strategy.\u201cWe have decreased prices across the board multiple times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only tickets that have gone up marginally are our best seats.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t run the Mavs to maximize profits. We now make money. But it\u2019s more important to me that fans can always afford to come to games.\u201dWell, how\u2019s that for disruption?An earlier version of this column misstated the average percentage increase at which Warriors tickets could be resold last year. It was 119 percent above face price, not 119 percent of face price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dutch National Soccer Program Looks for a Total Reboot", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byGDANSK, Poland \u2014 As rain fell on this port city Wednesday evening, the players of Poland\u2019s national team bounced around with verve and pep. The fans chanted, \u201cPolska!\u201d over and over. The coaches barked and bayed.Their opponents from the Netherlands looked far more subdued. They were professional, to be sure, but there was less life, less anticipation. An hour before a relatively meaningless exhibition match, only two weeks after the long slog of the club season had ended, more than a few of the players looked, quite simply, as if they would have preferred to be anywhere but here.The Oranje looked smart and savvy and effective. Yet from that incredible height came a brutal collapse last fall during qualifying for the European Championship. And now, a lost summer looms as teams like Poland \u2014 as well as minnows such as Wales, Albania, Northern Ireland and Iceland \u2014 prepare to take part in an expanded European Championship while the Dutch, somehow, have to stay home.Bert van Oostveen, the chief executive of the Dutch federation, said in an interview that the sting of failure had been considerable, in part because the feeling was familiar. Van Oostveen noted that the Netherlands had had this happen before: good showings at the 2010 World Cup, the 1988 Euros and the 1978 World Cup were each followed by a poor performance in the next major tournament. So van Oostveen was candid in his assessment.\u201cWhat I see is that it is perhaps a Dutch mental sickness of thinking that you are really that good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has happened too much. People don\u2019t understand it is one thing to reach the top but to stay just as good is much, much harder.\u201dHe sighed and added: \u201cEveryone is frustrated we are not in France. The Dutch fans are famous for traveling, but they have nowhere to go.\u201dFor a small country of about 17 million, the Netherlands has a remarkable soccer history. Great teams, like that \u201988 team that won the Euros, and great players like Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp earned the Dutch a global stature. The national team\u2019s guiding philosophy, known as Total Football, became known (and taught) around the world.But this downturn feels like something greater than past problems. A generation of top players that includes van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder \u2014 who have been at the heart of the team for years \u2014 has deteriorated. Van Persie, 32, and Sneijder, 31, are playing on vanity contracts in the less-illustrious Turkish league; Robben, 32, is a shell of himself \u2014 mostly because of injuries \u2014 with Bayern Munich. None were called up to the team for this series of friendlies as the federation and Coach Danny Blind \u2014 who was hired in the midst of the qualifying collapse \u2014 wanted to give younger players a chance to develop.But that is a problem, too. Once known for its production of youth players, the Dutch academy system has struggled to churn out successors to its earlier stars. Memphis Depay, a Manchester United midfielder, is an obvious possibility, but the Dutch federation believes there should be many more, and it sees the paucity of top-tier prospects as indicative of a larger problem.That is part of why the federation undertook what was essentially a self-imposed audit of its entire operation last year, analyzing everything from resource allocation to mental-strength training. Even the long-ingrained Dutch tactics, focused on possession, interchanging positions and deliberate passing moves, were scrutinized.\u201cThe main thing was that the whole of football was being progressive and we found ourselves standing still,\u201d van Oostveen said. \u201cThe game is changing. The players are changing \u2014 the evolution of speed, ball position, playing in several systems. It is all happening. The really successful teams can play different systems; we need to be able to play more than one.\u201dThe Dutch solicited input from outsiders, asking foreign coaches like Arsenal\u2019s Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and the former A.C. Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi for their thoughts on where soccer was headed. Coaches from youth teams and professional teams were polled. Players contributed, too. The result was an 11-point plan \u2014 featuring larger ideas, such as increasing the quality of youth coaches, as well as more granular notions, like a renewed focus at all levels on defending \u2014 that Dutch officials see as a 10-year process.The goal, in short, is a complete overhaul. And if that means that the Netherlands also struggles through qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, then the federation is prepared to accept that.\u201cThe result should be seen in 2022, \u201924, \u201926,\u201d van Oostveen said. \u201cYou will not create in five months the new van Persie. We have to be realistic. The effects of all this for Russia? They will not be that huge. We hope we qualify; it is important. But it is a harder qualification than this last one, and we know that.\u201dThat reality leaves the Dutch fans, famous for their vigor, in an uncomfortable limbo. Balancing patience with the disbelief that still lingers over missing the Euros is difficult.Coen Westerhof, a Dutch fan from Almere, said that he \u201cwas just so mad\u201d about how the qualifying played out but that he had tried to accept the notion that it was time for \u201cold guys out, new guys in.\u201dWesterhof said he was among a group of Dutch fans who had decided to adopt Belgium, a neighbor to the south, in the Euros. After the Netherlands lost its penultimate game in qualifying, one fan started a Facebook page in an effort to organize a group of Dutch fans who wanted to learn Belgian fan songs, the Belgian national anthem and other things related to cheering for the Belgian team.More than 10,000 people joined the page right away. After the Dutch lost their final qualifier and were eliminated, over 110,000 more expressed interest.\u201cYou know,\u201d said Maurice Huismans, a D.J., \u201cwe have to do something.\u201dIndeed they do. A few hundred Dutch fans did show up at Energa Stadium on Wednesday, tucked into one corner, where they and 40,000 more optimistic Polish fans watched a mostly turgid exhibition on a sloppy field. The Dutch were rewarded, sort of, as the Netherlands took advantage of two horrendous defensive mistakes by Poland to win, 2-1.Nice as it was, it was the definition of an empty victory.The Poles, after all, are going to France. The Dutch are still figuring out where they go from here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Woman at the Boys\u2019 Reunion", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byMY friend Mark and I were in the suburbs of Philadelphia, on the campus of the all-boys Haverford School, where we\u2019d been students 40 years earlier. In the intervening years, I\u2019d become a woman, and he was now in a wheelchair. A lot had changed.One day, when I was a sophomore, somebody put me in a headlock and hauled me around the campus for a half-hour, a helpless, flailing thing. We had been friends once, my headlocker and I. But the way I figured, not anymore.At last he dropped me, in tears, on the ground. He called me a few epithets \u2014 the ones reserved for gay and trans people \u2014 and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what you get.\u201d Then I got up and went to class; I was late for bio.It\u2019s reunion season, and many of us are returning to the site of our adolescences. What drives us to revisit days that are almost universally remembered with a cringe?This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d been back. In the 15 years since I came out as trans, I\u2019d found myself surprisingly embraced, if not exactly understood, by my former classmates. In spite of everything, I had a lot of affection for Haverford, not least because it gave me the education I would need to survive my own life. Plus, there were my friends: guys with big hearts and weird nicknames like Basi and Linky and the Bees. The Bees and I had been particularly close once, but he\u2019d kept his distance since my transition.The event was taking place against a national conversation about transgender identities, the question of individual dignity mortifyingly reduced to a hallucinatory debate about North Carolinian toilets. Plenty of my classmates are conservatives, which is fine with me, although I\u2019d assumed that most of them voted Republican because they liked the idea of small government and low taxes, rather than because they hated immigrants, gay people and the poor. My parents had been Republicans like this, and once so had I.But a Facebook exchange with a classmate suggested things weren\u2019t so simple. My old friend Robert adored me now, he said, as did my classmates. But he was less comfortable with transgender people he did not know. \u201cPredators aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being asked to dismantle what has hitherto been a barrier to their efforts.\u201dAt the reunion, Robert came up and gave me a big hug and a kiss. I couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to feel anything but love for him, even if he did seem to think my existence constituted a Get Out of Jail Free card for predators. Was it only because I\u2019d known him since he was 12 that I felt such affection? Maybe it\u2019s just impossible to hate someone whose history you know. If so, was my classmates\u2019 acceptance of me more the result of loyalty than compassion?Mark and I ate shrimp. He\u2019d been a quadriplegic since a surfing accident when he was 28. Behind an assortment of cheeses, a slide show was playing; our younger selves looked out at us.\u201cYou know, when I look at these pictures, it\u2019s like I\u2019m looking at some whole other person,\u201d Mark said. He glanced at me in my black and blue dress. \u201cYou and me, we both had a before, and an after.\u201dThe same could be said for most of the 69 boys who had graduated in June 1976. One died of AIDS. One served in the George W. Bush White House. Another played for the New York Giants. Two came out as transgender women.Suddenly, the Bees appeared. \u201cListen, Boylan,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with you. It\u2019s just that I miss Jim \u2014 that guy you used to be. He was my bud. I don\u2019t need Jenny. Jim meant a lot to me.\u201dI said, \u201cBut the person you miss is still right here.\u201d The Bees just gave me a look, as if this could be true only if there was no actual difference between men and women.I thought about having hurt feelings about this exchange. But I knew what it was like to miss the younger version of someone I had loved. I wanted to say, listen, my brother: Sometimes I miss the person you used to be, too.Later, Mark drove me away from the school in his wheelchair-adapted van. Sitting shotgun, I wondered if the biggest difference between who I am now and who I was then is less the result of gender than of time. Is it because I\u2019m female now that I\u2019ve become more interested in compassion than righteousness? Or is this simply what the years do to you?I wished that my headlocker had come to the reunion. I\u2019d have told him I forgave him, that I understood that whoever he was back then was surely not the person he was destined to remain forever.I looked over at Mark. A wave had picked him up and left him changed. But then a wave had lifted us all.Jennifer Finney Boylan, a contributing opinion writer, is a professor of English at Barnard College and special adviser to the president of Colby College.Advertisement"}

Pinterest wants to be known as a network for inspiration in topics like travel, cooking and crafts, as well as for shopping both on and offline.At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google \u2014 a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.\u201cShopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday.Among the features are buyable \u201cpins,\u201d or buttons, in browsers that users can click to purchase items on the site, as well as a digital shopping bag that follows users from their desktops to their smartphones or tablets.Perhaps most interesting is Pinterest\u2019s object-detection software, a type of product search and discovery that companies like Amazon have tried. The software analyzes a photo of an object, such as a stuffed animal, recognizes it and highlights the item \u2014 or something like it \u2014 in a pop-up window. Users can then buy the item through Pinterest.The commerce-focused updates come as Pinterest, six years old and valued at roughly $11 billion, faces pressure to prove it can live up to the high expectations of investors.As other social networks like Facebook and Twitter have scaled back efforts to build e-commerce businesses, Pinterest has long said it will dedicate resources to make shopping on the site a regular activity.Advertisement"}

He even declared, on the few occasions I ever actually saw him wear one, that he hoped the man who invented these objects of asphyxiation suffered mightily during his own lifetime.Yet, when my dad died, it was his ties I turned to. After his funeral, I sat on the floor of his closet and sorted through his collection, some decades old, of varied patterns and widths, some still bearing the stains from hurried pasta dinners or cups of coffee. And during the weeks that followed, when I felt as if I roamed the earth unmoored in his absence, I wore his ties to give me strength, and bring me peace.I still do.My patients often comment on my ties. I have one, I think intended for a lawyer, subtly patterned with tiny wolves in sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing. When a patient notices the gag, I joke that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not what they were hoping for in an oncologist, and they laugh, breaking the tension in the room.Ties can be conversation starters, allowing me and my patients to talk about mundanities, before we launch into the seriousness of cancer. Most patients compliment me on my ties. A few of my patients, all older and more formal in how they approach their doctors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 appointments, come dressed to the nines to my clinic, and I make sure to compliment them, too, as they clearly value appearances. But occasionally, someone will make a comment that is vituperative. One patient blurted, as soon as I walked into the clinic room:\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoa, doc, that tie is awful! Did you get dressed this morning with the lights off in your bedroom?\u00e2\u0080\u009dI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get upset. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not exactly considered a fashion maven, and style is subjective. I also knew, as did he, that his leukemia had returned, and suspected he was taking out his anger about the return of his cancer on the fabric of my tie.Ties in medicine can be controversial. There is even a growing movement to ban ties, as they may be vehicles for transmission of germs in their casual draping across hospital beds and exam tables as we move from one patient to the next. Many pediatricians eschew ties for this reason \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as to prevent themselves from choking, as infants and toddlers are prone to grab them during a clinic visit. This is less likely to occur with adult patients, although it did to me recently.I was examining a woman in her 30s with leukemia who had suffered mightily at the hands of our chemotherapy, but had emerged in a remission and was feeling better. As I stood before her and reached to feel for lymph nodes in her neck, she similarly reached up to straighten my tie and tighten the knot. Our eyes met, and we both laughed, embarrassed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour tie was off to the side. I need you looking right for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMany patients have expectations of how professional their doctors should appear. If a tie helps build confidence as they face the uncertainty of cancer treatment, as wearing my dad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ties helped me build confidence as I faced life without a father, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to wear one.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

Mr. Pojeky said Wednesday that the call about the owl, dubbed GiGi because of her gigantic size, came from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in May.GiGi, a great horned owl, had a concussion and two types of infections \u2014 and she was unable to stand up.\u201cShe was knocking on death\u2019s door,\u201d Mr. Pojeky said. \u201cOf all the animals I\u2019ve rehabbed, I did not think she was going to make the recovery.\u201dDays after GiGi came into the group\u2019s care, Mr. Pojeky left to visit his home state, Michigan.

But whatever it is, it has earned him the \u201cbird whisperer\u201d nickname.\u201cBird-of-prey whisperer,\u201d Ms. Dubuisson clarified. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve called him for years and years.\u201d\u201cMy understanding and experience with great horned owls is, if it\u2019s an adult bird, which it appears to be, the older they are, the more recalcitrant they are,\u201d Dr. Parks said. \u201cThey can be very stubborn and difficult.\u201dAn owl may spread its wings around its young to shelter them, or if it\u2019s overheated, he said.\u201cI would be surprised if it had anything to do with its reaction to its handler,\u201d Dr. Parks said.But Ms. Dubuisson said Mr. Pojeky just had a gift for handling birds of prey.\u201cHe is the only person that can handle them in the way he does,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to see.\u201dSoon after the photos were taken, GiGi was released near where she was found in Seminary, Miss., about two hours north of the rescue center. She circled a little bit and glanced back at her rescuers before flying off into the woods, Mr. Pojeky said.Many of the animals released by Mr. Pojeky and Ms. Dubuisson tend to look back before heading back into the wild, he said.\u201cIn our minds, that\u2019s them saying thank you,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Parasite Underground", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "FeatureA shadow network of patients are trying to treat their own debilitating diseases \u2014 by infecting themselves with gastrointestinal worms.Supported byThe doctor recommended infusions of cyclosporine, a powerful immune-suppressant drug. Vik looked it up and learned that the drug, often given to transplant recipients, in rare instances can increase the risk of fatal infection and certain cancers. And if cyclosporine didn\u2019t work, the next intervention would probably be the surgical removal of his colon. Vik might have to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of his life.\u201cI had a feeling there had to be a better way,\u201d he told me recently. (Worried about being stigmatized, Vik asked that I identify him only by his first name.) He began researching ulcerative colitis and discovered that the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 an umbrella term that includes both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease \u2014 had increased markedly in the United States over the 20th century. Yet the disease was less common in the developing world. He learned that exposure to dirt and unsanitary conditions early in life seemed to protect against these and other inflammatory diseases later. And then he encountered an explanation for the correlations in the research of a scientist named Joel Weinstock.Weinstock, a gastroenterologist now at Tufts University, thought that parasites were to blame. But it wasn\u2019t their presence in the human digestive system that was causing the rise; it was their absence. To survive for years in another animal, parasitic worms, known as helminths, counter their hosts\u2019 defenses. Because an out-of-control immune response against native bacteria was thought to drive inflammatory bowel disease, Weinstock\u2019s insight was that parasites\u2019 ability to disarm the immune system might prevent the disorder. The broader implication was that the disappearance of parasites \u2014 largely eradicated from American life in the early 20th century through improvements in sanitation \u2014 might have left our immune systems unbalanced, increasing our vulnerability to all types of inflammatory disorders.To Vik, Weinstock\u2019s idea was the first cogent explanation for his disease. It also pointed toward a solution. Weinstock was already experimenting with \u201cre-parasitizing\u201d people with inflammatory bowel disease, using a helminth called Trichuris suis, the pig whipworm. He had chosen the species because, in theory, it can\u2019t reach sexual maturity in humans and spread from one person to another. Early, small studies yielded impressive results, with 43 percent of colitis patients seeing improvement after 12 weeks of whipworm eggs, but Vik thought the use of pig whipworm had a flaw. It required continual dosing, and it could cost tens of thousands of dollars a year (a German company was producing the eggs for human consumption; in the United States, selling them to treat a disease is illegal). And most important, if he expected a parasite to change his immune system, he believed, a species adapted to humans, not pigs, was likely to do a better job.Vik wanted human whipworm. This helminth, which reaches about 1.5 inches in length, fixes itself into the wall of the large intestine and feeds off the organ\u2019s secretions for perhaps two years. The potential results of severe whipworm infection include anemia, clubbed fingers and, in children, stunted growth. But after exhausting his other options, Vik began to think of infecting himself with parasites as the most rational course of action. After all, the parasite had been with people since prehistory; \u00d6tzi the Iceman, the 5,300-year-old mummy found frozen in the Italian Alps, had whipworm. Besides, the worst possible outcome of a whipworm infection was a kind of inflammatory bowel disease. And he already had that.His doctor was dead set against the idea, Vik told me. So was his wife, a doctor in training. (They later divorced.) Vik is a driven, entrepreneurial type, though, and undeterred, he began emailing any expert who \u201cwould listen to my crazy ideas.\u201d In 2004, he flew to Bangkok to meet a parasitologist who agreed to hear him out. He brought along his father, a professor and internist, for \u201cgravitas.\u201d (Vik\u2019s father, who worked in Southeast Asia as a young doctor, told me it was common then to leave light whipworm infections untreated.)The Thai parasitologist later handed him a vial of fluid containing whipworm eggs. Microscopic in size, they had come from an 11-year-old girl in southern Thailand, he was told. Vik flew home.Next began what Vik describes as \u201cthe most difficult part\u201d of his life. He set up a lab in his parents\u2019 Southern California home and stocked it with a microscope, petri dishes, slides and flasks purchased on eBay. But he couldn\u2019t get the eggs to \u201cembryonate.\u201d Just as chicken eggs need to incubate to hatch, helminth eggs require \u201cembryonation\u201d to produce infective larvae. Parasite eggs are excreted in feces, and in their native tropics, that embryonation occurs naturally after the eggs spend time in warm, humid conditions. But reproducing those conditions in his parents\u2019 house proved difficult. He tried various conditions \u2014 warm, wet, cool, dry, light, dark \u2014 to no avail: The eggs remained inert. Swallowed in this state, they would pass right through his gut without hatching.The breakthrough came when, imagining defecation under a tree, Vik abandoned his goal of antiseptic incubation and began using nonsterile tap water in the petri dish. Now the eggs, football-shaped and translucent under the microscope, began to display a knotted, ropy shape within \u2014 developing larvae \u2014 indicating embryonation. Months after returning from Thailand, he finally drank a glass of water containing a few hundred whipworm eggs.Three months later, he swallowed another thousand eggs. Ova began showing up in his stool, indicating that his body now hosted living, breeding parasites. When he tapered off his drugs, his colitis remained quiescent. Instead of triumph, though, Vik felt doubt. Was this real? Or was it a natural ebb in his disease? \u201cI wanted proof,\u201d he told me. That\u2019s when Vik began searching for what he calls \u201cthe Team.\u201dIn his interactions with scientists, Vik had noticed that parasitologists, the scientists most familiar with the dangers of parasitic infection, were the most receptive to the idea that parasites might help with disease. So in 2006, after poring over numerous faculty web pages, he emailed a young parasite immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, named P\u2019ng Loke.When Loke heard Vik\u2019s story \u2014 his disease, his trip to Thailand, his trouble incubating the parasites \u2014 he found the tale compelling. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem crazy, just someone who had really done a lot of research, had his back up against the wall and decided to take a plunge,\u201d says Loke, who now has a microbiology lab at New York University.Loke agreed to monitor Vik, a decision that would alter the course of his own research. Over the following four years, Vik relapsed twice. Whenever his whipworms grew old, the colitis flared. Then he drank more eggs, and his disease came back under control. A gastroenterologist periodically examined Vik\u2019s colon, taking tissue samples. And when Loke and his colleagues analyzed which genes were expressed during flares and remission \u2014 an indicator of immune activity \u2014 they discovered a pattern that may change how scientists think about ulcerative colitis.When the disease was quiescent, production of one protein in particular, called interleukin-22, increased. IL-22 encourages intestinal mucus to flow. In inflammatory bowel disease, the protective mucous layer is often eroded. Scientists think this allows native microbes, usually held at a slight remove from the intestinal wall, to get closer to the gut wall, leading to inflammation and further impeding the flow of mucus. Vik\u2019s whipworms apparently interrupted that vicious cycle by restoring the mucus barrier. Parasites, it seemed, could heal the gut.When I first began exploring the movement a few years ago, two self-styled \u201cproviders\u201d supplied most of the parasites. They\u2019d read some of the same research as Vik, found it promising and acquired helminths in the developing world. After treating their own conditions (they claimed), they began advertising helminths online for thousands of dollars. They saw themselves as pioneers.Since then, competition has come to this niche market. New providers offer lower prices. Users read about the science in online forums, share their experiences and learn where to get helminths. Like Vik, a growing contingent of users has learned to cultivate parasites for self-treatment, circumventing the providers altogether. They trade incubation methods in Facebook discussion groups, occasionally arrange for the exchange of \u201cstarter\u201d material, including eggs or fecal material from worm-infested donors, and post photos of their homegrown eggs and larvae.Anecdote fuels the movement, because no large randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies have produced evidence that parasites can cure anything. And because parasites aren\u2019t F.D.A.-approved, paranoia is common. Nearly everyone I interviewed requested some measure of anonymity, not only to avoid stigma but also because they worried about losing access to a treatment they said had changed their lives.Scientists I queried tended to emphasize the dangers of helminth use. \u201cI do not advocate self-experimentation when the risks have not been clarified,\u201d Stephen Hanauer, director of the Digestive Health Center at Northwestern Medicine, told me in an email. Joel Weinstock, whose research partly inspired the movement, ticked off more reasons purchasing unregulated parasites is a bad idea: You don\u2019t know that you\u2019re getting the species promised. Even if you are, you don\u2019t know if the specimens are alive, or if you\u2019re getting the appropriate numbers of them, or even what the appropriate numbers are.Still, a few experts also expressed sympathy. \u201cI certainly can\u2019t condone it, but I completely understand,\u201d Alex Loukas, a parasitologist at James Cook University in Australia, told me. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people with debilitating disease. Modern medicine has just failed them.\u201d This is perhaps the best way to understand helminth use: as one grass-roots response to an epidemic. The prevalence of autoimmune and allergic diseases has increased between two- and threefold in recent decades. Roughly one in five Americans has an allergic disease, ranging from seasonal hay fever to life-threatening food allergies. Roughly one in 13 has an autoimmune disease \u2014 a disorder in which the immune system tasked with our protection instead attacks our own bodies. These disorders often strike in the prime of life or earlier, causing decades of suffering. And current therapies fall short. Continuing research offers reasons for hope, says Daniel Rotrosen, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease\u2019s division of allergy, immunology and transplantation. But currently, he says, \u201cWe are really not where we would like to be in terms of treating many of these diseases.\u201dThere\u2019s an apt historical precedent for the current unregulated experimentation with parasites: the underground pharmacies and smuggling rings dramatized in the movie \u201cDallas Buyers Club.\u201d They sprouted during the 1980s AIDS crisis, serving a demographic, mostly gay men, who were ignored by mainstream medicine and who, in an effort to treat themselves, began importing non-F.D.A.-approved drugs from Mexico. Many of the drugs they used didn\u2019t stand up to later scientific scrutiny, it\u2019s worth noting, but the calculus leading them to take unproven drugs was similar to that driving helminth users today. If you are stricken with a terrible disease for which medicine has little to offer, then what, really, do you have to lose by turning to a parasite?Her neurologist recommended a drug called Copaxone, she says. But the injections killed fat cells, leaving unsightly indentations and bruises along her thighs. And new brain lesions showed up on scans, indicating that the disease continued to advance. Amy tried another drug called beta interferon, but it triggered fevers, and after injections she felt ill for hours. \u201cIt was just this weird nightmare of life,\u201d she says.Then Amy\u2019s thyroid gland, important in regulating metabolism, started failing, stressed by the interferon treatment. Her doctor recommended that she take thyroid replacement hormone. This was the last straw. Each treatment caused new problems, it seemed, and none really helped. She wanted another option.A co-worker recommended a 2011 book called \u201cThe Wild Life of Our Bodies,\u201d by a biologist named Rob Dunn. It discussed therapeutic helminths. The notion that we\u2019d co-evolved with parasites for so long that our immune system needed them appealed to Amy\u2019s holistic mind-set. She joined a Yahoo group dedicated to \u201chelminthic therapy.\u201d That\u2019s where she discovered an extraordinary study from Argentina.In the early 2000s, some multiple-sclerosis patients at a neurology clinic in Buenos Aires began showing up with parasite infections. Aware of the potential for parasites to help inflammatory disease, the presiding neurologists proposed an experiment: Don\u2019t treat the parasites, and see what happens. Twelve patients agreed, and for nearly five years the doctors monitored them. Disease progression, as measured by brain scans, slowed significantly. Blood work showed an elevation of \u201csuppressor\u201d cells that prevent autoimmune diseases. And when, more than five years later, the doctors dewormed four patients who complained of malaise, those suppressor cells disappeared, and the disease started up again.Inspired by these findings, which were published in 2007, small exploratory studies testing the pig whipworm on multiple-sclerosis patients began around that time at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. That helped to reassure Lisy, Amy\u2019s partner, who initially thought the idea reeked of quackery. Amy contacted worm\u00adtherapy.com, a site run by man named Garin Aglietti. Aglietti wasn\u2019t a doctor \u2014 he\u2019d dropped out of medical school \u2014 but he\u2019d treated his own psoriasis, he said, with hookworms acquired in Belize. His breadth of knowledge impressed Amy. \u201cI felt this immediate trust,\u201d Amy told me. Two years\u2019 worth of hookworms cost $2,500.In January 2012, Amy and Lisy flew to San Diego. Aglietti picked them up at the airport in an S.U.V. and drove them across the border to a two-story building in Tijuana, where Amy met a warm doctor named Jorge Llamas. His spare, basic office didn\u2019t have shiny, modern medical equipment, but as Amy says, helminths were pretty \u201clow-tech.\u201dHookworms penetrate the skin and, after a weekslong odyssey through the body, arrive at the small intestine, where they feed on blood and grow to about a centimeter long. Llamas applied gauze to Amy\u2019s arm containing 35 nearly invisible hookworm larvae. There was a remote possibility of a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction as they entered her body, Aglietti explained. He had an adrenaline shot handy should that occur. They waited an hour, chatting, until Aglietti deemed things safe, and then he drove them back to San Diego.About 10 weeks later, Amy\u2019s bone-deadening exhaustion, a symptom of multiple sclerosis, began fading. She told her neurologist what she\u2019d done. To her surprise, he was familiar with the background research, but he was nervous about her decision. Whenever she visits, he offers new drugs. \u201cI have politely declined,\u201d Amy told me.Amy\u2019s neurologist didn\u2019t respond to my queries, but her family-practice doctor corroborated her account, adding, \u201cAs long as a patient is making an informed decision, and understands the risks, then something is worth doing if they decide it\u2019s worth doing.\u201dAs it happens, a company called Coronado Biosciences did test Joel Weinstock\u2019s pig whipworms. It ran the largest trials conducted to date, comprising 250 participants with Crohn\u2019s disease. But in contrast to Weinstock\u2019s earlier, smaller studies, which showed an almost miraculous curative effect in Crohn\u2019s \u2014 72 percent experienced remission \u2014 these studies showed no benefit at all. The company, now called Fortress Biotech, hasn\u2019t released details from the study, but it has dismissed criticism \u2014 Weinstock, for example, thinks the trial should have started over because of an unusually high response among those taking a placebo \u2014 as wishful thinking. \u201cThese \u2018believers\u2019 are being fooled by randomness,\u201d a spokesman for the firm said in an email.Last year, however, Alex Loukas, the parasitologist in Australia, published a small study in which hookworm infection seemingly cured celiac disease, an autoimmune disease of the gut triggered by the gluten protein, found in wheat and other grains. He gave 12 celiac volunteers 20 hookworm larvae each. Once the worms established themselves, he began feeding the volunteers incrementally larger quantities of foods with gluten. At the one-year mark, eight participants who previously couldn\u2019t eat any gluten without diarrhea and worse could now eat a bowl of pasta without problems.Celiac disease occurs when a person\u2019s immune system mistakes wheat protein as dangerous and attacks. This unbridled aggression begins to destroy the gut. How exactly the parasites stopped the disease remains somewhat mysterious. Studies suggest they hijack white blood cells, transforming them into soothing cells that prevent inflammatory disease. But research by P\u2019ng Loke also indicates that they commandeer the microbiota, the community of microbes in the intestinal tract. In animals, parasites increase counts of anti-inflammatory bacteria thought to prevent a range of disorders, including asthma and colitis. And deworming people causes an immediate decline in those same bacteria, Loke has found, perhaps increasing their vulnerability to inflammatory disease. He thinks parasites do this, in part, by increasing the secretion of mucus, which selectively feeds anti-inflammatory bacteria. Loukas and his colleagues have received funding for a larger celiac trial, but he sees the field moving away from the use of live parasites, toward the identification of the molecules they secrete.For helminth users, this push toward worm-\u00adderived pharmaceuticals is cited as justification for the underground\u2019s existence. People are sick and suffering today, they argue. Are they to wait for years or decades that they may not have for a worm-based pill when there\u2019s something that might work now?Was I afraid? I knew that a number of parasitologists, well versed in the terrors of hookworm infection, had intentionally infected themselves. When you learn enough about a parasite\u2019s biology, amazement and curiosity gradually replace fear and revulsion.So one cool early-winter day, I walked across the border to Tijuana, accompanied by Garin Aglietti. In Jorge Llamas\u2019s clinic, I riffled through several months of tests showing that Aglietti, my hookworm donor, didn\u2019t have H.I.V., hepatitis or Strongyloides stercoralis, a particularly unpleasant parasite that, like hookworm, infects through the skin but which, unusually among helminths, can also multiply in the body. Then Llamas pressed a bandage against my arm containing, he said, 30 larvae. I felt the well-known hookworm itch, a slightly tingly, almost stinging sensation as they burrowed into my skin.Over the next few weeks, as the larvae made their way to my small intestine, I felt as if I had a mild flu. Cramps, a little diarrhea, headaches and malaise followed. The symptoms lessened over time, and for a month or so during hay-fever season that spring, my sinuses were remarkably clear. Seemingly overnight, a patch of eczema on my hand also disappeared. Fine peach fuzz sprouted here and there on my body.But those were the extent of the benefits. And late in hay-fever season, I was suddenly stricken by full-blown seasonal allergies. My eczema returned with a vengeance. I thought I\u2019d lost the parasites, but they slowly reasserted control over my sinuses, although never quite as powerfully as during that initial period. I kept the colony going for over a year, during which time the benefits gradually waned while the symptoms \u2014 an occasional ache in the pit of my stomach and sporadic malaise \u2014 never completely dissipated. Ultimately, the benefits were too variable and the side effects too unpleasant to justify continuing.When people have written me over the years asking for advice, I point out that I\u2019m not a doctor, and I urge skepticism. It\u2019s possible, I say, that parasites worsen your condition. I interviewed one young man with Crohn\u2019s who gave himself hookworm, lost weight and became so anemic that he required emergency blood transfusions. I spoke with others who improved for a while but then relapsed.But I don\u2019t think that my warnings have dissuaded many people, for the simple reason that they\u2019re desperate. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss them because of this desperation. And certainly it\u2019s possible that cases of remission are a result of the placebo effect, that parasites don\u2019t help and that the community of helminths users is gripped by a self-reinforcing delusion. It\u2019s also possible, though, that parasites can treat a subset of patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases, and that through self-experimentation, sick people are figuring out who\u2019s in that group.Success stories, when posted, invariably inspire a chorus of congratulations followed by questions \u2014 which species worked the best? Moderators curate up-to-date lists of these successes, some of which link back to their authors, making them somewhat checkable. They also include failures, in an attempt at balance. Documents list substances that users have found may accidentally kill parasites, like oregano oil and nitrous oxide.The operating assumption in this world seems to be that parasites usually work. A moderator once politely asked that I stop referring to helminths as parasites and call them \u201csymbionts\u201d instead. And the social dynamics of these forums can strike some as odd. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure to be positive and cheerful about it all the time,\u201d a 30-something librarian who successfully treated her autoimmune thyroid problems with hookworm told me.At the same time, these groups direct participants to a remarkable amount of scientific information, including numerous peer-reviewed articles. Particularly intriguing are the protocols based on users\u2019 experiences. If you have a terrible reaction to hookworm \u2014 which isn\u2019t uncommon \u2014 you might start over with smaller doses, and gradually introduce larvae over a longer period of time. Different organisms might also work for different disorders. I spoke with one British scientist, a biologist, who found that hookworm helped an inflammatory condition affecting his liver, but not his ulcerative colitis. Only when he introduced whipworm, which lives at the site of the ulcerations, did his colitis diminish.At some point, I learned of a private online group where parents discussed treating their children with helminths. After my own experience, I couldn\u2019t imagine intentionally giving my child a parasite, so I was surprised. Many members were mothers; some had immune disorders themselves. A few incubated their own parasites. Everyone I spoke to had given helminths to themselves before their children. Their children had disorders like eosinophilic esophagitis, which can make swallowing food difficult; severe food allergies; and a neuropsychiatric disorder with O.C.D.-like symptoms called Pandas. In several instances, conventional treatment had failed. The parents viewed the potential side effects of parasite infection as milder than the diseases already afflicting their children, and less dangerous than some of the drugs they had already tried. And they claimed to have seen impressive results with parasites.Some were experimenting with a new organism, a tapeworm native to rats called Hymenolepis diminuta. A British company called Biome Restoration sells it. Depending on the dosage, an order can run just $40. Don Donahue, a radiologist in eastern Tennessee, founded Biome with two other passionate helminths users. He had long suffered from nasal inflammation and obstructive polyps. But just three weeks after acquiring 30 hookworms in Tijuana, he told me, the symptoms improved overnight. \u201cIt was like someone slapped me in the face,\u201d he says. He started cultivating them at home for his own use. Spurred in part by the sick people he saw at work, Donahue then decided to make helminths more widely available.The hookworm Necator americanus (\u201cAmerican murderer\u201d) wasn\u2019t ready for \u201cprime time\u201d in his view. \u201cI really honestly hate hookworm,\u201d he says, because some of the side effects are so bothersome. \u201cBut I\u2019m sick without it.\u201d So Donahue settled on what he considered a \u201cgentler\u201d organism, Hymenolepis diminuta. Yet even as he put most of his life savings into starting Biome Restoration, he has kept giving away parasites freely. Of everyone I spoke with, Donahue perhaps most fully expresses the ethos of enthusiastic sharing so often evident among the community of parasite users. I interviewed one young woman suffering from Crohn\u2019s whom he met running at the park and gave a supply of the rat tapeworm. Her Crohn\u2019s eased, she gained weight and, after years of trying, she became pregnant. I spoke with a former snowboarder in Portland, Ore., stricken with a painful autoimmune disorder of the spine called ankylosing spondylitis. That man, Scotty Wittlake \u2014 he wanted me to use his full name \u2014 told me his condition improved following his self-innoculation with Donahue\u2019s hookworm.\u201cCitizen scientists are pushing this forward,\u201d says Donahue, who acts more like an evangelist than an entrepreneur. He seems to want to share the miracle he\u2019s found, to spread the word and help others. Biome Restoration has no robust safety data nor any evidence that rat tapeworms help with anything. And parasites that find themselves in unfamiliar hosts can, in theory, cause significant disease and, in rare cases, even death. (In March, the F.D.A. extended an import alert, which already applies to hookworm and whipworm, to tapeworm.) But the company, which seeks to make a more affordable helminth available to more people, is trying something few others have: It is engaging with regulatory authorities to legally sell its product in Britain. The underground is pushing its way aboveground.An article on June 19 about patients\u2019 trying to treat their own diseases with parasites misidentified a drug taken by a patient who had ulcerative colitis. It was mesalamine, not sulfasalazine.Moises Velasquez-Manoff is the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Spanish Town That Runs on Twitter", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionJUN, Spain \u2014 When Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Salas\u2019s daughter, Martina, was born in April, he \u2014 like many proud new parents \u2014 turned to social media to share the news.Acabo de nacer a las 3.55 con 3 kilos y 110 gramosFor the town\u2019s residents, more than half of whom have Twitter accounts, their main way to communicate with local government officials is now the social network. Need to see the local doctor? Send a quick Twitter message to book an appointment. See something suspicious? Let Jun\u2019s policeman know with a tweet.People in Jun can still use traditional methods, like completing forms at the town hall, to obtain public services. But Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Salas said that by running most of Jun\u2019s communications through Twitter, he not only has shaved on average 13 percent, or around $380,000, from the local budget each year since 2011, but he also has created a digital democracy where residents interact online almost daily with town officials.\u201cEveryone can speak to everyone else, whenever they want,\u201d said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Salas in his office surrounded by Twitter paraphernalia, while sporting a wristband emblazoned with #LoveTwitter. \u201cWe are on Twitter because that\u2019s where the people are.\u201d\u201cJun is one of a group of islands of innovation in the public sector,\u201d said Arthur Mickoleit, a researcher who until recently was a digital government adviser at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. \u201cThey\u2019re tapping into social media to improve public services.\u201dJun\u2019s embrace of Twitter did not happen overnight.Jun\u2019s officials also started asking residents to verify their Twitter accounts at the town hall \u2014 a relatively simple process of checking people\u2019s government IDs with their online profiles to ensure their concerns were answered online.Officials began with basic services like public maintenance, letting people tweet when they saw a broken streetlight or a road that needed cleaning.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Salas said such activities built good will with residents, who at first opened Twitter accounts sporadically. But since 2013, the online activity has become almost universal as people saw how their neighbors used the service.One recent hashtag that residents have used is #EndesaMeEstresa, or \u201cEndesa You\u2019re Stressing Me Out,\u201d to highlight problems with Endesa, a local utility. After the company was confronted with Jun\u2019s angry tweets, it quickly fixed the blackouts, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Salas said. An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment.\u201cWe can check if they\u2019re really working or not,\u201d said Paco Castellano, a resident who recently opened a Twitter account, mostly to keep tabs on local officials.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said these interactions have made the town more efficient just as Jun\u2019s budget \u2014 like many Spanish towns\u2019 \u2014 is under strain. His officials rarely receive calls or visits from people looking for help, he said.Using Twitter has also reduced the need for some jobs. Jun cut its police force by three-quarters, to just one officer, soon after turning to Twitter as its main form of communication when residents began tweeting potential problems directly to the mayor.For Justo Ontiveros, Jun\u2019s remaining police officer, those benefits are up close and personal. He now receives up to 20, mostly private, messages from locals daily with concerns ranging from advice on filling out forms to reporting crimes like domestic abuse and speeding.Mr. Ontiveros said his daily Twitter interactions have given him both greater visibility within the community and a higher level of personal satisfaction, as neighbors now regularly stop him in the street to discuss things that he has posted on Twitter.It\u2019s unclear, too, whether lessons from Jun can be replicated on a larger scale, several analysts said, while some question whether a publicly listed company like Twitter should be permitted to help provide government services.For Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Torre Sarmiento, an architect who recently stopped by Jun\u2019s town hall after work to verify his Twitter account, the chance to quickly send tweets remained preferable to submitting government forms that often took weeks to process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Time to Stand With Gay Americans", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported bySome of June\u2019s gay pride celebrations happened last weekend, but many are still ahead.

You should go.If you\u2019re not comfortable marching, mingle on the sidelines. If parades aren\u2019t your thing, make an appearance at one of the other pride events in Kentucky in coming days.Just show up. And by doing so, show that the absence of \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cL.G.B.T.\u201d in your statements immediately following the Orlando massacre \u2014 and in the statements of so many other prominent Republicans \u2014 isn\u2019t because you place us and our concerns behind some thick pane of glass with a Do Not Touch sign that stays up even when blood and tears pool beneath it.For more than 48 hours, Paul Ryan also seemed to avoid any mention of the kind of nightclub that the Orlando gunman chose and one of the reasons its revelers were marked for death.On Tuesday morning that silence finally ended, as Ryan told journalists in Washington that he wanted to \u201cbe clear.\u201d\u201cMembers of the L.G.B.T. community were the targets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were simply attacked for who they are.\u201dHe thus joined his 2012 running mate, Mitt Romney, who sent out a tweet midday Monday offering \u201ca special prayer for the L.G.B.T. community that was the focus of this attack.\u201dRyan also joined Donald Trump, who mentioned L.G.B.T. Americans repeatedly in his formal remarks on Monday afternoon, expressing \u201csolidarity with the members of Orlando\u2019s L.G.B.T. community\u201d and asserting that the gunman wanted \u201cto execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.\u201dBut more conspicuous than what Romney and Trump said was what so many other Republicans didn\u2019t.Bemoaning the carnage, they justly condemned the Islamic State and violent extremists. They rightly paid tribute to \u201cfirst responders.\u201dBut this specificity didn\u2019t extend to the lives and loves of the people killed. Even Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, initially sidestepped the subject, failing to emphasize that many of them spent their final terrified minutes in a place where they had sought precisely the comfort and belonging that they didn\u2019t always feel on the other side of its walls.His past behavior and his call to 911 demonstrated an overarching hatred of America, with its celebration of diversity and individual liberty. The revelers in Pulse epitomized that liberty, and what happened to them is part of a bigger story and a bigger struggle that affect all Americans.But that doesn\u2019t preclude an acknowledgment of their sexual orientations, and it doesn\u2019t excuse any reluctance to discuss that.Roman Catholic leaders, too, shied away. Statements by the bishop of Orlando and by the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said nothing about a gay nightclub or gays.\u201cIf the murders had happened, God forbid, in a church of a particular Christian denomination, Catholic leaders would decry the murders and then naturally express their solidarity with members of that denomination,\u201d he said in the video, adding that for the most part, \u201cthis was not done for the grieving L.G.B.T. community.\u201d\u201cWe teach that,\u201d Lynch wrote. \u201cWe should believe that. We must stand for that.\u201dThis is one of those moments, in the wake of terror, when we find the most apt and evocative ways to underscore our oneness and renounce our fear. When we make grand gestures. When we make pointed ones.So Majority Leader McConnell, pick your rally. Speaker Ryan, accompany him. Governor Scott, attend the funerals of gay victims. Other Republicans and Democrats, recognize L.G.B.T. Americans with both your words and your presence at gay pride celebrations.You want to show our enemies what America stands for?

Since the best museums often channel the Zeitgeist, it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come as a surprise that another rumpled, 70-something, radical, balding, Jewish, progressive, born-and-raised New Yorker who moved to the mountains (New Mexico) years ago is being honored with a late-career retrospective. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDanny Lyon: Message to the Future\u00e2\u0080\u009d opens on June 17 at the Whitney Museum of Art, and will feature films and photographs by the celebrated, if combative, photographer. The exhibition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connection to the civil rights movement is no coincidence, however. The well-considered sense of timing dates to 2005, when Julian Cox, a genteel Englishman, had recently been appointed curator of photography at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. He wanted to plan an exhibition to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assassination, so of course he thought of Mr. Lyon.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDanny was obviously a pivotal player in that story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cox said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis involvement with the movement, his lifetime friendship with John Lewis and Julian Bond. I called him up and went to visit him.

He was entrusted to get out there and make a record of these various public protests, marches, and demonstrations on a variety of different issues. Voting rights, segregation, et cetera.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter SNCC, Mr. Lyon embraced  Hunter S. Thompson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew Journalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cox said, when he joined the Outlaws motorcycle gang and made perhaps his most famous pictures. He also spent 14 months photographing inside the Texas prison system, after he was given unparalleled access by Dr. George Beto, the head of the Texas Department of Corrections at the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe begins with the civil rights,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cox said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne side of personal freedom there.

On that subject, Mr. Lyon made his opinions quite clear in a recent email: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is both immoral and for me personally repugnant that anyone, including a stock holder would want to make a profit by imprisoning another human being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the companies that do this should be identified, as should all mutual funds that own that stock. The media should identify the CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of these companies and these people should be shunned socially.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy 2010, when Mr. Cox moved to San Francisco to become founding curator of photography at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and chief curator at the de Young Museum, he had gotten to know Mr. Lyon quite well. He had the rare privilege of reading directly from the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diaries, which led Mr. Cox to believe there was much in the mid-to-late career work that deserved a broader audience, including pictures made about immigration in New Mexico, where Mr. Lyon had moved in 1970.Mr. Cox also discovered that Elisabeth Sussman at the Whitney happened to agree, so together they planned the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMessage to the Future\u00e2\u0080\u009d exhibition, and an attendant catalog, which will eventually travel to the de Young Museum and to institutions in Switzerland and Germany. Both museums are committing vast resources on both coasts to share Mr. Lyon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work with the world, ensuring that his combative energy will continue to provoke thought and discussion.\u00e2\u0080\u009cActually, the very best of Danny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work has a lot of emotional impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cox said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has oomph.

The youth-focused party Demosisto called for Hong Kong to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u201cencroachment and unlawful interference.\u201dAbout 50 people held a protest in the searing midday sun on Friday outside the central government\u2019s office, and political groups were organizing a march on Saturday.\u201cWe are all Lam Wing-kee,\u201d said one lawmaker, James To. Demonstrators shouted \u201cPublishing is not a crime\u201d and \u201cReading a book is not a crime.\u201d\u201cLiving in an environment where democracy and freedom is a given, it just shocks me that Hong Kong, a place seemingly free, can have something like this happen,\u201d said Jeff Feng Lee, 18, a Canadian citizen interning for Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic Party.Even the city\u2019s government, which has come under withering criticism because it is perceived as looking out too much for the interests of Beijing, felt the need to assure nervous residents. John Tsang, the financial secretary, told reporters that \u201cit is unlawful for any law enforcement agencies from outside Hong Kong to take law enforcement action here.\u201d\u201cThat would be unacceptable,\u201d he added.Beyond the protests and official statements, many other people reacted to Mr. Lam\u2019s story in their own ways on Friday.On Thursday evening, Mr. Lam described how the Chinese police had zeroed in on the mailing lists of Causeway Bay Books, the shop where he worked and that is now closed. The police were interested in the bookstore\u2019s customers in mainland China, he said, and so allowed him to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday after more than seven months in custody to retrieve a hard drive with customer information.On Friday, employees at Hong Kong Reader Bookstore, one of the dwindling number of shops that sell volumes banned in the mainland, said they had separated records of people\u2019s purchases from their personal information, including names, email addresses and telephone numbers.\u201cWe\u2019d like to stay low-profile to protect our customers and ourselves,\u201d Timmy Wong, an employee at the store since 2007, said by phone. \u201cWe\u2019re not as brave as Mr. Lam. We didn\u2019t think we could be in any trouble until Mr. Lam came forward.\u201dMr. Lam\u2019s account of his apprehension and detention contradicted statements made by several of his colleagues, who maintained that they were voluntarily helping the Chinese with an investigation.But on Thursday night, Mr. Lam said that Mr. Lee had told him privately that he had indeed been taken into China against his will. Moreover, Mr. Lam said, Mr. Lee had given the Chinese police a list of the bookstore\u2019s customers. Mr. Lee, on his Facebook page on Friday, said that he had never told Mr. Lam that he had gone to the mainland against his will and had not given a list of the bookstore\u2019s customers to the mainland police.Also rebutting Mr. Lam were his Chinese jailers.\u201cDuring this time, Lam put forward that because he was on poor terms with his wife and son, it was difficult for him to reside in Hong Kong, and he asked the public security organs for help,\u201d the official said, according to Sing Tao. \u201cAccordingly, the public security organs made appropriate arrangements.\u201dWhen asked several times about the episode at a routinely scheduled news conference on Friday, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, said, \u201cLam Wing-kee is a Chinese citizen, and when he broke China\u2019s law in the mainland of China, the authorities had the right to take actions in accordance with the law.\u201dCharlotte Yang contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

He lowered the reggae song he was playing to get a better listen.The gunfire did not let up. As round after round was fired early Sunday, people started dropping, some in panic, some because they were wounded, and others because they were dead.\u201cI saw bodies on the floor, people on the floor everywhere,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cIt was a chaos, everybody trying to get out.\u201dBy the time the shooting ended, it would rank as the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Inside the club, there were 39 dead people along with the gunman, who was killed around 5 a.m. after a shootout with the police.Nine more people died either at hospitals or on their way to them. Another two bodies were discovered on the street just outside the club, according to Mayor Buddy Dyer of Orlando. Fifty-three people were wounded.Even in a post-Columbine world, where mass shootings have become so frighteningly common that the phrase itself is now a part of the lexicon, the bloody rampage at a small nightclub in Central Florida was shocking not only in its brutality but for the seemingly methodical fashion in which it was carried out.One out of every three people in the club was either wounded or killed. Some people had to hide for hours, crouched in bathrooms or in hidden corners inside the club, sending frantic text messages to the outside world begging for help. For others, the only way to get out alive was to scramble and crawl over the bodies of the dead.The mayhem was captured on video taken outside the club moments after the shooting. One group of men, some shirtless, carried a wounded man to a waiting pickup truck to be rushed to the hospital. Another group tried to help a man lying on the pavement, blood pouring from his wounds. A woman, apparently shot, staggered out into the night.The bloodshed ended only after a daring rescue operation by the police, in which they burst into a room in the club and freed 15 to 25 people before confronting the gunman and freeing another group being held hostage.As the investigation into the shooting continues, witnesses, the police and local politicians offered a vivid and gruesome portrait of how the carnage played out.Saturday was Latin Night at the club, which bills itself as \u201cOrlando\u2019s Premier Gay Nightclub.\u201dLocated at 1912 South Orange Avenue, next to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the club is housed in a relatively small building on a street filled with chain restaurants and shopping centers near downtown, roughly 18 miles from Disney World.The club itself is divided into three separate areas, each with its own theme and music selection. On Saturday, it was a mix of reggaeton, bachata, merengue and salsa. A video taken inside the club in the hours before the attack captured the festive mood, with patrons taking shots, slugging back beers and dancing under neon lights.Lizbeth Alvarez, 31, who was in the club with her girlfriend, Aixa Soltren, 27, said people often are packed in shoulder to shoulder.16 PhotosThe main dance floor is in a room called \u201cThe Jewel Box,\u201d where scores of gays, lesbians, transgender people and bisexuals from across Central Florida flock to party.On Saturday, as on all nights, there was a security guard posted at the front entrance. It was unclear whether Mr. Mateen shot his way into the club or smuggled in his weapons \u2014 which included an assault rifle, handgun and lots of ammunition \u2014 and then opened fire.Joel Figueroa, 19, of Orlando, was with his friend, Stanley, dancing when the first shots rang out.\u201cThe only thing I could think of was to duck,\u201d he said soon after the shooting, still obviously shaken.The moments that followed were a blur of panic and confusion. By the door, he saw his friend.\u201cThere was Stanley, on the floor,\u201d he said. He was shot three times, but managed to stumble outside, blood pouring from a huge gash in his arm. His condition was unclear.In those first few frantic minutes, scores of people ran out onto the street, many wounded, as the police rushed to the scene. Word spread quickly, with the wounded texting friends and family.Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.The club itself posted a message on Facebook shortly after the shooting began.\u201cEveryone get out of pulse and keep running.\u201dOne man wrote a text to his mother, saying he was shot and thought he was dying.Another mother showed reporters the stream of her son\u2019s increasingly desperate text messages.\u201cin bathroom,\u201d he wrote at 2:46 a.m. \u201che has us\u201d\u201ccall the police\u201d\u201ccall them mommy\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna die\u201dIt was unclear whether her son escaped.Luis Burbano, who gave interviews to several television networks, said that after the initial burst of gunfire, there was a momentary pause that he used to \u201cjet for the door.\u201dOn his way out, he saw a bartender hiding in a fitting room, \u201cwaiting for a miracle\u201d along with other patrons.After he escaped, a man near him collapsed, his arm badly wounded. Mr. Burbano took off his shirt and wrapped it around the man\u2019s arm.He then saw another man with a bullet lodged in his leg, and Mr. Burbano used another piece of clothing to try to stem his bleeding.With bodies littering the floor, at least 30 people remained trapped inside the club, according to the police.A group of 15 to 25 people were huddled in a room \u201cisolated\u201d from the gunman, Mr. Dyer told CNN.Another five to eight people were being held in a room with the gunman.The police, by now swarming outside, had established communication with Mr. Mateen, but it was unclear what they discussed. Heavily armed members of the SWAT team took positions around the building while other emergency medical workers rushed the wounded to a hospital, which was just a block away.A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.Finally, around 5 a.m., the authorities took action.They breached the wall of the isolated room with an armored personnel carrier known as a Bearcat.\u201cThat is when the shooter opened the door and started shooting outside,\u201d Mr. Dyer said.One officer was shot in the head, but was not seriously wounded because the bullet struck his Kevlar helmet.More than a dozen law enforcement officers took aim at Mr. Mateen and he was shot and killed.Next to his body was a battery pack, and the police were concerned that he might have been wearing an explosive device, so they investigated the scene first with a robot.It would take another hour before they could start to assess the extent of the damage. As they made their way deeper into the club, the toll grew higher.Brian Reagan, a manager at the club who was there during the shooting, took to Facebook to try to convey just how overwhelming it was to be caught in the center of a nightmare.\u201cI am scared, nervous, and concerned for every single person that was in that building,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease pray. This can not be real.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fathers and Stepfathers Join Hands at Weddings", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byField NotesIt\u2019s long been said that weddings bring out the best and the worst in people. In a society where divorce has become commonplace, and where the accompanying hurt has been longstanding, some couples and their complicated families are finding that a wedding can present the perfect opportunity to break the emotional logjam.Jacqueline Sweet, 26, was married last month at Carmel Valley Ranch in Carmel, Calif., with no fewer than eight eager parents (her fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents were also divorced and remarried) cheering on the couple.\u201cI knew my father would be walking me down the aisle,\u201d Mrs. Sweet said. \u201cI\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl and the oldest of three. He was paying for the wedding, and walking me was extremely important to him.\u201dNot wanting to exclude her stepfather, Kevin Smith, who has helped raise her since she was 3, Mrs. Sweet decided to give him the pivotal role of officiant. Convinced, however, that he would be too overtaken with emotion, Mrs. Sweet said that he agreed to a smaller role, that of giving the ceremony\u2019s only reading.As the two dads walked down the aisle, Mrs. Sweet\u2019s father, Robert Hirt, 55, recalled passing Mr. Smith, her stepdad. \u201cWhen I saw Kevin, he had tears in his eyes, and I thought, \u2018How can I not love this man?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter has twice the love and twice the caring, and that means you\u2019ve done your kid right.\u201dAnd the reading that was chosen? It was from First Corinthians: \u201cLove is very patient and kind, never jealous or envious, never boastful or proud, never haughty or selfish or rude.\u201dStephanie Warner, 32, has two stepdads in addition to her father. \u201cWho\u2019s going to walk me down the aisle has been a huge question I\u2019ve thought about my entire life,\u201d she said.As a wedding march played at her September 2011 marriage at the Testarossa Winery in Los Gatos, Calif., Mrs. Warner\u2019s father got the show started by walking her down the aisle to the front pew. He then gave her to her mother and current stepfather, who were waiting on one side of the aisle, while the other man who had been part of the bride\u2019s upbringing, her former stepfather, stood to the other side.At that, \u201cThe four of us linked arms like in \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 and we walked the rest of the way,\u201d Mrs. Warner said. \u201cThen they handed me off to my husband. When the priest asked, \u2018Who gives this woman?,\u2019 they all in unison said, \u2018We do.\u2019\u201dMrs. Warner was 2 when her biological parents divorced. By age 5, her mother remarried, but she divorced again a decade later. Mrs. Warner was 24 when her mother married for a third time.Her own wedding proved to be the perfect place to acknowledge her three fathers. As the couple cut the cake, Mrs. Warner said: \u201cI love you dad. I love you dad. I love you dad.\u201d When she did, \u201cthe entire room erupted in laughter,\u201d she recalled. \u201cEveryone knows I have a very blended family.\u201dHer mother, Lorie Arkley, 60, added: \u201cWalking the way we did was right for us. It was an amazing moment and it made me realize how lucky I am to be part of these men, each who love her.\u201d\u201cThe visual of two men walking their child down the aisle is a powerful statement,\u201d said Nicholas H. Wolfinger, a professor of family and consumer studies and an adjunct professor of sociology at the University of Utah. \u201cIt\u2019s about coming to terms with your parents\u2019 divorce, which often has been hard on kids. It\u2019s also a very positive statement and is something people can relate to and aspire to.\u201dProfessor Wolfinger attributes the rise in these shared, multifather moments to the fact that \u201cdivorced biological dads are more involved in their child\u2019s lives than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the \u201880s, most dads vanished. One-third had not seen their kids in five years. That\u2019s no longer the case, especially for the millennials.\u201dToday\u2019s blended family is as complex as a cocktail made from a variety of ingredients, each supplying a different flavor and texture.Speaking of Mrs. Peck\u2019s viral wedding photo, Ariana Niver, 27, who married last December at the Meritage Resort and Spa in Napa, Calif., said: \u201cI was so touched by it. I shared it on my Facebook page. It\u2019s a blessing to have two father figures, and I remember being impressed with how mature and selfless the decision to share that moment with this woman\u2019s father was.\u201dMrs. Niver, whose parents divorced when she was 2, and whose mother remarried a year later, had both her father and stepfather walk her individually, each give a speech and each have his own father/daughter dance.\u201cDeciding who should go first and who should give me away was extremely stressful,\u201d she said. Mrs. Niver\u2019s stepfather was assigned the lead and was met at the halfway mark by her father. \u201cWhen my stepdad walked me, I felt calm and relaxed; he was the perfect person to start me off,\u201d she said. \u201cTransitioning to my dad, I remember feeling proud. That he was the right person to lead me to my husband.\u201dAs families merge and morph, so do the relationships within them. Couples \u2014 both straight and gay \u2014 are now revamping or reinterpreting wedding traditions. How many male figures walk a child down the aisle or who does a thoughtful handoff is one of the most recent of these reconfigurations.\u201cMy generation is very open to sharing this moment,\u201d Mrs. Niver said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about following an exact tradition.\u201dAlicia Zani, 29, is very close with her stepmother, Melissa Zani, and stepfather. When Alicia was married last September in New Hampshire, her father and stepfather both walked her down the aisle.\u201cIt was Alicia\u2019s idea to ask her father if he minded that she also ask her stepfather,\u201d Melissa Zani said, who added that the bride\u2019s father was not only on board but said he\u2019d be disappointed if his daughter had failed to give a major role in the ceremony to her stepfather.Melissa Zani, a divorce lawyer, mentioned that not all families function as cohesively as they do. \u201cThis is a culmination of hard work paired with the goal to make your child happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no \u2018step\u2019 in our family. That\u2019s this generation\u2019s gift to be able to do that.\u201dJames H. Bray, an associate professor and a psychologist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a real cultural shift happening. The loyalty conflicts and competition biological fathers may have felt in the \u201890s toward other men raising their children has dissipated. Fathers understand another person is helping to raise their child, and a lot of fathers are learning to be O.K. with that. That loyalty shift is also happening to the children of stepfamilies as they learn it\u2019s O.K. to love both men. They realize their stepfathers are making more contributions to their lives socially, psychologically and financially.\u201dWhile some families affected by divorce are openly embracing weddings as a healing moment, others find themselves only tentatively moving in that direction.For Mrs. Warner, her wedding was the first time her three dads had been in the same room together. \u201cThey put their differences aside for the day,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving them all in one place doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a lifetime change for them. It\u2019s still a tender spot for everyone.\u201dIt\u2019s about love and equality, she said.\u201cI own these relationships,\u201d Mrs. Warner said. \u201cIt was important not to remove anyone from this day because they\u2019ve all been a part of my life. Each man is deeply significant and deserves to be a part of my special day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will Trump Swallow the G.O.P. Whole?", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "FeatureInside the identity crisis roiling the Republican Party.Supported byAs suits a man occupying what might be the toughest political job in America, Priebus does his best to stay availed of serene distractions. He plays jazz piano at home late at night and gazes into the 29-gallon saltwater fish tank that he keeps next to his desk. \u201cYou see that big eel?\u201d Priebus asked one day, pointing out a black slithery creature on the bottom, before noting others. \u201cThat\u2019s a yellow tang, hippo tang, a spotted puffer. There\u2019s an anemone. An urchin. An orange clown fish.\u201d He took a hunk of shrimp from a refrigerator and dangled it with a set of tongs into the water. A race to the bottom ensued as bits fell away and the fish vied for pieces of flesh. It was difficult to look away from the feeding frenzy. The big orange clown fish flailed at front and center. I asked Priebus if it reminded him of anyone. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said with something between a slight grunt and chuckle.No matter how much Trump has roiled the Republican water, it remained Priebus\u2019s job to carry it. The presumed Republican nominee appears on many days to be at open war with the party that is about to nominate him. The entire campaign, meanwhile, has been a proxy battle for the proverbial \u201csoul of the party\u201d that has been escalating between the G.O.P.\u2019s populist grass roots (captured by Trump) and \u201cparty leaders\u201d (embodied by Priebus, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell). Is the G.O.P. now the \u201cparty of Trump\u201d? Priebus bristles when people ask him this \u2014 or taunt him. I asked Priebus some variation on this question during each of my visits. \u201cDonald Trump is Donald Trump,\u201d Priebus says. \u201cAnd the party is the party.\u201d\u201cPriebus\u201d is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a \u201cb\u201d stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with \u201cpints\u201d) is 44 but has an older-man\u2019s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly put-upon manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest. The Trump issue, in other words. It\u2019s never far from anything, and really, these days, what else is there?Plenty, Priebus kept trying to convince me. The Republican Party had its own distinct identity and principles and points of pride. It controls both chambers of Congress and holds more federal and statewide seats than at any time since 1900, he said. What keeps eluding Republicans is the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six national elections. \u201cCultural elections,\u201d Priebus calls them \u2014 \u201cthe big ones.\u201d A chief reason for this is that many voters dismiss Republicans as being culturally and demographically stuck in 1900. It was Priebus who commissioned and endorsed the findings of the G.O.P. \u201cautopsy\u201d after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. Formally christened as the \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project,\u201d the report warned that the G.O.P. was \u201cincreasingly marginalizing itself\u201d to a point where it would be \u201cincreasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\u201d That is, the report concluded, unless the party expanded its aging white base to include more immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, precisely the groups the next likely standard-bearer has so splendidly repelled.Priebus refers to himself as a \u201cparty guy.\u201d He spent much of his youth in Kenosha, Wis., organizing pizza parties for Republican volunteers, putting up yard signs and listening to Newt Gingrich speeches on cassettes in his car \u2014 party-guy things. His first date with his future wife included a trip to a Republican Lincoln Day dinner, an evening sexed up by the presence of two Republican congressmen: James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Henry Hyde of Illinois. Being a \u201cparty guy\u201d can come off sounding a little old-school nerdy, like being a ham-radio guy. But Priebus speaks of this identity with sincere pride, and his allegiance is clear: to \u201cthe party,\u201d not any one nominee.On this particular day, cable news was wall-to-wall with stories: the surfacing of an audio tape of someone sounding a lot like Trump claiming to be a Trump \u201cspokesman\u201d; the discovery of a Facebook post from Trump\u2019s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed; and news that the Trump campaign had selected a white nationalist leader to be a California delegate (the delegate wound up resigning). Priebus eventually pivoted to Trump\u2019s supposed \u201cauthenticity.\u201d Yes, \u201cauthenticity\u201d was a better word, more latitude. He settled on the idea that Trump was a \u201cunique\u201d candidate who had created a new standard for what a politician could say and get away with. \u201cHe\u2019s carved out this idea that he\u2019s this earthquake in a box,\u201d Priebus says.Priebus was saying in effect that it would be possible to build a wall around Donald Trump and not have the G.O.P. pay for it. Trump did not define its values in the long term, even if he might temporarily defile them. \u201cWe\u2019re the party of the \u2018open door,\u2019\u2009\u201d Priebus told me, as he often does. Not big, beautiful walls.For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of \u201cmaturing\u201d as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to \u201csupport the nominee,\u201d if not endorse him. The \u201cnormalization\u201d of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio\u2019s case) deriding him as a \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201ccon man\u201d and \u201clunatic\u201d or (in Graham\u2019s) a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d or (in Jindal\u2019s) a \u201cmadman who must be stopped\u201d or (in Perry\u2019s) a \u201cbarking carnival act.\u201d I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries. Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians,\u201d he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry. In an interview, I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years. His smirk was audible over the phone. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not referring to any politicians in particular, but I\u2019ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPoliticians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal. But they are not as tough.\u201dPriebus, meanwhile, kept working the phones, trying to coax anti-Trump Republicans back to the party line and persuade \u2014 beg \u2014 Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on. \u201cI have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn\u2019t think are deserving of grace,\u201d Priebus said. Trump, in turn, calls Priebus \u201cMr. Switzerland\u201d and speaks well of him. \u201cReince is a peacemaker, a very good person for getting people together,\u201d he said. Trump was calling me from his limo after a rally in Anaheim, Calif. He was in the midst of an intrapartisan grudge tour of the American West, during which he disparaged, among other Republicans, Jeb Bush, the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and the New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez, who is one of the highest-profile Hispanic elected officials in the G.O.P. He also reiterated that Romney was a \u201closer\u201d and a \u201cchoker\u201d and for good measure boasted that \u201cI have a store that\u2019s worth more money than he is.\u201d\u201cIt depends how it turns out,\u201d he said.Trump would of course be the first to point out that both McCain and Romney lost and that he has been doubted at every step of his campaign. But the degree to which he seems unconcerned with his pariah status among name Republicans remains a key feature of his pursuit. To a comical extent, top Republicans willed themselves invisible when I reached out to them for this article, fearing, not incorrectly, that the conversation would turn to Trump. This included some of the most typically quotable Republicans, including former Trump challengers like Graham (\u201cHe\u2019s sorta had his fill talking about Trump,\u201d a spokesman emailed), Perry (\u201cThanks for thinking of him\u201d) and Ted Cruz (\u201cNot great timing on our end\u201d); the previous nominee Mitt Romney (\u201cYou are kind to think of me,\u201d he wrote); Trump stalwarts like Chris Christie (\u201cWe are going to take a pass this time\u201d); Trump-averse Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts (\u201cThe governor won\u2019t be available\u201d); and senators like Mike Lee, of Utah (\u201cSenator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the G.O.P. and conservatism in general. We are free anytime after Nov 8.\u201d).I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called \u201cthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency\u201d but who later said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only \u201cspeak about things I believe in, not somebody else\u2019s platform.\u201d Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he\u2019ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes. You envision him under a mushroom cloud, assuring his kids that it could be even worse \u2014 at least he didn\u2019t vote for Clinton.There\u2019s a palpable weariness among Republicans, and it\u2019s still only June. Every day, it\u2019s something else. \u201cWhat it does is suck all the oxygen out of the chamber,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told me. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do my job as a senator, which does not end because we have a contentious and bizarre presidential candidate.\u201dTrump, after accumulating enough delegates to win the nomination with almost no visible operation or recognizable strategy, has only nominally scaled his campaign beyond where it was a few months ago. There is barely any fund-raising or field apparatus to speak of, and Trump has outsourced a great deal of the nitty-gritty of an enormous general-election campaign to the overtasked R.N.C. Priebus has won praise for revamping the fund-raising, data and field infrastructure that he inherited from his embattled predecessor, Michael Steele, in 2011. But no national committee in recent memory has been called upon to pick up as much operational slack in a general election. I asked Priebus if he was frustrated that so much has been thrown into the R.N.C.\u2019s lap. \u201cIt\u2019s more frustrating for us when a campaign comes in and layers over our field staff,\u201d is how he spun it.In addition to celebrating the presidential nominee, national conventions are a showcase for party eminences, rising stars and elected officials. Not so here. The last nominee, Romney, and two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, have said they are not supporting Trump or will not campaign for him. McCain has said he would be skipping the convention and is pursuing his senate re-election in Arizona with characteristically gritted teeth: the familiar \u201cit pains me to do this\u201d routine. Three of the top five runners-up in the primaries \u2014 Cruz, Jeb Bush and the Ohio governor John Kasich \u2014 have either made no commitment to support Trump or, in Bush\u2019s case, said definitively he would not support him. A fourth, Rubio, in addition to his prolonged and winding agony over Trump, has said he does \u201cnot want to be considered\u201d as Trump\u2019s running mate. This is a popular distancing trick doubling as a nifty humble-brag among reluctant Trump endorsers. \u201cTo the members of the press who are asking, while I am flattered to be mentioned,\u201d Nikki Haley said, \u201cmy plate is full, and I am not interested in serving as vice president.\u201d (For the record, Trump finds these expressions annoying. \u201cThey were never asked,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when they do that, because it\u2019s very dishonest. If they\u2019ve taken themselves out, it means they\u2019re not being asked.\u201d)There is a distinct sense among leading Republicans that if you take proper precautions \u2014 Trump-proofing \u2014 it\u2019s possible to avoid contagion. Ryan agreed to be interviewed for a Father\u2019s Day feature in People Magazine but only on the condition that no Trump questions be asked.Trump seems to fundamentally welcome the party\u2019s revulsion. As Ryan wavered over supporting him, Trump was privately saying that Ryan\u2019s rejection might actually help him, that he was just the kind of political lifer whom Trump positioned his campaign against. His social-media director (and a former caddie), Dan Scavino Jr., actually went public with this, tweeting out a link to a column in Breitbart headlined, \u201cPaul Ryan Is the Reason the G.O.P. Is Losing America.\u201dWhile Ryan is trying to refashion and sell the G.O.P. as a party of innovation and heart, Trump is a creature of mouth and gut and other lower-body drivers. They can try to operate in parallel G.O.P. universes, but the two styles are often in obvious conflict.When we spoke, Ryan was most eager to discuss Priebus, his old friend and fellow Wisconsinite. Along with the high-profile governor, Scott Walker, the trio form a formidable G.O.P. axis of cheese heads. I asked Ryan how he, as the highest-ranking elected Republican, would distinguish his mission as a party leader from Priebus\u2019s. \u201cI see my role as helping to define the standard, which are the issues,\u201d Ryan told me. Priebus\u2019s role is building the party\u2019s apparatus to be ready for the standard-bearer. \u201cReince is basically being the adult in calming the situation,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is protecting that grass-roots process. Reince is protecting that from being disfigured or hijacked.\u201dJindal\u2019s \u201cstupid party\u201d remark reflected a concern among idea conservatives that was marinating well before Trump came along: that the Republican Party has taken on an increasingly anti-intellectual bent. There has been a strong populist allergy to elitism within the G.O.P. coalition for a long time. But Sarah Palin\u2019s emergence as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008 and subsequent tenure as a party celebrity was a benchmark. Lesser imitators like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain took turns as Republican front-runners in 2012. Trump made his name as a national political figure in 2011 and 2012 with his flamboyant campaign to prove that Obama was not born in the United States, an oft-discredited notion that was especially offensive to African-Americans. Four years later, the leader of what many Republicans had hoped was a nativist fringe movement is the party\u2019s presumed nominee.Ryan believed that he and fellow idea-mavens in Congress could preserve the party\u2019s substantive core. This would be the laboratory from which he could remake the party\u2019s conservative identity while attracting new Republicans, including young and minority voters. \u201cI have to protect conservatism from being disfigured,\u201d Ryan told me. His focus, he said, is on \u201cideas, temperament and the future of conservatism.\u201dRyan has little confidence that Trump cares at all about his ideas, possessed that temperament or had thought at all about the future of conservatism. Trump almost never talks about \u201cideas,\u201d unless you count blustery promises to \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it,\u201d end lousy trade deals and \u201cwin\u201d again.When, after considerable public hesitation, Ryan finally did say he would \u201cvote for\u201d Trump, he wrote a column in a newspaper in Janesville, Wis., reiterating his view that \u201cpolitics can be a battle of ideas, not insults\u201d and that \u201cif we\u2019re going to unite, it has to be over ideas.\u201d He said he had become convinced that Trump \u201cwould help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws.\u201dPriebus and Ryan were relatively powerless during the primaries as Trump undertook his systematic disfiguring of the R.N.C.\u2019s plans for a more inclusive party. Last summer, during the relatively innocent months of Trump\u2019s campaign, Priebus called and urged him to tone down his remarks (about \u201cMexican rapists,\u201d for example). Trump scoffed at the idea that such a puny figure, a party guy, would ever try such a thing. \u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with a five-star Army general,\u201d Trump said. Priebus paid a debasing house call to Trump Tower last fall to accompany Trump as he signed a loyalty pledge to the eventual nominee. He listened this spring to Trump predict \u201criots\u201d in Cleveland and complain about the \u201crigged\u201d system that might deny him his rightful nomination. (\u201cGive us all a break,\u201d Priebus tweeted at one point.) He has endured an outpouring from a gallery of never-Trumpers who are urging the R.N.C. to take extraordinary measures and disavow its extraordinary nominee. \u201cIf Priebus ends up blessing the Trump nomination,\u201d wrote the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, the head White House speechwriter for George W. Bush, \u201cit would turn the sins of Trump into the sins of the G.O.P. And Priebus would go down as the head of the party who squandered the legacy of Lincoln, the legacy of Reagan, in a squalid and hopeless political effort.\u201dPriebus is not a man for extraordinary measures. He is an organization man in a time of disruption, runaway self-esteem and selfie campaigns. Party guys go along. It\u2019s not always a fair fight.Still, the culture and speed of technological change has fueled an accelerated shift in how voters engage with and perceive political institutions and politicians. When I asked Trump the \u201cwhy join a party?\u201d question, he said, \u201cI think the whole system is changing.\u201d His toggling between parties over the years has been well documented. Likewise, his embrace of atypical Republican positions during the primaries \u2014 his support for some aspects of Planned Parenthood \u2014 did nothing to thwart his nomination. It would indicate that voters might not be as wedded to the assumed conservative orthodoxies as G.O.P. leaders might think. \u201cYou have people who are socially conservative and fiscally nonconservative and vice versa,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cYou have so many different permutations now.\u201dTrump\u2019s embrace of this \u00e0 la carte approach comports to a sensibility of voters\u2019 choosing between models of disruption rather than a singular ideology. In a sense, disruption in and of itself has become an ideology. Whoever swings the biggest wrecking ball wins. \u201cWashington is so broken and needs to be disrupted, and a lot of what could happen in this disruption would be good,\u201d said Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska. \u201cUnfortunately, it has to be someone who takes seriously the stewarding of a whole nation. And who cares about facts. And who is trustworthy.\u201dSasse was pointedly not talking about Trump. He has said that he could not support him as his party nominee. He would not be voting for Clinton either. \u201cThere are Dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two \u2018leaders,\u2019\u2009\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post in which he predicted the imminent breakup of both parties. He was harsher on Trump. Everywhere he goes in Nebraska, Sasse told me, people ask him for advice. \u201cPeople say: \u2018I\u2019m distraught. I\u2019m opposed to everything Hillary Clinton stands for, and yet I think I have to vote for her. How do you make sense of this? What should I do?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cThese are young evangelical women, teary sometimes. They say, \u2018I can never tell my kids I voted for that man.\u2019\u2009\u201dSasse, who is 44, became an instant luminary of the so-called Never Trump movement after he unloaded on Trump. He is mostly avoiding interviews, though in a classic bit of politician faux-modesty took this as an opportunity to share with me that \u201cI\u2019ve turned down something like 45 Sunday shows in a row.\u201dI asked Sasse if America\u2019s fascination with celebrity might help explain the rise of Trump. No, he said. \u201cThere is such crisis of shared vision for what America means right now,\u201d Sasse, a Harvard-trained former college president and business consultant, said. \u201cPeople desperately seek shallower pop culture as a form of escape rather than finding actual meaning.\u201d For politics to be satisfying, it requires deeper ideals. And to partake of it as just another celebrity snack food leads a citizen to feel, after a while, \u201clike you\u2019ve eaten a crap-ton of cotton candy.\u201dIn a tweet from early May, Sasse tried to nudge the former senator Tom Coburn into making a third-party bid. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and family-practice physician, left the Senate in 2015 after spending his career \u2014 six years in the House, 10 in the Senate \u2014 as one of Washington\u2019s proudest conservative mavericks and procedural troublemakers. Sasse told me that Coburn is one of his political idols. He also mentioned Paul Ryan. \u201cIf Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan have a baby,\u201d Sasse said, \u201cI\u2019m their hideous offspring.\u201dAll things being equal, Coburn would welcome having a superdisrupter in Washington. He has never been a party guy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters, the parties,\u201d Coburn, now retired and living in Tulsa, said. But Trump has been \u201crepulsive to me,\u201d he said, adding that Trump\u2019s ability to win a party nomination \u201ckind of fits with the modern social decline of America.\u201d I asked Coburn what Trump\u2019s nomination signaled about the state of G.O.P. He was characteristically glib, apocalyptic and idealistic. \u201cEither Trump is going to totally destroy the Republican Party,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cOr in the aftermath of him possibly losing an election, we\u2019re going to rebuild it stronger than ever.\u201dThe raze-and-rebuild option is predicated on Trump\u2019s losing. Several Republicans I spoke to seemed to hope for this, if not explicitly. It is politically fraught, obviously, to say they will not support their party\u2019s presidential nominee. But based on my discussions, I\u2019m willing to bet a good portion of the elected Republicans who claim minimal allegiance to \u201cthe nominee\u201d will wind up voting for Clinton in the privacy of their voting booths while rooting for Trump\u2019s complete humiliation. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to swallow it,\u201d said Mark Salter, the longtime chief of staff and confidant of John McCain. \u201cHe\u2019s just unfit for the office,\u201d referring to Trump. As for Clinton, he said, \u201cI mean, the worst thing you can say about her is, she\u2019s kind of a hack.\u201dEd Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and veteran of the Reagan and George H.W. Bush White Houses, calls himself a \u201cnot yet Republican,\u201d meaning he is \u201cnot yet\u201d ready to support Trump and has in fact moved in the opposite direction since Trump clinched the nomination last month. Rogers, a longtime business partner of the former Mississippi governor and R.N.C. chairman Haley Barbour, acknowledged that the Republicans tend to exaggerate Clinton\u2019s flaws as a trade prerogative. \u201cThe Clintons have never been the demons ideologically that we\u2019ve made them out to be,\u201d Rogers told me. \u201cFrom a character standpoint, they\u2019re pretty bad, but Hillary isn\u2019t the frightening offensive character that Trump is.\u201dIf grass-roots Republicans rebelled against the \u201cestablishment\u201d in the primaries, Trump has provided the establishment with mounting ammunition to fight back in the 11th hour. The first half of June has been a running train wreck for Trump, beginning with his crusade against Judge Curiel. Trump has been provoking increasing alarm among Republicans at the moment he should be proving himself nominally \u201cpresidential.\u201d The Republican senator Mark Kirk of Illinois announced that he could no longer support Trump in the aftermath of Curiel (\u201cI think he\u2019s too bigoted and racist for the Land of Lincoln\u201d); Lindsey Graham did the same and urged other Republicans backing Trump to rescind their endorsements. Top Republicans voiced widespread opposition post-Orlando to Trump\u2019s reiterated calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.Trump in turn called party leaders \u201cweak\u201d and pounded them for not falling in line behind him. \u201cJust please be quiet, don\u2019t talk,\u201d he railed at them at a June 15 rally in Atlanta. \u201cWe have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me do it by myself,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll do very well.\u201d He would be banking on the two-party system being sufficiently hobbled that allegiance to him would prevail over partisan loyalty. Republicans wouldn\u2019t hold it against Trump that he\u2019s anathema to their establishment while Democrats would feel no loyalty to their traditional home team, let alone to Hillary Clinton. Trump appeared at this moment prepared to begin an independent general-election campaign under the nominal banner of the Republican Party, while using their abundant resources. This looked more like a jail break than a pivot.Priebus played the good party soldier. \u201cRespect Mitt and differences but couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d he tweeted at Romney after his remarks. \u201cLet\u2019s stop this and unify.\u201d Priebus told Trump opponents at the retreat that Trump would win \u201cwith or without their help.\u201d He conveyed the exasperation of a substitute teacher being pelted with flying erasers.In almost every visit, Priebus and I had engaged in some variation on the same discussion. I kept asking him: \u201cWhose party is this anyway? Who gets to define the G.O.P.?\u201dPriebus and others might try to shape Trump\u2019s behavior. They talk every day, Priebus and Trump. And tens of millions of people are having their impressions formed, shaped or solidified about today\u2019s Republican Party by watching Donald Trump. They will vote for or against him in droves, not based on anything they read in the platform, whose readership probably amounts to less than 1 percent of Trump\u2019s Twitter following.When I walked into Priebus\u2019s office, he sat on his couch and soldiered forth like a good party guy. If Ryan and McConnell tried to remain boxed off from the earthquake, Priebus occupied another shelter, constructed of talking-point armor, alternate reality and denial. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good about things,\u201d Priebus told me. His voice was flat and deliberate, hostage-video mode. It was hard to resist a few pokes at the organization man. How\u2019s that Trump pivot working out?\u201cI think it\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Priebus said. He was trying to be upbeat. \u201cI have Hillary Clinton on the other side,\u201d he said, clinging to her as a lifeline. He was hoarse. I noticed him fiddling with a drink coaster. The coaster bore a cartoon rendition, sure enough, of Donald Trump: the only physical likeness I noticed anywhere in the building. Priebus had swiped a couple of these coasters from the bar at the Hay-Adams Hotel and found them amusing. He set them on a side table in his office, next to the fish tank.He predicted that Clinton\u2019s campaign would be a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d Well, yes. There\u2019s nothing like claims of moral high ground on a campaign. But I couldn\u2019t help reminding Priebus that Trump recently accused President Bill Clinton of rape, Obama of treason, Hillary Clinton of murdering Vince Foster, Cruz\u2019s dad of associating with assassins, Romney of not being a \u201creal\u201d Mormon and the rest of the litany. Where did the bottom even begin, and where could it possibly end? Priebus said that the rape and Vince Foster things were \u201csort of just warning shots to the Hillary campaign.\u201dHe also claimed that Trump and Clinton were running \u201ctied in the polls,\u201d though this was being contradicted as we spoke. Clinton led Trump by 12 points in a new Bloomberg survey, with 55 percent of respondents saying they would never vote for the Republican; and in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, seven in 10 Americans viewed Trump unfavorably, up 10 points in just the last month. A few days earlier, the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said that Republicans\u2019 accepting Trump as the nominee was \u201clike ignoring Stage IV cancer.\u201d There was a new wave of \u201cDump Trump\u201d stories in the media, mostly featuring the same band of wishful-thinking Never Trumpers who seem to spend vast amounts of time on Twitter. I asked Priebus about any convention situation that could deny Trump the nomination. He did not reject the possibility, but it\u2019s remote. It would require an alternative candidate (none currently), an organizing effort and a confluence of highly unlikely rule changes, delegate votes and procedural hurly-burly whose likelihood Priebus compared to drawing an inside straight three times in a row.\u201cI think people are living in Fantasy Land,\u201d he said, not saying whether he shared in the fantasy. Priebus was heading out to catch a flight to Greensboro, N.C., for a fund-raising event with Trump that night. He was playing a role, the party guy, the proprietor of the china shop in the time of the bull. There was something oddly comforting to me about this presence, as thankless and unenviable as the life of Priebus might seem these days. What could be better for a lifer apparatchik? Priebus made a perfect old-school foil to a new politics of blazing chaos. \u201cIt could be a great moment or a bad moment,\u201d Priebus told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a moment.\u201dI thanked Priebus for his time. He was still fumbling with the cartoon Donald Trump coasters. \u201cYour party\u2019s made this story fun for me,\u201d I told him.\u201cHave I made it fun?\u201d he asked, almost plaintively. \u201cOr have I made it less fun?\u201dAn article on June 26 about the future of the Republican Party misspelled the given name of the governor of New Mexico. She is Susana Martinez, not Susanna.Mark Leibovich is the chief national correspondent for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rare Visit to Taiwan by Siberian Crane Is a Bird-Watcher\u2019s Dream", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byJinshan JournalJINSHAN, Taiwan \u2014 The paparazzi gathered by the dozens, braving cold and rain and sticky heat. Sometimes their lanky quarry would lead them on long chases. Other times the celebrity would cooperate, particularly if crab or snail was on offer, drawing huge crowds to this farming hamlet on the northern coast of Taiwan after each sighting.The subject of such adoration was not a teenage Mandopop star in hiding but a bird \u2014 a Siberian crane, one of fewer than 4,000 in the world and the only one ever seen on this Asian island on the edge of the tropics.Environmentalists called him the little white crane of Jinshan, after the rural district where he spent most of his time, and his movements were tracked on Facebook and in the local news media. After he briefly ventured south over the mountains and took temporary refuge in the parking lot of a Taipei subway station, satellite trucks lined the country roads to monitor his return.The local government hired a full-time bodyguard to look out for the crane, who faced threats from feral dogs and powerful typhoons. But the biggest problem was the sightseers.\u201cThey were hard to control,\u201d Chuang Kuo-liang, the bird\u2019s guard, said. \u201cThey wanted to get close and touch him.\u201dI first encountered bird-watching in Taiwan when I lived in Taipei in 2014. Walk through any park in the city or bike the trails lining its rivers, and you will inevitably encounter a gaggle of bird-watchers with tripod-mounted cameras. They stand on muddy banks and circle around trees with nests, patiently waiting for a glimpse of a treasured creature.\u201cYou have to wait, because you don\u2019t know when it will return,\u201d said Kao Twan-kao, a retired civil engineer who was watching the nest of a Taiwan barbet on a rainy afternoon in Taipei\u2019s Daan Forest Park. \u201cSometime you will only see it once every few hours.\u201dThe Taiwan barbet is known in Chinese as the \u201cfive-colored bird\u201d for its green, red, yellow, blue and black plumage. One was waiting in the nest, a hole in a slender tree trunk, while its mate was out searching for food. We were lucky. After a few minutes, the brightly colored bird stuck its head out into the gloomy light of day.\u201cThese birds are so cute,\u201d said one bird-watcher, Chen Jia-hu, as he watched alongside his camera. \u201cSo we all want to protect them and protect the environment.\u201dSeveral migratory birds, including the endangered black-faced spoonbill, spend winters on the island, too.The Siberian crane was an anomaly. The bird was less than a year old when he arrived in December 2014, with cinnamon-brown feathers on his back and head. Later, as his adoring fans in Taiwan looked on, those colors gave way to pure white with black primary feathers.Siberian cranes can live up to 80 years, but they are critically endangered. Fewer than 20 remain in western Siberia, migrating to Iran in the winters. A population in central Siberia that used to winter in India disappeared more than a decade ago.The remaining cranes are in eastern Siberia and spend their winters in southeast China, downriver from the Three Gorges Dam at Poyang Lake, the country\u2019s largest freshwater lake, which has experienced periods of extreme drought in recent years. The local environmental bureau has sometimes scattered corn to ensure that the birds have an adequate food supply.\u201cIn the past there was always a balance, but now because of climate change, because of the man-made control of the water, cranes are facing a situation where they depend on humans to feed them to survive,\u201d said Chiu Ming-yuan, the deputy executive director of the Taiwan Ecological Engineering Development Foundation. \u201cAnd all the world\u2019s Siberian cranes are in that one place. It\u2019s a very dangerous situation.\u201dThe Jinshan crane, though, was apparently blown off course while flying to Poyang with his parents, landing 400 miles to the southeast in Taiwan to the thrill of the island\u2019s avid bird-watchers. He stands close to five feet tall, with long thin legs and wings that stretch more than seven feet. He would spend his days wading through the flooded fields, making plaintive honks as he searched for snails and fish.Mr. Chiu, whose organization took up the cause of the bird\u2019s protection, said that some 50,000 to 60,000 people made the journey to see him in Jinshan, which lies in a sliver of flatlands between the mountains of Yangmingshan National Park and the East China Sea.\u201cWhen this bird first came here, it not only attracted so many photographers, but also so many children who came with their school classes,\u201d Mr. Chiu said. \u201cAnd we began to think of what could we change in Taiwan, what could we change in the world.\u201dLocal environmentalists seized on the crane\u2019s visit to promote the preservation of wetlands. Mr. Chiu\u2019s organization also persuaded farmers in the area to not use herbicides and pesticides on their crops to provide a better habitat for migratory birds. They also marketed the organic rice and lotus root produced here under the bird\u2019s name, with a cartoon image of his red face on the package.And Mr. Chiu said his foundation gave farmers a stipend to compensate them for all the lotus root seedlings the crane devoured.\u201cI saw other attention-getting birds in 2015, including little penguins in Australia that drew hundreds of curious onlookers and a rare Golden Masked-Owl in New Guinea,\u201d he said by email, \u201cbut the crane in Taiwan was the only one with its own 24-hour security guard.\u201dMr. Strycker, who first visited Taiwan in 2003, said he had noticed a marked increase in interest in bird-watching on the island fueled by cheaper photographic equipment, more complete field guides and the growing availability of online resources for birders to share and communicate.\u201cOn this visit, I saw dozens of people with huge cameras where I saw none in 2003,\u201d he said. \u201cThe birds haven\u2019t changed, but interest in them has skyrocketed in the past decade.\u201dIn May, the Jinshan crane made a few trips along Taiwan\u2019s northern coast, and then one day he was gone. Researchers say he probably flew across the Taiwan Strait to mainland China and then north to join his comrades in Siberia.While farmers plan to continue refraining from using herbicides and pesticides, no one knows if the crane will return.\u201cIf he wants to leave, we should support him,\u201d said Huang Cheng-chun, one of the farmers whose rice paddies the crane called home. \u201cI hope he has a smooth trip to see his family. I hope next year he comes back with a girlfriend.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All of them began as a \u201csecret\u201d \u2014 or, as secret as one can be with an invite-only Facebook group.The groups are \u201csafe spaces,\u201d members say: a way to discuss policy and celebrate good news without having to defend; a place to bring up doubts about their candidate \u2014 What\u2019s the deal with the emails? What about her changing stance on gay marriage? \u2014 and work through them together with a nuance not typically afforded on the internet.In some, members strategize about how to respond to criticisms, keeping spreadsheets of articles that correspond with each.Others function like support groups: complete with finger snaps and Hillary cat memes and engulfing, bosom-like support.Should any members decide to \u201ccome out\u201d \u2014 that is, post publicly on their Facebook feed outside the group \u2014 they could do so knowing that they had an army of defenders, ready with \u201clikes,\u201d emoji and articles to back them up.\u201cIt\u2019s like a secret society,\u201d said Ashley Kreamer, 37, a film editor in Brooklyn, who is a member of two such groups on Facebook. \u201cA secret society of Hillary Clinton supporters.\u201dFor most of 2016, to be a vocal supporter of Mrs. Clinton \u2014 in certain circles of Bernie Sanders-supporting progressives, anyway \u2014 was to be the square in the Lacoste shirt cast to the corner of the hipster prom.And if you were young and for Hillary? Forget about it.\u201cI\u2019m treated like a traitor to my generation,\u201d said 22-year-old Patrick Ross, a playwright in Philadelphia.Older supporters were not immune either. Robert Stanton, a 53-year-old actor, had a friendship severed after he \u201cliked\u201d a photo of Mrs. Clinton and Courtney Love on Facebook. His former friend told him \u201che couldn\u2019t be friends with someone for whom he had no respect, which was quite a blow,\u201d Mr. Stanton said.Martha Harrison, 24, a medical student at New York University, said she was \u201cpretty sure\u201d a guy she was dating \u201cbroke up with me over my Clinton support.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all for lively debate,\u201d said 32-year-old Andrea Gabbidon-Levene, a program manager at a community college, \u201cbut this was something else.\u201dFor many Clinton supporters, a result was a kind of shrinking: answering when asked, but never volunteering their support. Calling yourself \u201canti-Trump\u201d instead of pro-Hillary, as Brandt Hamilton, 23, did. Buying Clinton swag but never wearing it. Dutifully picking up an \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d bumper sticker at the local Democratic headquarters but never actually sticking it on your car.\u201cAs opinionated as I am about movies, TV shows and the yoga world, I learned to be quiet during this primary season, \u201d said Mar\u00eda Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, 43, a yoga instructor in Los Angeles. \u201cI decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. So I hid, with millions of others, in plain sight.\u201dThe group\u2019s guidelines included \u201cdon\u2019t be a butthead\u201d (\u201cIf you need to disagree, focus on the substance of the argument, not the person making it\u201d) and a nod to the complexity of the word \u201cbitch,\u201d which they say that \u2014 for purposes of the group \u2014 they treat \u201cas a badge of honor and pride.\u201d\u201cWe were tired of having to deal with Bernie splainers and Hillary haters,\u201d said Natalie Miller, 38, a yoga instructor outside of Washington who founded the group with a friend, an English professor.Ms. Thomson, the New York writer who labored over her first public Facebook post, said: \u201cI\u2019d liken it to how, centuries ago, women made quilts to express their political beliefs in a way that wouldn\u2019t ruffle any feathers. My secret group was an email chain \u2014 which is, you know, clearly the \u2018quilt\u2019 of our modern times.\u201dIt was perhaps not so dissimilar, said the Democratic political consultant Will Robinson, to what many of these secret groups were doing. From the outside, it may have seemed that there was more enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders than Mrs. Clinton \u2014 his supporters saturating your Facebook feed \u2014 but Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters were there as well, albeit not shouting.\u201cI think sometimes being silent and not participating in the social media fights can be a form of sincere self-care,\u201d said Tanya Tarr, 38, a health coach and former political organizer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste my energy fighting or getting upset \u2014 I would rather quietly organize or go about my business getting my candidate elected.\u201d\u201cI volunteer at local Democratic HQ, and after the nomination, we had a bunch of women walk in and say: \u2018Is it safe now? I want to volunteer,\u2019\u201d said Clio Tarazi, 61, a retired urban planner in California. \u201cOne woman broke into tears. It was all the same sort of feeling, I think, of wanting to be comforted, of wanting to know that it was \u2018O.K.\u2019 to be public now.\u201dMr. Stanton, the actor, said: \u201cAfter Hillary clinched the nomination, I made my first public post about her.

{"Headline": "A Young Prostitute, Police Scandals and a Rocky Renaissance in Oakland", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The mayor came into office promising a \u201cSafer Oakland\u201d and greater trust between the residents of California\u2019s most crime-ridden city and a police force notorious for abuse and misconduct. Until a few weeks ago, the mayor, Libby Schaaf, a lawyer who took the post in January 2015, seemed to be delivering. Burglaries, robberies and murders are down, as are complaints of police misconduct.But in recent weeks, Oakland has been rocked by a cascade of sordid revelations that have left the city without a police chief and have surprised even a citizenry inured to police scandals.An 18-year-old prostitute, the daughter of a police dispatcher, claimed that she had had sex with officers and said the police had routinely tipped her off to raids. More than a dozen officers are under investigation, Ms. Schaaf said, and at least one of the relationships began while the prostitute was a minor.\u201cIt\u2019s tragic that this scandal has overshadowed the incredible progress that Oakland has made,\u201d Ms. Schaaf, 50, said in her wood-paneled office above the streets that are being transformed by what has been called Oakland\u2019s renaissance.\u201cAs someone who has worked for nearly 20 years on the issue of the sexual exploitation of minors,\u201d she continued, \u201cthis revelation was not just shocking. It was thoroughly depressing.\u201dThis city of about 400,000 has long had a reputation for not only rampant crime but also police abuses. The Police Department has been under court monitor since 2003, when the city settled a civil suit claiming that rogue officers known as the Riders had used excessive force and planted evidence on suspects.But the sex scandal and other controversies come at a time of brightened prospects for the city. Formerly dilapidated downtown neighborhoods are filling with restaurants, shops and yoga studios catering to the overflow of technology workers, hipsters and other economic refugees from San Francisco.Like a present waiting to be unwrapped, a large white canopy envelops the Oakland building where Uber, the ride-sharing company, is renovating its future headquarters.While the sex scandal grabbed the attention of the nation, so, too, did Ms. Schaaf\u2019s slapstick succession of leadership changes \u2014 she announced the departure of three chiefs in less than two weeks \u2014 that culminated with an empty seat at the top.The chief of police, Sean Whent, resigned early this month as reports of the scandal began appearing. Ms. Schaaf called it a \u201cpersonal choice.\u201dMs. Schaaf announced a successor, Ben Fairow, who was a deputy chief with the Bay Area Rapid Transit police. He lasted five days. The mayor called his hiring a \u201cmistake\u201d but did not offer an explanation. (While married, Mr. Fairow had \u201ca personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago,\u201d said Kenton Rainey, his supervisor at the Bay Area transit police, where Mr. Fairow returned to his job.)Paul Figueroa, the department\u2019s assistant chief, was then given the job, but he left after two days, without explanation.In announcing Mr. Figueroa\u2019s resignation, Ms. Schaaf began with a comment that would travel across the country: \u201cAs the mayor of Oakland, I am here to run a Police Department, not a frat house.\u201dShe vowed to \u201croot out a toxic, macho culture\u201d and did not name a chief. Instead, she put the police under the control of the city administrator, Sabrina Landreth. A search for a chief would probably take six months, Ms. Schaaf said.John Burris, a civil rights lawyer in Oakland who was involved in the 2003 settlement and has monitored police overhauls, said the scandals had been bewildering and disheartening because the force appeared to be on the cusp of emerging from more than a decade of court-mandated oversight.\u201cThere\u2019s been a progressive improvement in the city for a few years now,\u201d Mr. Burris said. \u201cThere has been optimism. We don\u2019t have the same levels of beatings and beat-downs by police anymore.\u201dOne striking change has been the reduction in searches without probable cause. A decade ago, the police conducted an average of 3,000 a year. Last year, that number was down to 280, Ms. Schaaf said.As part of the settlement, the city adopted a list of changes, including restrictions and conditions on when officers are allowed to use force. Out of 51 points in the settlement, Mr. Burris said, the police force is close to complying with the final three \u2014 racial profiling, the consistency of discipline and the effectiveness of the department in policing itself.Mr. Burris said the latest problems revealed a culture of collusion and an unwillingness to report wrongdoing.\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing because people knew about it and did nothing,\u201d he said.Ms. O\u2019Malley\u2019s office is leading the investigation into the sexual misconduct. No officers have yet been charged.The scandal has already affected the overhaul of the Police Department. One of Ms. Schaaf\u2019s campaign pledges was to speed the recruitment of officers. But the City Council agreed last week to delay the start of the next police academy class by two months.The force has 778 officers, well above the level in the aftermath of the recession, when layoffs brought the number of officers around 600.\u201cWe need the system changed,\u201d said Rebecca Kaplan, a city councilwoman. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem of one person or two people. A culture has been created that allows for the degradation of women.\u201dEfforts have been made for more than a decade to make the police force more diverse. Police academy classes under Oakland\u2019s previous mayor, Jean Quan, increased minority hiring and reduced the number of whites recruited to fewer than 50 percent.\u201cWe hired a police force that looked more like the city,\u201d said Ms. Quan, who also required the police to wear body cameras, a move that Mr. Burris called crucial in curbing abuses.Crime is down \u2014 26 homicides have been reported so far this year, compared with 40 at the same time last year. Robberies have declined 14 percent and burglaries 29 percent, according to police statistics through June 19.But many streets here remain unsafe. Oakland is the most dangerous major city in California, according to 2014 F.B.I. data, the latest available. Stockton and Compton were in second and third place in terms of violent crime.The police estimate that Oakland has 55 gangs. In more affluent neighborhoods, residents have banded together and hired private security guards.Black residents say racial profiling is still common. Gilbert Cross, a maintenance technician who works across from the building that Uber is renovating, said friends and family members were sometimes stopped by the police for no apparent reason.Mr. Cross said he had seen improvements since moving to the city in the 1980s, when it was \u201cdrug infested, with a lot of murders.\u201d\u201cOakland is getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut slowly.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about problems with the police department in Oakland, Calif., misstated the City Council\u2019s action regarding a delay of the next police academy class and a review of the police department\u2019s recruitment policies. The council voted on a budget that included the delay; it did not vote on the recruitment procedures that were already underway.Advertisement"}

Not long ago, Ms. Alvord, 23, said, a male fan traveled to Los Angeles from Germany to see her perform, approaching her onstage with a teddy bear and trying to kiss her. Even after she rebuffed his advances, the fan joined the line for a post-show meet-and-greet with her.Such interactions, long a fact of life for performers \u2014 and especially female musicians \u2014 are becoming more fraught as artists, responding to industry and fan expectations, must make themselves increasingly accessible while also contending with a barrage of online harassment and the threat of violence at concerts.\u201cEveryone who follows me on social media knows when I\u2019m traveling,\u201d Ms. Alvord said. \u201cThey know what I\u2019m doing, where I\u2019m performing.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Wright, who began her career in the \u201990s, said she had seen a rise in the feeling of entitlement from audiences. \u201cBack in the day, it used to be, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still here signing autographs,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s become required. They expect it.\u201dThe singer \u2014 who recalled a fan breaking into her home while she was in the shower, with hopes of reading her a poem \u2014 said her team has worked with law enforcement and keeps a file of potentially dangerous individuals. She also has a secret signal with her tour manager to indicate that she feels unsafe during fan interactions.\u201cNinety-nine-point-nine percent of the time, it\u2019s a really lovely experience,\u201d she said of meeting fans. But, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s incredible the vulnerability that that exposes an artist to.\u201dWhile canvassing with audiences is especially crucial for smaller acts, even megastars have made themselves more available in recent years, though with more fame comes tighter security.On Instagram, Mr. Bieber added of stressful fan interactions, \u201cI always leave feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted to the point of depression.\u201dBethany Cosentino of the band Best Coast said in an interview that a majority of her negative interactions occur online, but \u201cbecause a lot of females are attacked based on appearance, it feels a lot more personal.\u201dWhile she is a proponent of blocking and reporting anonymous trolls on social media, Ms. Cosentino said, \u201cThey could be a very real person with a very real problem.\u201d And what feels like \u201ca very severe lack of boundaries\u201d online, she added, can extend into the physical world, as with the overeager fans who have tried to board her tour bus.\u201cIt can be really scary,\u201d she said.Ms. Alvord started her YouTube channel at the age of 15. She knew Ms. Grimmie from what was a fledgling YouTube scene at the time, and they first collaborated in 2010. So Ms. Grimmie\u2019s death has left her especially rattled.\u201cThe first thing my parents said is, one: \u2018You\u2019re staying home,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd two: \u2018Is following your dreams worth it if it means risking your life?\u2019\u201d She added of Ms. Grimmie: \u201cWe share a lot of the same fans. Any one of us could\u2019ve been in this situation.\u201dMs. Alvord always tries to travel with a family member who is looking out for her. She said that now, along with a heightened sense of personal awareness and increased communication with venue security, she may need to institute additional rules and restrictions for when she meets her followers.\u201cFor all the thousands and thousands of fans that say I inspire them and help them, there is probably just a handful that have a twisted perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it only takes one of them to be a threat.

{"Headline": "Orlando Shootings Stitch Together Gays and Latinos, 2 Cultures Once at Odds", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 One of the survivors of Sunday\u2019s attack at the nightclub Pulse, a man closeted from his family, called his Latin American parents abroad to tell them that a close friend \u2014 who was actually his partner \u2014 had died in the bar. Their response: \u201cYou weren\u2019t in that bar, were you?\u201dThat attitude, a throwback to an earlier era, seemed the rare exception as relatives of those gunned down in the club, many of them Puerto Rican, mourned their deaths and celebrated their lives on the streets of Orlando.The moments of mourning seemed to show how far gay culture has progressed from a time when it was frequently hidden from loved ones.And so Eddie Justice, a 30-year-old gay accountant, texted his mother, Mina, \u201cMommy, I love you,\u201d as bullets flew and the gunman, Omar Mateen, headed toward the Pulse bathroom where he was hiding, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Justice was confirmed dead on Monday.In the hours since the attack, there have been countless homages on social media posted by friends and relatives, who extolled the accomplishments of their loved ones and embraced their sexual identity.And there were the families of the anguished victims, who gathered around tables and in conference rooms to await word about whether their sons, daughters, cousins or uncles \u2014 gay or straight \u2014 had died.It is not necessary to reach that far back to feel the progress, which has galloped swiftly ahead in the past 10 years. Despite setbacks and plenty of lingering hate, a new generation of gay people and lesbians feels far less weighed down by stigma and fear in today\u2019s rapidly evolving embrace of gay rights.\u201cA mother texting with her son and saying he was afraid and he was going to die,\u201d said Juan Cantu, a theatrical director of Mexican descent who lives here and was once a Disney World performer. \u201cThat is a milestone. In my generation, I\u2019m 42, I kept it hidden and I didn\u2019t have the kind of relationship with my family that I would have told them that I was at a gay bar.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cwe are not there yet.\u201dIt was Latin night at Pulse on Saturday, which meant that a large number of Latinos \u2014 gay and straight \u2014 came out to dance salsa and listen to music; most of them were Puerto Rican (a half a million live in the Orlando area) with a sprinkling of Mexicans and Colombians in the mix. While the club advertises as a gay bar and has a large gay clientele, it has always attracted a diverse group.Orlando has been one of the country\u2019s most gay-friendly cities, with progressive anti-discrimination laws and aggressive advocates in Mayor Buddy Dyer and Patty Sheehan, an openly gay councilwoman. The city hosts gay days every year, huge gatherings that draw people from around the world. Also, local companies like Universal and Disney are gay-friendly. At least one shooting victim was a Disney performer.Among Latinos, acceptance of gay culture has moved ahead less assertively. An overlay of machista culture remains, making it more difficult to come out for fear of rejection and discrimination.\u201cCertainly there are pockets of cultural resistance \u2014 be it the Hispanic community or the black community,\u201d said Tim Vargas, the president of the board of GLBT Community Center of Central Florida, who is half Mexican. \u201cBoth of those have had cultural hindrances to acceptance. I do think we have made a lot of progress.\u201dCarlos Guillermo Smith, 35, an Orlando resident who is of Peruvian and French Canadian descent and is government affairs manager for Equality Florida, the statewide gay rights organization, called the massacre inside Pulse an attack on the Latino gay, lesbian and transgender community.\u201cWhen you look at the list of names of victims, 90 percent of them are young Latino men,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who is running as a Democrat for an Orlando seat in the State House. \u201cIt is so devastating to our community because for me it is so personal, not only because this is my home, it\u2019s my community, it\u2019s against my identity as a gay Latino.\u201dAs relatives waited on Sunday outside a hospital, they spoke lovingly of the young men and women who had been shot and killed, words that bespoke the transformation that has taken place.Barron Serrano said his brother Juan P. Rivera Velazquez, 37, who loved bodybuilding and karate, had been married to Luis Conde, 39, for 13 years, a partnership he said they had worked hard to nurture. Both were Puerto Rican.\u201cThey had a bumpy relationship, at first; it was not easy and they had ups and down, but they always forgot about their problems and stuck together,\u201d Mr. Serrano said. \u201cThey were a very happy couple.\u201dAl Ferguson, the owner of a travel agency that caters to gay people, said he had kept vigil with families at the hospital in support of his friend Edward Sotomayor Jr., a Puerto Rican man who died in the shooting.\u201cWhat struck me in the room is the vast majority of family and friends there were not gay,\u201d said Mr. Ferguson, who is gay. \u201cThere were not lots of gay people supporting gay people. There were families that didn\u2019t care they were gay or didn\u2019t care they were in a gay club. They loved their son and their friend. That is a phenomenon that happened in the last six, seven, eight years: public acceptance of the gay community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Such Thing as a Healthy Smoker", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.Smokers who think they are escaping the lung-damaging effects of inhaled tobacco smoke may have to think again, according to the findings of two major new studies, one of which the author originally titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cMyth of the Healthy Smoker.\u00e2\u0080\u009dChronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or C.O.P.D., may be among the best known dangers of smoking, and current and former smokers can be checked for that with a test called spirometry that measures how much air they can inhale and how much and how quickly they can exhale. Unfortunately, this simple test is often skipped during routine medical checkups of people with a history of smoking. But more important, even when spirometry is done, the new studies prove that the test often fails to detect serious lung abnormalities that cause chronic cough and sputum production and compromise a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breathing, energy level, risk of serious infections and quality of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrent or former smokers without airflow obstruction may assume that they are disease-free,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily the case, one of the research teams pointed out. These researchers projected that there are 35 million current or former smokers older than 55 in the United States with unrecognized smoking-caused lung disease or impairments. Many, if not most, of these people could get worse with time, even if they have quit smoking. They are also unlikely to be referred for pulmonary rehabilitation, a treatment that can head off encroaching disability.Perhaps most important, those currently smoking may be inclined to think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dodged the bullet and so can continue to smoke with impunity. Doctors, who are often reluctant to urge patients with symptoms to quit smoking, may be even less likely to recommend smoking cessation to those with normal spirometry results.Even when the results of spirometry are normal, Dr. Regan added, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of smokers have respiratory symptoms. They get sick often, are more likely to be hospitalized with bronchitis or pneumonia, and have evidence on CT scans of thickened airway walls or emphysema that impair breathing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe multicenter study headed by Dr. Woodruff, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Francisco, found that smokers with normal findings on spirometry nonetheless are likely to have chronic respiratory symptoms like cough, phlegm, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness; lower than normal exercise tolerance; and evidence on a CT scan of chronically inflamed airways in the lungs. They also use more antibiotics to control respiratory infections and drugs called glucocorticoids to alleviate breathing difficulty. They pay more visits to doctors and emergency rooms and have more hospital admissions because of a flare-up of respiratory symptoms.In other words, they are far more prone than nonsmokers to experiencing terrifying episodes of troubled breathing.Of course, while lung disease is most prevalent, it is hardly the only adverse health effect of smoking, a source of noxious substances that can damage almost every organ system in the body. The list of smoking-related diseases has grown exponentially since smoking was labeled a probable cause of lung cancer 52 years ago in the first surgeon general\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report on smoking and health. The decades since have added many other deadly cancers, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, blood clots, peripheral artery disease, Type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cataracts and macular degeneration, as well as C.O.P.D.The challenge ahead, Dr. Fabbri wrote, is to identify patients with smoking-related lung damage who do not yet have obstructive disease and devise ways to treat them to reduce their symptoms and prevent flare-ups.A clinical trial to begin later this year, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, will examine whether treatments like use of a bronchodilator will help to alleviate symptoms in those without obstructive disease. Unfortunately, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cost of bronchodilator medication has gone through the roof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Woodruff said. Decades ago, people with breathing problems like asthma used aerosol bronchodilators that included chemicals called fluorocarbons. But these were banned for environmental reasons in the mid-1970s, and the replacements that drug manufacturers came up with are still not available in generic form, keeping prices high.Dr. Woodruff said that rehabilitative exercise, one of the best treatments for C.O.P.D., should also help people with lung damage short of obstruction because it improves the ability of muscles to use available oxygen more efficiently.To improve exercise tolerance, patients are encouraged to walk as fast as they can for as long as they can, rest, then walk some more. Most patients find this easiest to do on a treadmill, where speed and incline can be precisely regulated and the results measured. But if such equipment is unavailable or too costly to access, walking indoors or outdoors can be helpful if geared to a specific distance and speed that are gradually increased.Most critical, of course, is for smokers with or without symptoms of lung disease to quit smoking, which can reduce the severity of respiratory symptoms and slow the decline in lung function, Dr. Regan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team wrote. However, the team added, quitting smoking \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not eliminate the risk of progressive lung disease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means that the lungs of former smokers may need to be examined periodically.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

But another answer is that it was in many ways easier to be a working mother in 1980, when Chelsea Clinton was born, than it is today.Between the \u201980s and the aughts, when I had my children, a cloud of economic anxiety descended on parents, tightening what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild has called \u201cthe time bind.\u201d The workweek of salaried professionals ballooned from 40 hours to 50 hours or more, not counting the email catch-up done after the kids\u2019 bedtime. Union protections, predictable schedules and benefits vanished for vast numbers of blue-collar workers. Their jobs in the service or on-demand economies now pay so little, and child care costs so much (168 percent more than it did a quarter-century ago) that parents have to stitch together multiple jobs. Meanwhile, terrified that their offspring will sink even lower, parents siphon off time and money to hand-raise children who can compete in a global economy.Women like me who scale back in the face of impossible expectations feel themselves morphing into caricatures: attachment freaks, helicopter moms, concerted cultivators, neo-traditionalists. These stereotypes are just plain sexist, but I don\u2019t know many mothers whose careers, paychecks and sense of self-worth haven\u2019t been eroded by all the compromises they\u2019ve had to make. Our worlds have narrowed; our bank accounts have dipped below the minimum balance; and our power within the family and the world has dwindled. We\u2019d be quick to tell you that we wouldn\u2019t have done it any differently. Still.What if the world was set up in such a way that we could really believe \u2014 not just pretend to \u2014 that having spent a period of time concentrating on raising children at the expense of future earnings would bring us respect? And what if that could be as true for men as it is for women?We live in an age rich in feminisms. One celebrates our multiplicity of identities: black, lesbian, transgender. Another has effectively anathematized sexual violence. Yet another \u2014 I think of it as C-suite feminism \u2014 chips away at the glass ceiling that keeps women out of the most powerful jobs, such as, say, the presidency.But we need another feminism \u2014 and it needs a name that has nothing to do with gender. Let\u2019s call it, for lack of a better term, \u201ccaregiverism.\u201d It would demand dignity and economic justice for parents dissatisfied with a few weeks of unpaid parental leave, and strive to mitigate the sacrifices made by adult children responsible for aging parents.Mrs. Clinton could be a champion of caregiverism. She has been blunter this electoral season about family-friendly policies than she has ever been before. She emphasized paid family leave when she began her campaign and again in the opening statements of the first Democratic presidential debate. In May, she said she\u2019d cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of a household\u2019s income, down from what, for a household supported by minimum-wage workers, can now be more than 30 percent.But she needs to go further. Her focus is on wage-earners; what about the people who want to get out of the workplace, at least for a while? Mrs. Clinton should talk to Representative Nita Lowey of New York, who last year introduced a bill that would give Social Security credits to caregivers who left the labor market or cut back on hours \u2014 a public nod to the reality that care is work and caregivers merit the same benefits as other workers.Mrs. Clinton belongs to an earlier generation, one whose objective was to free women from the prison of domesticity \u2014 at least the middle-class women who didn\u2019t already have jobs \u2014 and send them marching into the work force to demand equality there. But true equality will take more than equal pay and better working conditions. It will require something more radical, a \u201ctransvaluation of all values,\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s phrase.There is also a venerable tradition in feminist history of trying to overturn a status quo that esteems professionals and wage-earners while demeaning those who do the unpaid or low-paid work of emotional sustenance and physical upkeep. In the 1960s, the largely African-American National Welfare Rights Organization demanded welfare payments that would maintain a decent standard of living, partly on the grounds that these mothers were working already, raising future workers, and partly because they couldn\u2019t find jobs that would support them. \u201cI am 45 years old; I have raised six children,\u201d wrote the group\u2019s chairwoman, Johnnie Tillmon, in 1972. \u201cA job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some 10 million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ve got the best chance of getting one.\u201dAround the same time, the Marxist feminists Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James began a campaign called Wages for Housework that called for the overthrow of a capitalist order subsidized, in their view, by the unpaid slog of homemaking and, yes, sexual services. This did not mean that women should necessarily go out and find jobs. \u201cNot one of us believes that emancipation, liberation, can be achieved through work,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSlavery to an assembly line is not liberation from slavery to a kitchen sink.\u201dLiberal feminists accused them of wanting to push women back into domestic drudgery, but they denied it. \u201cWe have worked enough,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe have chopped billions of tons of cotton, washed billions of dishes, scrubbed billions of floors, typed billions of words, wired billions of radio sets, washed billions of nappies, by hand and in machines.\u201d So what did they want? I asked Silvia Federici, a founder of the New York chapter of Wages for Housework who writes prolifically on these questions. Actual wages for housework aside, she said, the movement wanted to make people ask themselves, \u201cWhy is producing cars more valuable than producing children?\u201dThe program put in place by Bill Clinton in 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, cuts off benefits after five years or less; forces women to hold or look for jobs, whether or not there are any to be had; and allows states to shunt welfare funds into other programs. And so, from 1996 to 2011, the number of families living in extreme poverty \u2014 on $2 per person a day or less \u2014 more than doubled. A majority of those households were headed by single mothers.IN an important new book, \u201cFinding Time,\u201d the economist Heather Boushey argues that the failure of government and businesses to replace the services provided by \u201cAmerica\u2019s silent partner\u201d \u2014 the stay-at-home wife \u2014 is dampening productivity and checking long-term economic growth. A company that withholds family leave may drive away a hard-to-replace executive. Overstressed parents lack the time and patience to help children develop the skills they need to succeed. \u201cToday\u2019s children are tomorrow\u2019s work force,\u201d Ms. Boushey writes. \u201cWhat happens inside families is just as important to making the economy hum along as what happens inside firms.\u201dI had my children at 39 and 40. (Mrs. Clinton was 32.) My 12-year-old daughter is already calculating how soon she\u2019ll have to have children if I\u2019m going to be strong enough to lift them. Younger than I was, I tell her. But she\u2019s bright and ambitious. I could see her going to graduate school.I recently got into an argument with a professor friend about the plausibility of restructuring higher education and the professions so that women \u2014 and men \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have to hustle for positions like partner or associate professor just as they reach peak fertility. Many universities, I said, now stop the tenure clock for a year when assistant professors have children. My friend laughed. A year is nothing when it comes to a baby, she said. She\u2019d never have won tenure if she\u2019d had her son first.I didn\u2019t know what to say. At least she had a child, unlike friends who waited until too late.Here\u2019s a fantasy my daughter and I entertain: What if child-rearing weren\u2019t an interruption to a career but a respected precursor to it, like universal service or the draft? Both sexes would be expected to chip in, and the state would support young parents the way it now supports veterans. This is more or less what Scandinavian countries already do. A mother might take five years off, then focus on her career, at which point the father could put his on pause. Or vice versa.Vice versa was the deal struck by characters on the Danish TV series \u201cBorgen,\u201d a member of Parliament and her husband. He\u2019d schlep and clean for five years; then she\u2019d do the same. (As it turned out, she became prime minister and their marriage went to hell. But that\u2019s a problem few of us would ever have to face.)What really makes the \u201cBorgen\u201d model a mismatch for the United States is that American families, particularly low-income families, can\u2019t do without a double income, given wage stagnation and the cost of children in a country that won\u2019t help parents raise them. But having to work should not be confused with wanting to work, at least not without some stops along the way. \u201cIt takes 20 years, not 12 weeks, to raise a child,\u201d as the feminist legal scholar Joan Williams has written.It\u2019s a little late for me, if not, thank goodness, for my daughter. I fled my cul-de-sac before I should have, in part because I convinced myself that it was becoming a lovely, leafy, azalea-pink prison. City life is great, thank you, but I have regrets. I should have gone on longer rambles with the babies; blown more deadlines; been quicker to heed my son\u2019s demand to \u201csee train\u201d at the nearby station. The articles could have waited; the sight of a little boy clapping as a train squealed to a stop could not. As for Ladies\u2019 Night, it took me a long time to assemble a coterie of mothers as genial and supportive. If I\u2019m ashamed of anything now, it\u2019s how little I appreciated them then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C-Span, Gun Control and a Protest Made for Streaming", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookFor one day and night, the hottest drama on cable was on C-Span.The Democratic sit-in over gun-control legislation, captured mainly by House members\u2019 smartphone video, had all the elements: emotion, chaos, conflict, life-or-death stakes and the frisson of unpredictable reality. But television cannot claim credit for the show alone; it was a coproduction with social media.The broadcast, like much memorable live TV, was arresting not simply for what it was showing but also for the fact that we were able to see it at all.As the protest reminded us, the congressional leadership, not C-Span, controls the cameras. When the Democrats occupied the House floor Wednesday afternoon, to try to pressure the Republican majority into a vote, Speaker Paul D. Ryan took the House out of session and the video was cut off.Word of the protest began to leak on social media. The public-affairs network \u2014 not generally known for guerrilla journalism techniques \u2014 began to improvise.Essentially, C-Span turned the screens of America into giant iPhones, picking up the live feeds that representatives shot on Periscope, Facebook Live and other social platforms.The video was grainy, balky and awkwardly framed \u2014 which only added to the samizdat, you-are-there electricity of the broadcast. Representatives gave fiery speeches and held up the names of shooting victims printed on office paper; others wandered in and out of the camera shots. It was both theatrical performance and fly-on-the-wall reality; a little \u201cWest Wing,\u201d a little \u201cBig Brother.\u201dThe amateurishness of the visuals in itself added a layer of message. The smartphones were not just broadcasting speeches, they were proclaiming the fact that those speeches were not being shown through the usual channels.Television drama needs an antagonist, of course, and the mechanics of the event cast Mr. Ryan in that role. First he was offstage, an unseen force \u2014 the old dramatist\u2019s trick of keeping the Big Bad offstage to build his mystique. When he returned to the floor Wednesday night, the drama had been primed, and the room erupted.Protests are publicity stunts by definition. They often have a concrete goal \u2014 here, action on gun legislation \u2014 but they also seek attention to a matter that someone else would prefer got less attention.That technique was not invented by a smartphone app, as we were reminded by seeing Representative John Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement, at the head of the sit-in. But protests were once about luring the cameras to you.Now legacy and social media amplify each other. The online world is like a collective field producer, calling attention to stories and curating moments. Television picks up on these stories \u2014 and the fact that the news makes the leap from social to mass media becomes part of the news in itself.All this put C-Span in an unusual position, carrying a news event shot from the perspective of an interested party. But it was news, and another interested party controlled the usual television cameras. There was no party-neutral decision to be made here, but there was a journalistic one, and C-Span made it.Almost certainly this sort of thing will happen again. There will be more seasons of this new anthology series, perhaps about different issues and packaged by new producers.Thursday morning, C-Span was still carrying Democratic speeches from the floor, though Mr. Ryan, overnight, had gotten the House to break for its recess, pushing through a final vote on an appropriations bill. \u201cMembers,\u201d he said, \u201cwill record their vote by electronic device.\u201dBut in a way, they already had.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Developer Conference: A More Open Siri, and Other Upgrades", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple\u2019s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.Apple announced:\u25a0 Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.\u25a0 Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.\u25a0 A rebranding of its Mac operating system.\u25a0 An expansion of Apple Pay.\u25a0 Opening up Siri to developers.\u25a0 Improvements in photos and maps.\u25a0 Subscriptions through Apple News.\u25a0 Opening up its messaging service to developers\u25a0 A new interface for Apple Music.Here were the main points:That segmentation suggests Apple\u2019s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.That is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominantFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.The move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)Advertisement"}

(These have strained our relationship in the past.) She confided in me that she would like to visit a therapist but can\u2019t afford to. I would like to help her with this cost. How do I offer the money without offending her? She is proud. And how do I assure myself that the money is being used for therapy only? I would hate to be taken advantage of, which has also been a problem for us.ANONYMOUSAlthough we are strangers, let me spritz my shortcomings all over you like cheap perfume. One of my lesser qualities, as a friend, is that as soon as mine so much as breathe a problem, I move into \u201csolve it\u201d mode \u2014 when, often, they simply want to vent and be heard. In my zeal, I can rob them of the chance to work through issues on their terms, and I occasionally act like a bulldozer. This may not apply to you (or it may). I\u2019m just throwing it out there.Assuming you gave your friend the chance to talk out her dilemma, express your generous offer as kindly as you have here. Say: \u201cDawn, I\u2019ve been doing well at work and have some extra cash. I would really like to help you pay for the therapy you mentioned. Will you think about accepting a gift?\u201d (Do not make this a loan. That would be a recipe for disaster.) Then don\u2019t mention the subject again until she comes back to you.If she refuses, accept her decision. But if she agrees, discuss the terms of the arrangement: Will your contribution be a lump sum or a monthly stipend, and how long will it continue? Feel free to add, \u201cThis money will only be used for therapy, agreed?\u201d But do not use this offer as an opportunity to rehash your past difficulties. If you don\u2019t trust her enough to take her word about the expenditure, better not to make the offer. But I hope you do. It\u2019s a touching show of friendship.At our local elementary school, some parents light up cigarettes while waiting on the sidewalk outside the gates during pickup time.

{"Headline": "Fighting ISIS With an Algorithm, Physicists Try to Predict Attacks", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byAfter Orlando and San Bernardino and Paris, there is new urgency to understand the signs that can precede acts of terrorism. And with the Islamic State\u2019s prolific use of social media, terrorism experts and government agencies continually search for clues in posts and Twitter messages that appear to promote the militants\u2019 cause.A physicist may not seem like an obvious person to study such activity. But for months, Neil Johnson, a physicist at the University of Miami, led a team that created a mathematical model to sift order from the chaotic pro-terrorism online universe.Experts who study terrorism and online communication said that the new research was informative, and that they appreciated that the authors would make their data available to other researchers. But they cautioned that the actions of terrorist groups are extremely difficult to anticipate and said more information was needed, especially to substantiate any predictive potential of the team\u2019s equation.\u201cThis is an interesting approach, this is a potentially valuable approach, and more research should be done on the approach,\u201d said J. M. Berger, a fellow in George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism and the co-author of \u201cISIS: The State of Terror.\u201d \u201cBut to jump ahead to the utility of it, I think, takes more work.\u201dDr. Johnson, who also heads the Complexity Initiative, an interdisciplinary research program at the University of Miami, said the study\u2019s goal was to start \u201ca proper quantitative science of online extremism to replace the black-box narrative that is currently used.\u201dInstead of focusing only on large social media groups or trying to track millions of individual users, the researchers suggest focusing on small, nimble groups because they reflect groundswells of new activity and, if followed, can potentially point to where that activity is going. While such tracking in itself might not prevent individual acts, like the massacres in Orlando or San Bernardino, it can help identify when conditions are ripe for such acts to happen, the study said.The tracking of terrorists on social media should take a cue from nature, Dr. Johnson said, where \u201cthe way transitions happen is like a flock of birds, a school of fish.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one fish saying, \u2018Hey, I want everyone to be about five inches away from someone else, and we\u2019re going to have this shape,\u2019 \u201d he said.The researchers \u2014 including experts in international covert networks who spoke Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish \u2014 analyzed activity on Vkontakte because Facebook shuts down pro-Islamic State discussions very quickly, Dr. Johnson said, and because Vkontakte\u2019s 350 million users are diverse, including many Chechen members who have been targets of Islamic State propaganda. For comparison, the researchers tracked groups promoting civil unrest in Latin America, including strikes and protests, and found both similarities and differences to online activity supporting the Islamic State.The study focused on small groups of Islamic State supporters that formed online and found about 200 such groups, with more than 100,000 members combined. The groups\u2019 postings included pledges of allegiance to the extremists, fund-raising appeals and survival tips, like how to protect oneself during drone attacks. The pull of small groups is strong. So-called lone wolf sympathizers do not remain alone long, the study said: They usually join a small group within weeks.Quashing these groups, the study found, can prevent their members from fusing with larger pro-Islamic State groups, which can quickly distribute inciting videos or statements to much broader audiences. But when small groups are blocked by Vkontakte, about a quarter of them reinvent themselves \u2014 changing their names, reincarnating, or briefly going dark before re-emerging, the researchers found.Just before the Kobani incursion, the rate of creation of pro-Islamic State online groups accelerated, Dr. Johnson said. After all the data on small groups was plugged into the team\u2019s equation, the Kobani attack was the only one the formula would have predicted, showing that the equation matched real-world occurrences during the period studied, he said.Faiza Patel, a director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, said the study showed that \u201cthere are ways to look at narrow groups rather than the entire population of internet users.\u201dBut because the Kobani attack was the only example cited, she said, \u201cFrankly, at this point, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re predicting anything.\u201d\u201cThere may be five other independent reasons for the spike in this pro-ISIS propaganda,\u201d she noted, \u201cand I don\u2019t know they have taken into account the other possible explanations.\u201dMr. Berger said Kobani, aside from being the sole example cited, was a military-style operation, not a terrorist attack, so the formula, should it hold up, might only apply to large-scale sieges.\u201cWith military action, if their strategy is to use social media to intimidate, then it makes sense\u201d that there would be a spike in online groups\u2019 forming just before, he said. \u201cBut with a terrorist attack, we\u2019re often talking about one, two, sometimes a dozen people who are operating out of conditions of secrecy.\u201dAttacks like the one in Orlando are still rare, Ms. Patel said, with \u201cso many different variables that it\u2019s very, very difficult to come up with any predictive formula.\u201dBoth Mr. Berger and Ms. Patel noted a tricky question raised by the research: When is it best to try to suppress small groups so they do not mushroom into bigger groups, and when should they be left to percolate? Letting them exist for a while might be a way to gather intelligence, Ms. Patel said.Dr. Johnson said that was one of many questions for further research. \u201cIf I break the groups up too quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cI have the risk that I\u2019m liberating out these individuals,\u201d scattering them like a virus to infect other groups.Mr. Berger praised the researchers\u2019 transparency.\u201cThere are a lot of companies that claim to be able to do what this study is claiming, and a lot of those companies seem to me to be selling snake oil,\u201d he said. If the predictive theory holds up, he added, it would be \u201cthe silver bullet everybody in the government and everybody in the private sector has been chasing for years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "I put my cameras down in 2014, after covering the war in Gaza. I\u2019d spent a month photographing entire neighborhoods leveled by the Israeli offensive, and the shattered bodies of countless men, women and children blown apart by bombs. I had seen enough of war. My desire to make pictures had been waning after more than a decade spent covering conflicts across Africa and the Middle East as a news wire photographer. The blur of wars and disasters had grown too great \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Congo, Sudan, Chad, Somalia, Afghanistan, Libya, Israel, Gaza \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as had the number of friends and colleagues injured or killed. At some point, I burned out. I lost the drive to capture events unfolding before me, mostly because the images were often upsetting, but also because they seemed to change little and did nothing for those I photographed. This is a moral quandary for any reflective photojournalist. Invoking the pretense of serving a cause larger than our own, we intrude upon the lives of others at their most vulnerable. Yet change is incremental, often imperceptible, and not always for the best. That\u2019s no reason to stop doing what we do, but it can lead to disillusionment and despair, especially when the events we cover seem never-ending, a merry-go-round of misery.Of course, the emotional distress faced by journalists is nothing compared to what our subjects endure. We are not victims. We chose this line of work, for whatever reason \u00e2\u0080\u0094 adventure, prestige, ego, idealism or the conviction that recording history holds intrinsic value. But that relentless flow of violence and suffering takes a toll. Photography, once the creative force defining my career, my sense of purpose and identity, was no longer part of my life. And I didn\u2019t even miss it. With the explosion of mobile phone and social media use, photography seemed like something for everyone else to do.Lately though, I\u2019ve felt the tug of something missing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that sense of being caught up in a flurry of activity, and the hitch of excitement that comes from creating visual order from chaos. Photography had long been my excuse for interacting with others, an introvert\u2019s key to an external world. I wanted to venture forth again, but not into the mayhem I had previously sought. How do you recapture something that has evaporated, and been blown away?I returned in June to Senegal\u2019s capital, Dakar, the oceanside city where I lived from 2005 until 2014, and where I was first employed as a photojournalist. An invitation to attend Dakar Fashion Week, an annual event organized by a Senegalese friend (full disclosure: event sponsors covered a portion of my travel costs), offered a chance to see old friends in a place that had been my home for nearly a decade. I also hoped the visit would resolve the nagging question of whether I could rekindle my photographic curiosity.On my second day, I wandered backstage at a beachfront venue long before the show began. Music was pumping, the sun was setting, and the sky held a purple glow as bright stage lights cast sharp shadows onto rough concrete walls while makeup artists and hairdressers fussed over a dozen or so models, many of whom were friends (Slides 6, 9 and 18). Designers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also friends \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fretted over their creations. The messy scene was captivating. I spent half an hour shooting with my iPhone before rushing back to my hotel room to collect my real camera. For the first time in ages, I felt that irrepressible urge to photograph. Amid the clamor of backstage nerves and excitement, I slipped into a familiar rhythm, moving through the action while seeking quiet moments, small details and explosions of color. A photograph holds still a sliver of time and gives it shape. Catching the right instant is inexplicably gratifying. We can measure time and light and sound and distance, but what about emotion or imagination? Can they be held within the confines of an image? Trying to capture such intangibles is part of what compels me to photograph. The thrill of shooting comes from stumbling across the unexpected.That thrill went beyond just the fashion shows and late-night after-parties in sweaty nightclubs. I wandered Dakar\u2019s sandy streets in search of images and snapped pictures along my old jogging route, while lounging at the beach, and photographed my former watchman with his family.Looking at the pictures now, many reflect a solemn mood at odds with the gaiety surrounding the week, but others depict the enjoyment and levity I experienced. Fashion may seem frivolous, but it\u2019s a portal into beauty, creativity and life \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the very things that first drew me to photography before ugliness, destruction and death warped my view. I was shooting for myself, but shared my pictures on Instagram using the platform\u2019s traditional square format. A photographer friend teased me for saying I was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfiling\u00e2\u0080\u009d pictures rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009cposting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u2019t take the news wire out of the photographer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she joked.Using my iPhone and social media to engage in a familiar place with people who matter to me allowed me to reconnect with something I thought I had lost forever \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the pure and simple joy of making pictures.By the end of my visit, I wanted to keep shooting. More than that, I was reminded that photography is a central part of me, something elemental in my spirit and fundamental to how I view the world.In Dakar, the creative vapor crystallized and took shape again, like a Polaroid developing from a milky cloud into something tangible, concrete. And just as in a Polaroid, all the elements were already there. They just needed to coalesce in the right place, at the right time."}
{"Headline": "Refugees Encounter a Foreign Word: Welcome", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "How Canadian hockey moms, poker buddies and neighbors are adopting Syrians, a family at a time.Supported byTORONTO \u2014 One frigid day in February, Kerry McLorg drove to an airport hotel here to pick up a family of Syrian refugees. She was cautious by nature, with a job poring over insurance data, but she had never even spoken to the people who were about to move into her basement.\u201cI don\u2019t know if they even know we exist,\u201d she said.At the hotel, Abdullah Mohammad\u2019s room phone rang, and an interpreter told him to go downstairs. His children\u2019s only belongings were in pink plastic bags, and the family\u2019s documents lay in a white paper bag printed with a Canadian flag. His sponsors had come, he was told. He had no idea what that meant.When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support, from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. She and her partners had already raised more than 40,000 Canadian dollars (about $30,700), selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a nearby mosque.Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on.For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family\u2019s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. \u201cYou mean we\u2019re leaving the hotel?\u201d Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, \u201cWhat do these people want in return?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,\u201d John McCallum, the country\u2019s immigration minister, said in an interview.In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called \u201cNew Canadians.\u201d The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg\u2019s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper.The fear is that all of this effort could end badly, with the Canadians looking na\u00efve in more ways than one.And volunteers cannot fully anticipate what they may confront \u2014 clashing expectations of whether Syrian women should work, tensions over how money is spent, families that are still dependent when the year is up, disagreements within sponsor groups.Still, by mid-April, only eight weeks after their first encounter with Ms. McLorg, the Mohammads had a downtown apartment with a pristine kitchen, bikes for the children to zip around the courtyard, and a Canadian flag taped to their window. The sponsors knew the children\u2019s shoe sizes; Abdullah and Eman still had keys to Ms. McLorg\u2019s house. He studied the neighborhood\u2019s supermarkets, and his wife took a counseling course so she could help others who had experienced dislocation and loss. When the male sponsors visited, she sat at the dining room table with them instead of eating in the kitchen \u2014 as she would have done back home \u2014 as long as her husband was around, too.Mr. Mohammad searched for the right words to describe what the sponsors had done for him. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve been on fire, and now I\u2019m safe in the water,\u201d he said.But he and other new arrivals were beginning to confront fresh questions: How were they supposed to work with these enthusiastic strangers? What would it mean to reinvent their lives under their watch?As sponsors sign the paperwork that commits them, no one really explains the potential range of their unofficial duties: showing a newcomer to spit in a dentist\u2019s sink by miming the motions, rushing over late at night to calm a war-rattled family terrified by a garage door blown open by the wind, or using Google Translate to tell children who lived through war and exile that they are supposed to wear pink at school for anti-bullying day.One April morning, Liz Stark, the grandmother in chief of another sponsor group, could not find Mouhamad Ahmed, the father in the family. She tried his phone and waited in vain outside their new apartment. This was a problem: Wissam, his wife, was in labor with their fifth child.The pregnancy had been anxious because the couple had lost even more than their old life in Syria, where Mr. Ahmed used to farm wheat, cotton and cumin. They had spent years in a refugee camp in Lebanon, their three children never attending school because tuition was too expensive. Ms. Ahmed became pregnant there with their fourth child, but labor was troubled and the girl lived only six hours. They named her Amira, which means princess.\u201cI was thinking maybe the same thing will happen to me here as well,\u201d Ms. Ahmed said.As Ms. Stark hunted for Mr. Ahmed, Peggy Karas, another sponsor, stayed at the hospital massaging Ms. Ahmed\u2019s hand during contractions. Like other such pairs, the two women had come together through opaque, bureaucratic machinery. A United Nations agency referred Ms. Ahmed and her family to Canadian officials who interviewed and screened them, then passed their file to a new nonprofit dedicated to matching Syrians with private sponsors, who had 24 hours to say yes or no based on the barest of details.Ms. Stark and many of her co-sponsors were retired teachers, bossy and doting, and they had become hellbent on bringing this new child into the world safely. They had introduced Ms. Ahmed to the vitamins she would take, the machines that would monitor her, the hospital ward where she would deliver. The older women had repeated the doctors\u2019 reassurances that all would go smoothly this time. They had helped her pick out tiny outfits and baby gear, but she was too superstitious to take them home, so they formed a small mountain in a sponsor\u2019s living room.Ms. Stark had recruited another newly arrived Syrian refugee to serve as an interpreter during labor. When she finally found Mr. Ahmed, who had been playing soccer, unaware of what was happening, she ushered him to the hospital room, where he took over holding his wife\u2019s hand.Suddenly a medical team rushed her away, saying the umbilical cord was in a dangerous position and she needed an emergency cesarean section. Ms. Ahmed, terrified, asked her husband to take care of their children if she did not survive. As Mr. Ahmed collapsed, sobbing, the sponsors asked his permission to pray.When a nurse finally appeared to say the newborn was healthy, whisked off to intensive care for observation, Ms. Ahmed said she would not believe it until she held the baby, but Mr. Ahmed was jubilant. He called his father in Syria and let him choose a name: Julia, the family\u2019s first Canadian citizen.Once the infant was home, she went from being the Ahmed family member the sponsors worried about most to the one they fretted about least. She would grow up hearing English, going to Canadian preschool and beyond. For her siblings \u2014 10-year-old twins, a boy and a girl, and an 8-year-old brother \u2014 the sponsors found a program for children who had never been to school. Their father, who had gone through only second grade, worked on learning enough English to find a job.Ms. Ahmed worried about her children. \u201cWhat if my kids don\u2019t adjust, don\u2019t settle in school very well?\u201d she asked.Everyone was on a deadline: After one year, the sponsors\u2019 obligation ends, and the families are expected to become self-sufficient. Toronto rents are high, and the Ahmeds may not be able to stay in the relatively inexpensive apartment the sponsors found for them \u2014 the monthly rent is 1,400 Canadian dollars, or about $1,100 \u2014 even if Mr. Ahmed finds a job.Like many sponsors, Ms. Stark believes that her country is especially suited to resettling refugees, with its vast size, strong social welfare system, and a government that emphasizes multiculturalism. Canada has not endured acts of terrorism like the Sept. 11 hijackings or the Paris attacks, or even an assault on the scale of the Orlando nightclub killings. And with only one land border, little illegal immigration and a tenth of the population of the United States, Canada is hungry for migrants. Officials around the country have clamored to bring Syrian refugees to their provinces.\u201cWe are an accident of geography and history,\u201d said Ratna Omidvar, who co-founded Lifeline Syria, a group that matches Syrians with sponsors.Opposition to the influx has been relatively muted. The Conservative Party argues that the country is taking in more refugees than it can provide for, but supports accepting Syrians. Some Canadians complain that the country should take care of its own first, and new chapters of the Soldiers of Odin, a European anti-immigrant group, have cropped up in recent months. A few incidents targeting Syrians \u2014 graffiti reading \u201cSyrians go home and die\u201d at a Calgary school, a pepper spray attack at an event welcoming refugees \u2014 drew widespread condemnation.One May evening, three weeks after Julia\u2019s birth, Ms. Stark stopped by the Ahmeds\u2019 apartment with a plastic table for the balcony and cradled the baby. She had a new grandchild, but she had spent more time with Julia. The cookie-baking retirees were planning a party to welcome her the Syrian way, by feasting on a newly slaughtered lamb on her 40th day. Meanwhile, Mr. Ahmed had adopted a new custom: He sometimes brought his wife breakfast in bed and got the children ready. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw men just doing everything that women do in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought, yeah, of course, I will do the same.\u201dThat night, Ms. Ahmed handed Ms. Stark a form from the twins\u2019 school, unsure what it was about. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to the Blue Jays game?\u201d she crowed to the boy, Majed, who grinned back under his dark curls. Then she turned to his parents. \u201cThis costs money, but your sponsors will pay for it because this is important.\u201dThe Ahmeds were so frugal that their benefactors sometimes worried whether they were buying enough to eat. Ms. Ahmed said they wanted to purchase no more than the family needed. \u201cThe sponsors worked for the money they are giving us, and we\u2019re not just going to throw it in the garbage,\u201d she explained later.Before leaving, Ms. Stark explained the proper Tylenol dosage for the couple\u2019s daughter, Zahiya, who had a fever. She and her twin now spent their school bus rides exchanging language lessons with a pair of Chinese brothers, pointing to objects and naming them. One day when their parents tried to bring them home after a dentist appointment, the Syrian children refused, insisting on returning to school for the time remaining.English words were starting to emerge from the older children\u2019s mouths, but the sponsors and the adult refugees could barely understand one another without help, often relying on mimed gestures or balky translation apps. Even when the groups use interpreters, they often get stuck in roundelays of Canadian and Syrian courtesy, so reluctant to impose that they do not say what they mean. Ms. Ahmed, who had a first-grade education and was not attending English classes because she was home with a newborn, said that not being able to communicate was painful.\u201cSometimes I feel like I am losing my mind,\u201d she said, because she felt so close to the sponsors but could not even tell them little things about the baby.Still, some groups faced greater challenges. Some Syrians have backed out before traveling to Canada, intimidated by the geographic and cultural leap. Sam Nammoura, a refugee advocate in Calgary, said he was tracking dozens of cases in which Syrian-Canadians sponsored friends and relatives and then left them destitute. Other pairings have turned out to be mismatches of expectations; one formerly well-off Syrian family expressed disappointment that its apartment was a second-floor walk-up and lacked a washing machine. Others were shocked to discover that their sponsors were posting Facebook messages and blog entries about them that strangers could read.Even when sponsors and refugees become enmeshed in one another\u2019s lives, they do not fully know one another. Not every family is open about its history, and many sponsors would like to know the worst but do not want to ask. (The Ahmeds and the Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, and were reluctant to publicly share details of their experiences in Syria because they feared reprisals against relatives still there. Most of the refugees in this article left Syria around 2013, during fighting between the Assad regime and rebels.)The sponsors do not share everything about themselves, either. Emma Waverman, the leader of another cluster, was telling her co-sponsors about the stirring bar mitzvah speech her son had written about the Syrians they were aiding when another woman stopped her.\u201cDo they know we\u2019re Jewish?\u201d she asked.Few issues are as delicate as how hard the sponsors should push and when the refugees can say no. Should the Syrians live close to downtown sponsors or in outer-ring neighborhoods with more Middle Easterners \u2014 and is it right for sponsors to decide without consulting them? The Canadians raise tens of thousands of dollars for each newcomer family; who controls how it is spent?Some worry that sponsors are overpowering the refugees with the force of their enthusiasm. Kamal Al-Solaylee, a journalism professor at Ryerson University who is originally from Yemen, said he had noticed a patronizing tone, as when some sponsors highlighted their volunteering on social media. \u201cThe white savior narrative comes into play,\u201d he said.When Muaz and Sawsan Ballani and their 2-year-old son arrived here in February, they seemed so disoriented and alone that their sponsors became especially eager to nurture them. Mr. Ballani, 26, had once worked in his father\u2019s clothing store, which was run out of their home. Now he introduced himself to his sponsors by showing them a picture of his oldest brother: not a smiling snapshot, but an image of the young man lying dead back home, blood streaming from his body. (Mr. Ballani believed that his brother had been caught in fighting between the regime and the opposition, but in the chaos of the conflict, he said, he could not learn more.)Sawsan wed Muaz when she was 16 in an arranged marriage, rushed because of bombings and failing electricity; a month later, they fled. Now 20, she had not seen her family since.The couple had been languishing in Jordan, sleeping in a house crammed with too many people, not enough beds or blankets, and ants that crawled over their son, named Abdulrahman, after Mr. Ballani\u2019s dead brother, and nicknamed Aboudi. One of Mr. Ballani\u2019s brothers was still stuck in the house in Jordan, he said, and his brother\u2019s widow was living in a park in Syria with her three children, foraging for food.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come here, we would have died,\u201d he said.The family\u2019s sponsors started as mostly strangers to one another \u2014 a few former colleagues, a friend of a friend. Helga Breier, a market research consultant and one of the organizers, was drawn into sponsorship last summer, when she felt haunted during her Mediterranean vacation by the suffering across the water.The Ballanis became their galvanizing cause. Together they found a bright apartment near their homes and countered the bareness \u2014 the family had few belongings \u2014 with cheery posters and tags labeling everything in English: lamp, cupboard, wall, door. The couple spoke almost no English, so to teach Mr. Ballani to get where he needed to go, the sponsors helped him photograph the route. When Aboudi threw tantrums in day care, they sat with him so his mother could stay in language class. The couple cooked elaborate Middle Eastern thank-you meals for the sponsors and mostly welcomed their interventions. Mr. Ballani donned a Toronto Maple Leafs hat that he wore day after day, and his wife gamely hopped on a toboggan.Sometimes the sponsors barely hid their views of how the Ballanis should adjust. At a spring potluck dinner, Ms. Ballani described how she had recently traveled by subway on her own, a trip she could not have imagined taking just a few weeks before. The sponsors around the table, firm feminists, asked what else she might like to do herself.She turned to her husband. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you an honest question,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you let me work here?\u201d As they waited for the answer, the Canadian women held their breath.\u201cYes, but I wouldn\u2019t have let you work back\u201d in Jordan, he said, adding that even women who behaved traditionally there were often harassed and that those who appeared too independent faced worse. Ms. Ballani pressed forward: She wanted to attend university and have a career of her own, she said, a daunting set of goals for a woman with only a seventh-grade education. The Canadians beamed; two high-fived each other.At the same time, the sponsors worried that they were becoming helicopter parents, as Ms. Breier put it. When the Syrians skipped English lessons (Aboudi sometimes kept them awake at night) or missed an appointment for donated dental services (a misunderstanding), the sponsors agonized over what to say, debating on the messaging app Slack. Should they show up every morning at the Ballanis\u2019 apartment to make sure they got to class? Aboudi did not nap regularly and seemed to consume a lot of sugar \u2014 he drank soda, sometimes for breakfast \u2014 so should they offer advice?Mr. Nammoura, the refugee advocate in Calgary, said he saw a pattern among the cases. The Canadians, who feel responsible for the refugees\u2019 success, want to give them as much help and direction as possible. But many Syrians, finally safe after years of war and flight, want to exhale before launching into language regimens and job searches, and sometimes feel that sponsors are meddling.When the Ballani sponsors sought advice from an Arab community center caseworker and an older Syrian mother, they were told to be harsher \u2014 to threaten fines or loss of sponsorship if the couple did not accept their guidance. Instead, the sponsors tried to strike a balance, being insistent on issues like health and education but easing off in other areas.A few weeks before Ramadan, the Ballanis raised the prospect of missing school during the month of long fasts. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard because we have to fast 16 or 18 hours,\u201d Muaz Ballani told the sponsors.Ms. Breier and her partners dismissed the idea, saying they feared that the couple would lose their slots if they missed too many classes. The Ballanis quickly relented. It was not clear how much freedom they felt to express disagreement to outsiders; they seemed reluctant to acknowledge anything but gratitude.That morning, Ms. Ballani said she and her husband never had different opinions from the sponsors. \u201cWe\u2019ve never felt like they were telling us what to do,\u201d she added.Another weekend, the extended group gathered for a picnic, the first birthday party anyone had thrown for Mr. Ballani. He was deeply moved by the gesture. \u201cA human life has value here,\u201d he had said in an interview. \u201cYou can feel it everywhere.\u201dBut the conversation at the party turned to his relatives in Syria, and he seemed distant as the Canadians presented his cake. Like many of the newcomers, he regularly receives calls and texts from family members, some in harrowing straits, as news reports describe starvation back home and mass drownings in the Mediterranean.\u201cI am really thankful to them; I don\u2019t want them to misunderstand,\u201d he said later about the sponsors. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m two people at the same time, one happy and one unhappy,\u201d because of his family\u2019s continued suffering.The sponsors had been working on that, too, helping match Mr. Ballani\u2019s brother in Jordan with another Toronto sponsor group and laboring over the paperwork. By late spring they had news: His relatives could arrive by year\u2019s end.Mr. Ballani, overjoyed, started planning what he would show his relatives in the city that had taken him in. This time, he would be the guide.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to help,\u201d he said.Three months after the Mohammads\u2019 awkward first meeting with Kerry McLorg and the other sponsors at the airport hotel, they had clicked into a productive rhythm, settling into Canada faster than anyone had expected.They went on a picnic to Niagara Falls and danced around a maypole at a spring festival. The girls won student-of-the-month honors. Bayan, the eldest, who had whipped past the boys she raced on Jordanian streets, was now beating runners from schools across the city. When the sponsors came to give informal language lessons, Ahmad, the 4-year-old, liked to try new phrases in English, such as \u201cGood job!\u201dStill, there was some culture shock. When Abdullah Mohammad took the children to a community pool, he encountered a woman in a string bikini. \u201cI ran away,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before in my life.\u201dMs. McLorg, measured and methodical, had organized the sponsor group, but the most energetic member was an artist named Susan Stewart, with a seemingly endless list of activities for the family and long email exchanges with the children\u2019s teachers. During her turn to give English lessons, she brought flashcards down to the courtyard, telling the children to alternate between loops on their bicycles and new words. She was sweetly relentless, which was partly why the family had made so much progress, the other sponsors said.When Mr. Mohammad voiced interest in working, Ms. Stewart became consumed with helping him find a job. Of all the tests for the family \u2014 and, by extension, the sponsors \u2014 this was perhaps the most crucial. So Ms. Stewart found an Arabic-speaking settlement counselor to advise Mr. Mohammad and drove him to a job fair for refugees, where they struck up a conversation with a Syrian supermarket owner. After he invited Mr. Mohammad for an interview, Ms. Stewart fashioned a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from a questionnaire she had helped him fill out.\u201cI am keen to learn all aspects of the trade from stocking and organizing shelves to marketing strategies and Canadian shopping habits,\u201d she wrote. Describing his work experience \u2014 doing odd jobs during his three years in Jordan \u2014 she wrote, \u201cAs a refugee I had to be resourceful and find work wherever I could.\u201d Even though the interview would be in Arabic, she drilled him in English phrases like \u201cI can stock shelves.\u201d\u201cTen more times!\u201d she told him as they drove to the interview.When he was offered the part-time position, the sponsors were thrilled. But a few days later, he called the Canadians to say he would turn it down. He struggled with taking money from the sponsors \u2014 back home, others had come to his family for help, and it was \u201creally hard to be on the receiving end,\u201d he said. But he wanted to consider options, such as becoming a mechanic. In Syria or Jordan, he had never had freedom to choose his work. \u201cIt\u2019s always what you have to do to earn a living rather than what you really want to do,\u201d he said later.And he did not want to take a job until he improved his English, he said, because he did not want any more favors or charity. At the supermarket, unable to answer basic questions from customers, \u201cI would be a burden to my employer,\u201d he added. He had been annoyed at Ms. Stewart for pressing so hard, he said later, but mostly he was embarrassed to pass on the job after she had done so much.But Ms. McLorg saw a plus side: Mr. Mohammad was starting to navigate his own path in Canada, and the relationship between the sponsors and the family, so lopsided at the start, was beginning to balance out. \u201cOur job was to help them come into Canada and show them the options that are here,\u201d she said.In mid-May, at the end of a routine meeting with the sponsors and the Mohammads, she shared news of her own: She had breast cancer. Now that she was facing surgery, she was the one who was vulnerable, and the Syrians were the ones who were checking on her.They brought flowers and chocolates; the other sponsors, now practiced in the logistics of caring, offered meal deliveries and other assistance. \u201cI had no intention of building my own support group, but I have one now,\u201d Ms. McLorg said.Bayan and Batoul, the two oldest Mohammad children, made get-well cards using the same set of watercolors the sponsors had used to make greeting signs that first day at the airport hotel. The morning after Ms. McLorg\u2019s operation, when she made her way down to her living room, the cards were the first things she saw.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the surname of two of Muaz Ballani\u2019s sponsors. They are David Dennis and David Dennis Jr., not David Scrivener and David Scrivener Jr.Advertisement"}

She got the idea after seeing a pixilated heart pattern on a similar grid. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can do that. But in my own way,\u2019\u201d she says. Clough headed to the Milnerton Flea Market, which proved to be a gold mine of inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s this big stretch of dusty road, and people normally sell bric-a-brac and weird, gross things,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been super-influenced by it; the selection is almost tasteless, or a little off-style and antiquated. I love it.\u201d There, she found a few vintage rackets, which she brought back to her studio. \u201cI started to experiment with different scales and how to change the canvas,\u201d she says.Growing up in the suburbs of Cape Town, Clough left high school for a specialized visual art program before enrolling at the Red and Yellow School of Logic and Magic, \u201cwhich sounds like it\u2019s from Harry Potter,\u201d she says, but gave her a background in art direction and advertising. After graduating in 2010, she worked a number of design jobs before deciding to focus more intently on her woven artwork, which she\u2019s done for the last five years. Apart from rackets, Clough has embroidered sneakers for Vans (to mark the brand\u2019s 50th anniversary this spring) and emblazoned a rusted gate (on Cape Town\u2019s Canterbury Street) with her colorful stitched patterns for the United Nations.She does all this in a studio that\u2019s less than 200 square feet. \u201cThe most important part is my couch,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where I spent most of my time; I play with my threads there.\u201d The vibe in the room, which is part of a house located in the Brooklyn-like Gardens section of Cape Town, is cozy and low-key: \u201cThere are boxes full of pompoms, pens and sewing paraphernalia, and containers with tools and cameras,\u201d she says. \u201cI needed a space full of my own weird little trinkets, where I can spread my work out without invading anyone else\u2019s space.\u201dMuch of Clough\u2019s inspiration comes from street culture, and her love of music. As a side gig, she works as a visual jockey doing live music events and has performed with D.J. artists Haezer, PH Fat and Los Tacos among others. (Her stage name is Fiance Knowles, a nickname she picked up from a friend. \u201cI thought it was hilarious. I\u2019m skinny, pale and freckly \u2014 I\u2019m definitely not rivaling Beyonc\u00e9 in any shape or form.\u201d) She\u2019s also part of a hip-hop collective called Uppercut.Still, she has embraced the old-fashioned nature of her art form quite comfortably: \u201cYou just need a hobby that makes you feel like a 70-year-old woman, and then you\u2019ll be on your way.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a product Danielle Clough uses in her artwork.

{"Headline": "With Obama in Japan, and a Puppy in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byWhen I finally fell into bed at my hotel, I was certain I would sleep solidly until the alarm went off for the train to Hiroshima the next day.Two hours later, I was awake.Jet lag.I looked at the clock. Japan, where I had come to help cover President Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima, is 13 hours ahead of New York, where my 11-year-old daughter would just be home from school. I zapped her a text: Could we connect on FaceTime?Suddenly, there she appeared on my phone, lounging on the beanbag chair in the Brooklyn bedroom she shares with my son. After a few minutes chatting about school, she asked if we could switch to Snapchat. She wanted to send me a funky picture with the ears and snout of a puppy superimposed on her face.Now it was my turn. I am new to this, so she texted me instructions. I managed to get the Snapchat camera working and pulled up the filters for altering my face. I tapped on one with geisha-like features.The result was grotesque, but my daughter was thrilled. A text came zipping back. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that one here! Send me more!\u201dAs a journalist who has always traveled frequently for my job, one of the hardest parts of being on the road has been missing my children. When they were born, video-chatting was not something you could do easily by phone. Babies, meanwhile, can hardly talk on the phone, and as preschoolers my children were not much interested in it. So for many years I had to make do with brief, stilted conversations and photos that my husband would send by email. I remember, one night at a hotel, opening a picture of my then toddler daughter grinning from the top of a slide at the playground and becoming so unhinged that I began sobbing hysterically.Now technology has opened up much more satisfying ways of staying in touch and being part of their daily lives while I am away. Although I was ambivalent when my daughter first asked to be allowed to start an account on Instagram and use Snapchat, I now see the gifts of social media from afar.Instead of having to call and ask her the always-vexing parental question, \u201cWhat did you do today?\u201d I can just log on to her Instagram account or click on one of her Snapchat montages and see for myself. While I have been in Japan, she and her friends seem to have developed a passion for buying Blue Raspberry Coolattas from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on the way home from school. I know which two friends slept over Saturday night at our apartment.And while my 9-year-old son would often be distracted by a mere audio call and quickly pass the phone to my husband, with FaceTime he can make faces, or pull the camera so close that I have an intimate view of his nostrils. By phone, he tends to simply recite a litany of activities, but when he can see my face he is more likely to tell me what is really on his mind. When we connected the other night (my time), he reported that he had been researching which rides would be scariest at the amusement park he hopes to visit when my husband takes the kids to see my in-laws during my return trip to Japan next month.Social media is also becoming increasingly crucial to my job. During the week I was in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, I appeared three times on Facebook Live. Having spent my entire career as a print-only journalist, always accustomed to having my work go through an editor before publication, I am now learning to improvise before a camera. It was wonderful to be able to bring readers \u2014 if that\u2019s the right term \u2014 to wherever I was, interviewing an atomic bomb survivor or touring the peace park in Hiroshima.But I found that it was also a good tool for posting a video message to my family while they slept, so they could see it in the morning when they awoke.All this connectivity makes me feel so much less anxious about moving my family from Brooklyn, the only home my children have ever known, to Tokyo this summer.When I was 7 years old, my family moved to Japan for two and a half years. When we returned to California, I was heartbroken to leave my best friend behind. Staying in touch was much more difficult: The cost of an international phone call was so prohibitive that my parents allowed me to call her only on her birthday and at Christmas.As we prepare to move, my daughter and her best friend have made a vow to meet on FaceTime at least once a week. She and another friend have created a special shared Instagram account where they can post pictures every day. My son will still be able to play Minecraft with his friends thousands of miles away.And while I\u2019m on the road, it is so much easier for me to be a noodge. When our babysitter sent a text to me in Hiroshima with a photo of my son at soccer practice, I was able to text back immediately: \u201cIs he wearing sunscreen?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Timothy Trespas, an out-of-work recording engineer in his early 40s, was sure he was being stalked, and not by just one person, but dozens of them.\u201cNow you see how it works,\u201d they would say.At first, Mr. Trespas wondered if it was all in his head. Then he encountered a large community of like-minded people on the internet who call themselves \u201ctargeted individuals,\u201d or T.I.s, who described going through precisely the same thing.Mental health professionals say the narrative has taken hold among a group of people experiencing psychotic symptoms that have troubled the human mind since time immemorial. Except now victims are connecting on the internet, organizing and defying medical explanations for what\u2019s happening to them.The community, conservatively estimated to exceed 10,000 members, has proliferated since 9/11, cradled by the internet and fed by genuine concerns over government surveillance. A large number appear to have delusional disorder or schizophrenia, psychiatrists say.Yet, the phenomenon remains virtually unresearched.For the few specialists who have looked closely, these individuals represent an alarming development in the history of mental illness: thousands of sick people, banded together and demanding recognition on the basis of shared paranoias.An internet search for \u201cgang-stalking,\u201d however, turns up page after page of results that regard it as fact. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary for me is that there are no counter sites that try and convince targeted individuals that they are delusional,\u201d Dr. Sheridan said.\u201cThey end up in a closed ideology echo chamber,\u201d she said.In instructional tracts online, veterans of the movement explain the ropes to rookies:\u2022 Do not engage with the voices in your head.\u2022 If your relatives tell you you\u2019re imagining things, they could be in on it.\u201cThey wanted to basically destroy me, and they did,\u201d a young mother in Phoenix says in one video, choking back tears. She lost custody of her daughter and was sent to a behavioral health hospital, says the woman, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy. \u201cBut I am going to fight back for the rest of my life.\u201dShe adds, \u201cAnd guess what, I\u2019m not crazy.\u201dDr. Sheridan\u2019s study, written with Dr. David James, a forensic psychiatrist, examined 128 cases of reported gang-stalking. It found all the subjects were most likely delusional.\u201cOne has to think of the T.I. phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the gang-stalking idea as an explanation of what is happening to them,\u201d Dr. James said.A leading proponent of that view is an anesthesiologist from San Antonio named John Hall.The book made a splash because of the messenger: a licensed member of the medical establishment who was telling those who feel targeted that psychiatrists were misleading them. A janitor knows as much about the human mind, he wrote.Dr. Hall, 51, was invited for an interview on \u201cCoast to Coast AM,\u201d a conspiracy-minded radio show based in California that is said to reach millions of listeners. After that, he said, \u201cI had probably three or 4,000 emails from people saying: \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in this state.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in Florida.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s happening to me in California.\u2019 \u201dThe similarities of the cases spoke to a wide-ranging campaign, he said. \u201cIf the psychiatrists want to say that this is schizophrenia or delusional disorder, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut every one of these victims have the same story.\u201dWhile Dr. Hall has faced scrutiny from the Texas Medical Board over his mental fitness, he retains his license. Over time, however, many others who identify as gang-stalking victims end up out of work. They are mocked by colleagues, tolerated by family. Friends and spouses fall away.The despair that results has led some to lash out in violence.\u201cAs you can see right now,\u201d he says into the camera, \u201cI am totally not crazy.\u201dLaying out his case, he describes an episode at a gas station where he believed somebody in dark glasses was mimicking his movements. \u201cIt was really creepy,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I did, he did.\u201dLater in the video, he prays for forgiveness for his future sins. \u201cFather,\u201d he says, \u201cright now I ask that you look down on all the targeted individuals across the globe. Help them to cope with this madness.\u201dThe vast majority of people with psychosis never resort to violence. Still, studies suggest that a small number of those experiencing psychotic episodes \u2014 especially paranoid thoughts, accompanied by voices making commands \u2014 are more likely to act on hostile urges than people without a mental illness.Many in the T.I. community, as anyone would, have repudiated the shootings by Mr. Alexis and Mr. May. But some also harbor troubling views about their perceived oppressors. They question how people could be so cruel.It baffles her, she said. But worse, \u201cIt makes me angry to see how many people in this country are sociopaths. They are absolute groupthink drones,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even consider them human anymore.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a need for meaning and a need to understand your life and the problems you\u2019re having,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not some meaningless nobody. You\u2019re being followed by the C.I.A.\u201dIn that way, Dr. Clancy said, the behavior shares a trait with religious belief: To abandon it would be life upending.Paula Trespas, Mr. Trespas\u2019s mother, said she avoided debating with him.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that he was making up,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really felt the way he felt and experienced what he experienced. I got to the point where I was just finally saying to him: \u2018I\u2019m very, very sad that you have to go through this. I wish that there was something that I could do.\u2019 \u201dThe big hope is that society will wake up to what\u2019s happening and put a stop to it, those who feel targeted say. In some cases, they do seek psychiatric help. In others, the delusions subside. For the rest, the prognosis isn\u2019t good, psychiatrists say. Many contemplate suicide.Mr. Trespas, now 49, says he went so far as to prepare a rope.He is gaunt, with weary, sad eyes. It\u2019s been eight years since it all began, he says. He can\u2019t hold a job. His friends have drifted away.The online community has been a crucial support, he says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re believing the wrong thing. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I try to keep my mind open about who and what and why and how.\u201dOne thing he is certain of though, he says: He\u2019s not crazy.An earlier version of this article misstated the professional title of Susan Clancy, who has researched people who believe they\u2019ve been abducted by aliens.

This is largely because the Filipinos are well known, and very proud of their Filipino hospitality.\u201dMerryn Johns, editor in chief, CurveAnd of course any tourist is sure to be taken with the Nashville music scene. \u201cIn addition to the gay night life there\u2019s something about crooning cowboys in Nashville that makes us swoon,\u201d he wrote.Ben Lambert spent six months traveling around Southeast Asia last year, he wrote in a recent email, and while he was not shocked to find Thailand, especially Bangkok, to be lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-friendly he said he was indeed surprised by the positive reception in some of the other countries he visited.\u201cWhile there are a great many people in these countries who cannot accept homosexuality, there are large communities of people who do \u2014 especially among the younger generations,\u201d Mr. Lambert wrote. \u201cThis leads to the creation of flourishing, yet discreet, L.G.B.T. communities throughout the region.\u201dThere are many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-owned or L.G.B.T.-friendly businesses \u2014 bars, clubs, saunas and hotels in cities including Saigon, Vietnam; Yangon in Myanmar and Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, Mr. Lambert wrote. And \u201cwhile these places may not be brazenly waving the Pride flag, they are not hidden. They do not exist behind unmarked doors with secret passwords and handshakes required for entry. They exist in regular neighborhoods and are open to the entire public. The locals, including police, know exactly what they are and tend to leave well enough alone.\u201dAnother Manchester advantage: \u201cThis is a rare case of a city that has actually more than one lesbian bar and they were both happening,\u201d Ms. Chauvin said, recalling her visit. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty indicative of a thriving gay community.\u201dDavey Wavey, storyteller, self-described gay guru and Facebook/YouTube personalityPuna, he said, is \u201ca very queer community.

It\u2019s really a more diverse spectrum of L.G.B.T.Q. than you see in most of those other places like Provincetown or Palm Springs.\u201dOutside of the confines of Kalani, all of Puna is welcoming and the natural environment affords plenty of reasons to visit, too, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this incredible, almost magical place where the rain forest meets the ocean.

You first.It\u2019s more like the saying, \u201cWhat you said was a little ridiculous and sad, and I\u2019m going to do the hilarious thing of pretending it was so bad that you should no longer even use Twitter, and my hyperbole will itself be a mike drop.\u201d Does that make sense?

{"Headline": "Bangladesh Says It Now Knows Who\u2019s Killing the Bloggers", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 The young man, inching past a crowded checkpoint near a truck stand in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, caught the attention of an alert police officer.His backpack, together with his appearance, from the unshaven beard to the long Punjabi tunic over baggy pants, set off the suspicion that he was an Islamist militant. The man was arrested after he was found to be carrying a machete, an unregistered pistol and six bullets.Little was known about the attackers, except that they were Islamist radicals, and that their assaults have been coming with ever-greater frequency this year.The detained man refused to discuss much, saying only that he was Saiful Islam, 23 years old and a teacher at a local madrasa, or Islamic school.But the picture filled in six days later, when two 19-year-old men, arrested after running from the site of another fatal attack, identified the madrasa teacher as a fellow conspirator. That touched off a cascade of revelations that, for the first time, has allowed the Bangladeshi authorities to penetrate the murky world of the attackers and answer questions about the planning, execution and purpose of the attacks that have baffled the country \u2014 and, indeed, the world \u2014 since the violence began.In a lengthy interview, the chief of the police counterterrorism unit, Monirul Islam, who assumed his post in February, laid out the findings of his investigation in minute detail.The killings were organized by two militant Islamic groups that have gathered volunteers and recruits, trained them and eventually seeded them into cells run by a commander, Mr. Islam said. They have tried to pick their targets with care, with the aim of gaining support from the public, he said, and trained teams of killers. Their goal was to convert Bangladesh\u2019s mixed secular and religious culture to an Islamist one, the chief investigator said.The Bangladeshi authorities say that they now believe they have identified the top leadership of the two groups they say are responsible, and that they are preparing to round them up. Only when the leaders are caught, they caution, will the attacks be stopped, and at that, only for a while if the appeal of Islamic fundamentalism is not blunted.Bangladesh, a nation with a Muslim majority adjoining eastern India, gained independence from Pakistan in a vicious war in 1971 and established a secular, democratic government. A military coup in 1975 led to more than three decades of mostly military-backed governments sympathetic to Islamic fundamentalists, until a secular government returned to power in 2009 with an overwhelming majority. But secularism is far from universally accepted in Bangladesh, and has always had to contend with a conservative Islamic culture.To a surprising extent, the militants have succeeded in their aim of discrediting secularism, the chief investigator said.\u201cIn general, people think they have done the right thing, that it\u2019s not unjustifiable to kill\u201d the bloggers, gay people and other secularists, he added.They have also put the secular government on the defensive. As a result, even as the government has condemned the killings, it has urged writers not to criticize Islam and warned that advocating \u201cunnatural sex\u201d is a criminal offense.Some experts say that only a more widespread crackdown will stop the killings, but that the government has held back, fearful of creating a backlash.\u201cThe politics has been turned into the secular versus the Islamists,\u201d said Abdur Rashid, a retired army major general and executive director of the Institute of Conflict, Law and Development Studies in Dhaka. \u201cTherefore the government is cautious.\u201dTwo groups in particular took up the fight against secularism, Mr. Islam said. One, Ansar al-Islam, is led by a fiery cleric and a charismatic, well-trained operational commander, both of whom Mr. Islam declined to identify because they are being watched. Its leaders command about 25 trained killers, some of whom have been involved in three or four attacks, Mr. Islam said.The second, the Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, is the reorganized offshoot of a group banned in 2005 for setting off nearly 500 bombs simultaneously around the country.While both are radical Islamist groups, Mr. Islam said, neither seems to have direct links to larger terrorist networks like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, though those groups have occasionally claimed credit for the attacks.The students used to attend his Friday speeches at a local mosque where Mr. Rahmani, who has since been arrested, declared a fatwa on bloggers critical of Islam, calling for them to be killed, Mr. Islam said.As it happened, one of the students, a 32-year-old senior named Redwanul Azad Rana, was also a leader in Ansar al-Islam, Mr. Islam said. He invited the younger students to Mr. Rahmani\u2019s sermons and introduced them to the writings of Thaba Baba.\u201cBeing a believer, it is your duty to kill\u201d Thaba Baba, Mr. Rana told the students, one of them said in his confession in court. Prodded by Mr. Rana, \u201cwe made a plan to kill Islam\u2019s and Prophet Muhammad\u2019s insulter Thaba Baba by identifying him,\u201d the student, Faisal Bin Nayeem, 24, said in the statement.He said they found Thaba Baba\u2019s picture on Facebook, then searched for someone matching it at the Shahbag protest, still underway at the time. Eventually, they identified a 32-year-old architect, Ahmed Rajib Haider, as Thaba Baba. After studying Mr. Haider\u2019s routines, three of them surprised him outside his house around 9 p.m. Mr. Nayeem said he drove his machete into the back of Mr. Haider\u2019s neck and hit him twice more as he fell forward.Ansar al-Islam, with the help of mainstream Islamist groups, then began to publicize Mr. Haider\u2019s writings, casting the killers as defenders of Islam against \u201catheist bloggers.\u201dThe writings, published in at least two national dailies, enraged large segments of the population, who had previously been sympathetic to the Shahbag movement, Mr. Islam said.During the next two months, two more bloggers were killed. The police began arresting the North South University students who were involved in killing Mr. Haider, and also caught Mr. Rahmani, the cleric who inspired them. But Mr. Rana, the student leader, remains at large and is thought to have left the country.Mr. Islam said he believes these arrests stopped Ansar al-Islam \u2014 also known as the Ansarullah Bangla Team \u2014 from killing more people in 2013 and 2014. But the group reorganized the terrorist cells, he said, and the killing resumed.From the growing number of attackers in detention, the police learned that the newly reconstituted Ansar al-Islam had changed its tactics, now recruiting madrasa students and teachers instead of university students to carry out killings. Mr. Islam said a violent protest by the madrasa students in May 2013 convinced Ansar al-Islam leaders that they were a more promising source of fanatical recruits than their university counterparts.The training and indoctrination of the recruits became more rigorous and systematic at that time, Mr. Islam said. The cell that assassinated another blogger, Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, 27, just a month after Mr. Roy\u2019s killing rented an apartment where two senior operatives worked with the group of would-be killers. One, an operations expert, taught them how to kill with a machete and use a pistol to scatter anyone interrupting the attack.Armed with Mr. Babu\u2019s picture and his address, the assassins were sent to his home to assess the situation and returned to a barrage of questions from the trainer. \u201cWhat happens if you are stopped? What will you do?\u201d he asked them, Mr. Islam said.Close to the planned date of the attack, the other operative, an ideologist, introduced the killers to Mr. Babu\u2019s writings. The students were given samples calculated to stir them up. \u201cWhat is the punishment for someone who writes these insults?\u201d the trainer asked them. The group answered in unison, day after day, \u201cOnly death,\u201d the arrested students told investigators.Mr. Islam said the hardest part for the police was identifying the leaders, who were so concerned about security that they would not give their real names to the madrasa students they were training.Still, the police have now identified a trainer involved in planning the attack on Mr. Babu. Last month they printed the suspect\u2019s picture, along with those of five others accused of participating in the killings, in local dailies, offering rewards of up to 500,000 takas, about $6,400, for information leading to their arrests.The other militant group, the reorganized Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh, works independently of Ansar al-Islam and almost exclusively in northern Bangladesh, the chief investigator said. But the group is less professional than Ansar al-Islam, he said, making mistakes that are costing it public support.The group has trained 50 to 100 madrasa students as killers, he said, organizing them into cells of four or five. But through shoddy research, many of the victims have turned out to be popular local figures. Among them: a homeopathic doctor who used to give free treatment to villagers, and an English professor at Rajshahi University who was not known to have written critically of Islam.When detained militants learned that a 66-year-old Japanese man they had slaughtered had converted to Islam in 2015, they told investigators they were upset over their mistake.With all the slip-ups, the communities turned against them. With the public\u2019s support, Mr. Islam said, the police quickly rounded up the suspected hit men and several of their handlers in most of the Jama\u2019atul Mujahedeen Bangladesh killings, and were in pursuit of the senior leadership.Many in Bangladesh continue to live in terror. Twenty-five associates of one victim, a gay rights activist, have taken refuge in safe houses provided by diplomatic missions. Several dozen bloggers have fled the country. Those who remain have grown fatalistic.\u201cOn this journey, we\u2019ll lose our lives,\u201d Arif Jebtik, 39, one of the leaders of the Shahbag movement, said in an interview in his Dhaka apartment, which he rarely leaves. He has quit his job, closed his blog and stopped dropping his children off at school.\u201cThis is the price we have to pay to history,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jo Cox and Britain\u2019s Place in Europe", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byIn politics, as in life, there is the question of the company you keep.Reasonable people, some friends of mine, make reasonable arguments for Britain to leave the European Union. They say it lacks transparency. They say a union containing an inner club of nations with a common currency, but outliers without it, constitutes a setup that defrauds voters because it is intellectually dishonest. The euro nations require a political union that is ever closer for the euro to be sustainable. Other nations, like Britain, do not want that.They argue that the E.U. is undemocratic, run by unaccountable bureaucrats, and that Britain can somehow reinvent itself, overcome geography and defy several authoritative predictions of economic disaster \u2014 most recently from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 by linking with fast-growing parts of the emergent world after it turns its back on a stagnant Europe.I am prepared to lend half an ear to such notions, even if they are paltry quibbles when set against the wonder of a borderless Europe at peace, access to a market of half a billion people, decades of growing prosperity since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, and the British capacity to count in the world as a leader within a united Europe rather than become an insular minnow adrift in the English Channel.The European Union has been through a tough decade. It has been beset by the structural flaws of the euro and a weak response to the financial meltdown of 2008. It has faced the ongoing difficulties of absorbing former Communist bloc nations and the challenge of mass immigration. It needs reinvigoration \u2014 of a kind Britain could lead.But none of this is what the British referendum has been about. It has been about jingoistic bigotry of the take-Britain-back variety; anti-European rants dished up by The Daily Mail (often on the basis of claims so flimsy they would make Donald Trump blush); the vileness of the U.K. Independence Party, whose latest poster screams \u201cBreaking Point\u201d next to a crowd of dark-skin refugees; the outrageous diatribes of the former London mayor Boris Johnson, who has compared the union\u2019s designs to Hitler\u2019s; the dim anger of a Little England troubled by globalization and choosing to focus that ire on Brussels (of all places) and on the desperate survivors of the Syrian civil war (of all people).In other words, it has been about poison. That poison led \u2014 not directly, but still \u2014 to the murder last week of Jo Cox, a representative of the opposition Labour Party, and a mother of two, by a man shouting \u201cBritain first!\u201dCox, a rising political star, had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union. She had declared in her maiden speech to Parliament that the Yorkshire towns and villages she represented had been \u201cdeeply enhanced by immigration, be it of Irish Catholics across the constituency or of Muslims from Gujarat in India or from Pakistan, principally from Kashmir.\u201dWhat struck her, she said, was that \u201cwe are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us.\u201d In her last article for The Yorkshire Post this month she had written, \u201cPlease don\u2019t fall for the spin prior to June 23 that the only way to deal with concerns about immigration is by voting to leave.\u201dThe suspect charged with her murder, Thomas Mair, gave his name as \u201cdeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d in his first court appearance. Prosecutors said he had also shouted \u201cKeep Britain independent\u201d as he attacked Cox. Pamphlets about extreme rightist and white supremacist organizations were found at his house.Yes, in politics there is also the question of the company you keep.Those who have called for Britain to quit the E.U. have been prepared to get into bed with the likes of xenophobic fanatics like Mair. They have countenanced the fabrication of gross slurs about Europe and foreigners to further a campaign to lead Britain out of its neighborhood (and the greatest political invention of the second half of the 20th century) into some fantasyland of bygone glory.This is not the Britain I know. This is not the Britain that accepted my South African Jewish immigrant parents and allowed them to prosper. This is not the Britain whose own union \u2014 of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 has been an exercise in successful mingling. This is not the Britain whose capital, London, is perhaps the world\u2019s greatest city because of the openness that has made it the home to every tongue.\u201cJo, get up,\u201d pleaded Cox\u2019s assistant, Fazila Aswat, as the politician lay dying. \u201cNo, my pain is too much,\u201d Cox replied, her last words.Come on, Britain!

{"Headline": "Facebook Offers Tools for Those Who Fear a Friend May Be Suicidal", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 When Carrie Simmons opened her Facebook app one day in late 2014, she saw a status update from a high school friend she had not seen in years that alarmed her. It read like a suicide note.\u201cThank you for everyone who tried to help me,\u201d Ms. Simmons\u2019s friend, whom she declined to name, wrote.Ms. Simmons immediately called a mutual friend, a police officer, who reached out to the local authorities in their friend\u2019s town in California. There, the police found the friend in a parked car with a pistol in his lap. He did not pull the trigger and is alive today.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t already been educated in suicide prevention or hadn\u2019t seen the post on Facebook, I don\u2019t know that I would have picked up the phone and known to call,\u201d said Ms. Simmons, who is a real estate broker in Seattle.With more than 1.65 billion members worldwide posting regularly about their behavior, Facebook is planning to take a more direct role in stopping suicide. On Tuesday, in the biggest step by a major technology company to incorporate suicide prevention tools into its platform, the social network introduced mechanisms and processes to make it easier for people to help friends who post messages about suicide or self-harm. With the new features, people can flag friends\u2019 posts that they deem suicidal; the posts will be reviewed by a team at the social network that will then provide language to communicate with the person who is at risk, as well as information on suicide prevention.Yet Facebook is walking a tightrope, trying to explore its role as an arbiter of social change without upsetting the hundreds of millions of people who regularly use its services. Some of the suicide prevention tools may trouble groups that have concerns about digital privacy. Many of those groups have already become wary of what they see as Facebook\u2019s overreach in people\u2019s personal lives.\u201cGiven that Facebook is the place you\u2019re connected to friends and family, it seemed like a natural fit,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Guadagno, a researcher at Facebook who is leading the suicide prevention project. Facebook has a team of more than a dozen engineers and researchers dedicated to the project.Facebook\u2019s new suicide prevention tools start with a drop-down menu that lets people report posts, a feature that was previously available only to some English-speaking users. People across the world can now flag a message as one that could raise concern about suicide or self-harm; those posts will then come to the attention of Facebook\u2019s global community operations team, a group of hundreds of people around the world who monitor flagged posts 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Posts flagged as potential self-harm notes are to be expedited and reviewed more quickly by the team members, who also examine posts that Facebook users have reported as objectionable. Community operations team members who evaluate potentially suicidal content are given special training, Facebook said.The person reporting a suicide note is given a menu of options, including the ability to send a Facebook message directly to the friend in distress or to a mutual friend to coordinate help. Facebook will provide a suggested text message to send, or users can fill in their own words.\u201cPeople really want to help, but often they just don\u2019t know what to say, what to do or how to help their friends,\u201d said Vanessa Callison-Burch, a Facebook product manager working on the project.

I know \u2014 it feels as if the internet, virtual reality, Donald Trump, Facebook, sequencing of the human genome and machines that can reason better than people constitute a change in the pace of change without precedent. But we\u2019ve actually been through an extraordinarily rapid transition like this before in history \u2014 a transition we can learn a lot from.\u201cGutenberg\u2019s printing press provided the trigger,\u201d Goldin told me by email, \u201cby flipping knowledge production and exchange from tight scarcity to radical abundance. Before that, the Catholic Churches monopolized knowledge, with their handwritten Latin manuscripts locked up in monasteries. The Gutenberg press democratized information, and provided the incentive to be literate. Within 50 years, not only had scribes lost their jobs, but the Catholic Church\u2019s millennia-old monopoly of power had been torn apart as the printing of Martin Luther\u2019s sermons ignited a century of religious wars.\u201dMeanwhile, Goldin added, Copernicus upended the prevailing God-given notions of heaven and earth \u201cby finding that far from the sun revolving around the earth, the earth rotated around the sun,\u201d and \u201cvoyages of discovery by Columbus, da Gama and Magellan tore up millennia-old maps of the \u2018known\u2019 world.\u201dThose were the mother of all disruptions and led to the parallels with today.\u201cNow, like then, new media have democratized information exchange, amplifying the voices of those who feel they have been injured in the upheaval,\u201d said Goldin. \u201cNow, like then, public leaders and public institutions have failed to keep up with rapid change, and popular trust has been deeply eroded.\u201d Now, like then, \u201cthis is the best moment in history to be alive\u201d \u2014 human health, literacy, aggregate wealth and education are flourishing \u2014 and \u201cthere are more scientists alive today than in all previous generations.\u201dAnd, yet many people feel worse off.Because, as in the Renaissance, key anchors in people\u2019s lives \u2014 like the workplace and community \u2014 are being fundamentally dislocated. The pace of technological change is outstripping the average person\u2019s ability to adapt. Now, like then, said Goldin, \u201csizable parts of the population found their skills were no longer needed, or they lived in places left behind, so inequality grew.\u201d At the same time, \u201cnew planetary scale systems of commerce and information exchange led to immense improvements in choices and accelerating innovations which made some people fabulously rich.\u201dWas there a Donald Trump back then?\u201cMichelangelo and Machiavelli\u2019s Florence suffered a shocking popular power-taking when Girolamo Savonarola, a midlevel friar from Ferrara, who lived from 1452 to 1498, exploded from obscurity in the 1490s to enthrall Florentines, who felt left behind economically or culturally, with sermons that laid blame upon the misguided policies and moral corruption of their leaders,\u201d said Goldin. \u201cHe and his zealous supporters, though a small minority, swept away the Medici establishment and seized control of the city\u2019s councils.\u201cFrom there, Savonarola launched an ugly campaign of public purification, introducing radical laws including against homosexuality, and attacked public intellectuals in an act of intimidation that history still remembers as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Savonarola was amongst the first to tap into the information revolution of the time, and while others produced long sermons and treatises, Savonarola disseminated short pamphlets, in what may be thought of as the equivalent of political tweets.\u201dThe establishment politicians of the day, who were low energy, \u201cunderestimated the power of that new information revolution to move beyond scientific and cultural ideas\u201d to amplify populist voices challenging authority.Yikes! How do we blunt that?\u201cMore risk-taking is required when things change more rapidly, both for workers who have to change jobs and for businesses who have to constantly innovate to stay ahead,\u201d Goldin argued. Government\u2019s job is to strengthen the safety nets and infrastructure so individuals and companies can be as daring \u2014 in terms of learning, adapting and investing in themselves \u2014 as they need to be. At the same time, when the world gets this tightly woven, America \u201cneeds to be more, not less, engaged, with the rest of the world,\u201d because \u201cthe threats posed by climate change, pandemics, cyberattacks or terror will not be reduced by America withdrawing.\u201dThen, as now, walls stopped working. \u201cCannons and gunpowder came to Europe that could penetrate or go over walls and books could bring ideas around them,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Britain to Leave Europe for a Lie", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 I have been overcome by gloom since Britain voted to leave the European Union. It\u2019s not just the stupidity of the decision. It\u2019s not merely the lies of the charlatans who led the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign. It\u2019s not only the absence, now so evident, of any \u201cNextit.\u201d It\u2019s not even the betrayal of British youth. It\u2019s far more: a personal loss. Europa, however flawed, was the dream of my generation. The European Union was an entity, a bloodless noun, yet it had a beating heart.Riding a European train, gazing at the lines of swaying poplars, the villages huddled around their church spires, it was often impossible, at least for me, not to look past the tranquility to the blood-seeped soil and the tens of millions who gave their lives in Europe\u2019s collective suicides. Well, as the Germans say, we had the blessing of late birth; and the duty inherent in that blessing was to build a united Europe.Covering the European Parliament from 1980 to 1982, I would drive down from Brussels to Strasbourg. The Parliament was a bit of a farce. Unwieldy bundles of documents translated into Europe\u2019s many languages were carted back and forth. Yet, in its cumbersome way, the Parliament embodied something important: the hard trade-offs of European construction, union conjured from Babel.When I moved to Italy, with its large Communist Party and spasms of political violence, I would hear how \u201cscaling the Alps\u201d into the core of Europe was critical to the country\u2019s stability. The E.U. was insurance against the worst. For Mediterranean countries like Spain and Portugal that emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s it was something close to salvation.Memories: feckless Europe at the time of the Bosnian war and the thirst, nonetheless, of the small nations reborn in Yugoslavia\u2019s death to join the European Union and escape the bloody Balkan gyre. Watching Germany move its capital back to Berlin from Bonn in 1999 and thinking, the German question is solved and Europe is home free! Driving, when I lived in Berlin, into Poland and pinching myself to recall the unspeakable suffering overcome by German-Polish reconciliation as Poland prepared for E.U. membership.No miracle was ever so dull. Britain tended to see the E.U. in prosaic terms: It had not been delivered from ignominy or tyranny by European integration. Still, it gave the union heft, a free-market prod, a universal language and its second-largest economy. It was that recalcitrant member any good club needs.Sure, the challenges mounted. The 30-year postwar economic miracle ended \u2014 and with it full employment. The Franco-German balance at the heart of the union collapsed. German dominance stirred unease. The creation of a single currency, the euro, was bungled. The admission of former Communist states spurred large migrant movements. The European welfare state was strained. Resentments multiplied.Technology accelerated globalization, pulling hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in Asia but also offshoring millions of European jobs. Societies disaggregated. For each City honcho getting a daily Christmas delivery from Amazon Prime there was some poor sod out there in Nowheresville working a precarious warehouse night shift packaging stuff.Boris Johnson understood, in his scurrilous way, that the E.U. had become a perfect scapegoat for Western societies beset by the dilemmas of modernity. Opposed to Brexit early this year, he became its chief advocate, playing on every base instinct. Brexit was a tool, a plaything, never a principle. If he looks so glum in triumph it is because the adrenalin has run out.There will be no extra $470 million for the National Health Service from European Union savings, after all. Immigration is not about to fall. Some of the regions that voted for Brexit are also those that get the most funds from Brussels. \u201cThere is now no need for haste,\u201d Johnson says. Oh, really? \u201cWe are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans,\u201d he says. Oh, please!If Johnson becomes prime minister in the fall, he will be an unelected leader, just like all those \u201cunaccountable\u201d high rollers in Brussels. When he tries to extricate Britain from the union, he will face a hostile Parliament. Last time I checked, Britain was a parliamentary, not direct, democracy. So perhaps there is still hope. If words mean their opposite, as they do in Johnson\u2019s mouth, anything is possible. Europa is worth a fight.The union, for all its failings, did not deserve to be betrayed by a huckster. It will not die because of this imbecilic vote, but something broke \u2014 a form of optimism about humankind, the promise of 1989.My children will not inherit the Europe I hoped for. I look at my hands and see my father\u2019s emerging, the veins now more pronounced. Life feels diminished. Some things are unavoidable. This was not.Advertisement"}

Built in San Francisco in 1896, it was intentionally scuttled in 1940. The intent was to sink the ship in shallow water to make it easily visible from a glass-bottom boat, but the underwater slope was steeper than the ship\u2019s owners realized.The boat slid out of sight, ultimately coming to rest with its bow in 360 feet of water and its stern at a depth of 490 feet. The Tahoe was first reached in 2002 by a highly technical dive team that in the process set a record for high-altitude scuba diving. (Lake Tahoe is more than 6,200 feet above sea level.)Now the hobbyist team hopes it can democratize the science and adventure that has previously been accessible only to someone with the resources of Robert Ballard, the oceanographer and explorer who has investigated ships like the Titanic and the Bismarck, a German battleship sunk in the early stages of World War II.The idea also intrigued professional archaeologists as well as an official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who joined the expedition last week.David McKinnie, a senior adviser at the atmospheric administration\u2019s Ocean Explorer program, met the two engineers several years ago. Last year he invited them to make a presentation at an event for ocean explorers that the administration sponsored.\u201cThey were by and far the hit of the show,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were captivated by the potential of citizen exploration.\u201dThe Trident submarine, which was steered by a video game controller, was able to float gently around the shipwreck and dip into the ship through an exposed roof section that had been torn away.In keeping with the citizen-science aspirations, the dives were broadcast live over social media platforms like Facebook and Twitch. Trailed by a thin power and networking cable, the sub glided over the length of the wreck, beaming high-resolution video back to a command center, where it was displayed on a large computer monitor in a room overlooking the lake.The goal of the explorers is to have \u201ca lot more eyes in the ocean,\u201d said Mr. Lang, who worked for a start-up firm before co-founding OpenROV in 2012 with a Kickstarter campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re actually legitimately building the world\u2019s largest ocean observation platform on a shoestring,\u201d Mr. Lang said.While poking around the Tahoe wreck, the OpenROV team found a plaque that had been left behind by the previous team of divers, who reached the site over a decade ago.Navigating underwater was challenging, and the dive team had to be careful to keep from tangling their tether deep below the surface. They tracked their location in part by periodically observing a bright light that was suspended under the surface from their control boat hundreds of feet above.They were able to easily reconstruct how the ship had come to its final resting place and trace the furrow that it created as it slid deeper into the lake.An observer noted that one of the old myths that had been passed on to visitors to the lake by a mailman in the 1940s was that Lake Tahoe\u2019s deep waters were so cold that drowning victims actually stood up when they came to rest on the lake bottom.No bodies were seen by the Trident, only the occasional fish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Doctor on Schedule, Rarely on Time", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Dr. Abigail Zuger on the everyday ethical issues doctors face.The minute I got on that bus, I knew I was in trouble. The driver sat at the stop just long enough to miss the green light. Then he inched along till he missed the next light and the one after that. He stopped at every stop even though not a soul was waiting.The 20-minute trip to work stretched to a half-hour, then longer. I was late, late, late.But this was a driver with a mission, clearly way ahead of schedule and trying to get back on track. He was very early; now I was very late. We were two people with competing, mutually exclusive agendas, and the one in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat was bound to win.A half-hour later, still sweating from racing the last five blocks on foot, with patients piling up in the waiting room, I became the one in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat, with the mission and overriding agenda. Woe betide those with competing plans.Just like that driver, I work under two mandates. One is professional: getting my passengers from point A to point B without breaking the law or killing anyone. The other one is less exalted but generally far more visible: I run according to a schedule that I ignore at my peril.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they mutter out in the waiting room. And indeed, she runs late for exactly the same reasons your bus runs late: too many slow-moving passengers lined up to board. Not enough buses or drivers. A person in a wheelchair requiring extra attention. Horrible traffic.Not only does she often run late, but your poor driver \u00e2\u0080\u0094 er, doctor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can run only so late before disaster ensues. She has obligations not only to you and your fellow passengers twitching in annoyance, but to a host of others, including the nursing and secretarial staffs and the cleaning crew at the end of the line. She can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull that bus in at midnight if everyone is supposed to leave by 7 p.m.So when there is enough work to last till midnight, my agenda shifts, and not so subtly. Everyone can tell when I begin to speed. Every visit is pared down to the essentials. All optional and cosmetic issues are postponed, including most toenail problems and all paperwork. Chatting is minimized.As a bus driver once said to me when I was foolish enough to start a conversation about his speed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLady, just get behind the white line and let me drive.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about speed, an advanced skill set is required.A patient has been waiting weeks for his appointment, anxiously rehearsing his lines. Bad luck that he showed up on a day I need him in and out in 19 minutes. He spends his first 18 unwisely, pretending everything is fine, making small talk, not quite mustering the courage to say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on his mind.Then just as he is being ushered gently to the door, he pauses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by the way \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by the way\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an infamous schedule buster. It means something bad: a suspicious lump, a sexually transmitted disease. Further, it is so common that an entire literature now addresses the \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, by the way\u00e2\u0080\u009d phenomenon and how to tame it.One favored tool is: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d That question, asked by the doctor early in the visit, is intended to probe the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda before it trumps the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.In other words: My agenda is to adopt your agenda, and then rework it so that I can drive on. Brutal, perhaps, but effective.Very rarely do things work out for me the way they did for that driver who made me so late to work. Occasionally I have so much time that I can dawdle along the route.I remember clearly the last time that happened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing for exercise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny hobbies?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour family, are they well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I progressed rapidly through seatbelts, bike helmets, family medical history, end-of-life preferences \u00e2\u0080\u0094 every single stop my bus typically has no time to make.Every answer was \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dunno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the patient stood up: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I have places to be. Are we done?\u00e2\u0080\u009dWe were two people with competing, mutually exclusive agendas.

{"Headline": "Is Lizzie Grubman a Changed \u2018Party Girl\u2019?", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a year of anniversaries for Lizzie Grubman, the archetypal celebrity publicist known equally for making friends, enemies and headlines.Shortly after midnight on a July morning in 2001, Ms. Grubman ignited a tabloid firestorm when she backed her father\u2019s Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. into a crowd outside the Conscience Point Inn, a Hamptons nightclub, injuring 16 people.George Rush, a former gossip columnist who covered the accident and its aftermath for The Daily News, said the story played out as \u201ca larger parable about class conflict.\u201d\u201cFor many readers, Lizzie was a vicious princess who was overdue for her comeuppance,\u201d he said.Now 45, Ms. Grubman has stayed out of the spotlight for a decade. Mellowed by marriage and two children, and energized by her firm\u2019s expansion into talent management and television development, she feels ready to talk about the remarkable roller coaster of her life, and lay to rest the ghosts of that infamous summer.\u201cI do a lot of damage control, that\u2019s what I love in P.R.,\u201d Ms. Grubman said on a recent Sunday, sitting in her large corner office in the Flatiron district, which showcases \u201cRear Window\u201d style views over a uniquely Manhattan hodgepodge of apartments, construction sites and artists\u2019 studios. \u201cJust think of Olivia Pope in \u2018Scandal,\u2019 but for Hollywood.\u201dHer full client list is confidential (\u201cI do divorces, I do arrests and cop situations, when someone is resigning or getting fired,\u201d she said), but her current publicity-seeking roster includes the TV personalities Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Carole Radziwill, the rising hip-hop producer C4 and the pop singer Inas X.\u201cI think I\u2019ve matured, I think I\u2019ve grown up,\u201d said Ms. Grubman, dressed in a new-season Prada sundress and chunky platform heels, accessorized by a Givenchy Antigona black leather tote, whose oversize zipper teeth made it look like a document shredder for money. \u201cLiving a private, nonpublic life is a much happier life.\u201dMs. Grubman was flanked by her sons, Harry, 9, and Jack, 7, and her husband, Chris Stern, executive creative director for the talent and management agency WME IMG.Mr. Stern is a chatty, gentle man with a fondness for Loro Piana cashmere sweaters. When together, the couple bring to mind a really expensive pair of new stiletto heels and the protective velvet bag that comes with them in the box.\u201cChris is my rock,\u201d said Ms. Grubman, pulling him close. \u201cHe\u2019s made me into a different person, and my children have, too. There\u2019s been some rough times.\u201dThe family divides its time between their East 61st Street apartment (a triple combine duplex) and a five-bedroom weekend home in Sag Harbor, N.Y., both designed by Mr. Stern. It\u2019s a life filled with children, grandparents and all the trappings of professional success.Yet even now, with a happy home life and thriving business, Ms. Grubman has difficulty discussing the events of summer 2001, when everything changed.\u201cThe trials and tribulations that she went through, just like everybody else has gone through, she came out in a way that I\u2019m very, very proud of,\u201d Mr. Grubman said. \u201cEvery so often, I\u2019ll bump into someone and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re Lizzie\u2019s father.\u2019 I get a kick out of that.\u201dMr. Grubman was a famously bad student, a trait he passed on to his daughter. She had brief tours at four New York City private schools, including Horace Mann, Lenox and Dwight (\u201cmy social life became a little bit more important than studies,\u201d she said), followed by a single semester at Northeastern University.It was in Boston that Ms. Grubman started promoting nightclubs and the public relations career that she pursued upon returning to New York.\u201cNadine\u2019s list is not valuable, it\u2019s only valuable to Nadine,\u201d Ms. Grubman said. \u201cI respect Nadine, I have nothing bad to say about her. She clearly does not like me.\u201d (Ms. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.)It inaugurated a golden age for her business, but her tough-as-nails persona and moneyed background alienated some observers even as it attracted huge names to her client list, including entertainers like Jay Z, Gloria Estefan and Mr. Combs, and modish restaurants and nightclubs of fin de si\u00e8cle New York, like Moomba, Spy Bar and Asia de Cuba.\u201cShe was there by my side and protected me when I was young and just getting into the spotlight,\u201d Britney Spears, a former client for whom Ms. Grubman still occasionally consults, wrote in a text message from Los Angeles. \u201cI was so grateful to know that Lizzie always looked out for me.\u201dBut the article also ruffled feathers, with its depiction of the subjects as privileged party girls, an early backlash to the \u201cprincess\u201d image that would attend Ms. Grubman for years to come.\u201cI get it,\u201d she said of the resentment at the time. \u201cIt would irritate me, too.\u201dBut worse was on the way.On July 6, 2001, Ms. Grubman received the devastating news that her mother had late-stage ovarian cancer. (She died three weeks later, at age 58.)In an emotional state, Ms. Grubman nevertheless went out that Friday evening to attend July 4 weekend festivities in the Hamptons. After a party at the home of Alex and Alexandra von Furstenberg, she drove the black Mercedes S.U.V. to the Conscience Point Inn, then a fashionable Southampton nightclub.Sometime after midnight, she got into an argument with a doorman who insisted she move her car. Instead, the vehicle lurched backward into a line of waiting patrons, injuring 16 people.The gossip columns continued to needle, and it was an encounter with aggressive paparazzi that convinced Ms. Grubman that she needed to remove herself and her family from the spotlight.\u201cOne day, we\u2019re out walking, and these photographers are out for my son, and he was so scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurt him so badly. We had problems in preschool with him taking class pictures.\u201d\u201cNow, he\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said, watching Harry gambol over her office furniture. \u201cNow he has his own Instagram.\u201dIf Ms. Grubman\u2019s critics were hoping she would collapse under the sheer weight of the schadenfreude directed at her, they will be disappointed.In her stylishly decorated office, surrounded by family, she seems closer to the \u201chaving it all\u201d work-life balance promoted by tech industry mom-bosses like the Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg and the Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer.Ms. Grubman rises at 5 a.m., wakes her children at 6:30 and works from her office between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Back home, she balances work calls and family time (Mr. Stern is the cook) until a 9 p.m. bedtime.Jack, the younger son, who seemed completely at ease in her office, was asked to describe his mother. \u201cShe buys us stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she talks on the phone a lot.\u201d(Ms. Grubman laughed it off, but it seemed clear there would be some media training when he got home that night.)Amid the happy family din, however, there remains just a trace of sadness around the intertwined tragedies of her mother\u2019s death and the car accident that changed her life. When asked to reflect on that fateful night, her normally polite smile sets into a thin, flat line.\u201cThat unfortunate night happened, which I prefer not to talk about, in respect to my children and family, and the people who were involved,\u201d she said.\u201cI never properly mourned my mother. We\u2019ll leave it at that, you know why.\u201dIn 2007, her husband decided to do something about it.\u201cUnderstanding that Lizzie had a really tough time with Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d Mr. Stern said, \u201cI decided, right after we had Harry, that I go to Barneys and walk around with a personal shopper and pick out the best shoes and the best handbags in the place, bring them to the apartment, and I proceeded to fill Harry\u2019s entire crib with all of these pretty special boxes of treats.\u201d\u201cIt was piled high,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to make it seem like Harry was giving her the gift.\u201dMs. Grubman said, \u201cHe\u2019s changed Mother\u2019s Day for me, and he\u2019s helped me through it.\u201dThe anecdote captures Ms. Grubman\u2019s uniquely contentious place in New York\u2019s pantheon of characters. It\u2019s a cherished and heartwarming memory for the family, but viewed from the outside, it will be perceived as overprivileged and materialistic enough to inspire a thousand mean tweets.Was Ms. Grubman prepared for such a social media response?\u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d she said, sounding momentarily battle weary. \u201cI\u2019ve been beaten, I\u2019ve been killed in the media. But at this point in my life, my family, my kids and my clients are the most important people to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Leaders Tell a Dazed Britain to Get Going on \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported by\u201cI do not understand why the British government needs until October to decide whether to send the divorce letter to Brussels,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, told German television.\u201cI would like it immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not an amicable divorce, but it was also not an intimate love affair.\u201dThe emergency meeting of foreign ministers from the European Union\u2019s six founding states \u2014 Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 revealed impatience and exasperation with Britain.The European Union has other considerable challenges, including the migrant crisis, Greece\u2019s turbulent economy and sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. European leaders, looking at Spanish elections on Sunday and German and French elections next year, want the uncertainty around the British question resolved as soon as possible so they can try to show their own voters that Brussels is capable and on track.But the British have to decide what they want in a future relationship with the European Union, given the disagreement among the Brexit leaders, who are not a government. Mr. Cameron, humiliated and an opponent of leaving, clearly has no desire to bear the burden of those negotiations \u2014 both internally, within the divided Conservative Party, and externally, with other European leaders. His counterparts in Europe think he has damaged not only himself and his country, but also them, by energizing European populism and diminishing the bloc.The French are particularly impatient, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault saying on Saturday that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc should begin soon. He warned that Mr. Cameron will face \u201cvery strong\u201d pressure to accelerate the process when European leaders meet on Tuesday in Brussels, where Mr. Cameron is expected to be asked to leave the room when the others discuss their plans. The Europeans are also expected to cancel Britain\u2019s six-month presidency of the council, which was to begin in July 2017.There is confusion about Britain, too. Mr. Ayrault said Saturday that \u201cthey must designate a new prime minister, which would certainly require several days.\u201d In fact, the process will be considerably longer, because Conservative lawmakers must first agree on a leadership contest and decide when it will be. That contest will involve numerous ballots of Conservative legislators to winnow down candidates to two, and then the 150,000 or so registered members of the party (who had joined at least three months ago, to prevent infiltration) will vote by mail.Ms. Merkel, trying to be conciliatory in the face of facts, said that she was seeking an \u201cobjective, good\u201d climate in talks on Britain\u2019s exit, and that there was \u201cno need to be particularly nasty in any way in the negotiations; they must be conducted properly.\u201dShe said Scotland planned to enter discussions with European Union institutions and European governments to protect its place in the bloc. Ms. Sturgeon said she would establish an advisory panel on the legal, financial and diplomatic implications of the vote.As Mr. Cameron\u2019s announced resignation sank in, speculation abounded that Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the most visible leader of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, was the favorite to replace him. But there were reports in British newspapers that Mr. Cameron and his deputy, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were eager to keep Mr. Johnson from profiting from what they considered to be his betrayal and that they were organizing support for Theresa May, the home secretary.In a speech in London on Saturday, Mr. Corbyn largely ignored the no-confidence effort. Instead, he told supporters that Labour would fight to ensure that its agenda was at the heart of discussions as Britain negotiated its exit from the bloc.He mentioned the importance of employment protections and human rights, said the referendum had laid bare divisions in the country over immigration and underlined the despair of those hit by austerity measures.\u201cToday it\u2019s important we learn from what has taken place,\u201d he said. Asked if he would run again if his leadership was challenged, he replied, \u201cYes, I am here.\u201dThe sense of shock was particularly acute in London, a cosmopolitan city and an important financial center, which reacted to the vote with anger, disappointment and even tears.\u201cI was crying yesterday,\u201d Camila Diehl, 26, who works for a cancer charity in London, said Saturday. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening. This is not the country I know.\u201dMs. Diehl, who has a Colombian mother and a British father, said she was worried about what the vote would mean for funding for scientific research. She is now questioning her future in Britain, she said.Mayor Sadiq Kahn, who supported \u201cRemain,\u201d took to Facebook on Friday, saying he wanted to \u201csend a clear message to every European resident living in London \u2014 you are very welcome here.\u201d\u201cThere are nearly one million European citizens living in London today, and they bring huge benefits to our city \u2014 working hard, paying taxes, working in our public services and contributing to our civic and cultural life,\u201d he wrote.And in the latest consequence of Britain\u2019s vote to withdraw from Brussels, Britain\u2019s highest-ranking European Union official \u2014 Jonathan Hill, the commissioner for financial services \u2014 resigned on Saturday.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, James Kanter from Brussels, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Sunderland, England.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brooklyn Bridge Park Conflict, Neighbors See Trouble. Players See Intolerance.", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byBrooklyn Bridge Park, the 85-acre park at the edge of Brooklyn Heights, transformed an industrial shoreline into a recreational esplanade that today draws over 125,000 people on summer weekends. It has become the emerald trim of a jewel-box neighborhood of handsome brownstones.Particularly prized are the park\u2019s tidy basketball courts that draw players from as far as the Bronx and Queens for their million-dollar views of Lower Manhattan and other amenities not often found on more humble home turfs \u2014 like actual nets on the hoops. But a spate of courtside fights among rowdy visitors, punctuated by gunfire last year, has prompted the police, at times, to shut down Pier 2, where the courts stand.The situation has set some residents in the well-off neighborhood, which is mostly white, on edge, some of whom portray the pier as an OK Corral for gangs and complain that their quaint streets have become overrun with teenagers. The players, many of whom are black, say that whatever problems have occurred are relatively limited and believe that they are the victims of stereotyping.Courtside fisticuffs, they say, are just a result of teenagers being teenagers \u2014 and isn\u2019t that what happens in parks?The conflict between the players and the neighborhood plays out in particular at the southern end of the slim, 1.3-mile-long park, where it pours out onto Joralemon Street.But some players believe the issue has more to do with their background than their behavior.\u201cSometimes I try and avoid going on Joralemon,\u201d said Aaliyah Johnson, 17, who is black and travels from Flatbush to play basketball. \u201cIt\u2019s like they look at you, move their kids over like you\u2019re going to do something, and clutch on to their purse. Your doing that \u2014 it just makes us not feel welcome. We just came here to play basketball.\u201dThat race has become part of the discussion is inescapable, some say, given that the players coming to the park cross through an overwhelmingly white neighborhood \u2014 whites make up about 80 percent of residents in Brooklyn Heights, according to the United States census.Since April, the police have shut Pier 2 six times, either in response to fighting or to pre-empt possible violence. As part of its effort to avoid trouble, the Police Department has started monitoring social media for mention of the park. One of the shutdowns, the police said, was meant to stop a large party planned on Facebook, and two others came after threats on social media to \u201cshoot up the park.\u201dIn recent weeks, the police have increased their presence with 16 officers added to park duty, bringing the total to 25, according to park officials.Some residents have become so troubled by the situation that they have asked Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, the group that runs the park, to replace the basketball courts with something else. Tennis courts are a frequent suggestion.Park officials say that is not going to happen.\u201cBrooklyn Bridge Park has been built and designed as a space for everyone,\u201d said Regina Myer, the president of the park. \u201cThe inclusion of basketball courts was a deliberate decision from the outset.\u2019\u2019Ms. Myer acknowledged that there have been security issues that park officials, along with the police, are working to address. \u201cBut getting rid of some of the most popular basketball courts in the city is decidedly not the solution,\u201d she added, \u201cand would fly in the face of everything this park stands for.\u201dPark officials and volunteers are trying to come up with ways to discourage loitering on the streets outside the park, which tends to lead to conflict. They are also working with representatives from a nearby housing project, the Ingersoll Houses, where many of the players come from, to develop programs for younger residents. One idea is to host a basketball game between the police and regular players.Another neighborhood leader who has raised concerns about the courts, Peter Bray, the executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, described the issue as \u201cthe attack on Joralemon Street.\u201d But the problem, he said, is not with the players, it is with the park itself. The park is long and thin, bounded by water on one side and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway and tall bluffs on the other. There are few access points. \u201cThe park planners have not done a good job at finding ways for people to get into the park and out of the park,\u201d Mr. Bray said.And one of the ways in and out, the Squibb Bridge, has been closed for years because of engineering issues.For Aaliyah, who sat in the park on a recent afternoon practicing secret handshakes with her girlfriends as they waited their turn to play basketball, any threat to the courts weighed heavily. \u201cThis is Brooklyn culture here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re removing it, it\u2019s like a piece of our childhood will be gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Brooklyn, this week, they became pariahs.In rapid succession, Good English has been dropped from several Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to play, as well as the Northside Festival, a weeklong music festival that began on Monday. Other festivals have also announced that the band will no longer be performing.\u201cWhen people choose to defend something, then I think they should be held accountable for it,\u201d said Daniel Stedman, a founder of the Northside Media Group, which runs the Brooklyn festival.\u201cHow does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the Brock story, how does somebody participate in that, making right of a wrong?\u201d Mr. Stedman said. \u201cWe are really just one tiny, infinitesimal part of that puzzle, but I think it was a no-brainer for us.\u201dIn her letter, Ms. Rasmussen, 20, says that there was a distinction between rape and Mr. Turner\u2019s case, and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions.Mr. Turner, 20, a swimmer at Stanford, was found by two passers-by, partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus, on top of the 23-year-old woman, who was incapacitated by alcohol, according to the authorities. The passers-by stopped the assault and held Mr. Turner down as he tried to flee.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn\u2019t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him,\u201d Ms. Rasmussen, who plays drums in the band, wrote. \u201cBut where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isn\u2019t always because people are rapists.\u201dMs. Rasmussen\u2019s letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of Mr. Turner before his sentencing, a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant. His father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week; he said that the episode had affected his son\u2019s appetite and that, in particular, he no longer enjoyed rib-eye steaks.Following the firestorm her letter provoked, Ms. Rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized. \u201cThis appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved,\u201d she said in a statement.Ms. Rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private. But a spokesman for the court said she was wrong \u2014 such letters, like most documents entered into the court, are a matter of public record.Within hours of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter being made public by New York magazine, Good English was removed from a roster of Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days, including Rock Shop in Gowanus, Industry City Distillery in Greenwood, Gold Sounds in Bushwick, and Bar Matchless in Greenpoint.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be affiliated with anyone that\u2019s going to try to victim-blame or even just downplay rape,\u201d said Larry Hyland, an owner of Bar Matchless.Mr. Hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bar\u2019s Facebook page demanding that the band\u2019s show be canceled. Some of the messages, he said, included threats to confront the band members if they did perform.\u201cWe didn\u2019t cancel the show because of censorship,\u201d he said, adding that while he disagreed with the content of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter, he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend. \u201cI wanted to avoid an unsafe environment.\u201dIn her statement, Ms. Rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote, but to \u201cthe overzealous nature of social media.\u201d In particular, she lamented the \u201cuproar of judgment and hatred unleashed on me\u201d and the effect it was having on her musical aspirations.Advertisement"}

When completed, it will provide energy for Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urban boom and fuel further industrialization of the Amazon basin. The Belo Monte is just one of scores of dams that the government has planned for the rivers of the Amazon rain forest to propel the growth of Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.Although plans for the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex started in 1975, construction was delayed until 2011 because of fierce and persistent protests by several of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 16 indigenous tribes. The original project was changed so that tribal lands would not be directly flooded. But nearby forests where they hunted would be submerged, and the dam will most likely affect water levels and drinkability, transportation and fishing. Many Brazilians whose family roots in the area date to a century ago, when it had a booming rubber industry, are also affected. They mostly live off the land and still depend on fishing and tapping their own rubber trees. The story of the dam and its effects on the environment result in the kind of slow, subtle photo essay that is expensive to do and hard to fund. Mr. Elkaim recently received a $20,000 Alexia Foundation grant, which will enable him to pursue the story for the next year.His rain forest images will be displayed at the Look3 Photo Festival in Charlottesvile, Va., from June 13 to 19 as a part of an exhibit celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Alexia Foundation. Curated by Mike Davis, the exhibit will also include Mary Calvert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on homeless female veterans who have survived sexual trauma in the military.  This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exhibits also include work by Nick Brandt, Graciela Iturbide, Yuri Kozyrev and Frans Lanting as well as Olivia Bee, Sheila Pree Bright, Binh Danh and Radcliffe Roye, known as Ruddy. The festival also includes two daylong seminars for  emerging and midcareer photographers.Even before the Belo Monte dam project, the surrounding area had been severely damaged by the clearing of forests by outsiders for cattle grazing.While the tribal protests helped change the original plan for the hydroelectric complex, a new dam is planned nearby on the Tapaj\u00c3\u00b3s River. Mr. Elkaim recently spent time there with the Munduruku tribe, who are fighting to stop that dam. They have recently delayed construction by getting their territory officially recognized by the government as indigenous land. When Mr. Elkaim returned to the area around the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex earlier this year, even those people still protesting seemed resigned to the dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impending effects on their environment and way of life. While this story may be too nuanced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and remote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to inspire headlines in North America, Mr. Elkaim says he thinks it is critical because it is typical of what he sees as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgutting\u00e2\u0080\u009d of ecosystems around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to protect the people whose entire way of life, identity and culture are dependent upon these ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we protect their way of life, they will protect the environment around them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJames Estrin, the co-editor of Lens, will be participating in the educational programs on June 15 at the Look3 festival.

{"Headline": "How You Fight With Your Spouse May Affect Different Body Parts", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "In the 1980s, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, invited heterosexual couples who had been married for at least 15 years to recreate in the lab some of the ups and downs of intimacy. First the spouses talked to each other for 15 minutes about their day; for the next 15 minutes, they were directed to rehash an area of ongoing contention in their relationship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in effect, pressed to argue, which they did. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just pushed the right buttons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Robert Levenson, a professor of psychology at Berkeley and the senior author of the new study. The resulting spats were followed by 15 minutes of dispassionate, general discussion. All interactions were inconspicuously recorded on video. The subjects also completed detailed questionnaires about their health. Every five years since then, for at least two decades, the couples have returned to the lab and repeated everything.This experiment has produced a wealth of data for studies on long-term marriage and well-being, but the recent Emotion study was  the first time researchers (from Berkeley and elsewhere) examined subjects\u00e2\u0080\u0099 facial expressions and voices while they bickered. The researchers then compared emotional signals during arguments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when someone is angry, for instance, his or her eyebrows lower, eyes widen, lips compress and voice crescendos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with the health questionnaires. Spouses, especially husbands, who seethed with anger while arguing were much more likely to later report symptoms of cardiac problems, like chest pain or high blood pressure, than calmer spouses; those who stonewalled were more prone than others to develop muscular problems, like back or neck pain. These associations were highly specific. Angry spouses rarely developed back pain, stonewallers rarely reported cardiac symptoms and people whose main response to conflict was sadness or fear did not report many cardiac or musculoskeletal problems at all.The results make physiological sense, Dr. Levenson says: Anger, for example, raises pulse rates and causes other biological reactions that tax the heart over time. Of course, an observational study like this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prove that emotions cause health problems or that other factors, like genetics, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t more influential.

{"Headline": "C-Span Delivers on Sit-In, Even With Cameras Off", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 C-Span knew it had a problem.Democrats had unexpectedly sat down in the middle of the House of Representatives chamber to demand a vote on gun control legislation, and with the body officially in recess, C-Span, the cable network known for \u201cgavel to gavel\u201d coverage of Congress, had no means to cover it.Then it found an unlikely source: the social media feeds of House members who had turned to Periscope, a live video-streaming app, and Facebook Live.\u201cAs soon as we knew it was available, we went for it,\u201d Terry Murphy, C-Span\u2019s vice president for programming, said on Thursday after a short night\u2019s sleep. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know when we got into it that we would be doing it for 24 hours. There just wasn\u2019t much time to debate it.\u201dSo began what was arguably the most memorable 24-hour period the network has seen in years, one that Mr. Murphy estimated had probably set a record for continuous broadcast of a social media feed and that others suggested amounted to something of a declaration of independence from congressional landlords, who control the TV cameras inside the Senate and House chambers.\u201cWe always told ourselves that if we were successful, we were building a tool to give a voice to the voiceless,\u201d Kayvon Beykpour, co-founder and chief executive of Periscope, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s showing you the truth from different people\u2019s perspectives. It\u2019s a really raw way of experiencing what you watch.\u201cIn this case, it\u2019s really ironic that the voiceless were our elected representatives.\u201dTwitter has long had a presence in Washington, and holds regular training sessions for politicians and media organizations on how best to use its tools. After Twitter bought Periscope, the video app was incorporated into the company\u2019s training efforts.About a month ago, Twitter held a training session with the House Democratic caucus that focused specifically on how to use Periscope. A staff member from Mr. Peters\u2019s office attended. On Wednesday, when C-Span lost access to cameras \u2014 which are normally shut off when the House is not in session \u2014 an aide suggested that Mr. Peters turn to Periscope as a means of broadcasting what was happening on the House floor.Other networks shared brief segments from the live feeds, but it was C-Span that stuck with them, overriding other coverage and cutting away only when Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other House Republicans returned to the floor around 10 p.m. for a series of votes.C-Span is no stranger to late-night sessions \u2014 be they for a filibuster or a contentious vote \u2014 but the impromptu sit-in, which Mr. Murphy said the network had no advance knowledge of, was different. A staff of around 25 people remained overnight in the Capitol and at the network\u2019s offices a few blocks away, and the regular morning team was called in four hours early.\u201cIt was the least scripted of the all-night sessions we\u2019ve had to cover,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.The fact that C-Span does not control the cameras inside congressional chambers has been a source of disquiet for the network since it arrived on the air in 1979. Every time a new leader comes to power in either chamber, Mr. Murphy said, network executives send a letter requesting greater access, including the placement of independent media cameras inside the chamber. Thus far, they have been denied.The network employs about 270 people and has an annual budget of $70 million, according to a spokesman, Howard Mortman. It enjoys a niche following: Journalists covering the federal government treat it as a lifeline, and for those addicted to politics from coast to coast, few sources can rival its unvarnished transmission.While C-Span\u2019s decision to stick with the protest drew a flurry of criticism on Twitter, Mr. Mortman said there had been no serious concerns raised from Mr. Ryan\u2019s office or outside groups.\u201cWe want to show as much of Congress as we can \u2014 that\u2019s our mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThis clearly is a big story, and this gives us a way to show what\u2019s happening in an area where our own cameras are not allowed.\u201dNicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Boy, we media people sure know how to pick \u2018em.Sure, there are exceptions like the Gawker-hunter and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who is a Trump delegate, but for the most part, Mr. Trump turns people in the Valley off. HP Inc. also said this week that it would not contribute financially to the Republican National Convention.Mr. Trump has attacked Apple, Facebook and Amazon, so his unpopularity in Silicon Valley is no surprise. But David\u2019s report also suggested that Hillary Clinton, who hasn\u2019t really championed the tech industry in her run, is also greeted with mild skepticism here. In the Obama era, tech companies have been revered \u2014 Google has easy access to the White House, and many Obama staff members have gone to work for the tech industry. But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically. So I wonder: Is that good?Don\u2019t you think that the tech skepticism among the major candidates reflects the bloom coming off the tech rose in general, and a yearning for a pre-internet era when everyone had good jobs and the future seemed so bright?We\u2019ve long feared that technology would eat our jobs, but platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit offer a dystopian look at what a future of fragmented employment might actually look like. And with wages and jobs at the center of much of the campaign for both Democrats and Republicans, there isn\u2019t much to love there. Data breaches scare the bejesus out of everyone. And in an anti-establishment moment, it has become clear that tech has matured into the establishment.Anyway, great to chat with you, Lydia. See you on Twitter!Advertisement"}

While returning home from school in Delhi, Tewari\u2019s cousin Shivam, 16, was hit by a speeding jeep. The driver abandoned the scene. Shivam, badly injured, managed to pull himself to the side of the road. He asked strangers for assistance. \u201cHundreds of people must have passed by him in the 30 minutes he was there,\u201d said Tewari. \u201cBut no one helped. He bled to death in full public view on the side of the road.\u201dTewari was so disturbed he left his job. \u201cIt angered me,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to find out why this had happened.\u201d He traveled across India meeting people who had lost family members in similar circumstances. He spoke with lawyers, police officers, doctors, and activists to try to understand the problem. And he discovered two important facts.The cumulative toll of road deaths in India is alarming. Between 2006 and 2015, 1.2 million Indians died in road crashes, and six to seven million were injured or disabled, many with head and spinal injuries. Road deaths are the No. 1 cause of death for Indians between the ages of 15 and 49. Perhaps half of the victims are from very poor backgrounds \u2014 rickshaw wallahs, cart pullers or daily laborers who walk or bicycle home from work after dark, when crashes most often occur. Their deaths cause families to fall deeper into poverty. \u201cIf 50 percent could be saved if they were rushed to hospital, why should that not be done?\u201d Tewari implored.Now, the next phase of work begins. \u201cWe need to get this disseminated right down to the last person on the road,\u201d said G. K. Pillai, a former secretary in India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs, who serves as a trustee for SaveLife Foundation. \u201cThis is a huge country: 1.2 billion people. I would put it at two to three years before we can get everyone to know this is the law.\u201dThe good Samaritan law is just one of many efforts being advanced by SaveLife and other advocates to improve road safety. Since 2009, SaveLife has trained 10,000 police officers in 10 states to provide trauma care tailored for crash victims \u2014 everything from performing CPR and transporting a victim safely to dealing with fire injuries, impalement or dismemberment. \u201cGiven the lack of available ambulances in India, police officers were rushing a lot of victims to the hospital,\u201d said Tewari. \u201cBut while they were doing that, they weren\u2019t providing trauma intervention.\u201dBut the numbers alone don\u2019t explain why India\u2019s crash rate is so high. The main problems are systemic: India\u2019s processes for training and licensing drivers is broken; enforcement of traffic violations is anemic, and road engineering in general doesn\u2019t conform to accepted safety standards, which take human error into account. Moreover, unlike many other countries, India doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive legal framework for advancing road safety, nor has it designated a government agency to take the lead in overseeing it. SaveLife continues to push for both of these changes.Some of the inadequacies are absurd \u2014 and fixable with tighter laws. For example, until 2014, it was permissible for trucks in India to carry construction rods protruding up to a meter from the back of the truck. Each year, this caused thousands of deaths in rear-end collisions. A SaveLife petition led the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to ban the practice.\u201cWe need a comprehensive road transport and safety law, with more stringent penal laws,\u201d said Alok Mittal, a former police commissioner who is now the inspector general at India\u2019s National Investigation Agency. \u201cAs part of the U.N. decade for road safety, we have committed to reduce road fatalities by 50 percent by 2020, but the trend has been increasing. We need to really act in a big way to control these fatalities.\u201d\u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to take 10 to 15 years to have a major impact,\u201d adds Pillai, \u201cbut we have to do it. Too many people are losing their lives and we don\u2019t acknowledge the impact.\u201d He contrasted India\u2019s intense focus on terrorism with its focus on road safety. The government spends 20 times more to combat terrorism, he estimated, while road crashes kill 75 times more people. \u201cYou have a bus accident and 30 people are killed, it\u2019s a two-line entry on the sixth page. But if four people are killed in a bomb blast, it\u2019s front page news.\u201d\u201cUnless the framework under road safety is reformed we will not see broad changes,\u201d adds Tewari. \u201cIt requires being flexible, understanding how the government works and thinks, being data driven. If you\u2019re able to get your agenda to become part of their agenda, you can have big impact. But it takes a while for policies to come through, and to have impact \u2014 so you have to sacrifice instant gratification.\u201dAn earlier version of this article in some instances misspelled the name of a man who was killed by a speeding jeep in Delhi.

It also allows you to waste hours scrolling through Facebook or looking for the latest deals on Amazon.More powerful computing systems can predict the weather better than any meteorologist or beat human champions in complex board games like chess.One place to look at this disconnect is in the doctor\u2019s office. Dr. Peter Sutherland, a family physician in Tennessee, made the shift to computerized patient records from paper in the last few years. There are benefits to using electronic health records, Dr. Sutherland says, but grappling with the software and new reporting requirements has slowed him down. He sees fewer patients, and his income has slipped.\u201cI\u2019m working harder and getting a little less,\u201d he said.The productivity puzzle has given rise to a number of explanations in recent years \u2014 and divided economists into technology pessimists and optimists.The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait.Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity.Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its \u201cdigital potential,\u201d the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records.The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors\u2019 offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government.\u201cThe government funding has made a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs.\u201dThe electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. \u201cPeople confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish,\u201d said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd so little has gone into changing work so far.\u201dThe government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive.Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules.Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging.Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers\u2019 revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealth\u2019s cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealth\u2019s share is less than 5 percent of the group\u2019s revenue.Today, Dr. Sutherland\u2019s personal income and the medical group\u2019s revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014.Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact.Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes.Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records.Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients.He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss.He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, aren\u2019t everything. \u201cMy patients are better served,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happier.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect of digital technology on productivity growth rendered incorrectly the name of a medical technology provider.

Trump: Acquaintances in the hometown Mr. Nadler has known for nearly three decades will not look him in the eye.\u201cPeople I\u2019ve known for years,\u201d Mr. Nadler, 63, said. \u201cJust nod or wink or something. Anything.\u201dAcross the country, every election introduces a measure of neighborly strain. Allegiances splinter. Eyes roll. Conversations curdle.But Mr. Nadler\u2019s case is unique. His neighbors include Bill and Hillary Clinton, perched behind a white fence about a mile away on Old House Lane. And the town is proud, and fiercely protective, of its most famous residents.\u201cWe love her,\u201d said Dawn Greenberg, the founder of Chappaqua Friends of Hillary, before adding a Clintonian hedge. \u201cShe reportedly loves us back.\u201dMr. Nadler is unmoved, focusing his daily energies almost exclusively on helping to defeat Mrs. Clinton and extolling her opponent\u2019s virtues.He was jeered last month at the town\u2019s beloved Memorial Day parade, where the Clintons marched to warm applause. Mr. Nadler abandoned his plan to approach the former president and ask him to put on a Trump hat.He has taken local administrators to task for prominently displaying images of the Clintons on the town website.He has founded an opposition group on Facebook, \u201cNeighbors of Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua for Donald Trump for President,\u201d whose hundreds of members mostly live elsewhere.His connection to the candidate, he said, is unmistakable.\u201cWe have a symbiotic understanding, Trump and I,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s spooky in a way.\u201dIt is an admiration fostered over many decades. Trained in engineering and building construction, Mr. Nadler \u2014 a Bronx native who shuns the \u201cboootiques\u201d of Chappaqua, but not the accent of his youth \u2014 has followed Mr. Trump\u2019s career since the 1970s, dazzled by his redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel (now the Grand Hyatt) in Midtown Manhattan.He tracked Mr. Trump\u2019s ups and downs, personal and professional, in the news. He never missed an episode of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201dMr. Nadler, with thinning hair and an iced tea stain on his white polo shirt, was once something of a hippie, playing folk music in Central Park as a teenager and identifying most strongly with Democrats like the Kennedys. He never took to the Clintons, though he said the former president was gracious once when Mr. Nadler introduced himself and his son at a supermarket.\u201cHe could charm the pants off a snake,\u201d Mr. Nadler said.Speaking from his back porch, Mr. Nadler described a lifetime of hard and often physical labor, interrupted in recent years after a fall from a ladder that left him with a broken hip.Mr. Trump, he said, is the candidate he has been waiting for. He identified several parallels between himself and the presumptive Republican nominee.There is rhetorical strategy: \u201cHe has exaggerated to compensate for people who don\u2019t like him,\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \u201cI do that, too.\u201dThere is the nose for deal-making: \u201cBeing in construction, I\u2019ve negotiated,\u201d he reasoned.And when Mr. Trump announced his bid last year, railing against unauthorized immigrants and promising a wall, Mr. Nadler marveled at how similar their instincts were.\u201cA lot of things, I said. I mentioned ISIS. I mentioned Obama with refugees and illegals,\u201d Mr. Nadler said.Seeking an analogy, Mr. Nadler invoked the 1988 movie \u201cTwins,\u201d the story of physically mismatched brothers separated at birth. (Mr. Nadler is the Danny DeVito character, in his telling, with Mr. Trump as Arnold Schwarzenegger.)Across town, where Mr. Nadler has long earned a reputation as a gadfly, he has found little solidarity.Along almost every stretch of this exclusive hamlet, there is a Clinton story \u2014 the injured boy whose cast was signed by Mr. Clinton, the salon on King Street that styles Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hair, the time a little girl chased the Clinton family dog into the back of a security vehicle.Locals cheer the famous family at Lange\u2019s Little Store and Delicatessen, where Mr. Clinton is known to prefer fruit salad and a honey bran muffin, and at Hip-Kid boutique, which keeps a \u201cHillary\u201d sign tucked discreetly beneath the register.Democrats enjoy an overwhelming voter registration advantage in the upscale ZIP code. And since the Clintons purchased their home in 1999, even many voters who lean right like Mr. Nadler have come to appreciate the couple\u2019s affection for this woodsy patch of New York real estate and its quaint downtown, some 35 miles from the city.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cNot everybody wears their politics on their sleeve,\u201d said Robert J. Greenstein, the town supervisor for New Castle, which includes Chappaqua. \u201cHe tends to.\u201dThe rest of Mr. Nadler\u2019s family is less vocal. His wife, Maria, has embraced Mr. Trump, if not her husband\u2019s dedication, which has elevated his status in several Trump-centric Facebook groups and online chats.\u201cMy infamous husband,\u201d sighed Ms. Nadler, a teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s consumed a lot of his time.\u201dHer most daring act of political protest came at a diner, she said, when she flashed a menacing glare at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who lives in nearby Mount Kisco and supports Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Nadler\u2019s 17-year-old son, Stephen, the youngest of their three children, remains the home\u2019s chief Trump skeptic.\u201cI find it hard to believe the side that says he\u2019s very intelligent,\u201d he said from the front seat recently, with his father driving.\u201cHe has a 156 I.Q.!\u201d Mr. Nadler shot back. His source was not immediately clear.The teenager said the family\u2019s Chevy Tahoe is now more famous than its owner, appearing often in the Snapchat videos of high school friends who are surprised at its trimmings. Mr. Nadler has glued some of his pro-Trump stickers to the back window to prevent theft.Another aesthetic choice \u2014 Mr. Nadler\u2019s plot to frame and hang a Trump sign inside the house \u2014 was felled by spousal veto.Surely, Ms. Nadler said, there are other Trump supporters in their midst.

Trump will be greeted by as many as 6,000 protesters on the first day, a noisy coalition of dozens of groups, including Black Lives Matter and the Workers World Party. The demonstrators intend to ignore restrictions keeping them far from the delegates, raising fears the violence that accompanied some of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies will be magnified on a mass scale.Two marches along routes the city has not authorized are planned for the convention\u2019s opening day, July 18. Organizers say they want to avoid violence. But they are also gearing up for confrontation with the police, including training in civil disobedience.\u201cIf there are people willing to put themselves on the line to be arrested, so be it,\u201d said Deb Kline, a leader of Cleveland Jobs With Justice, one of the groups that will march.A week later, as Democrats pour into Philadelphia, so will an army of Bernie Sanders supporters planning Occupy Wall Street-style protests against what they call the \u201cfraudulent\u201d nomination of Hillary Clinton. One group, Occupy DNC Convention, is circulating information about protecting oneself from tear gas by wearing a vinegar-soaked bandanna and swim goggles.The divisive nominating contests have produced countercurrents of deep resentment in both parties. And next month, that bitterness could spill into the streets in large protests just when Republicans and Democrats \u2014 and the host cities \u2014 are trying to present images of unity to the country.There is no chance of that level of violence, officials in both cities insist, because modern policing has evolved to be less confrontational. Philadelphia is considering issuing $100 summonses to marchers blocking highways or failing to disperse, rather than arresting them.But protest organizers in Cleveland say that by imposing strict rules to contain demonstrators, the city is increasing the likelihood that unsanctioned protests will erupt, leading to violent clashes with the police or between Trump supporters and opponents.Protest groups say the restrictions are less for safety than to minimize their visibility, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio has sued the city over the rules, saying they violated free speech rights. The rules limit marches to 50 minutes, mostly during the mornings, hours before the delegates convene, and to a route distant from Quicken Loans Arena, the convention site, passing over what protest organizers call \u201ca bridge to nowhere.\u201d\u201cThe parade route is very short and it goes over a bridge, which means no one can see them,\u201d said Christine Link, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.Some protest leaders said they would ignore the restrictions and march as close as possible to the arena, which will be wrapped in a security perimeter set by the Secret Service.\u201cThey made this plan to frustrate and aggravate people who want to demonstrate within their rights against the Republican agenda,\u201d said Thomas Burke, a leader of the Coalition to Stop Trump and March on the RNC.Expecting thousands for a protest on the convention\u2019s opening day, Mr. Burke said he would ignore the official parade route and march from Cleveland\u2019s Public Square to within \u201csight and sound\u201d of the arena.\u201cIf the police respect our march, I think we have a family-friendly event,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people try to provoke and attack our march, I\u2019m pretty sure people will take care of themselves. We\u2019re very well organized.\u201dEven the organizer of a pro-Trump rally said the city\u2019s rules increased the chance of violence by confining all demonstrators to the same route.\u201cYou stick everybody together face to face, you\u2019re going to have a problem,\u201d said Tim Selaty, organizer of a group called Citizens for Trump, which expects 5,000 to attend. \u201cThey have created a much more dangerous situation.\u201dAfter the 2004 Republican convention in New York, the city paid out millions of dollars to settle claims of civil rights violations after the police detained 1,800 people, including dozens swept up by long orange nets.A spokesman for Mayor Frank G. Jackson of Cleveland defended the prescribed march route and said the police had trained for 18 months to deal with protesters.\u201cOur anticipation is everyone is going to come and do what they\u2019re supposed to do and will be able to have a wonderful time,\u201d said the spokesman, Dan Williams. He added that protesters who chose other march routes would not be arrested as long as they used sidewalks and did not block traffic.The potential effect on Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as they formally enter the general election is asymmetrical.Philadelphia is giving the protesters more leeway than Cleveland is, allowing daylong rallies of Sanders supporters in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park facing the convention site, the Wells Fargo Center, on all four days of the convention, July 25-28.Mr. Taylor, a Philadelphia resident with no official ties to Mr. Sanders, received a request from the campaign to use one of his permits so Mr. Sanders could hold a rally in Roosevelt Park on Sunday, July 24, the convention\u2019s eve.Even as Mrs. Clinton effectively clinched the nomination by securing a majority of delegates, many Sanders supporters insist there were fraud and voter suppression.\u201cWe feel like democracy has been stolen,\u201d said Laurie Cestnick, the founder of a Facebook group called Occupy DNC Convention, which has more than 25,000 members.Her group is a hub for ride shares to Philadelphia, information about \u201cBernie Buses\u201d and tent camping and a friendly warning not to use BernieBNB, a house-sharing app that is already overwhelmed.Ms. Cestnick\u2019s application for a permit for up to 15,000 people to march on July 25 is pending with the city.Mr. Taylor\u2019s group, March for Bernie at DNC, plans to demand the resignation of the Democratic Party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida; the end of the use of superdelegates, or party leaders who get nominating votes and have overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton; and universal open primaries. Independents strongly favored Mr. Sanders over Mrs. Clinton but could not vote in the many closed primaries, where only registered Democrats could participate.If the demands are not met, Mr. Taylor said, die-hard Sanders supporters plan to leave the Democratic Party. Polls show as many as 30 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers say they will not vote for Mrs. Clinton.To symbolize their view of the party, Mr. Taylor said, \u201cwe plan on marching coffins down Broad Street every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why I Quit Twitter \u2014 and Left Behind 35,000 Followers", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byThe beginning of my end with Twitter came with both a frowny face emoticon from Ari Isaacman Bevacqua, one of The Times\u2019s audience development experts, and a boilerplate email from Twitter:For weeks, I had been barraged on Twitter by rank anti-Semitic comments, Nazi iconography of hooknosed Jews stabbing lovely Christians in the back, the gates of Auschwitz, and trails of dollar bills leading to ovens. It all started after I linked to an essay, on my Twitter account, by Robert Kagan \u2014 one that discussed the emergence of fascism in the United States. At first, I let it flow, determined to preserve my Twitter time line as a shrine to hate and incontrovertible evidence of rising anti-Semitism. But last week, I had begun reporting the most egregiously abusive accounts to Twitter \u2014 and I\u2019d received no response.Then Ms. Bevacqua assembled the worst of the missives and images, forwarded them to Twitter and requested action. On Monday night, she was informed none would be forthcoming. The next morning, I logged on to see a new user calling me a \u201ckike,\u201d declaring that Jews should have their assets seized and hoping for a revival of the ovens.I had enough. I proclaimed on Twitter that I would be leaving it behind \u2014 along with my 35,000 followers.The racists, anti-Semites and broader world of so-called White Nationalists protest that any move to censor their hate would be an assault on free speech (orchestrated by Jewish overlords, they add for good measure). But that argument holds no water on Twitter, which is a private company, not a public forum \u2014 and one that has explicit rules.And there is this:It is not a close call when a user named \u201cHolololocaust\u201d tweets out beautiful women in Nazi uniforms, \u201cHonorary Aryan\u201d broadcasts portraits of Adolf Hitler, \u201cCato Maior\u201d pursues his agenda under a confederate flag, and \u201cNSRevolution\u201d (presumably for National Socialist) uses a swastika as his logo.Other things I have learned on Twitter: Taylor Swift has been adopted as the patron saint of the White Nationalists, apparently an icon of Aryan purity; racists and anti-Semites are obsessed with something called the \u201c14 Words\u201d \u2014 \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\u201d \u2014 and are particularly fond of holding Jews responsible for their own historical misfortunes, perpetually demanding that I explain why, throughout the history of the diaspora, the Jews keep getting exiled, brutalized and nearly annihilated. Message: We brought it on ourselves.But Twitter appears determined to ignore its own terms of service, which also include a blanket prohibition on pornography. I can assure you that this, too, is flouted, since \u201cTrutherbot Spawn\u201d sent me a lovely and explicit GIF to illustrate his opinion of my behavior.Mr. Goyimist has a point. The blocking or deleting of accounts on Twitter is a pointless exercise if Twitter won\u2019t police itself for flagrant violations of its terms of service. As I wrote this, I took time out to open a new account on Twitter. My handle: @Jew_Hater, my Twitter name HitlerAnew (I_Hate_Jews, Josef_Goebbels, Heinrich_Himmler and Hitler_Returns were already taken) \u2014 and, hey, no problem!Facebook users can make up names, but they at least have to sound legit. Twitter, not so much. Yes, Twitter\u2019s free-for-all has advantages: parody accounts, anonymity for the persecuted and such. But that only means Twitter assumes more responsibility for policing its accounts.I have been encouraged to return to Twitter, and told that I should continue to fight, that my exit was cowardly, that I let the haters win. And I might. I miss the quick rush of a scan through my time line.But the fact is, giving up one social media space wasn\u2019t exactly martyrdom. It wasn\u2019t much of a loss at all. I have found myself reading whole articles through The New York Times and Washington Post apps on my phone \u2014 imagine that. I can actually look at the profiles of people requesting to be my friend on Facebook to see if they are, in fact, trolls. If one slips through, I not only can \u201cunfriend\u201d him but can delete his posts. It feels liberating.And I am awaiting some sign from Twitter that it cares whether its platform is becoming a cesspit of hate. Until then, sayonara.Advertisement"}

Officials hoped this sweep would make a dent in the wave of gun violence that has plagued the city. As Mr. Lott was filing his photos at a nearby Starbucks, a woman ordered her coffee and walked out the door. Within seconds, she was mortally wounded by a stray bullet.This was the third person he had seen shot this year.Chicago is going through yet another grim season of gun violence. While this sprawling city of 2.7 million people who live in dozens of neighborhoods is diverse, it is also segregated. That reality is alarmingly reflected by the victims of gun violence, with most bloodletting concentrated on the West and South Sides. The North Side, which I called home for many years, is mostly unaffected by the violence, save for a few pockets. Most neighborhoods see no shootings at all.Mr. Lott, a Chicago native, has been covering crime in the city for The New York Times over the past year, working with the paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local reporting staff. As things have unfortunately kept getting worse, coverage has expanded.Mr. Lott, Alex Wroblewski, Sam Hodgson, Whitney Curtis and I worked round-the-clock on 12-hour shifts. Mr. Lott and Mr. Wroblewski, who both live in Chicago and have documented this story extensively, worked more or less from dusk to dawn. We put one photographer on the West Side and one on the South Side. About a dozen reporters worked overlapping nine-hour shifts.And it was equally important to follow up with victims and families, and to document daily life in the city.There is a ranch home on the Far South Side where, if you kneel down and lean into the bedroom wall, you can peer through a bullet hole and see Julia Rhoden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandchildren playing in the front yard. Early on Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend, she was sitting on her bed watching television. Her husband, Calvin, was sitting outside when someone walked up and opened fire, missing him entirely but peppering the concrete, screen door and awning with bullets. One of those bullets ripped through the bedroom wall and lodged in Ms. Rhoden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back. When I met her on Sunday, she had just been released from the hospital and was cooking dinner for her family. Blood still seeped through her bandage and shirt.Loud noises make her uneasy now.As I drove away and turned the corner, I was startled to see children galloping by on horseback. Just two blocks from the Rhoden home, Rashad Branscomb, who owns the horses and keeps them in a nearby suburb, was having a family picnic. He was unaware of the Rhoden shooting, but immediately rattled off two other nearby addresses where there has been gang activity.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are trying to get them out of here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Branscomb, who grew up in Englewood, where a lot of the shooting is taking place.For me, it was a small sign of hope for a city I still consider home.\u00e2\u0080\u009cChicago is an extremely beautiful city,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lott said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I hope we can figure out a solution to curb crime.

{"Headline": "How Do You Stop a Future Terrorist When the Only Evidence Is a Thought?", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byMAGNANVILLE, France \u2014 The first time Larossi Abballa appeared on the radar of French terrorism investigators, the only act of violence they could pin on him was killing bunnies.He had joined a small group of men, all bent on waging jihad, on a trip to a snowy forest in northern France five years ago, when he was 19. There, they videotaped themselves slaughtering the rabbits, bought so the men could grow used to the feel of killing.When he and seven others were later arrested, the authorities found that several of the men had saved the video of the slaughter on their cellphones, alongside footage of soldiers being beheaded, according to French court records. Mr. Abballa was eventually convicted on a terrorism charge and spent more than two years in prison.But at the time of his arrest in 2011, investigators were not able to definitively show that he was a permanent threat to France. After his prison stint, he was placed under surveillance. Just months after the wiretaps stopped, he committed the double murder last week.Across Europe and the United States, law enforcement officials are struggling to reckon with attackers like Mr. Abballa and Omar Mateen, whose shooting rampage this month at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., left 49 dead. They are men who clearly seemed to be building toward violent acts, and whose names had surfaced in terrorism investigations, but who avoided crossing legal lines that could tip off the authorities until it was too late.With thousands of terrorism surveillance cases running at any given time, the European authorities say they are swamped and are in the difficult position of trying to head off attacks of which the only forewarning is often in the form of what someone thinks or what they are overheard saying.\u201cA man is in a shop and thinks about stealing an object,\u201d said Georges Sauveur, a Paris lawyer who has defended several terrorism suspects, including one of the men who accompanied Mr. Abballa to the forest in 2011 to slaughter the rabbits. \u201cWhat do you do? You put him in jail?\u201dMr. Sauveur added, \u201cYou can\u2019t put him in jail unless he takes the next step and attempts to steal something.\u201dIn late 2010, France\u2019s domestic intelligence agency began watching Mohamed Niaz Abdul Raseed, 33, who was living in the Val d\u2019Oise region of northern France and who the agency suspected was a recruiter for Al Qaeda. The investigation revealed that he had lured seven adherents, the youngest of whom was Mr. Abballa.Under the older man\u2019s instruction, the young men met in a public park to do calisthenics, enrolled in a kung fu class and gathered for lessons on extremist Islam. They also took their day trip to the forest in Cormeilles-en-Parisis with the rabbits, which they had pooled their money to buy.By the spring of 2011, two members of the group had gone to Pakistan, where they were met by a facilitator for Al Qaeda, according to French court records obtained by The New York Times.As the most junior member of the group, Mr. Abballa was not chosen to go, and that frustrated him. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty for blood, Allah is my witness,\u201d he wrote in an email intercepted by the authorities. In another, he begged, \u201cPlease let me go, pls, pls, pls.\u201dWhen it appeared that he would not be sent to Pakistan, he turned his rage toward France, writing on Feb. 19, 2011, \u201cWith Allah\u2019s will, we will find a way to raise the flag here.\u201d A week later, he wrote that his cell would \u201cwipe away the infidels.\u201dHe was arrested on May 14, 2011, and like the other members of the cell was convicted on a charge of belonging to a criminal or terrorist organization, carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years, said S\u00e9bastien Bono, the lawyer representing the accused leader of the group.Considered the group\u2019s least influential member, Mr. Abballa spent more than two years in prison and was released in 2013. He was kept under surveillance until the end of 2015.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy retrospectively, with hindsight, to say that law enforcement, or government, should have known about someone\u2019s intent. But obviously there\u2019s a big difference between motivation \u2014 someone being radicalized \u2014 and then going out and actually acting on that,\u201d said Richard Walton, who led the counterterrorism unit for the London Metropolitan Police during the 2012 Olympics. \u201cAt any one time, in any country, there will be many hundreds, if not several thousand suspects, that fit this profile.\u201dAmong the difficulties for the authorities in 2011 was that Mr. Abballa had aggressively denied any connection to terrorism. He told investigators he was an atheist. He denied that he had taken part in the practice-beheadings of rabbits \u2014 he was not seen on the video \u2014 even though the seven other men in the cell all said he had participated. And the members of the group contradicted one another. When pushed, one of Mr. Abballa\u2019s accomplices explained that they had slaughtered the animals in order to have halal meat to eat during the Islamic holiday of Eid, according to a summary of their interrogation.It took investigators time to spot the hole in that claim: The forest slaughter was in January, and the Eid al-Adha holiday had been celebrated two months before, in November.While the legal systems may be different, the United States faced many of the same problems in their interactions with Mr. Mateen, who when questioned by the authorities about earlier threats of violence insisted that he had said those things because he was angry after facing discrimination.For France, thought to have among the largest numbers of suspected Islamic State loyalists in Europe, the haystack is at least as big, and some say the caseload has become unmanageable.\u201cWe are in fact drowning in intelligence,\u201d said Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris.He and others said there were structural problems, including the fact that France\u2019s so-called S List, a database of people believed to have been radicalized, has over 10,000 names and is not ranked according to threat level.\u201cIf you take your daily agenda, and you were to note down the birthday of every single person you know, it would be unmanageable\u201d to try to wish them all a happy birthday, Mr. Bauer said. \u201cYou need to make a selection. We don\u2019t know how to do that with the profiles of these people.\u201dAfter Mr. Abballa killed the couple in Magnanville, France, last week, a deputy in Parliament, \u00c9ric Ciotti, introduced a bill creating the status of \u201cadministrative detention\u201d for those representing a security threat.In effect, he was calling for rapid prioritization of the S List, and he said the bill would be aimed at immediately detaining hundreds of those deemed to pose the highest risk, placing them under house arrest or in a detention center.He called the measure necessary because the penal code is based on proving that an individual is not just talking or thinking about committing an act of terrorism, but has taken steps toward carrying out the act.\u201cThese people are known to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be able to take preventive action.\u201dPrime Minister Manuel Valls said last week that he would consider the proposal, but that there would be \u201cno Guant\u00e1namo\u201d in France, the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration reported.Jean-Charles Brisard, the chairman of the French Center for the Analysis of Terrorism in Paris, called the idea \u201cabsurd\u201d and said France could not jettison civil liberties.He added that putting everyone on the S List under surveillance was impossible, because there are more than 10,000 names and fewer than 5,000 agents. It takes 20 agents per suspect for 24-hour surveillance, he said, meaning France could perform round-the-clock surveillance of only a small fraction of those suspected of being radicalized.\u201cMy profound conviction is that unfortunately we need to get used to living with this new threat,\u201d Mr. Brisard said. \u201cIt\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s diffuse and it can erupt at any moment.\u201dThe streets in Magnanville, a community of about 5,600 people less than 40 miles from Paris, are lined with neatly trimmed hedges. It was here that Mr. Abballa waited last week for an off-duty police officer, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, to come home. As neighbors watched in horror, Mr. Abballa stabbed Mr. Salvaing in the street and left him bleeding in the driveway, then forced his way into the house. There he stabbed to death Jessica Schneider, the officer\u2019s longtime partner, as the couple\u2019s 3-year-old son watched.In the time it took the police to close in and shoot Mr. Abballa dead, he paused to upload a Facebook Live video. He had prepared a long speech, and the sound of flipping pages could be heard as he spoke.\u201cFirst of all, I pledge allegiance to Emir al-Mumineem Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\u201d he began, referring to the leader of the Islamic State using a similar formula to the pledge uttered by Mr. Mateen, who called 911 from inside the nightclub to dedicate his violence to the terrorist group.In a long rant captured on the video, Mr. Abballa\u2019s thoughts returned to the frustration he felt in 2011, when he begged to be allowed to go abroad to wage jihad.\u201cI address this also to the French infidel authorities. This is the result of your work. You closed the door to my Hijrah,\u201d he said, using an Arabic term for a pilgrimage that for some Islamic State devotees has come to mean traveling to Syria and Iraq to join the group. \u201cYou closed the door toward the lands of the caliphate? Well, good then, we have opened the door of jihad onto your territory.\u201dAlissa J. Rubin, Adam Nossiter and Lilia Blaise contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

Their work represents men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fashion at its boldest and most dynamic: audacious leopard prints, Dutch wax cloth suits paired with plaid ties and pocket squares, stylish straw hats and fedoras, spats, and ever-present sunglasses. These men \u00e2\u0080\u009care not afraid of color nor of mixing and matching styles, much in the same vein as the era of hip-hop that birthed them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Lewis wrote. Historically, within black and white cultures across the world, the dandy has served as a transgressive figure. In 19th-century Europe, the French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire, drawing on the writer Jules Barbey d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aurevilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study of the quintessential fashionable dandy, Beau Brummel, helped popularize the dandy as the epitome of urban countercultural resistance and of the brashness of modernity. To Baudelaire, the dandy was a sartorial revolutionary. He employed clothing and style in \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe passionate pursuit of an original selfhood that makes its own rules,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the art historian Susan Fillin-Yeh wrote. Or as Baudelaire himself put it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDandyism [is] an institution beyond the laws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The idea of dandyism as a form of personal expression and social and cultural resistance among people of color has a long history in the United States. The writer Stuart Cosgrove has examined this connection in relationship to the zoot-suiters of the mid-20th century \u00e2\u0080\u0094 African-American and Latino dandies, whose richly tailored and padded clothing conveyed a distinctly political message.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe zoot suit was a refusal \u2026 of subservience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cosgrove wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was during his period as a young zoot-suiter that the Chicano union activist Cesar Chavez first came into contact with community politics, and it was through the experiences of participating in zoot-suit riots in Harlem, that the young \u00e2\u0080\u0098Detroit Red\u00e2\u0080\u0099 began a political education that transformed him into the Black radical leader Malcolm X.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs early as the 19th century, the appearance of the black dandy was often cause for alarm in white America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a threatening presence, as the art historian Richard J. Powell observed, in the context of a \u00e2\u0080\u009csociety where black people (and specifically black men) had clearly demarcated positions and identities and posed a challenge to the American body politic when they failed to conform to white expectations.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile scholars have traced the roots of the black dandy to the West \u00e2\u0080\u0094 specifically, Britain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Lewis noted that he originated in Africa. Throughout the continent, highly refined sartorial aesthetics and tailoring were the hallmark of African men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fashion for centuries. Dandyism has remained an important part of African society, advanced by such movements as la Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 des Ambianceurs et des Personnes \u00c3\u0089l\u00c3\u00a9gantes (the Society of Ambience Makers and People of Elegance), which originated in the French speaking Congo, as well as the Swenkas, the debonair working-class Zulu men of South Africa.In the end, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDandy Lion\u00e2\u0080\u009d reminds us of the extent to which the dandy has historically challenged \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and continues to challenge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a limited or proscribed view of men of color. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether hanging out at a gentlemen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s club or attending the African Street Festival in London, there is an unspoken conversation being had between Black men globally about how they want to be seen in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reads an exhibition text. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe decision to defy social expectations of how they show up in the world is an exuberant act of agency and defiance in the face of a world that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always friendly to Black men and boys.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMaurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

{"Headline": "At King Arthur Flour, Savoring the Perks of Employee Ownership", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byPrototypeLast month, a recipe for lemon cake filled with pastry cream and lemon curd spread quickly on Facebook, garnering 6,200 shares and 9,900 likes. Of the 300-plus commenters, some had followed the recipe and were displaying photos of their frosted creations, while others asked baking questions or inquired about dairy- and gluten-free versions of the recipe. Another contingent was just plain hungry. \u201cI need a piece of that cake right now,\u201d one person wrote.Jesse Cloutier, the company\u2019s digital engagement supervisor, quickly wrote a playful reply to the Facebook user who was desperate for an immediate lemon-cake fix. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a piece right here that we\u2019ll be happy to mail to yo...,\u201d Mr. Cloutier wrote. \u201cOh! Oh dear. I\u2019m afraid there are only a few crumbs lef \u2014 aaaaaand those are gone too.\u201dMr. Cloutier isn\u2019t just on staff at King Arthur Flour; like 340 other employees, he\u2019s also a partial owner of the company.Since 2004, King Arthur Flour has been 100 percent employee-owned. After the first year of employment, all workers who log more than 800 hours a year, including seasonal and part-time laborers, are eligible for the employee stock ownership program, or ESOP.ESOPs are retirement plans that function much like 401(k)\u2019s, but with one enormous difference: The company fully funds ESOPs without any financial contributions by employees.In 1996, Frank Sands, a fifth-generation owner of King Arthur Flour, and his wife, Brinna, began contemplating the succession plan for their business. With no family members interested in taking it over, Mr. Sands came up with the idea of selling it to his employees.\u201cFrank decided to rethink what would be the best way to move forward,\u201d said his stepdaughter Ellen Kitchel, who works as an administrator for King Arthur Flour\u2019s educational programs, including baking classes. \u201cHe really liked the idea of having the employee ownership. He thought it brought out the best in people.\u201dBut there is also a practical reason that some turn to employee ownership. \u201cNot being able to get their wealth out of the company so that they can retire is one of the major problems of family entrepreneurs,\u201d Professor Blasi said. Hence, turning to the managers and workers who helped build the business may be appealing.\u201cThese people don\u2019t have $15 million,\u201d Professor Blasi said. \u201cBut all of a sudden, the ESOP allows them to have $15 million if they have a business plan and if there\u2019s a bank that approves a credit line.\u201dProfitability and a history of peaceful labor relations are keys to setting up and sustaining a successful ESOP, along with worker support for the plan and strong management leadership. Full employee ownership, like King Arthur Flour\u2019s model, isn\u2019t necessary, but it helps ensure stability, Professor Blasi said.But ESOPs don\u2019t create utopias. Working at a company with an ESOP can be riskier than simply earning a wage. This is because with ESOPs, employees can potentially lose both their jobs and their ownership shares. Mitigating that risk, Professor Blasi said, is the fact that workers don\u2019t personally make contributions to the ESOP and aren\u2019t required to vouch for the loan obtained to buy the business.King Arthur Flour has experienced major growth since it became employee-owned. In the late 1990s, the company started distributing products outside New England, to the Midwest and beyond, growing from a small regional business into a national one with robust sales. Its annual sales are now more than $100 million. More than 2,000 King Arthur Flour products are sold in grocery stores, to bakeries and through the company\u2019s website and catalog.But, Ms. Kitchel says, the culture at King Arthur Flour isn\u2019t very different from what it was under her family\u2019s ownership.\u201cThere are many similarities from when my mother and Frank owned it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of real hands-on involvement. People care about each other and people care how things get done.\u201dKing Arthur Flour\u2019s three co-chief executives say employee ownership has helped them attract talent and unite the work force. (The company also has profit-sharing and 401(k) programs.)And some of King Arthur Flour\u2019s employees might be able to expect the ESOP to pay off handsomely in the long term, said Ralph Carlton, one of the chief executives.If the value of the company\u2019s equity continues to grow, workers who are employed long enough to accumulate hefty retirement funds will find that the benefit \u201cis not just icing on the cake,\u201d Mr. Carlton said. \u201cIt allows people to retire in a very comfortable manner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Travelers on Where to Go After Orlando", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byAs lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people make summer travel plans, or even plans to attend pride celebrations in our own cities, how important is safety when deciding where to go in a post-Orlando world? And how do we balance the need for visibility as a means of social change with the need for fellowship within the community that accepts us? I talked to people who form a loose-knit L.G.B.T. travel collective, and explored how a sense of nervousness and, as there has been since the beginning of the gay rights movement, a powerful feeling of defiance, may shape where we go.But the unfortunate truth is that this feeling that our havens are not actually snug enclosures insulated from a potentially dangerous world is hardly new.Even before the Orlando shooting, the decision about what to do this summer was more charged than usual, because of a presidential campaign and state laws in North Carolina and Mississippi exposing a divide on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights issues. The number of places where you could morally defend spending your tourist dollars had already shrunk.The question of whether to avoid the state is indicative of a perennial issue we face as we choose where to go. The early ethos of the gay rights movement, which gave rise to the chant \u201cwe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it!\u201d doesn\u2019t jibe with now avoiding places that restrict lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.While the Orlando shooting might cause some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to avoid big events, at least for awhile, the consensus, if there is one, among L.G.B.T. travel leaders is that attendance in most cases will only go up. \u201cIf you\u2019re visible and you\u2019re out, we\u2019re strengthened as a whole,\u201d Ms. Chauvin said.

But so far, they have not found any independent corroboration \u2014 through his web searches, emails or other electronic data \u2014 to establish that he was, in fact, gay, officials said.The question of sexual orientation is a part of a broader effort by the F.B.I. to establish Mr. Mateen\u2019s criminal profile. Beyond being a critical piece of information that could help the agency reconstruct the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, it could aid in creating a broader analysis of criminal and terrorist behavior.\u201cPeople often act out of more than one motivation,\u201d Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters during a visit here on Tuesday. \u201cThis was clearly an act of terror and an act of hate.\u201d\u201cIf you know anything about psychology, you know that people that have a really, really strong resentment or above-average hate toward something, it\u2019s because deep inside that\u2019s what they truly are,\u201d she said in an interview at her home in Boulder, Colo. \u201cIn Islam, it\u2019s true that there is very low tolerance for homosexuality. He may not have been able to be himself.\u201dBut she added that she was speculating, and that there was nothing in their intimate life on which she had based that hunch.Several men later came forward to tell other news media outlets that Mr. Mateen was a regular at Pulse. (Two of them, female impersonators who perform at the club, declined to comment for this article, though, saying the focus ought to be on the victims.)Another Orlando man, a Navy veteran named Kevin West, told The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post that he had communicated with Mr. Mateen for about a year on Jack\u2019d, a gay chat and dating app.Hector Camacho, the chief executive of Jack\u2019d, said the company was cooperating with the F.B.I.A company spokesman, Jeff Dorta, said several television networks that sought to authenticate the report forwarded screen shots of what was purported to be Mr. Mateen\u2019s Jack\u2019d profile page, which they said they had received from a source making the allegation. Mr. Dorta said that a technical analysis determined that the profile page was probably not created by Mr. Mateen.\u201cWhile we are not at liberty to comment on any specifics, I can tell you that as of now, utilizing the information Jack\u2019d has been provided, we have not been able to substantiate that Omar Mateen was a Jack\u2019d user,\u201d Mr. Dorta said.In an interview, Mr. West refused to share any of the messages or pictures or explain which app he had used to communicate with Mr. Mateen. He became combative when pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t need to prove anything to anyone,\u201d Mr. West said. \u201cIf I said it, it\u2019s true.\u201dThe man said Mr. Mateen had profiles on at least three gay dating apps. He said they first met at another gay club in Orlando, the Parliament House, and had more than a dozen rendezvous at an area hotel.Miguel told the network that Mr. Mateen felt rejected by Hispanic gays and was angry at Puerto Ricans in particular, because he once had a sexual liaison with a man who later confessed to being H.I.V. positive.Federal authorities looked into his account and do not consider it credible, said a law enforcement official who spoke on background because the information was part of an ongoing investigation.Christopher Hansen, 32, a witness to the Pulse massacre, said that if it turned out that Mr. Mateen had been gay, it might open a conversation about homophobia in Muslim and other religious households where homosexuality is sometimes not accepted.\u201cMaybe this would help open up eyes in all religions,\u201d he said.Pedro Julio Serrano, a gay activist in Puerto Rico, said he was worried that Univision\u2019s interview sought to dismiss the killings as a \u201cpersonal quarrel.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any texts, phone calls, voice mail messages, emails or Facebook messages,\u201d Mr. Serrano said. \u201cWe have to be very careful here.

{"Headline": "Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton, and Urges Democrats to Unite", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama told Senator Bernie Sanders in an Oval Office meeting on Thursday to channel the energy of his presidential campaign\u2019s millions of supporters behind Hillary Clinton, and said that Mr. Sanders would play a central role in shaping the Democratic agenda if he did.Less than an hour and a half later, Mr. Obama, who had tried to remain neutral in the race between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, formally endorsed her.Moving swiftly to unite his party after a primary campaign that has left many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters bitter and disillusioned, Mr. Obama, according to his aides, tried to mollify the maverick senator while prodding him to reorient his efforts against Mrs. Clinton into a broader bid to help Democrats in November.There was no hint after the meeting that Mr. Sanders intended to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the nomination at next month\u2019s convention, but hours later at a rally in Washington he urged voters there to go to the polls in their primary on Tuesday and to keep pushing for a political revolution.After the White House meeting, Mr. Sanders vowed to take the ideas that have animated his campaign \u2014 addressing poverty and income inequality, increasing Social Security benefits, and reducing the role of money in politics \u2014 to the convention.But he also announced plans to meet soon with Mrs. Clinton to discuss ways they could work together to defeat Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.The meeting was the set piece of a day of choreographed political theater in which Democrats treated Mr. Sanders to a visit only slightly less elaborate than that of a head of state. The White House made sure that cameras were positioned to capture the president and the vanquished Vermonter strolling animatedly along the White House colonnade to the Oval Office for their meeting. Later, Mr. Sanders met with the Senate Democratic leadership before zooming up Massachusetts Avenue for an audience with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at his residence at the Naval Observatory.Democrats were hoping that if they gave time and space to Mr. Sanders, he would not cause trouble for them at their convention in Philadelphia and would eventually endorse Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Sanders spent much of his day using back entrances and side doors and ducking into stairwells to avoid reporters\u2019 questions, clearly unwilling to talk in precise terms about his plans.The road ahead was clearer for Mrs. Clinton, who on Thursday collected long-anticipated expressions of support from influential Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, perhaps more of a favorite of the party\u2019s liberals than even Mr. Sanders.In a video posted on her campaign\u2019s Facebook page shortly after Mr. Sanders departed the White House grounds to visit the Capitol, Mr. Obama described Mrs. Clinton as the most qualified candidate to seek the White House, and implored Democrats to come together to elect her after a divisive party primary.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the three-minute statement.Mr. Obama has made no secret of his desire to play an active role in the race to succeed him. \u201cI\u2019m with her, I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there to campaign for Hillary,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the video.Mrs. Clinton immediately announced that she and the president would hold their first joint campaign appearance of the 2016 race on Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., the start of what White House officials said would be an intense campaign push for Mr. Obama that will culminate in near-daily appearances as the November election draws nearer.White House officials had been discussing the endorsement with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s camp for days, but they kept the timing under wraps, in part as a gesture of respect for Mr. Sanders and his highly motivated supporters.Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders on Sunday that the endorsement would come soon, according to people familiar with the conversation, and discussed the announcement with Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday, the night she clinched the nomination.Mr. Obama recorded the Facebook message earlier on Tuesday at the White House, aides said.The president had been circumspect about declaring the race finished, even after Mrs. Clinton captured sufficient delegates in primaries on Tuesday to clinch the Democratic nomination. On Thursday, he congratulated her on \u201cmaking history\u201d and said he had personally witnessed her qualifications for the Oval Office.\u201cShe\u2019s got the courage, the compassion and the heart to get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen her judgment, I\u2019ve seen her toughness, I\u2019ve seen her commitment to our values up close.\u201dMr. Obama also praised Mr. Sanders for what he called an \u201cincredible campaign.\u201d He said the Vermont senator\u2019s emphasis on addressing income inequality, reducing the influence of money in politics and bringing young people into the political process would strengthen the party.In their Oval Office meeting, White House officials said, Mr. Obama told Mr. Sanders that he could play a valuable role in re-energizing the party by supporting Democrats in races across the country this year, and use the influence he has amassed in his campaign to press his agenda forward in the Senate.Mr. Sanders, speaking to reporters as he left the West Wing with his wife, Jane, said that \u201cwe will continue doing everything that we can to oppose the drift which currently exists toward an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires exercise enormous power over our political, economic and media life.\u201d\u201cNeedless to say,\u201d he added, \u201cI am going to do everything in my power and I will work as hard as I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s quick endorsement irritated some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s leading supporters, who said they could not understand why the president would not wait until after next week\u2019s Washington primary, the last contest in the Democratic nominating process, to weigh in.\u201cI thought they\u2019d give him the grace to finish out what he pledged to do, which is take his campaign to the final contest,\u201d said Paul G. Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and Massachusetts senator who backs Mr. Sanders.At the rally in Washington on Thursday night, Mr. Sanders showed no sign of slowing down his campaign, making no mention of Mrs. Clinton and saying nothing about party unity. Many in the crowd of about 3,000 people shouted slogans like \u201cShun the nonbelievers\u201d and \u201cStay in the race.\u201dOn Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders tried to balance their desire to be respectful of Mr. Sanders and give him room to exit the race on his own terms while firmly conveying to him that the contest has essentially ended. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, said he had invited Mr. Sanders to address the Democratic caucus on Tuesday.Mrs. Clinton \u201chas enough delegates,\u201d Mr. Reid said after meeting with Mr. Sanders in his Capitol office. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear a single word about him wanting to change the fact that she\u2019s the nominee.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will most likely succeed Mr. Reid as Democratic leader next year, echoed his colleague, telling reporters after his own meeting that he knew Mr. Sanders to be \u201cconstructive.\u201dPrivately, Senate leaders breathed a sigh of relief. Mr. Reid told Mr. Sanders during their 40-minute conversation that he was entitled to wind down the campaign on his own time. And Mr. Sanders implied to Mr. Reid that he would begin that process after the final primary next week and not take his campaign to the convention floor, according to an aide briefed on the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation.But Mr. Sanders is going to try to put his stamp on a party that he adopted only when he began to seek its nomination. He told Mr. Reid that he wanted a say on both policy and process, an indication that he intends to push for a robustly liberal platform and an overhaul of the Democratic presidential nominating system that could eliminate superdelegates.There are also some personal grudges left over from the primary: Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign remains uneasy that two prominent Clinton supporters who fiercely attacked him \u2014 former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut \u2014 remain co-chairmen of the D.N.C.\u2019s Rules Committee.\u201cOf course there are hard feelings,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a liberal who is friends with Mr. Sanders but backed Mrs. Clinton.\u201cBut Bernie knows she will generally take the party and the country in the right direction \u2014 and there\u2019s the threat of Trump.\u201dAlan Rappeport, Nick Corasaniti and Yamiche Alcindor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orlando Gunman Was \u2018Cool and Calm\u2019 After Massacre, Police Say", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Mateen eventually made comments persuading them that \u201cthere would be an imminent loss of life,\u201d Chief Mina said, prompting the chief to end a three-hour standoff and order the assault that killed Mr. Mateen and freed dozens of people trapped in the club.Even as American military forces and intelligence agencies attack the Islamic State and other extremist groups, Mr. Obama said, \u201cone of the biggest challenges we are going to have is this kind of propaganda and perversions of Islam that you see generated on the internet.\u201dNew information also emerged Monday on Mr. Mateen, including frightening statements he made three years ago to co-workers at a local courthouse about being tied to terrorism, and that the resulting F.B.I. investigation was extensive, lasting 10 months.\u201cFirst he claimed family connections to Al Qaeda,\u201d which, like the Islamic State, is a Sunni Muslim terrorist group, James Comey, the F.B.I. director, said Monday. \u201cHe also said he was a member of Hezbollah,\u201d a Shiite group in conflict with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\u201cHe said he hoped that law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so that he could martyr himself,\u201d Mr. Comey said.\u201cOur investigation involved introducing confidential sources to him, recording conversations with him, following him, reviewing transactional records from his communications,\u201d and searching government records for mentions of him, the director said. \u201cWe then interviewed him twice. He admitted making the statements his co-workers reported, but explained that he did it in anger because he thought his co-workers were discriminating against him and teasing him because he was Muslim.\u201d16 PhotosThe F.B.I. closed the investigation, and Mr. Mateen continued working as a security guard for a private firm G4S.The Florida Department of Corrections revealed on Monday that before working for G4S, Mr. Mateen worked briefly as a state prison guard. Alberto C. Moscoso, a department spokesman, said that Mr. Mateen worked at Martin Correctional Institution from October 2006 to April 2007, but did not say why he left.The government of Saudi Arabia reported on Monday that Mr. Mateen had traveled to that country twice to make a religious pilgrimage known as the umrah. The Interior Ministry said he had visited in March 2011 for 10 days, and in March 2012 for eight days.Investigators were hunting for any indication that Mr. Mateen might have had help in planning or carrying out the slaughter, and they continued combing through the battered, blood-spattered wreckage of Pulse for clues.\u201cSo far, we see no indication that this was part of a plot directed from outside the United States,\u201d Mr. Comey said.\u201cIf I knew 1 percent about what he was doing, I would have called the F.B.I.,\u201d the elder Mr. Mateen said. \u201cHe went against my principles as a father and as a U.S. citizen.\u201dChief Mina said that an off-duty officer who had been working at Pulse responded to shots fired at about 2 a.m. Sunday. Additional officers rushed to the scene, he said, and entered the nightclub, where they engaged in a gun battle with Mr. Mateen, forcing him to retreat to a bathroom where officers believed he had four to five hostages. About 15 to 20 people were in another bathroom.Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.\u201cAt that time we were able to save and rescue dozens and dozens of people and get them out of the club,\u201d Chief Mina said. A SWAT team was called and took up positions in a bathroom across from where Mr. Mateen had taken cover.From that point, \u201cit kind of stabilized and the suspect had barricaded himself in the bathroom,\u201d and there was no shooting during the subsequent standoff, the chief said. Mr. Mateen called 911, beginning a series of calls and conversations with the police, in which he declared allegiance to the Islamic State, the terrorist group that has taken over parts of Syria, Iraq and Libya. The attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December also stated their allegiance to the group.\u201cHe was cool and calm when he was making those phone calls to us,\u201d Chief Mina said. \u201cWe had a team of crisis negotiators that did talk to the suspect, just trying to get as much information as possible, and they focused on what they could do to resolve the situation.\u201dBut, he added, \u201che really wasn\u2019t asking for a lot and we were doing most of the asking.\u201d Asked about reports that Mr. Mateen was laughing or celebrating, the chief said there was no sign of that in the phone conversations.\u201cThere was talk about bomb vests, about explosives, throughout,\u201d and eventually \u201cthere were statements made about imminent loss of life.\u201dLaw enforcement officials decided to mount an assault on the club, but an explosive placed on the wall did not penetrate completely, so officers used an armored vehicle to punch a hole about two feet off the ground, allowing hostages to flee, the chief said. Mr. Mateen also came through the breach in the wall, Chief Mina said, and was killed in a shootout with the police.When asked during the news conference if there was a chance that people might have been struck by friendly fire or in the crossfire, Chief Mina said: \u201cI will say that is all part of the investigation. But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, their backdrop was a concrete wall. And they were being fired upon, so that is all part of the investigation.\u201dAt hospitals and gathering spots nearby, relatives and friends of the clubgoers who remained unaccounted for began to lose hope that their loved ones had somehow survived. And those who had already learned that their loved ones had died began to plan for funerals.\u201cI cannot imagine being one of the parents or knowing your loved one may be among the deceased and waiting to find out,\u201d Mr. Dyer said. The authorities adjusted the death toll on Monday, saying that the 50 people killed included the gunman. Orlando Health, which has a network of medical facilities in the area, said 43 victims remained in the hospital, including six who would undergo operations on Monday.Investigators continued on Monday to scour the crime scene for evidence and piece together the gunman\u2019s motive. Thirty victim witness specialists and crime reconstruction experts were on the scene, F.B.I. officials said.\u201cI don\u2019t know what caused this,\u201d said Mr. Mateen, speaking in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan. \u201cI did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart.\u201d\u201cMy son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents,\u201d he said.At Monday\u2019s news conference, A. Lee Bentley, the United States attorney for Central Florida, said the investigators had collected a large amount of electronic and criminal evidence and were trying to determine whether Mr. Mateen acted alone.\u201cIf anyone else was involved in this crime,\u201d Mr. Bentley said, \u201cthey will be prosecuted.\u201dThis partial list dates to 2007, the year of the Virginia Tech mass shooting.Joel Figueroa and his friends \u201cwere dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverybody was screaming and running toward the front door.\u201dGov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Monday that he had asked Mr. Obama to issue a federal emergency declaration for his state.\u201cYesterday\u2019s terror attack was an attack on our state and entire nation,\u201d Mr. Scott said in a statement. \u201cThis morning, I have asked President Obama to declare an emergency so that the full resources of the federal government can be made available for all those impacted by this horrific massacre.\u201dLizette Alvarez reported from Orlando, and Christine Hauser and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

{"Headline": "What College Sports Recruiters Can Teach Your Child", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Most children who play team sports will not win a college scholarship. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t learn something from collegiate coaches who spend countless hours evaluating high school athletes on and off the field. As it turns out, the advice head coaches have for prospective recruits will help any student succeed, even those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t plan to play sports in college.We spoke with several college coaches from a variety of sports about the qualities they look for in a student as they try to build a successful team. Here are edited excerpts of what they had to say.Nick Saban, head football coach at the University of AlabamaI tell my players to focus on what you have to do to succeed rather than the result itself. This is true if you want to climb Mount Everest, be the president of IBM or play for Alabama. I ask them: what are your goals, what do you hope to accomplish, and how is your behavior now helping you accomplish those goals? Whether we win or lose, there are technical aspects for every player, things that they did well and things that they did poorly. My focus is on improvement. One game doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t define success \u2014 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s momentary. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about consistency and performance.I always talked to my [own] kids after their games and looked for the life lessons that came from the things they did or other things that happened in the game. [As a parent] you can have these discussions or leave it to the coach.\u00c2\u00a0I think sometimes you need to prepare your child to respond to adversity: If I want to play more, then I need to work harder. Everyone is not entitled to an opportunity to play. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the way of the world. You have to earn your way.Think of [college] as a 40-year decision, not a four-year one. The life lessons learned at that institution will affect them forever.Gene McCabe, head coach of men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lacrosse at Washington and Lee UniversityWe all think our kids are the greatest but what is the reality? If your child is talented and loves it, be sure to provide them with competitive opportunities to grow their game and to gain exposure but keep it in perspective.Candidly, I worry about the money that is spent today on competitive youth sports. While families do need to engage in the process and attend tournaments and showcases, they do not need to do it all the time, nor should they take out a second mortgage on the house to pay for it.I always find it interesting to get a voicemail from a parent saying that their son is so busy that he can\u2019t call me himself. Until that kid picks up the phone, I assume they are not interested. When you see a kid who has taken ownership of the process, it tells you that, by and large, they will take ownership of other things in their lives, too.Audra Smith, head coach of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basketball at Clemson UniversityThe kind of athlete I\u2019m looking for is one who can handle adversity. Today, a lot of parents walk around with a safety net so their children won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get hurt or disappointed \u2014 but I want a tough player who understands that when I push them it\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s because I know they have the ability to be better. We need to help our children develop a little toughness so that when they experience toughness down the road, they don\u2019t shut down or shatter emotionally.Parents should look for a good youth coach who demands the best of their kids but is not over the top. \u00c2\u00a0Find a coach who fits your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality and who you feel comfortable with as a parent. So when your child says the coach is being tough, you can back up that coach and agree that maybe your child isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t playing up to his or her potential. That\u2019s what I tell my own daughter when she\u2019s disappointed after a game. Parents need to uphold a coach\u2019s authority, not undermine it.There are kids I don\u2019t recruit because I see their social media. When I see an inappropriate [post], like provocative pictures or inappropriate language, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a red flag. It not only tells me about the player, it also tells me that their parents are obviously not aware of what\u2019s going on in their teen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to have that backing from a parent if I have an issue with that child.Jeremy Gunn, head coach of men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soccer at Stanford UniversityThe biggest asset I look for on the field, past athleticism and skill, is intrinsic drive. The most successful student athletes that I have coached are the ones that, first minute or last minute, winning or losing, hot day or cold day, cup final or \u201ceasier game,\u201d show the same type of attitude. If somebody has that drive and work ethic, they will continuously grow and develop. As a coach you are not really recruiting the student athlete for today, you are recruiting who they are going to become and who you think they can be.Everybody has moments when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re upset and not happy with an outcome. As a parent you can either join in the complaining process or sensibly say to your kids, \u201cWhat do you think you can do about it? Or what can you do next time?\u201d When a child complains about their coach, you can either join in with the process or you can say, \u201cHave you spoken to your coach about this?\u201d to help guide them to take control of their situation.Being successful requires the same traits no matter what you do. If somebody is a good student, they have already shown perseverance and a desire to succeed. That means they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already learned certain skills that are going to make them a good athlete for us. I talk to our student athletes about Dr. Carol Dweck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on the growth mind-set, and explain that those are the types of people who are the foundations of our program. People who have been extremely successful have often been reinforced with the fixed idea that they are good and they are special. Then when they move up the levels, I think a great university can sometimes take a huge sledgehammer and smash their ego to smithereens. Now they are no longer top of the heap. They are no longer the superstar athlete. Based on the fixed reinforcement they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had their whole life, it logically follows that they are now bad and they are no good. So by educating people that it is a continuous journey, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to handle the situation in a more positive manner.Lisa Miller, head coach of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lacrosse at Harvard UniversityWe look for athletes who are also serious students, ones who are challenging themselves in the classroom by taking tough courses and doing well in them.With travel leagues, parents should ask themselves: What will my child be missing by not playing for our town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team or for their high school? While the players on travel teams are all close in age, in high school a freshman may be playing with a senior and vice versa. Kids learn social skills when they have to play with people of different ages and levels. Upperclassmen are learning to be leaders, and freshmen are learning to be part of a team\u2019s culture. These are skills that kids need to play at the college level and later on in the workplace.To play at an elite level, you\u2019re going to have to play at the club level. But you don\u2019t have to be on the road every weekend so that you\u2019re missing family vacations, not forming friendships with the kids in the neighborhood or giving up a chance to play another sport.Ninety percent of our athletes played multiple sports in high school. Multi-sport play reduces overuse injuries and exercises different muscles \u2014 but there\u2019s also a learning benefit. You might be the star lacrosse player but when it comes to basketball, you may be on the bench for most of the game. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good learning experience for a kid to have to sit on the bench. It puts them in another person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoes and teaches them empathy, which will make them a better leader and teammate.Tracey Bartholomew, head coach of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soccer at Columbia UniversityI think one of the things that kids don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle well is constructive criticism. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to process it when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t praiseworthy all the time. You want parents to be encouraging, but also not afraid to give constructive criticism. A coachable kid who can handle constructive criticism \u2014 that goes a long way.As children get older, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to teach them how to self-reflect. Instead of giving your opinion right away, ask them what they thought about the game. If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too hard on themselves, stop them and say, here are two or three things you did well and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to work on for next time. Help them learn to process it.We vet players by talking to their club coaches. I want to know: Is this the kid who after practice is by themselves, wearing their headphones, walking quickly off the field? Or is this the kid who picks up the cones and the pinnies and helps out? I want the kid who picks up the cones, who has that awareness of other people. In developing a team, I look for people who are not selfish. I honestly would take A- or B+ level talent but A+ characteristics because those people tend to rise when things get harder.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Idaho Town Is Rattled Months After Reports of a Brutal Assault", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byDIETRICH, Idaho \u2014 Anonymous phone callers from distant area codes have unleashed tirades of invective on the residents of this tiny rural town. Strangers cruise its paved and dirt roads, seeming to drive through just for a look. And come fall, Dean Grissom\u2019s 7- and 11-year-old grandchildren will be going to another school.\u201cTheir parents think the kids aren\u2019t safe,\u201d said Mr. Grissom, 57, who works for the Idaho Fish and Game agency. He said that sending the children to classes in Shoshone, eight miles away, was unnecessary in his view, but that he understood the parents\u2019 fears. A town he loves has been damaged.There is a lot of debate here about what happened at the town\u2019s only school on Oct. 23 after a football practice: an assault, a racist attack, bullying, a failure of supervision by school officials, or some combination. Hardly anyone disputes, though, that this town of 350 people has been shaken to the core.State and local prosecutors say that several white football players bullied and brutally assaulted a mentally disabled black teammate in a locker room that October day, shoving a coat hanger into his rectum while other boys held his arms.In addition, a $10 million federal civil suit was filed last month by the boy\u2019s adoptive parents, Tim and Shelly McDaniel, who are white. In it, they accused the school district and its administrators, trustees, employees and volunteers of failing in their legal duty to protect the McDaniels\u2019 son, who they say endured months of racist taunts, humiliation and physical abuse. After the locker-room attack, the boy required treatment at two hospitals for rectal injuries.\u201cThe school district and individual defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the harassment, humiliation, mental and physical abuse and mistreatment of the plaintiff by students of the district and thereby permitted and caused him to be bullied, beaten and raped,\u201d the lawsuit said.In big ways and small, the repercussions of both the crime and the family\u2019s response are already rippling out, no matter what happens in court or at the school, which has 245 students in grades K-12.Mr. McDaniel, 60, who has taught science at the school for 21 years, put the family\u2019s house up for sale last month and is looking for work elsewhere. The cars and trucks that sometimes slowly cruise by out front, he said, and the funny looks he gets around town have unnerved him and his wife, who is 51. On July 1, a state law allowing Idahoans to carry a concealed weapon without a permit will take effect, and Mr. McDaniel said he planned to be armed after that.\u201cIf I could be gone today, I\u2019d be gone,\u201d he said, sitting outside in the yard on a recent afternoon as dogs wandered about near chicken and goat pens.The legal terrain to come is a minefield in itself, education law experts said. Courts have generally recognized that school officials cannot be everywhere all the time, and have not typically held teachers, administrators or coaches legally responsible for occasional bullying. But that deference can fade when race, religion or disability is involved, said John Dayton, a professor of education law at the University of Georgia. In those cases, courts have sometimes tilted hard the other way, he said, if they find that a clearly vulnerable group or category of students was not sufficiently protected.Other education experts said the central question raised by the McDaniels\u2019 lawsuit \u2014 whether school officials should be held responsible for failing to stop a culture of bullying before it escalates to violence \u2014 had become harder to answer as new and different ways of bullying have proliferated.\u201cThe expectation of supervision has increased,\u201d said Ann E. Blankenship, an assistant professor of educational leadership at the University of Southern Mississippi. Technology, she added, \u201copens the door to bullying opportunities 24 hours a day.\u201dDon Heiken, Dietrich\u2019s mayor, has publicly called on the school to fire people involved in the football program, who he said must have been aware that bullying, if not outright racism, was getting worse. The boy, according to his parents\u2019 suit, was stripped of his pants on the bus after one football game, while other students took photos. He was \u201ccontinuously\u201d subjected, the suit said, to \u201cwedgies\u201d \u2014 his underwear yanked sharply upward, sometimes so violently that he came home with torn shorts.\u201cThey had to have known,\u201d Mr. Heiken said in an interview.It probably did not help, Mr. McDaniel said, that in a school where sports are hugely important, his son was unskilled at football. Unable to remember the plays, the boy was called offsides \u2014 crossing the scrimmage line before the ball was snapped \u2014 six or seven times in a row in a single game, his father said.Dietrich itself, about 35 miles from Twin Falls and about 60 miles from the resort community of Sun Valley, is changing and growing, which has become part of the discussion about what happened here. The population has doubled in the last couple of decades and is expected to double again even faster, according to a planning presentation made recently to the town council.Lynn Johnson, 78, said \u201coutsiders,\u201d as he called the wave of newcomers, were changing the town where he has lived for the past 42 years, and not always for the better. Both of the students charged as adults in the case \u2014 Tanner Ray Ward, 17, and John R. K. Howard, 18 \u2014 were relatively new to the community, for example. The defendant being tried as a juvenile has not been named in court documents.\u201cNeither of them boys are from Dietrich,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who drove a school bus and did maintenance work for the school for 17 years. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without them.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Ward declined to comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Howard did not respond to phone messages. The school superintendent and principal, both defendants in the civil suit, did not respond to emails and phone messages.Mr. Grissom, who lives just a few blocks from the school, said that he knew and admired the McDaniel family, and that he thought that admiration was shared in much of the town. That they would move away was one more piece of the damage, he said.\u201cPeople look at this and say a lot of people are prejudiced here,\u201d Mr. Grissom said. \u201cThey\u2019re not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementJune 28, 2016Phillip LongmanAvik RoySo why does Sanders oppose giving veterans those options?The common sense response of most Americans \u2014 and most veterans \u2014 was simple: Give veterans who can\u2019t get convenient care from the V.A. the option of obtaining that care from private doctors, hospitals and insurers.There are plenty of veterans who are happy with V.A. health care. And those who have been lucky enough to stay off the V.A.\u2019s waiting lists often do well. But why on earth would we deny other veterans the ability to seek care from qualified private providers, when those on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare can? Even the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s own employees enjoy a vast array of private health care and coverage options that are denied to the veterans they ostensibly serve.We hear a plethora of excuses from opponents of reform. Antagonists say that veterans can only receive good care in a closed system, in which veterans are forbidden to seek care from other sources. The naysayers shriek about \u201cprivatization,\u201d as if health care delivered by private physicians is something to be feared. And they claim that if some veterans seek care from private sources, those that prefer the traditional V.A. will receive inferior care.Those who are ideologically committed to believing that government services are always better than private services may be unwilling to consider evidence to the contrary. And leaders of public-sector unions oppose allowing veterans to seek care from private hospitals instead of public ones, because they\u2019d receive less income from workers\u2019 dues. But for everyone else, the right answer is obvious.\nMost Americans these days have never served in the military. Fewer still have received care in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or even known someone who has. This gap between military and civilian life creates an opening for a powerful array of interests intent on eroding public support for our veterans health care system. Giving veterans access to America\u2019s world-class hospitals \u2014 nonprofit institutions like Massachusetts General Hospital and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \u2014 is not a corporate conspiracy. Nor is it a conspiracy to give veterans the option of choosing alternative health plans, like those offered by nonprofit Blue Cross entities. We thoroughly reviewed the historical and scientific evidence regarding V.A. health outcomes. So did the independent assessment of V.A performance requested by Congress in 2014. Our conclusions and theirs were the same: that many veterans receive quality care from the V.A., but that many do not \u2014 especially those who are forced to languish for months on V.A. waitlists. Reforming the V.A. in these ways affirms plain common sense. It\u2019s supported by the best research on health reform. Most important, it upholds a fundamental American principle: that those who\u2019ve sacrificed to preserve our freedoms should themselves have the freedom to choose how and where they get their health care.\nBy 2034, the cost of V.A. health care under this scenario could be as high as $450 billion, compared to a baseline of less than $100 billion. Most of this exploding cost would come from veterans currently covered by private health care plans who would quickly switch to the much more attractive, taxpayer-financed package available from the V.A. How would Congress pay for this exploding cost? Mainline veterans service organizations like the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans have enough experience in Washington to know that all the new spending would crowd out funding for V.A.\u2019s core mission, which is to serve veterans who have service-related disabilities or who are indigent. Veterans hospitals and clinics would have to close to cover the cost of providing a very generous health care plan to vets who don\u2019t currently use the V.A. and who in most instances don\u2019t need or want the specialized model of care it offers. Most veterans advocates, including myself, strongly support the V.A.\u2019s making greater use of high-performing health care networks of private providers in areas where the V.A. needs to improve capacity and access. But these networks need to be tightly integrated and coordinated into the V.A.\u2019s existing model of care, both to control cost and, even more important, deliver the quality of care veterans deserve. \nWould privatization of V.A. health care improve the system or undermine it?\n"}

{"Headline": "Female Cinematographers, Not Content to Hide Behind the Camera", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byIt was the fall women\u2019s meeting of Local 600, the cinematographers\u2019 union, that kindled the idea. Gathered in the Nyack, N.Y., home of Ellen Kuras, an Oscar nominee who shot \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d female directors of photography, assistants and camera operators swapped stories of their trade \u2014 and the challenges of being underrepresented in it.\u201cYes, we need to talk about the fact that there are few women, because there are,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to advocate for people who are there. There have been women shooting, telling stories, for decades, at least. We are here!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re talking about breaking a longstanding cycle\u201d of hiring that favors men, said Rebecca Rhine, who was appointed the national executive director of Local 600 in December. Even choosing her as a leader, she said, is a sign that the union is open to change, \u201cand acknowledging that we have work to do,\u201d in broadening the ranks. Still, most of its executives are male.Women make up about 12 percent of Local 600\u2019s camera department roster, Ms. Rhine said. (The union also represents entertainment industry publicists.) The group is just beginning to compile the numbers for people of color among its ranks. \u201cYou can\u2019t have progress except by looking at the starting point,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThis is not going to fix itself passively.\u201dWhen Ms. Eakin graduated from film school, she said, she had little sense that her trajectory might differ from a male cinematographer\u2019s. She began her career in St. Louis a dozen years ago, then moved to New York and worked steadily on commercials, documentaries, television and features.But along the way, she said, she discovered that perceptions about her gender mattered. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption of incapability, a lot of times, when it comes to women, as opposed to the assumption of capability when it comes to men,\u201d she said.Women can still reach that level, she added, but have to shoot two $1 million movies before getting a $5 million assignment, and so on. \u201cThere\u2019s never a call like, \u2018You did great on your $5 million movie, here\u2019s a $100 million project,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy experience is that guys get to take the fast route.\u201dAs in most fields, the timing of motherhood and balancing its demands are added hurdles. \u201cProducers hear that you\u2019re due in February, and they don\u2019t want to hire you for a job that ends in January,\u201d Ms. Morrison said.Ms. Morrison shot \u201cDope\u201d while she was pregnant, and the HBO movie \u201cConfirmation\u201d while she was breast-feeding, so she found ways to pump on set. (Both were directed by Rick Famuyiwa.) Pregnancy, she said, should be \u201cviewed as working with a broken wrist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something that has take you out of the equation,\u201d she said.Sharing ways to navigate issues like these is one goal of the meetings held by Cinematographers XX. It\u2019s not affiliated with the union, although there is crossover; Ms. Eakin is a Local 600 member, and Ms. Rhine, the union director, said she viewed it and other sites as a complement to her work.Ms. Eakin said she hoped that Cinematographers XX, which has about 40 established directors of photography and 18 who are starting out, would serve as a resource for hiring: Producers and studios can no longer pretend they don\u2019t have access to any female cinematographers. Women must apply to join, and are vetted by Ms. Eakin and others; some have been turned away, or asked to update their production reels. For now, the focus is women who can work in New York or Los Angeles, although the group is allied with the International Collective of Female Cinematographers, which has over 150 vetted members. Ms. Eakin said Cinematographers XX and its Facebook group have already resulted in jobs for some members.Ms. Morrison, one of the few women registered with Local 600 as a director of photography (most are camera operators or assistants), said she was inspired to join Cinematographers XX because she saw studios and producers responding to the renewed discussion about the dearth of female directors. \u201cThis dialogue is having an effect,\u201d she said, though she added that she looked forward to the day when she could \u201cjust be referred to as a D.P.,\u201d and not a female D.P.Ms. Eakin said spotlighting the range and diversity of female cinematographers underscored their strength. \u201cEveryone can stop questioning whether women can command a set and a crew and be creative and technical at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can and we do.

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "New York Above 800 Feet", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "By Jake SilversteinPerhaps much of this history has been driven by crude competition \u2014 the fierce battle between the Chrysler Building and the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building (40 Wall Street), for instance, to be the World\u2019s Tallest Building, a fight the Chrysler won by a stunning coup de gr\u00e2ce: the last-minute addition of its secretly constructed spire, which nudged New York\u2019s altitude record up to 1,046 feet for 11 precious months until the Empire State Building topped out. But the city\u2019s architectural history cannot be reduced to gamesmanship. Something else is going on. Manhattan builds up because it cannot build out and because it cannot sit still. Those of its inhabitants who can afford to do so will seek to climb to higher ground.We are currently in the midst of another clambering epoch. The city has 21 buildings with roof heights above 800 feet; seven of them have been completed in the past 15 years (and three of those the past 36 months). In this special New York Issue, we explore the high-altitude archipelago that spreads among the top floors of these 21 giants. It totals about 34 million square feet in all, encompassing lavish living spaces, vertiginous work environments (during construction and after), elite gathering places. Visually, the experience of this new altitude feels different in kind from its predecessors, the peak uplifts of previous booms that topped out at 400, 500 or 600 feet. At 800 and above, you feel something unusual in a city defined by the smelly bustle of its sidewalks and the jammed waiting and inching and zooming of its avenues \u2014 a kind of Alpine loneliness. Every New Yorker knows the pleasant private solitude that can be found at street level, among anonymous crowds. This is something different: an austere sense of apartness inspired by achieving a perspective seemingly not meant for human eyes.Jake Silverstein is editor in chief of the magazine.By Michael Kimmelman\u201cWould you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?\u201d Harry Lime asked on the Ferris wheel in \u201cThe Third Man.\u201dJimmy Park, whose office is also on the 85th floor and who is a mountain climber in his spare time, put it another way: \u201cYou\u2019re looking down on something you\u2019re not in, and you feel you\u2019re a long way from where you need to be if you need to be safe. At the same time, there\u2019s something therapeutic about seeing great distances. It happens on planes, on mountains, on beaches. I\u2019ll have a meeting with a new client, and we\u2019ll gaze out the window and have this comfortable silence.\u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he went on, \u201cto the \u2018overview effect\u2019 that astronauts feel, which created the whole environmental movement. You realize how small you are and how big the world is.\u201dThe Old Testament declared every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low, in keeping with classical beliefs about proportion and balance. By the 18th century, awe, terror and exultation, previously reserved for God, passed over to geological phenomena like mountains and experiences like conquering peaks. Kant called it \u201cthe terrifying sublime.\u201d In the 19th, with new technology and the growth of cities, nature was rivaled by the man-made. The sublime became reachable by climbing to the top of a tall building.In this spirit, Richard Morris Hunt designed New York\u2019s Tribune Building, built in 1875, with its clock tower at 260 feet, competing with the spire of Trinity Church to be the tallest structure in the city. A quarter-century later, Daniel Burnham\u2019s Flatiron Building, at 285 feet, established a new ideal of tall and skinny, soon dwarfed by the 700-foot-tall Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower, just across Madison Square Park, which was itself outdone, in 1913, by Cass Gilbert\u2019s Woolworth Building, at 792 feet.The New York skyline found its Platonic ideal less than two decades later with the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. The Empire State\u2019s 204-foot mooring mast for passenger dirigibles, which never actually docked there, represented the mercantile equivalent of Trinity\u2019s steeple. As E.B. White wrote, the city skyline was \u201cto the nation what the white church spire is to the village \u2014 the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying that the way is up.\u201dIt was exclusivity of neighborhood, more than sheer height, that connoted status in Manhattan half a century ago: a 20th-floor penthouse on Park Avenue still signified the pinnacle of the social pyramid. Back then, real nosebleed altitudes, like 800 feet, belonged primarily to commercial, not residential, buildings. Skyscrapers advertised companies. Apartments alone couldn\u2019t cover the extraordinary cost of construction at such heights.That changed only during the last decade or so, once apartments in luxury buildings like 15 Central Park West fetched $3,000 a square foot and more. Suddenly, a very tall, very slender project on 57th Street, with a floor plate just big enough for one apartment, or maybe two, and needing far fewer space-hogging elevators than a commercial tower, seemed profitable to aggressive developers. Big-name architects were enlisted. As Carol Willis, the founding director of the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan, likes to put it, form follows finance.Height suddenly substituted for neighborhood as a signifier of status, partly because zoning regulations steered sky-high construction toward less restricted, mixed-use parts of the city, like 57th Street, which also offered money shots of Central Park, and partly because a target clientele of South Asian copper-mining industrialists and Russian oligarchs had little intention of living in their apartments. In any case, they didn\u2019t actually want neighbors. They wanted views. Developers promoted these buildings as de facto country estates, where the chances of encountering someone who isn\u2019t a paid employee of the building are vanishingly slim, and in-house restaurants serve only tenants, so that even eating out won\u2019t require actually going out.Many New Yorkers, infuriated by tax breaks given to these skyscraping potentates, picture themselves toiling in the long, skinny shadows the new towers will cast. But shadows aside, that\u2019s not entirely fair to the supertalls. Some people may not like their scale, but a handful of apartments in mostly nonresidential blocks of Midtown or near Wall Street are hardly the cause of gentrification and displacement. And there may be just a little xenophobia in the anti-supertall phenomenon. It\u2019s a good bet that more than a few wealthy Chinese, Indians and Arabs, like Jews before them, facing an impossible vetting process from co-op boards on the Upper East Side, elected instead to look down on them.In any case, 57th Street is now dubbed Billionaire\u2019s Row, and wealth has reached new altitudes. Advances in skyscraper technology have much to do with this. William F. Baker, who helped engineer the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 2,717 feet the world\u2019s tallest tower, recently explained the engineering behind life above 800 feet. Engineers, he said, who long ago figured out how to make sure skyscrapers won\u2019t topple over, are focused more and more these days on the trickier problem of making people inside feel secure. It\u2019s a challenge because very tall, very slim buildings are designed, like airplane wings, to bend not break. An average person starts worrying about movement in a high-rise long before there\u2019s anything approaching a threat to safety. Mild jostling that you take for granted in a car or train can provoke panic at 100 stories, even if you\u2019re still safer in the building than in the car.Incredible efforts now go into mitigating those effects. Today\u2019s superslender towers are outfitted with sophisticated counterweights, or dampers, and other movement-tempering devices, as they are also outfitted with elevators that speed tenants to their aeries but not so swiftly that you will perceive any troubling G-forces. Something around 30 feet per second seems to be an ideal velocity, suggesting there may be an ultimate height for luxury towers \u2014 not because we can\u2019t engineer a mile-high building but because rich tenants won\u2019t abide elevators that take several minutes to reach apartments for which they paid the annual expenditures of the Republic of Palau.Exceptional engineering requirements are said to account for a hefty portion of the cost of apartments in the supertalls, like 432 Park Avenue, presently the tallest apartment tower in Midtown Manhattan, and one of the costliest. Its exterior is a grid of concrete and glass, like an extruded Sol LeWitt, or a distended Josef Hoffmann vase (or a middle finger stuck up at the city, depending on your perspective). Giant twin dampers near the roof, the size of locomotive engines \u2014 with their own spectacular double-height views over the city \u2014 act like shock absorbers, providing ballast and discouraging chandeliers from tinkling and Champagne glasses from toppling over.But taste is tricky to legislate. Critics greeted the Chrysler Building with horror when it was finished, then held it up as a model of what skyscrapers should look like when a modern generation of glass and steel towers reshaped the postwar skyline and provoked fresh outrage. Looking back, we can see that 1950s landmarks like Lever House, by SOM\u2019s Gordon Bunshaft, and the Seagram Building, by Mies van der Rohe, are as beautiful and refined as any architecture in America, although in the following decades they spawned a million mediocre imitations, cluttering Manhattan and obscuring the originals\u2019 genius. This was the era of white flight and suburban sprawl, when Roland Barthes described New York as a vertical metropolis \u201cfrom which man is absent by his accumulation,\u201d and America\u2019s so-called towers in the park \u2014 those often unjustly maligned housing projects of clustered high-rises in poor neighborhoods, many on the margins of the city \u2014 were left to ruin. The ugliest skyscraper in town, long known as the Verizon Building, at 375 Pearl Street, a seemingly windowless behemoth, still looms over the Brooklyn Bridge. It went up in 1976, just after the twin towers, by Minoru Yamasaki, which New Yorkers loved to hate \u2014 until many came to regard them differently, and not just because of what happened on Sept. 11. At dawn and dusk, the sculpted corners of the towers captured sunlight, making orange and silver ribbons float in the ether. Now, 1 World Trade has risen from their ashes. The classic modernist skyscraper is fashionable again. Taste, like the New York skyline, remains an endless work in progress.Of the new buildings, I like 432, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, and the studied jumble of 56 Leonard, downtown (Herzog & de Meuron are the architects). They\u2019re designed with finesse, punctuating the skyline. Other buildings going up, like Jean Nouvel\u2019s 53 West 53rd, beside the Museum of Modern Art, and 111 57th Street, by SHoP Architects, promise to help tip the scales back toward an older ideal of the sophisticated, attenuated tower, crowded out by those decades of plug-and-play boxes.And corporate chieftains are no longer clamoring for glitzy new company towers. They\u2019re more in tune with millennials, who prefer repurposed buildings, street life and live-work neighborhoods. The architect Bjarke Ingels has recently envisioned a couple of New York towers that feature enormous, sky-high terraces, to bring something of the pleasures of being on the street into the ether.\u201cThe tendency has been to create a hermetic experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows, so you\u2019re incarcerated in a box,\u201d Ingels said. \u201cOutdoor space used to be considered a nuisance, which didn\u2019t contribute to the building\u2019s value, but I believe that\u2019s changing. I am starting to hear leasing people say they want outdoor space. That\u2019s true in residential as well as commercial properties. I think the future at 800 feet is more likely to be engaged with the outside and less an escape from it.\u201dMaybe. In New York, it can get pretty windy and cold up there. For ages, my aunt has rented a studio apartment, a bit lower down, on the 16th floor of a building in Greenwich Village, with a terrace looking toward Washington Square Park and Lower Manhattan, although mostly the view consists of a jumble of low-rise buildings, black-tar rooftops and fire escapes. The terrace has a sun-bleached, green-and-white canvas awning that can be rolled out for shade. Voices and car horns waft up from the street. Rain splatters on the terra-cotta floor. Spring blows in on breezes from the river. I feel like the luckiest man in New York when I\u2019m there, above the city and in the middle of it.Everyone\u2019s sweet spot is different. I stood with Jimmy Park at his window in 1 World Trade, 1,000 feet up. He was extolling the view of Brooklyn and Queens. The roof of 7 World Trade, a neighboring 743-foot glass office tower, cleverly conceived by David Childs, was several hundred feet directly below us. We could just make out the mechanicals. Someone standing up there would have been one of Harry Lime\u2019s dots.I asked Park how tall he thought it was. He scrunched his forehead. He hadn\u2019t really thought about it, he said. \u2666Matthew Pillsbury is a photographer.

Then he led me south, through a lavish open-plan living room, where his partner, Tatyana Enkin, was preparing tea. The two are collectors of glass art, and the living room was dense with it: crystal swans and obelisks and lilac-and-purple baubles of various abstract shapes. LED strip lighting in the ceiling made the room glow blue, then red. \u201cLook at the World Trade Center,\u201d Estis said, pointing downtown. Finally, he led me west.But as he looked out the window his eyes flickered, a little irritated, at two new supertall condo buildings that tower above his, slightly blighting his west-facing view. To the right in the middle distance was One57, a blandly luxurious gray-blue monolith that rises to 1,004 feet and casts a significant shadow over the south side of Central Park; just to the right of that stood the even loftier 432 Park Avenue, pencil-thin and still unfinished. The design of 432 Park is more attractive than One57\u2019s \u2014 it resembles a neat stack of pale Rubik\u2019s Cubes \u2014 and its rapid rise has made it perhaps Manhattan\u2019s most noticeable skyscraper. When Estis moved into Trump World Tower in 2002, his year-old home was the world\u2019s tallest residential building. Now 432 Park dwarfs it.\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to an art gallery,\u201d Enkin said. \u201cThe painting has to be on eye level.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of being above it all?\u201d Estis said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on the beauty of the city and the various structures. Here you have the flavor.\u201dEstis is, much like the man who built Trump World Tower, thickset, restless, plain speaking and motivated by a desire to win. He grew up in Little Neck, Queens, his mother a legal secretary and his father a lawyer for the Veteran\u2019s Administration. At school, they asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. \u201cRich,\u201d Estis replied. He was 6. While in college, he rented an ice-cream truck and drove it around on an aggressive schedule \u2014 eight months out of the year. Soon after he graduated from law school he had enough money saved to buy his first piece of property: a two-family home in Bay Terrace, Queens. Now 57, he owns approximately 65 apartments and houses throughout Manhattan and Queens, and heads a 79-lawyer law firm.Enkin, like Trump\u2019s first and third wives, is an ex-model who grew up in the Eastern bloc. She was raised in Soviet Ukraine and worked as a hydrologist in the Siberian gulags before moving to the United States to become a model for the Elite agency and Marc Jacobs. Now 40, she works as an artist\u2019s agent.By living above 800 feet, Estis and Enkin are two members of an unexpectedly exclusive group in Manhattan. In my estimation, no more than 40 people currently live above that line, scattered among just three buildings (Trump World Tower, One57 and 8 Spruce Street, a Frank Gehry building downtown). But they\u2019re just the vanguard. The city is in the midst of another building boom, one unlike any that has come before. In the past, Manhattan\u2019s tallest buildings were filled with corporate offices; now, the most imposing skyscrapers are built as homes for some of the wealthiest people on the planet. By 2020 there are expected to be at least 14 residential skyscrapers in New York City. Many of them will block out the light for a great expanse of Central Park. A small city is being built in the sky \u2014 but for whom? I was curious to learn about them, so I set out to meet as many as I could.Estis and Enkin were the first I got in touch with, and the most hospitable. I lingered around their apartment for hours, until the sun was setting over the Hudson. The spires of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building suddenly illuminated, bathing the apartment in their light.\u201cWhen you\u2019re up there,\u201d Estis said, meaning the 432 Park penthouse, \u201cyou\u2019re missing this. You\u2019ll see lights. But not at this level. You never want to be level with, or looking down on, rooftops. There\u2019s no advantage.\u201d\u201cApparently that penthouse sold for $95 million,\u201d I said. The buyer has been reported to be the Saudi Arabian retail and real estate giant Fawaz Alhokair (432 Park\u2019s representatives declined to comment). He made his $1.37 billion fortune by bringing outlets of Western retail chains \u2014 Topshop, Banana Republic, Zara and Gap \u2014 to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus.Estis shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cThey get bragging rights,\u201d he said. Then he affected the smug tone of a 432 Park penthouse purchaser and added: \u201cI paid more money than anyone else in the building. But I may not have the best view.\u201dThe view may not matter in the end. According to Forbes, Alhokair lives primarily in Riyadh, so presumably 432 Park\u2019s penthouse will become just a pied-\u00e0-terre for him \u2014 or perhaps simply an investment property, destined to remain pristinely and forever empty.Tracking down the owners was a drawn-out process. I would make a trip to the New York City Registry to fetch the names and addresses of the limited-liability companies that made the purchases and try to contact them that way. For example, the top two floors of One57 make up a single duplex, Apartment 90, which sold for $100.5 million to an L.L.C. named, unhelpfully, P89-90 LLC. (It remains Manhattan\u2019s most expensive single residence.) The lawyer representing the L.L.C., Andrea Riina, emailed me, \u201cYour request was forwarded to the client and declined.\u201dI had slightly better luck with Apartment 90\u2019s downstairs neighbor, the owner of Apartment 88. In April 2015, it was sold for $47.3 million to Pac Wholly Own L.L.C., which is associated with a Chinese airline, Pacific American. The airline is owned by the HNA Group, which is in turn owned by the billionaire Chen brothers, Feng and Guoqing. After correctly predicting in the early 1990s that Hainan, a balmy island south of Beijing, would become a kind of Chinese Riviera, they started an airline to take passengers there. Soon, they amassed a fortune. According to a 2014 Bloomberg profile, Chen Feng is a \u201crigorously private\u201d man; apparently his brother is, too. I emailed Guoqing Chen\u2019s assistant several times before she finally responded: \u201cOne57 is a company investment program, and Mr. Chen doesn\u2019t live in One57 right now. So, I am afraid Mr. Chen can\u2019t take the interview. Thank you so much for your consideration.\u201d The rebuff knocked out Apartment 86 too. The L.L.C. that purchased it, One57 86 L.L.C., is registered to the same small downtown Manhattan office suite that houses Pacific American airlines.Apartment 83 is unsold, and the owners of Apartments 85 and 82 \u2014 the billionaire retailers and business partners Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, respectively \u2014 \u201cprefer not to be included in the article,\u201d their assistant wrote. Stroll, who made his money by investing early in Tommy Hilfiger, is Canadian but a resident of Geneva, according to Forbes. Chou \u2014 an early investor in Michael Kors \u2014 lives in Hong Kong.I had a good feeling about Apartment 81 (which lies slightly below 800 feet, but I felt I\u2019d earned it). For a start, there was a chance its owner actually lived there. The apartment cost $55.5 million and \u2014 according to The Times\u2019s real estate pages from the week of the sale \u2014 boasts a \u201cgalvanizing 75-foot-long entrance gallery,\u201d a \u201cgrand salon,\u201d four bedrooms, a \u201cone-ton bathtub carved from a single marble slab,\u201d \u201chead-on views of the park to the north\u201d and a concierge who can organize everything from \u201chelicopter service to the Hamptons\u201d to use of a quartz stone bed at a spa on a lower floor that has, apparently, certain healing properties. These apartments are marketed in grandiose ways. As Michael Graves, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman, told The Times in November 2015, \u201cLiving on a full floor at One57 is probably the closest thing to being a king in the 21st century.\u201d (To be pedantic, the world\u2019s 15 actual kings are closer to being kings than the residents of One57 are, though there might conceivably be some overlap.)The purchaser of Apartment 81 turned out to be a Texan named Becky Moores. Unlike her neighbors, she didn\u2019t conceal her identity. She bought it in her own name \u2014 well, in the name of the Rebecca Ann Moores Family Trust. She married her childhood sweetheart, John, in 1963. Forty-five years later she filed for divorce, hinting at infidelity. The divorce was messy and public and the payout vast enough to afford her not only Apartment 81 but a $34.3 million apartment on One57\u2019s 54th floor too. The settlement proved less fortuitous for fans of the San Diego Padres. John Moores was the team\u2019s owner, and to pay the settlement he had to sell his majority share. In the process, the payroll plummeted, and the star players Jake Peavy and Adrian Gonzalez were traded off to save money. \u201cUltimately, the team collapsed,\u201d says Tom Krasovic, a sports reporter at The San Diego Union-Tribune who covered the Padres for years. He seemed confident that Becky Moores would grant me an interview. \u201cI always found her to be a very nice lady,\u201d he told me over the telephone. \u201cShe\u2019s very well liked and very approachable with a lot of the media.\u201d\u201cBad news,\u201d emailed my contact for Moores. \u201cRebecca Moores isn\u2019t interested in participating in your story.\u201dSorting out who lives above 800 feet in Trump World Tower is slightly easier, thanks both to the tabloids and to the fact that it was built before this vogue for secrecy really took hold. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z used to live up there. They rented an apartment a few floors above Estis and Enkin for a year, paying a reported $65,000 per month. The former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter lived there, too. He sold his 5,500-square-foot apartment on the 89th floor, identical in shape and size to Estis and Enkin\u2019s, for $15.5 million in 2012. Nowadays, their neighbors include the widow of a Delta Air Lines pilot who made a fortune in the stock market, a human rights advocate from South Africa who specializes in health care projects for the developing world, the chairman of Assist America (a global medical-emergency service) and a mysterious Asian businessman who purchased the three remaining apartments all at once, paying in cash, according to Enkin. \u201cHe\u2019s Japanese,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know exactly what he does.\u201d (According to a resident and city records, his name is Chinh Chu. Chu works in finance and he is, in fact, from Vietnam. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)8 Spruce Street stands out among these new buildings because it\u2019s rental-only \u2014 none of the units are for sale. Only the top three floors sit above the 800-foot line. The resident of Penthouse South, on the very top floor, agreed to meet me.Penthouse South is tiny \u2014 so tiny it looks as if there has been some mistake. Its 453 square feet are inclusive of literally everything. It\u2019s so incongruous amid the huge penthouses it abuts that it feels almost magical, like the secret railway platform from which the wizards take the train to Hogwarts. It was designed to be a guest or nanny\u2019s room for one of the other penthouses, but building management rented it instead to Stellan Parr \u2014 33, tattooed, soft-spoken and studying to be a physician assistant. He pays rent \u201cin the low thousands.\u201d He is a unique man: perhaps the only person of (somewhat) modest means who lives at such heights in New York. We sat at his kitchen/living room/bedroom table and admired his view, which takes in the Statue of Liberty, the curve of the East River, 1 World Trade Center and the 9/11 Memorial pools. He opened his window a fraction, and we both suddenly experienced debilitating vertigo. He closed it, and the feeling immediately dissipated.As my elevator descended and my ears popped, it occurred to me that I would almost certainly never take in such a view again. And in fact, maybe nobody will, if these apartments wind up becoming empty investments.A few weeks later, via email, I received an enormous surprise. For the first time ever, a purchaser of an apartment above 800 feet in one of the mysterious new supertall condo buildings had agreed to speak with a journalist about his purchase. I was to meet him in his Fifth Avenue office on Thursday at 4 p.m.Howard Lorber is a 67-year-old New Yorker, balding, gregarious, instantly likable. He stood at his 52nd-floor office window, which looks out over \u2014 or, I suppose, under \u2014 his future home. His apartment will be on the 67th floor, he told me, 850 feet above the ground.\u201cI point it out to everyone who comes in here,\u201d he said.I mentioned my calculation that only a few dozen people currently live above 800 feet in the city. Lorber, who works in real estate, did his own calculation and said, \u201cOnce 432 Park is filled, there\u2019ll be 40 more.\u201dOn his mantelpiece were photographs of him with Donald, Ivanka and Melania Trump. \u201cI think Donald is fantastic, and he\u2019s going to beat Hillary and be the next president,\u201d he said. There was also a photograph of him with Mitt Romney. \u201cI should take that one down,\u201d he said.Lorber grew up in the Bronx. His father was an electrical engineer, and Lorber entered the work force by the time he was 13, \u201cflipping pizzas, pumping gas.\u201d He went to college but hated it, so he became a sociology major because someone told him it was the easiest way to graduate. Out in the world, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the sort of work he could find with a sociology degree, so he went back to college and learned accounting. He became a stockbroker, then moved into insurance. Eventually, he made enough money to buy Nathan\u2019s Famous, the hot-dog company. He\u2019s currently chairman of the real estate firm Douglas Elliman, the very same firm that is now selling the condos at 432 Park \u2014 hence, perhaps, his willingness to be interviewed. From time to time during our conversation, he lapsed into a kind of marketing autopilot: \u201c432 Park is an unbelievably striking building, it\u2019s like a masterpiece, it has to be the most talked-about and revered building in New York City. ... \u201d But I didn\u2019t mind the spiel because \u2014 given his expertise \u2014 he provided insightful answers to my lingering questions about the supertall boom.\u201cHow come Trump World Tower is so much less expensive than 432 Park?\u201d I asked.\u201cBy New York standards it\u2019s already an older building,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst Avenue in the 40s doesn\u2019t command the same price as Park Avenue in the 50s. It just doesn\u2019t. Everyone wants to live in the middle, as opposed to the ends. I guess Central Park is the equivalent of living on the water in the Hamptons. Then there are the ceiling heights, the amenities. ... \u201d (432 Park will have a restaurant, a fitness center and several floors of studios that the owners of the larger apartments can purchase as offices or for staff accommodation. When I walked into Lorber\u2019s office, he was complaining to one of his associates about the price of these studios. \u201cSeven hundred feet for $3 million, to house your staff?\u201d he was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d Still, he has reserved one for himself.)I recounted to him my lack of success at One57, how I was impeded in part by the impenetrable L.L.C. names. \u201cPeople do it for privacy,\u201d he said.\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit worked.\u201dI asked him about all the emptiness up there. Will those apartments purchased as investments by foreign billionaires really remain forever vacant?\u201cIt depends on the people,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome foreigners just want to get their money out of the countries they\u2019re in. They may or may not rent them, but it\u2019s not about making money. It\u2019s more a matter of wanting stability, to be in a safe haven, which they believe New York City is. Look around the world. Look at all the turmoil. Argentina\u2019s bankrupt, Brazil\u2019s in trouble. In China the prices probably went down 20 to 30 percent last year.\u201d But this, he added, was more an issue for One57 than for 432 Park. \u201cOne57 is geared more to foreigners; 432 Park is mostly domestic.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt ended up that way,\u201d he said. \u201cOne57 has a hotel in it. 432 Park doesn\u2019t. I think the foreigners like the idea of having a hotel. The locals like the privacy and the security of not having a hotel. And also, in fairness, One57 was on the market first. So they had the first shot at those people.\u201dThis last statement made me realize just how tiny a group this is \u2014 these foreign billionaires happy to spend tens of millions on New York City apartments they may never visit. It\u2019s a very small community, the superrich. In fact, when Lorber asked me who else I had interviewed for the story, and I mentioned Warren Estis, he broke into a huge smile and said: \u201cI know Warren very well! He\u2019s a client of the company! He\u2019s a fun guy!\u201dWhen I was at Estis and Enkin\u2019s apartment we got to talking about Trump and the hostility that follows him around. Trump World Tower was itself constructed amid much acrimony and division \u2014 a chaotic and upsetting experience for some neighbors and a bonanza for others. Taking advantage of the city\u2019s idiosyncratic \u201cair rights\u201d process, Trump quietly bought rights from the owners of several low-rise neighboring buildings \u2014 a church and a Japanese cultural center among them \u2014 until he had enough to build one gigantic tower. He undertook his maneuver with such stealth that none of the other neighbors, not even Walter Cronkite, knew what was unfolding in their backyards. When Trump\u2019s plans were finally revealed, Cronkite made an emotional petition to the city appeals board, calling the design \u201cdemeaning\u201d to the United Nations. \u201cHow can we allow an institution as important to the world and New York as the U.N. to be forever dwarfed by this outsize and illegal tower?\u201dA Trump executive, Abraham Wallach, responded by reminding the media that Cronkite himself lived in a 50-story high-rise at U.N. Plaza. \u201cPeople who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d he said.Before setting off for Trump World Tower, I emailed the Rev. Robert J. Robbins, formerly of the Church of the Holy Family, to ask what the church did with its unexpected $10 million air-rights windfall from Trump. He declined my interview request, citing \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s present high profile\u201d as the reason. One of Estis and Enkin\u2019s neighbors refused to let The Times photograph their apartment because they didn\u2019t want their name associated with Trump\u2019s in the current climate. For that reason, I felt concerned about mentioning his name to Estis and Enkin. But I needn\u2019t have worried. They are huge fans of his and intend to vote for him.\u201cHe\u2019s truly impressive,\u201d said Estis. \u201cHe gives off an aura of presence and he usually has very positive things to say to the individual he\u2019s talking to. He makes you feel good about yourself. He\u2019ll praise you.\u201d\u201cHow has he praised you?\u201d I asked.\u201cOne time I ran into him at the U.S. Open, and he was with a well-known name in New York real estate,\u201d Estis said. \u201cWe shake hands, and he turns to the builder-developer and says, \u2018Warren\u2019s probably one of the best lawyers in New York City.\u2019\u2009\u201d Estis beamed. \u201cAs I said, it makes you feel good.\u201dTrump does like to say things that make people feel good, though the question of their veracity is often tricky. Trump World Tower\u2019s public-relations agency repeatedly assured The Times that Estis\u2019s apartment lay 810 feet above the ground. But then I called Marshall Gerometta, an expert in skyscraper heights at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\u201cOnly the top residential unit is above 800 feet,\u201d he said. That\u2019s the 90th-floor penthouse, four floors above Estis and Enkin. His figure, he told me, came from a 3-D image of the building on Google Earth. When I raised doubts about his methods, he said that he had \u201cchecked dozens of buildings this way against the actual blueprints, and it\u2019s usually within a couple of feet of accuracy. I\u2019m kind of the go-to guy on this.\u201d (This is true: The Council on Tall Buildings is a respected source.)\u201cIs Trump known for exaggerating his buildings\u2019 heights?\u201d I asked.Gerometta replied that he didn\u2019t know about that, but he did know this: Trump was probably one of the first builders to skip floor numbers in order to inflate the total count. \u201cWhat he markets as the 90th floor is often actually the 72nd floor, just to make it sound more impressive.\u201d\u201cThe Donald,\u201d Gerometta said, laughing, \u201clikes to exaggerate.\u201d (Trump World Tower continues to dispute Gerometta\u2019s figures but has not produced blueprints or other evidence to the contrary.)For Estis and Enkin, the precise altitude of their apartment is ultimately immaterial. At sunset we sat at a west-facing window. The evening light filled the room, and Enkin had opened a bottle of Champagne. I suddenly remembered recent demonstrations at various Trump-owned skyscrapers across New York City.\u201cWas there an anti-Trump protest outside this building a couple of weeks ago?\u201d I asked them.Enkin smiled. Then she shrugged and said, \u201cYou only see the top of their heads.\u201d \u2666Christopher Anderson is a Magnum photographer and a recipient of a Robert Capa Gold Medal Award. By Helen MacdonaldBehind the tourists pressed against the perimeter fence, there\u2019s a man leaning back against the wall. Above him the stars and stripes flap languidly in the night air. I can\u2019t see his face in the gloom, but I know this is the man I\u2019ve come to meet because he\u2019s holding a pair of binoculars that look far better than mine, and his face is upturned to sky. There\u2019s an urgency to the way he stands that reminds me of people I\u2019ve seen at skeet shoots waiting for the trap to fire the next target. He\u2019s tense with anticipation.This is Andrew Farnsworth, a soft-spoken 43-year-old researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and I\u2019m joining him here in hope of seeing a wildlife phenomenon that twice a year sweeps almost unseen above the city: the seasonal night flights of migrating birds. I can\u2019t help thinking this is an absurdly incongruous place for a nature-viewing expedition. Apart from the familiar exceptions \u2014 pigeons, rats, mice, sparrows \u2014 we tend to think of wild creatures as living far from the city\u2019s margins, and nature as the city\u2019s polar opposite. It\u2019s easy to see why. The only natural things visible from this height are a faint scatter of stars above and the livid bruise of the Hudson running through the clutter of lights below. Everything else is us: the flash of aircraft, the tilt of bright smartphones, the illuminated grids of windows and streets.Skyscrapers are at their most perfect at night, full-fledged dreams of modernity that erase nature and replace it with a new landscape wrought of artifice, a cartography of steel and glass and light. But people live in them for the same reason that they travel to wild places: to escape the city. The highest buildings raise you above the mess and chaos of life at street level; they also raise you into something else. The sky may seem like an empty place, just as we once thought the deep ocean to be a lifeless void. But like the ocean, this is a vast habitat full of life \u2014 bats and birds, flying insects, spiders, windblown seeds, microbes, drifting spores. The more I stare at the city across miles of dusty, uplit air, the more I begin to think of these supertall buildings as machines that work like deep-sea submersibles, transporting us to inaccessible realms we cannot otherwise explore. Inside them, the air is calm and clean and temperate. Outside is a tumultuous world teeming with unexpected biological abundance, and we are standing in its midst.Wind-borne migration is an arthropod specialty, allowing creatures like aphids, wasps, lacewings, beetles, moths and tiny spiders hoisted on strands of electrostatically charged silk to travel distances ranging from tens to hundreds of miles. These drifting creatures are colonizers, pioneers looking for new places to live, and they\u2019ll make a home wherever they find one. Place a rose bush out on the arid environment of a top-floor balcony and soon wind-borne sap-sucking aphids will cluster on its stems, followed by the tiny wasps that parasitize them.Insects travel above us in extraordinary numbers. In Britain, the research scientist Jason Chapman uses radar systems aimed into the atmosphere to study their high-altitude movements. Over seven and a half billion can pass over a square mile of English farmland in a single month \u2014 about 5,500 pounds of biomass. Chapman thinks the number passing over New York City may be even higher, because this is a gateway to a continent, not a small island surrounded by cold seas, and summers here are generally hotter. Once you get above 650 feet, he says, you\u2019re lofted into a realm where the distinction between city and countryside has little or no meaning at all.During the day, chimney swifts feast on these vast drifts of life; during the night, so do the city\u2019s resident and migrating bats, and nighthawks with white-flagged wings. On days with northwest winds in late summer and early fall, birds, bats and migrant dragonflies all feed on rich concentrations of insects caused by powerful downdrafts and eddies around the city\u2019s high-rise buildings, just as fish swarm to feed where currents congregate plankton in the ocean.It\u2019s not just insects up there. The tallest buildings, like the Empire State, 1 World Trade Center and other new supertowers, project into airspace that birds have used for millenniums. The city lies on the Atlantic flyway, the route used by hundreds of millions of birds to fly north every spring to their breeding grounds and back again in the fall. Most small songbirds tend to travel between 3,000 and 4,000 feet from the ground, but they vary their altitude depending on the weather. Larger birds fly higher, and some, like shorebirds, may well pass over the city at 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Up here we\u2019ll be able to see only a fraction of what is moving past us: Even the tallest buildings dip into only the shallows of the sky.Though you can see migrating raptors soaring at altitudes well over 800 feet over the city during the day, most species of diurnal birds migrate after nightfall. It\u2019s safer. Temperatures are cooler, and there are fewer predators around. Fewer, not none. Just before I arrived, Farnsworth saw a peregrine falcon drifting ominously around the building. Peregrines frequently hunt at night here. From high-rise lookout perches, they launch flights out into the darkness to grab birds and bats. In more natural habitats, falcons cache the bodies of birds they\u2019ve killed among crevices in cliffs. The ones here tuck their kills into ledges on high-rises, including the Empire State. For a falcon, a skyscraper is simply a cliff: It brings the same prospects, the same high winds, the same opportunities to stash a takeout meal.I feel less like a naturalist and more like an amateur astronomer waiting for a meteor shower, squinting expectantly into the darkness. I try a new tactic: focusing my binoculars on infinity and pointing them straight up. Through the lenses, birds invisible to the naked eye swim into view, and there are birds above them, and birds higher still. It strikes me that we are seeing a lot of birds. An awful lot of birds.For every larger bird I see, 30 or more songbirds pass over. They are very small. Watching their passage is almost too moving to bear. They resemble stars, embers, slow tracer fire. Even through binoculars those at higher altitudes are tiny, ghostly points of light. I know that they have loose-clenched toes tucked to their chests, bright eyes, thin bones and a will to fly north that pulls them onward night after night. Most of them spent yesterday in central or southern New Jersey before ascending into darkness. Larger birds keep flying until dawn. The warblers tend to come earlier to earth, dropping like stones into patches of habitat farther north to rest and feed over the following day. Some, like yellow-rumped warblers, began their long journeys in the southeastern states. Others, like rose-breasted grosbeaks, have made their way up from Central America.Something tugs at my heart. I\u2019ll never see any of these birds again. If I weren\u2019t this high, and the birds weren\u2019t briefly illuminated by this column of light cast by a building thrown up through the Depression years to celebrate earthly power and capital confidence, I\u2019d never have seen them at all.Farnsworth pulls out a smartphone. Unlike everyone else holding screens up here, he\u2019s looking at radar images from Fort Dix, in New Jersey, part of a National Weather Service radar network that provides near-continuous coverage of airspace over the continental U.S.A. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a heavy migration night tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see those kinds of patterns on radar, in particular, those greens,\u201d he explains, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about 1,000 to 2,000 birds per cubic mile potentially, which is almost as dense as it gets. So it\u2019s a big night.\u201d After days of bad weather for birds wanting to fly north, with low cloud and winds in the wrong direction, a bottleneck of migrants built up, and now the sky is full of them. I watch the pixellation blossom on the animated radar map, a blue-and-green dendritic flower billowing out over the whole East Coast. \u201cThis is biological stuff that\u2019s up in the atmosphere,\u201d Farnsworth says, pointing one finger to the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s all biology.\u201dMeteorologists have long known that you can detect animal life by radar. Just after World War II, British radar scientists and Royal Air Force technicians puzzled over mysterious plots and patterns that appeared on their screens. They knew they weren\u2019t aircraft and christened them \u201cangels\u201d before finally concluding that they were flocks of moving birds. \u201cThat was their contamination, right?\u201d Farnsworth says of radar meteorologists. \u201cThey wanted to filter all that stuff out. Now the biologists want to do the reverse.\u201d Farnsworth is one pioneer of a new multidisciplinary science, fit for an era in which weather radar has become so sensitive it can detect a single bumblebee over 30 miles away. It\u2019s called aeroecology, and it uses sophisticated remote-sensing technologies like radar, acoustics and tracking devices to study ecological patterns and relationships in the skies. \u201cThe whole notion of the aerosphere and airspace as habitat is not something that has come into the collective psyche until recently,\u201d Farnsworth says. And this new science is helping us understand how climate change, skyscrapers, wind turbines, light pollution and aviation affect the creatures that live and move above us.New York is among the brightest cities in the world after Las Vegas, only one node in a flood of artificial illumination that runs from Boston down to Washington. We cherish our cities for their appearance at night, but it takes a terrible toll on migrating songbirds: You can find them dead or exhausted at the foot of high-rise buildings all over America. Disoriented by light and reflections on glass, they crash into obstacles, fly into windows, spiral down to the ground. More than 100,000 die each year in New York City alone. Thomas King, of the New York pest-control company M&M Environmental, has had calls from residents of high-rise buildings asking him to deal with the birds colliding with their windows during migration season. He tells them that there\u2019s no solution, but they can talk to their building manager about turning the lights off. It helps. Programs like the New York City Audubon\u2019s Lights Out New York have encouraged many high-rise owners to do the same, saving both energy and avian lives.Every year the \u201cTribute in Light\u201d shines twin blue beams into the Manhattan night as a memorial to the lives lost on Sept. 11. They rise four miles into the air and are visible 60 miles from the city. On peak migration nights songbirds spiral down toward them, calling, pulled from the sky, so many circling in the light they look like glittering, whirling specks of paper caught in the wind. On one night last year, so many were caught in the beams that the few pixels representing the \u201cTribute\u201d site glowed superbright on the radar maps. Farnsworth was there with the Audubon team that got the lights shut off intermittently to prevent casualties. They switched off the \u201cTribute\u201d eight times that night for about 20 minutes at a time, releasing the trapped birds to return to their journey. Each time the lights went back on, a new sweep of birds was drawn in \u2014 the twin towers made ghosts of light visited over and over by winged travelers intermittently freed into darkness before a crowd rushed in to take their place. Farnsworth is a lead scientist in BirdCast, a project that combines a variety of methods \u2014 weather data, flight calls, radar, observers on the ground \u2014 to predict the movements of migrating birds throughout the continental United States and forecast big nights like this that might require emergency lights-out action.The flow of birds over the observation deck continues, but it\u2019s getting late. I make my farewell, take the elevator back down the building and wander uphill to my apartment. Though it\u2019s long past midnight, I\u2019m wide-awake. Part of what high-rise buildings are designed to do is change the way we see. To bring us different views of the world, views intimately linked with prospect and power \u2014 to make the invisible visible. The birds I saw were mostly unidentifiable streaks of light, like thin retinal scratches or splashes of luminous paint on a dark ground. As I look up from street level, the blank sky above seems a very different place, deep and coursing with life.Living in a high-rise building bars you from certain ways of interacting with the natural world. You can\u2019t put out feeders to watch robins and chickadees in your garden. But you are set in another part of their habitual world, a nocturne of ice crystals and cloud and wind and darkness. High-rise buildings, symbols of mastery over nature, can work as bridges toward a more complete understanding of the natural world \u2014 stitching the sky to the ground, nature to the city.For days afterward, my dreams are full of songbirds, the familiar ones from woods and back lots, but also points of moving light, little astronauts, travelers using the stars to navigate, having fallen to earth for a little while before picking themselves up and moving on. \u2666Brian Rea is an illustrator and artist based in Los Angeles.Photographs by Jack DavisonCamille Sweeney is a journalist and a co-author of \u201cThe Art of Doing.\u201dBy Gareth CookAt last, the wind happens upon one of the supertall towers south of the park and reveals a far more wicked talent. It strikes the building\u2019s face and rushes for the edges, whipping off the corners and spiraling tightly, creating a columnar vortex that sucks at the tower\u2019s side and goes careering downwind. If air is moving quickly, these vortices form to a beat, pulling first one way, then the other. The gale is coming out of the north, but this force acts on the perpendicular, along the east-west axis, rocking the structure. Specialists call this the crosswind effect, and in certain circumstances, the rocking hits a building\u2019s \u201cnatural frequency.\u201d Imagine, says Derek Kelly, an engineer, that the hand of God were to reach down and gently pluck one of the skyline\u2019s spires: The skyscraper would vibrate back and forth, like a guitar string. That is a building\u2019s natural frequency. If it matches the crosswind tugs, the two are in resonance; the oscillations grow, like a child kicking on a swing. East then west, east then west. When a gale rolls in, a supertall will lean back, but it\u2019s nothing compared with the potential power of the crosswind effect.Today\u2019s engineers have conquered gravity: With enough structural steel and high-performance concrete, a tower will soar. The more dogged foe is wind. While gravity pulls down, wind can come from any compass point. It can apply pressure or suction, or alternate between the two. The wind, unlike gravity, changes from city to city, from season to season. Most harrowing of all is the wind\u2019s dynamism. It is changed by everything it touches, and the wind even shapes itself, with every current pulling on all its neighbors. Gravity is plodding and obvious, but give wind a chance, and it will gather itself together and riot.In the world of tall buildings, a novel kind of specialist has come to prominence: the wind engineer. As towers grow taller, they climb into more powerful winds, and lighter construction techniques can leave them more vulnerable. Developers have begun putting up very slender skyscrapers, like 432 Park Avenue in New York, and these are particularly sensitive to the aerial environment. When a wind engineer like Kelly looks at such a building, he understands that it is airborne, with one end pinned to underlying bedrock, the rest riding the winds of Manhattan.Kelly is a principal at RWDI, one of North America\u2019s top wind consultants. The company\u2019s client list includes 432 Park Avenue and 111 West 57th Street, a 1,428-foot skyscraper set to be among the slimmest in the world. (Imagine a one-foot ruler, stood on end and stretched to roughly twice its height.) When testing shows too much sway in an initial design, a near certainty with slender supertalls, RWDI offers a \u201cshaping workshop.\u201d The architect, developer and engineer make the trek from their home metropolis to the company\u2019s headquarters in Guelph, Ontario, with dibs for the day on a wind-test tunnel and a cadre of model makers so that ideas can be tried in the tunnel and improved upon. The goal is to find ways that the building might, as these specialists say, \u201cconfuse the wind.\u201d Designers of airplane wings want a smooth rush of air, to generate lift; designers of buildings want to divide the wind and leave it in disarray.Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, at 2,717 feet the planet\u2019s tallest man-made structure, is asymmetrical, winding down from the top in a series of steps, like an expanding spiral staircase. The crosswind effect depends on a building\u2019s width, and so at each level on the Burj, the wind beats at a different frequency: confused and frustrated, like a toddler kicking wildly on a swing that won\u2019t get going. Another favorite weapon of wind confusion, seen on many skyscrapers, is cut corners, which disrupt suction forces along the side. Pinnacles and antennas are subjected to the kind of scrutiny given America\u2019s Cup yachts. In the case of 432 Park Avenue, the design team used five gap layers, each two floors in height, where the facade opens to allow air to pass through, sapping vortices. These horizontal bands give the tower a visual rhythm, but they are there because of the wind. In the natural world, wind sculpts sand dunes and cuts the snow, carving rings where it has whipped around a tree. It leaves its marks on buildings too.If shaping and structural tweaks reach their limit, engineers can reduce motion further by installing \u201ctuned mass dampers\u201d near the apex. One version consists of an enormous mass on a suspension system with pistons that resist the mass\u2019s movement. The damper acts as a pendulum, but set just off the building\u2019s natural frequency, meaning that whenever the tower lurches, the mass drags, out of sync, steadying it. The 1,667-foot Taipei 101 is damped with a 728-ton ball that does double duty as a tourist attraction. From the observation deck, the ball appears to swing in heavy winds, though actually the tourists are also in motion.Hidden at 432 Park Avenue, some 1,300 tons of combined mass stroke away on two dampers. The building\u2019s engineer, Silvian Marcus, the U.S.A. director of building structures at WSP/Parsons Brinckerhoff, visited one of the top floors with a group and asked if anyone felt anything. No, they said. He rested a laser pointer on the floor, aimed it up and stood back. The dot wandered as the tower flexed. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable; we feel nothing,\u2019\u2009\u201d Marcus told me. With high-end damping, most people will not sense motion in normal weather. For supertall residential skyscrapers, tuned mass dampers are the rare luxury amenities that go unseen.Very tall buildings are a recent invention, and the public has not yet developed an intuitive sense for them. \u201cWe still have this innate understanding that a building we enter will remain stationary,\u201d says Melissa Burton, the global head of civil structures for BMT Fluid Mechanics. \u201cIt scares us when it moves.\u201d You can choose to make a home in the clouds, comfortably isolated from the elements, but you can never escape the wind. The walls, and everything they contain, will always be in motion. Most of the time, this will fall beneath your notice. Yet someday a storm will come, the wind will riot and you will feel its touch. \u2666Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.Photographs by Matthew PillsburyPhotographs by Thomas StruthThomas Struth is a photographer based in Germany who often examines the relationships between people and their modern environments. His photographs have been shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Museo del Prado in Madrid and others.By Taffy Brodesser-AknerJimmy Chin wasn\u2019t all that concerned with safety, to be honest; he was more concerned about the unknowns of rigging the first shots. He wanted to convey the \u201cairiness\u201d of being up that high; he wanted to convey the awe he knew that he would feel \u2014 the awe that motivates everything he does, whether photographing free climbers in Yosemite for National Geographic or dangling from unclimbed sandstone towers in Chad. He was mostly thinking that shooting straight down the spire \u201cmight not give you a sense of the actual spire,\u201d and how can you show how big the world is from up there with just one shot? He wanted the camera to swing out a little, and he was thinking of the best ways to do that. He settled on a long monopod, a six-foot pole, and that\u2019s about all he could think about. He had returned from China a few days before, coming home jet-lagged from another big shoot. The safety issue felt like a nonissue to him. This guy was part of the first ascent of the sharkfin at Meru, in the Himalayas. He skied from the summit of Everest. He\u2019d never climbed a skyscraper, but 1,776 feet in the air is nothing for him; 1,776 is usually what he calls a good start. And anyway, he had his very own safety liaison.All the time Walsh was lecturing, and during the entire six hours they were up there together, Chin was thinking what a good teacher Walsh must have been, back in Walsh\u2019s previous life, at that Philadelphia public school. But the school district was a mess, Walsh says, and when he was laid off four years ago, he didn\u2019t look very hard for another teaching job. A relative told him about FallProof, a company that teaches fall prevention, to head off lawsuits (and falls).Chin couldn\u2019t help noticing how patient Walsh was, how they seemed to speak the same language despite having such extraordinarily different backgrounds. For a minute, Chin could imagine Walsh doing both things, the climbing and the teaching. You know that old physics theory about a multiverse? In which there are infinite numbers of concurrent universes for every moment of the past and present and future? In the multiverse, there stands Jamison Walsh, patiently teaching the special-needs population of the city, and there is Chin skiing down Everest right this minute, every minute, thinking that that is probably the craziest thing he will ever do.This wasn\u2019t Walsh\u2019s first time up the spire; it wasn\u2019t even his second. The other times, he was on the clock for safety checks and needed to just get the job done \u2014 making sure the ladders and all the fall protection were in \u201ctiptop shape\u201d for the people who would be climbing later to service the weather barometers and the beacon for airspace, and eventually the array of antennas for local television that will be installed this summer, antennas similar to the ones that used to be on the World Trade Center. But this time, up there for hours with the sole purpose of letting the time pass, letting the light change and the clouds move for Chin\u2019s camera, he was able to really contemplate it, you know?They grew chatty over the hours. Walsh asked Chin about Everest, the only mountain he\u2019d heard of that Chin had climbed and photographed. Walsh told Chin about the rooftop he\u2019d recently been on in York, Penn., how he could see the mountains around him. They talked about the view from nearly 1,776 feet. They high-fived about what giants they were. Walsh tried to FaceTime with his poor wife, who gets nervous about what he does, who sighs with relief every time he walks through the door at the end of the day. \u201cWe\u2019re up here!\u201d he said into the camera. Chin will tell you that Walsh seemed a little giddy up there. The excitement took Walsh by surprise. \u201cIt was undescribable,\u201d Walsh said. Yes, being a safety liaison is mostly just a regular job, but sometimes regular jobs can burst your heart.There they hung, harnessed King Kongs, dangling off the building. As late afternoon descended and Chin\u2019s shutter clicked, Walsh watched the city, trying to wrap his head around the beauty of it. \u201cIt\u2019s simply whatever God produced,\u201d he said, trying to convey what it was like. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d He looked over at the Statue of Liberty, which was ant-size, and he looked over at Jersey City, for God produced Jersey City as well, and he watched the sunset. He thought about Sept. 11 up there. How could you not? At the base of the spire, construction workers had graffitied memoria for those they lost in the attack into the steel. Far down below were the footprints of the old towers and the reflecting pools, and people surrounding them at all hours, paying respects, wondering how we\u2019ve moved on so quickly that right next door there\u2019s a new tower now, taller even. If you were to believe in a multiverse, you could imagine that somewhere in a parallel universe, the people in the twin towers are still there doing their jobs as on any given day, scurrying through the halls with their papers and their tasks, at their terminals. But if you believe in a multiverse, you could also imagine that day when the people descended suddenly and unwillingly, how they jumped and fell \u2014 that day is happening on a loop forever, too. One World Trade Center rose up in spite of all that happened, and in our audacity or our hubris, we\u2019re going higher. As Walsh says, business is good.You couldn\u2019t even see them from the ground that spring day, Walsh and Chin. The sky darkened, and the city lit up, and Walsh looked up past Chin, past the crow\u2019s nest, and saw that there was not much left to go before the climb was complete. Eventually they came down off the spire, and they both signed the base. That night, Chin went to get a cheeseburger, something he can never do in the Himalayas. And that night, Walsh took the train back to Pennsylvania, and he walked through the door of his home once again, and his wife sighed relief and asked him about his day. \u2666By Sam AndersonWe want to see.What do we want to see?A large part of what we want to see, it turns out, is ourselves seeing.The photographer Brian Finke captured people capturing people \u2014 themselves and others \u2014 on top of New York\u2019s highest public observation decks: the Empire State Building, Top of the Rock and One World Observatory. Together, these skyscrapers attract around 10 million tourists a year. They are spikes of capitalist triumph: symbols of wealth, strength, power, transcendence.But humans are sensitive creatures. Even though these platforms are not, in the grand scheme of things, all that high \u2014 850 feet, 1,250 feet \u2014 the air is measurably thinner up there. Our lungs have to work a tiny bit harder to smuggle oxygen into our bloodstreams. We know, viscerally, that we\u2019re unlikely to survive a fall from such an inhuman height. It is both terrifying and giddy. We feel we are standing, temporarily, in a band of the sky; we are only visitors in this elevated realm, and won\u2019t stay long. Still, we reach up higher. We hold our cameras out at arm\u2019s length, or even beyond arm\u2019s length with selfie sticks, straining for every last inch of perspective, so that in the resulting photo, right there in the foreground of the panoramic expanse (the park, the river, the rival skyscrapers, the harbor), is the familiar spectacle of us: our Hawaiian shirts, our sunglasses, our babies packed snugly into their elephant-print slings, our tender, terrestrial faces. \u2666Design: Gail Bichler, Matt Willey.

{"Headline": "The Muslim Silence on Gay Rights", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAn Afghan-American Muslim walks into a gay club in Florida on Latin night during Pride Month. In my dreams, that is the beginning of another great story of remix, tolerance and coexistence that is possible only in America. In reality, it\u2019s the start of a nightmare massacre fueled by hatred and perpetrated by a man from a group already scarred by a generation of suspicion and surveillance.Whether Omar Mateen was a militant fighter financed by the Islamic State, a self-radicalized extremist or a lone wolf psychopath with a gun license, the distinction for committing the worst mass shooting in our history now belongs to an American Muslim.After the attacks in Orlando early Sunday morning, many of my American Muslim friends began posting messages on Facebook about how frustrating it felt to go from the affirming images of the late Muhammad Ali to news of yet another terrorist attack. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent us,\u201d many wrote. \u201cHe can\u2019t call himself a Muslim.\u201d For many American Muslims, this kind of immediate condemnation and social media activism has become the first step in our symbiotic relationship with the news cycle. As the history of fellow minorities has taught us, retaliatory violence, exclusion and even internment are always possible in the American family and it\u2019s best to try to get ahead of the curve.But in this moment of hashtag solidarity, I hope we can also have some tough conversations about our limits. Accompanying those posts, I saw many gestures of solidarity and sympathy for the L.G.B.T. community. But behind those posts is a history of silence on gay rights.For eight years, I was an editor and producer for NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d It seemed as if each week featured an example of \u201cMuslim\u201d violence and with it an opportunity to bring more nuanced perspectives and context to the discussion. Through highlighting the voices of Muslim reformists and liberals, I felt optimistic about a generation that could bridge our widening divisions.

For Lamar Allen, the comedian Steve Harvey is the exemplar: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis ability to admit mistakes, take ownership, his boldness, leadership and willingness to give back to the black community represents black masculinity.\u201d\u201cI wanted to bring the viewer into our story, our collective story,\u201d Mr. McFadden, 25, said. \u201cMany times African-American males are bunched into one category of masculinity and actually a category of toxic masculinity, a violent being, which is totally not true.\u201d\u201cWhen we see this repetitively we go along with this rhetoric and start to believe that,\u201d he added. \u201cWith this project I seek to tell the vast range of different stories and identity.\u201dMr. McFadden wants viewers to draw their own conclusions from the 30 subjects. There is little explanation. The texts include scribbled words reflecting their strain with the topic. His subjects range in age from 19 to 27 and were photographed in simple, muted light against a dark background, looking into the camera, unsmiling, as if pondering a deep question. The pictures of their fathers run the gamut: yearbook photos, military portraits, long-ago family snapshots, sometimes sharp, sometimes grainy. His subjects were asked to submit just one picture of their father and to write a definition of black masculinity, even if it did not mention their father. In fact, only a few made such direct references.Mr. McFadden doesn\u2019t mind vague.The photographs of the young men, their texts and the pictures of their fathers \u201cspeak to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe contemporary images combat and explain that they don\u2019t have to be exactly who their father was. They can take a stance on their own identity.\u201dAnd they do, even if they struggle to define it.\u201cBlack masculinity is a phantom to me,\u201d wrote Matt Cornwall, 21 (Slide 7), shown in a plunging neckline, loose-fitting shirt, his father in crisp suit and tie peering out alongside him. \u201cI personally try to move towards it and I can never fully grasp it. However, my parents are black and I\u2019m comfortable with the body I\u2019m in right now. That\u2019s perfectly good enough for me.\u201dPride permeates many of their statements.\u201cI don\u2019t see being black as a negative thing,\u201d wrote Jamel Jones (Slide 5). \u201cI get to be a part of a rich legacy of struggle and triumph. I\u2019m part of one of the most creative groups of people on the planet and a real leader of change. I\u2019m good with that. I\u2019m not going to let others color the way I view myself, my family and my history.\u201dMr. Jones, whose father is shown outdoors in a 1970s leisure suit, toasted him as \u201csuper diligent, loving and one of the most intelligent people I know.\u201dMr. McFadden got the idea after the Trayvon Martin case, in which a black teenager in a hoodie was gunned down in Florida by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch leader, in one of the first of a string of racially-charged cases involving the deaths of young black men.\u201cI began to think about me and my peers, in the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always thought about and heard about and our parents warned us about police brutality. But to see that, and then Michael Brown and all the videotaped shootings playing out, it kind of brought it into the now in my generation.\u201dMr. McFadden found his subjects largely by word of mouth among  friends and acquaintances.  The simple light \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he used a Phase One camera with an 85-millimeter lens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and straightforward look of the subjects were inspired by images of Frederick Douglass.There is one other entry in the project, where a young man wrote this: \u201cBlack people will continue to face oppression in this country but we must not let it stop us. We are powerful beyond measure. Please make an effort to be a positive role model in someone\u2019s life.\u201dThe words are Mr. McFadden\u2019s and they appear alongside vintage pictures of his father and grandfather.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to put myself in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the project is an extension of me anyways, I figured I needed to put myself in.\u201dBesides, he added, \u201cWe all collectively are trying to come to this idea of selfhood.

Sony has sold about 40 million PlayStation 4s, which are its latest generation of consoles, with Microsoft estimated to have sold about 21 million Xbox One consoles, according to SuperData Research.The console makers are also trying to keep ahead of technology trends, with virtual reality regarded as a promising direction.

{"Headline": "In the Fight for Transgender Equality, Winning Hearts and Minds Online", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionBut there has also been another force at play: Facebook.Many in the trans community will tell you that the social network has played an indispensable role in changing for the better what it\u2019s like to live as a transgender person in America. Despite much to be wary of about Facebook \u2014 its ubiquity, its invasiveness, its capacity to alter much about the national mood \u2014 it has also become a critical tool for visibility and equality, and may be one reason that mainstream attitudes toward transgender people are shifting so rapidly.But the experiences of transgender people on Facebook suggest that many of these assumptions aren\u2019t so open-and-shut. Scholars who study online interaction say that humans do feel empathy online. We can be moved by what happens on the internet and we carry what happens there to our interactions beyond it.Sometimes, unexpectedly, the internet redeems itself.That\u2019s about a tenth of the number of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual \u2014 a population so small it defies any obvious efforts to form a community based on proximity. What the numbers mean for transgender people and their families is geographical isolation: It\u2019s hard to find others nearby who are like you, and it\u2019s hard to get people who aren\u2019t like you to understand what it\u2019s like to be you.Ms. Neal, who lives in Wilmington, Del., said she felt at sea. \u201cI honestly had no idea children could be transgender,\u201d she said. Neither did the experts she consulted. \u201cFor every doctor and therapist we took her to, she was the first trans person that they had ever dealt with at that age.\u201dBridging people who are spread across vast geographies into a single community is of course the sort of problem the internet was practically created to solve.For lesbian, gay and transgender people, online interaction afforded another luxury besides mere connection. It fostered a middle ground between being secretive and being out, a safe space for testing out a new way of living.In the last few years, the number of Facebook groups for transgender adults and teenagers and for the parents of young transgender children has grown rapidly. One Facebook support group that Mr. Key belongs to has doubled from 2,000 members to 4,000 in the span of a few months, he said. A private group for the families of transgender children in the San Francisco Bay Area has grown to about 60 families in the last year, according to the group\u2019s founder, Lara, who asked that her last name not be published to protect the privacy of her 10-year-old transgender daughter.But little happens on Facebook without everyone else seeing it. So as more transgender people came to the social network to find others like them, other people on Facebook began to notice transgender people there, too. Mere visibility has had a positive effect.\u201cIt\u2019s not all about activism,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just being out there as a regular person, and being known as a normal person \u2014 to show that it\u2019s not salacious, that trans people are really just normal people who talk about movies and music and who post silly cat pictures, as normal as everyone else.\u201dThere have been no academic studies on the role that the increased visibility of transgender people online has played in helping to shift views about them. But there are clues from other research.\u201cWhat we found is there is a different kind of empathy produced online,\u201d Mr. Carrier said in an interview. In general, this \u201cvirtual empathy\u201d is not as strong as the sense of empathy we experience in face-to-face communication.But on domestic social issues, the perceived prevalence of a viewpoint changes the politics of it. The more visible gay people became in the culture and in straight people\u2019s personal lives, the more accepting the outside world became. That made it easier for more gay people to come out, which increased acceptance, and on and on in a feedback loop.That sentiment is not always obvious online. Transgender people and especially the parents of transgender children say that they see a lot of ugliness on Facebook directed at them. \u201cThose in the limelight in the LGBT \u2014 and especially T \u2014 world have to endure the worst of the internet: its comments sections,\u201d said Ina Fried, a transgender technology journalist who works for the technology news site Recode.But Ms. Fried, like many trans people, says that the costs of online visibility are far outweighed by the accelerating social acceptance.Ms. Neal, the mother of the 12-year-old Trinity, said that an elementary school classmate of hers had recently reached out to her on Facebook. \u201cHe was on the other side of this issue,\u201d Ms. Neal said. \u201cWe had never really talked to each other in school. But knowing me, and knowing that I had a trans child, that connected us. And me being vocal and advocating for my trans child made him realize, \u2018Maybe I\u2019m on the wrong side of history.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump has some advice for panicked Republicans in Washington who are melting down over his most incendiary statements: Man up.\u201cPoliticians are so politically correct anymore, they can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview Tuesday afternoon as fellow Republicans forcefully protested his ethnically charged criticism of a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against the defunct Trump University.\u201cThe people are tired of this political correctness when things are said that are totally fine,\u201d he said during an interlude in a day of exceptional stress in the Trump campaign. \u201cIt is out of control. It is gridlock with their mouths.\u201dEven as he chastised Washington\u2019s political class for a lack of backbone, Mr. Trump exhibited modest signs later on Tuesday that he was getting the message that some remarks \u2014 such as questioning the fairness of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel because of his Mexican heritage \u2014 crossed a line.While he did not apologize, he issued a statement that his comments on Judge Curiel had been \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d In a final Republican primary night victory speech, he struck a more conventional tone \u2014 at least for him \u2014 giving a more disciplined address using the teleprompter he has mocked while promising to make the Republican Party proud in the general election campaign.But anyone thinking that Mr. Trump is going to suddenly adopt a more cautious, strategic approach yearned for by election-conscious congressional Republicans is likely to be disappointed. He wrinkled his nose in disgust at the mere mention of the word \u201cpivot,\u201d though he conceded he wants to get on to broader discussion of the economy.In his view, it is clear that his way has worked and the establishment\u2019s has failed. After all, he vanquished every senator, governor or former governor who challenged him for the party\u2019s nomination.\u201cI disagree with a lot of things I\u2019ve watched in politics over the years, that\u2019s why I\u2019m running,\u201d Mr. Trump said over a meatball lunch he barely touched in the restaurant of Trump Tower. \u201cAnd that may make me less popular with politicians. But I have to be honest. I didn\u2019t get there by doing it the way a lot of these people do it.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Mr. Trump, arms crossed tightly across his chest during lunch, was aggrieved and considered some of the Republican pushback inappropriate and unhelpful \u2014 though he did not want to address specific critics. He insisted that he is anything but a racist and, with his usual rebuttal by the numbers, stressed that voters have rewarded his outspokenness with a record haul of primary votes while Washington is held in dismal regard.\u201cPeople want people to represent them who are going to stick up for what they believe in,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPoliticians have been very weak and very ineffective over the last quite long period of time.\u201dMr. Trump is also unhappy with the media, and noted that he is nearing the ability to reach 20 million people by himself through his personal Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, providing an alternative way to reach the public, even if it\u2019s largely a one-way conversation.His is a campaign like no other, conducted out of a luxury office tower in Manhattan named for its most prominent occupant, the presumptive nominee himself. A few floors below his personal office with a Trumpian view of Central Park is unfinished space being leased to his campaign team, a relatively skeleton crew of 80 or so running a national campaign.He is flabbergasted by critiques that he is woefully undermanned compared to the hundreds working for Mrs. Clinton, many just over in Brooklyn.\u201cTo me, that is smart,\u201d Mr. Trump said about his lean team, though he says he will soon increase his work force.As the primary season came to an odd close with him under Republican fire in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 an unheard-of spectacle in the last half century of presidential politics \u2014 Mr. Trump took some time to huddle with his campaign team. His daughter Ivanka, a trusted adviser, was close at hand, as was his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, his press secretary, Hope Hicks, and his special counsel, Michael Cohen.As he headed to the Trump Grill for lunch, tourists and workers hailed him, congratulated him and urged him on as they lined up to take photos with their phones.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.He posed with some women and looked back at a reporter to point at the women and boasted \u201cHispanics!\u201d Afterward, he bragged: \u201cThey say \u2018We love you, Mr. Trump. We\u2019re from Mexico.\u2019 \u201dAfter he was seated, the Secret Service erected a temporary partition to shield him from other guests.\u201cLook,\u201d he said, amused, \u201cwe put up a wall!\u201dThe uneasy relationship he has with Republicans in Washington \u2014 not to mention the antipathy for him among Democrats \u2014 may have worked for him during the primary campaign. But in the White House, like them or not, he will need them to deliver on whatever agenda he would pursue.Mr. Trump, who has for years contributed to and glad-handed politicians from around the country, believes he can be successful.\u201cI think I will get along with the politicians actually,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get the government moving. I\u2019ve done a lot of work on the other side of politics and I\u2019ve always gotten what I want.\u201d\u201cWe will see how it shakes out but I think it is going to shake out very well. I think people are tired of what is going on.\u201dEven as they express alarm over his tone and positions, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell have yet to abandon Mr. Trump despite pressure from some Republicans to do so. The two congressional leaders say they still share more with Mr. Trump\u2019s ideology than with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.So how does it feel to be the lesser of two evils?\u201cI don\u2019t think I am, for many people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe for some politicians.\u201dClearly, the real estate merger between Trump Tower and the Capitol is going to take more time.Advertisement"}

Elections for the next legislative session will be held in September, and the arrest comes about a month before the start of nominations.Mr. Leung, 60, said in a post on Facebook that commission officials came to his home about 6:30 a.m. on Thursday. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear in district court on Friday for a procedural hearing.Regarding the money, Mr. Leung said by telephone on Thursday afternoon, \u201cI gave to the party, to a publishing house, I can\u2019t recollect the memory, but I need to talk to a lawyer and defend myself now.\u201d He said he could not discuss the matter further because he had not yet talked to his lawyer.He pointed out that the charges came just ahead of nominations for election to the Legislative Council. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smear, you know,\u201d he said.\u201cI said before, if the government wants to press charges to anyone, they are capable,\u201d he added.In an earlier post on Facebook, he wrote, \u201cHe who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.\u201dMr. Simon, in an email, said, \u201cLegislator Leung is a uniquely positive presence in Hong Kong, and so as I have no idea what this is all about, it\u2019s best, for this rare occasion, I keep my usually wide-open mouth closed.\u201d He added that he had not been contacted by the anticorruption council.Legislative rules require lawmakers to declare donations within two weeks, and Mr. Leung has previously been cleared of wrongdoing in relation to other payments that were not immediately reported.According to a statement he made to a commission of lawmakers investigating the earlier donations, Mr. Leung admitted to receiving about $64,000 from Mr. Lai in 2013 on behalf of the League of Social Democrats, a party with which he is affiliated.Mr. Leung contended that he had received the cash from Mr. Lai on behalf of the party, not in his capacity as a lawmaker. Last December, the committee sided with Mr. Leung in saying that he had not violated the legislature\u2019s rules.Mr. Leung has declared receiving donations totaling about $115,000 in the current legislative session, which began in 2012, according to the legislature\u2019s records.Other lawmakers have declared the receipt of donations from Mr. Lai since at least 2007, according to the legislature\u2019s records.Charlotte Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}

That distinction had been reserved for the groom\u2019s mother, Janey Singer, who died in November at 62, two months after being diagnosed with lung cancer.The groom\u2019s sister, Ali Singer, said in an interview that the couple decided to marry quietly last year, in a hospice care center with Mr. Singer\u2019s mother.

Ms. Singer, who works in advertising at Facebook, helped take over the planning from her mother, and said she was inspired by words of support given to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, after Ms. Sandberg\u2019s husband died last May.The couple\u2019s ceremony was held Saturday at the Brant Beach Yacht Club on Long Beach Island, about two hours south of New York City.

Case for Guns", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Jose, Calif. \u2014 I\u2019LL never forget the first piece of safety advice I got when I began my transition from the male body in which I was born to the female body I now occupy: Carry a whistle. If I was attacked, I was supposed to blow it in hopes it would alert some do-gooder to dash into a dark alley to break up a brutal hate crime.The idea was not only preposterous, it was also insulting. The implication was that I, being transgender, wouldn\u2019t be able to save myself. But I didn\u2019t need a whistle; I had a gun.Since the attack in Orlando, Fla., many L.G.B.T. groups have been calling loudly for laws restricting gun ownership. But if anyone should be concerned about protecting the individual right to bear arms, it\u2019s L.G.B.T. people. We need to stop preaching nonviolence and voting for politicians who don\u2019t protect us.If you find yourself in a violent encounter, you\u2019re lucky if you get three seconds to react. If you want to save yourself, you have to go on the offensive. And a whistle isn\u2019t going to cut it.These are people who understand that if you\u2019re gay or transgender, you can\u2019t simply hope that laws will protect you. They won\u2019t. And you can\u2019t rely on the police. Orlando is proof you could bleed to death in the time it takes for them to stop the shooter.What happened in Orlando was not just an attack on America, it was an attack on L.G.B.T. people. While America at large debates what laws could have prevented this, what role Islam plays, and which political party is to blame, we need to get practical: If you don\u2019t defend yourself, no one else will.Most would agree \u2014 as do I \u2014 that violence is rarely the answer, and it\u2019s never a first line of defense. But when my friends tell me they\u2019d rather die than resort to violence, I tell them fine, I\u2019ll light a candle at your vigil. It\u2019s your choice. But those are the stakes. Don\u2019t kid yourself otherwise.I used to have reservations about people carrying guns in bars. But 12 states allow concealed carry in bars, and I haven\u2019t heard any reports of increased violence in those places. Now I can\u2019t help wondering how many victims in Orlando might have been saved if a few people inside the nightclub had had concealed carry permits, and been able to fight back.Many L.G.B.T. people view guns as evil \u2014 immoral killing machines that should be heavily regulated, if not eradicated. That\u2019s because they hear about guns only when the story ends tragically, or when they see them used in violent movies.This is a call to L.G.B.T. people to take their own defense seriously, and to question the left-leaning institutions that tell them guns are bad, and should be left to the professionals. Become a professional. You\u2019re allowed. That\u2019s what the Second Amendment is for. We can fight back when our lives depend on it.Nicki Stallard is a spokeswoman for Pink Pistols, an L.G.B.T. gun group.Advertisement"}

Hoping to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapture that resilient spirit of Lagosians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esiebo, 37, spent the past three years working on \u00e2\u0080\u009cHighlife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which documents the Nigerian city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynamic party scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe parties are a reflection of young people today \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money coming into more people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Esiebo, who grew up in working-class neighborhoods between Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe parties are diverse and have different statuses of people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt more than 30 parties, Mr. Esiebo aimed to capture a variety of events, ranging from six-figure traditional weddings to late-night street parties. Each of his frames seduces you, welcoming you into this world of momentary closeness. Sweaty bodies are illuminated by the familiar glow of disco lights. At other parties, Champagne bottles dazzle with sparklers as designer purses litter the tables. He also captured moments as tensions erupted at an overcrowded nightclub (Slide 19), but said he rarely encountered problems when he went out. He said he intentionally concentrated on the positive aspects of the party experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have this stereotype that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go out in the night, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esiebo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing how the street gets so busy, because people are out there partying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A look back at Andrew Esiebo\u2019s work on Lens.To ensure access to high-profile events, he said the D.J.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s became his gatekeeper, giving him free rein to glide through the crowds.Other Afropop hits dominating the party circuit, including Wande Coal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cAshimapeyin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and P-Square\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cShekini,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (above) are known for fusing traditional Afrobeat with hip-hop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with early inspirations from Fela Kuti, the Funkees and Tony Allen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNigerians are drawing inspiration from what they see through the media about parties in the other parts of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Esiebo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen they match it up with the spirit of Lagos.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat exactly is that spirit of Lagos? According to Mr. Esiebo, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spirit of never giving up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou keep fighting until you get what you want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

Daniel Radcliffe and the Art of \u2018Privacy\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe please ask that you turn your cellphones on.\u201dWhile Ms. Rourke, dressed in turquoise sneakers and a flowing cloak, worked on pace and rhythm, Mr. Graham, stubbled and wearing a beige surfer shirt, made notes that would likely result in new pastel-colored pages. The actors\u2019 scripts, an assortment of blue, yellow and pink, already resembled flattened Easter baskets.New interviewees, many of whom will appear as characters, include Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee; Randi Zuckerberg, the former market development director at Facebook; and Sherry Turkle, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology specialist in technology and intimacy, who was tickled to learn that she\u2019ll be played by the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alumna Rachel Dratch.Over a salad lunch in an upstairs office (\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much kale since we\u2019ve come to America,\u201d Ms. Rourke said with some bemusement), the creators discussed what inspired \u201cPrivacy\u201d and how they\u2019re altering it for New York audiences.Ms. Rourke, 39, and Mr. Graham, 33, both grew up in the north of England and describe themselves as private people, so private that they skitter around personal details and consented to share only a few pages from the play\u2019s script.Ms. Rourke wasn\u2019t always this way. \u201cA big part of my childhood was people telling me to stop showing off,\u201d she said. But she later came to embrace a culture in which \u201cit\u2019s quite rare for people to talk freely, openly and constantly about their feelings,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham\u2019s social introversion is even more acute. \u201cI used to be private to the point where it was actually hard for relationships, for friendships, for my family,\u201d he said. He\u2019s had to push himself to become more open, both in his work and in his personal relationships, a trajectory that mirrors the Writer\u2019s journey in the play. \u201cI began to understand there\u2019s only so far you can go unless there\u2019s openness,\u201d he said.For more than a year, they hosted \u201ca two-person book group, reading stuff back and forth,\u201d Ms. Rourke said. They learned about how the internet works, how corporations mine data to focus their advertising, how email has altered written communication, how social media transforms individual psychology.Speedily, they set about interviewing their initial experts. Mr. Graham used his natural shyness and sympathy to coax people into speaking freely. \u201cI do just want to listen,\u201d he said. Ms. Rourke then followed with \u201cthe smash-and-grab for the bit I know we\u2019ll need,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham assembled that testimony into the London version of the script, which also included satirical versions of themselves, a slightly paranoid playwright and a somewhat pushy director. For the New York production the director character has been dropped and the portrayal of the writer now seems less satirical.At first he squirmed while an actor portrayed him, but he came to feel that the character \u201cfelt like me. His paunch was a bit more pronounced than mine but the rest of it was pretty accurate,\u201d Mr. MacAskill wrote.Though Ms. Rourke and Mr. Graham said they were pleased by the enthusiastic response to the play in London, neither considered it finished. Ms. Rourke acknowledged that the original piece had been written with \u201can incredibly tight deadline\u201d and that there were \u201cnotes in the margins that we didn\u2019t get to address.\u201dTo help the piece to resonate with New Yorkers, they\u2019ve now interviewed some two-dozen United States experts. Ms. Rourke noted that, \u201cGenerally, the British are unconcerned about the state having their data but reluctant to share their personal histories.\u201d In America it\u2019s been the opposite. The number of audience interactions have been increased and there is a more graceful emphasis on the connections between the personal choices each individual makes (what to reveal to another person, what to disseminate online) and larger political trade-offs between liberty and security.During the London run, some critics complained that the play was ultimately too diffuse, that it didn\u2019t advocate strongly enough for any particular stance. That\u2019s one element that Mr. Graham and Ms. Rourke have chosen not to alter, in part because they\u2019re still making up their minds. If they are sometimes suspicious of technology, they are also reliant on it and sometimes excited and consoled by it.Besides, as Mr. Graham explained, the conversation around privacy and technology \u201cis moving at such light speed and it\u2019s going to evolve and change over the course of our lives.\u201d He has no interest in writing \u201cthe kind of play that makes its audience think \u2018we\u2019ve lost our freedoms, we\u2019ve lost our privacy, I\u2019m going to go down into the basement and wear a tin hat and never interact with anyone again,\u2019\u201d he said. Rather, he wants to spark discussion and debate.The conversation around privacy clearly engages Mr. Radcliffe, 26. Having been cast in the Harry Potter franchise as a preadolescent, the continuum between the private and the public is very real for him.\u201cPeople probably perceive me as someone who doesn\u2019t have very much privacy,\u201d he said during a rehearsal lunch break. \u201cI still feel like I have a lot and it\u2019s very important.\u201d To preserve this, he keeps away from social media platforms. He\u2019s never tried online dating; he doesn\u2019t Instagram his meals. (As he skipped lunch in favor of a black-currant drink and a cigarette, there may not be much to Instagram.)Mostly he finds this minimal online presence liberating. \u201cWhen I see my friends I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been up to, we can have a conversation about it,\u201d he said. But he clearly still worries about how much privacy he can and should maintain. When a reporter observed that he seemed far less neurotic than the Writer, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just masking that well,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of me in the character.\u201dDuring rehearsal that character is changing. The playwright is changing, too. As he has worked on the script, Mr. Graham has reduced his online presence, lessening his use of Twitter and Facebook. He\u2019s no Luddite, but he\u2019s thinking more deliberately about how he shows himself to the world \u2014 the online one, the real one.\u201cIt\u2019s about how much control do you have, how much consciousness do you have and how happy you are,\u201d he said, spearing another forkful of kale. \u201cThis show is not in any way trying to say throw your cellphones away.\u201dAn article last Sunday misstated the day that the play \u201cPrivacy\u201d was scheduled to begin performances. It was Saturday, July 2 \u2014 not Friday, July 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Few More Vegetables and a Little Less Meat May Reduce Diabetes Risk", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be a vegetarian to reap the benefits of a plant-based diet.New research shows that eating a few extra servings of healthy plant-based foods each day and slightly reducing animal-based foods like meat and dairy products can significantly lower your risk of Type 2 diabetes.The studies \u2014 the Nurses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Health Study, the Nurses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Health Study 2 and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study \u2014 asked participants to fill out more than 100 detailed questions about their eating habits. They provided information not just about the foods they ate but about how the food was prepared and even what cooking oils were used. While self-reported dietary information can be flawed, extra steps were taken to confirm the data. Participants completed questionnaires every two to four years, and the nutrient intake information was compared to tests of blood biomarkers to make sure they matched up. The results were also adjusted, or modified, to account for other characteristics that contribute to Type 2 diabetes, like being overweight.The research was also unusual in that it distinguished between healthful and unhealthful plant-based foods. Healthful plant-based foods include whole grains, fruits, vegetables nuts, seed and legumes, while an unhealthful plant-based diet could include refined carbohydrates like bagels and muffins, starchy vegetables like potatoes and French fries and sugary foods like cake and cola. Animal-based foods include meat of all kinds, fish and seafood as well as eggs, dairy products and animal fats like butter.On average, adults who ate a plant-based diet with few animal products cut their risk of Type 2 diabetes by 20 percent. But when researchers distinguished between healthful and unhealthful plant-based foods, they found that diabetes risk dropped by 34 percent among the healthful plant-based eaters. Notably, there wasn\u2019t a benefit to plant-based eating when a person consumed a lot of refined carbohydrates and starchy vegetables. In that case, a person\u2019s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increased slightly.While most American adults are omnivores, eating from many different food sources, and few are vegetarian, the research suggests that simply reducing the amount of animal-based food you eat from five or six servings a day to about four servings a day can lower the incidence of Type 2 diabetes. When people make these changes in diet, they usually cut back on red meat and processed meats and substitute healthier plant-based foods, including protein-rich ones like nuts, seeds and legumes, said Frank Hu, the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior author and a professor at Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about is a moderate shift \u00e2\u0080\u0093 replacing one or two servings of animal food a day with one or two plant-based foods,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Hu. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not talking about a dramatic change from being a carnivore to being vegan or even vegetarian \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a small shift, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doable for most people. You can still include some meat, but not have it in the center of the plate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Good plant-based foods are known to be rich in fiber, antioxidants, good fats and a wide array of micronutrients, and have been shown to improve glucose metabolism and lower inflammatory markers. But scientists say they also help promote the good-for-you bacteria that live in your gut.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we ingest food, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeding ourselves, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also feeding the bacteria in our gut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d  said Dr. Hu.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you switch from an animal-based dietary pattern to a plant-based pattern, after a while \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how long it would take, a few weeks or months \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the type of bacteria will also change.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe bacteria in the gut use components of plant-based foods like fiber for their own survival and growth. These components are metabolized by the intestinal bacteria, and the end products are short-chain fatty acids, which have been shown to have beneficial effects on inflammation, insulin resistance and overall metabolism. They also may send a satiety signal to the brain, so people feel fuller.When you eat refined carbohydrates and have less fiber in the diet, the healthy bacteria that metabolize fiber will be reduced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the short-chain fatty acids that would have beneficial effects in your body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Hu said.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "An N.Y.U. Study Gone Wrong, and a Top Researcher Dismissed", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byNew York University\u2019s medical school has quietly shut down eight studies at its prominent psychiatric research center and parted ways with a top researcher after discovering a series of violations in a study of an experimental, mind-altering drug.A subsequent federal investigation found lax oversight of study participants, most of whom had serious mental issues. The Food and Drug Administration investigators also found that records had been falsified and researchers had failed to keep accurate case histories.In one of the shuttered studies, people with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress caused by childhood abuse took a relatively untested drug intended to mimic the effects of marijuana, to see if it relieved symptoms.\u201cI think their intent was good, and they were considerate to me,\u201d said one of those subjects, Diane Ruffcorn, 40, of Seattle, who said she was sexually abused as a child. \u201cBut what concerned me, I was given this drug, and all these tests, and then it was goodbye, I was on my own. There was no follow-up.\u201dAt least one trial of marijuana, and one using ecstasy, are in the works for traumatized veterans, and some psychiatrists and many patients see this work as having enormous promise to reshape and improve treatment for trauma. But obtaining approval to use the drugs in experiments is still politically sensitive. Doctors who have done studies with these drugs say that their uncertain effects on traumatic memory make close supervision during treatment essential.The New York Times pieced together details of the research and the investigation through documents, letters and emails, as well as interviews with a participant and several researchers familiar with the project.The violations \u201cjeopardize subject safety and welfare, and raise concerns about the validity and integrity of the data collected at your site,\u201d the F.D.A. said in a letter, obtained by The Times, to Dr. Alexander Neumeister, the studies\u2019 lead investigator.Dr. Charles Marmar, the chairman of the psychiatry department at N.Y.U., said that people working with Dr. Neumeister had reported concerns about the lab\u2019s compliance with research standards. Once some of those issues were confirmed, Dr. Marmar said, the university placed Dr. Neumeister on leave, \u201cand suspended all activity, suspended access to all accounts. I took control of those studies.\u201d Dr. Neumeister later submitted his resignation.Georges Lederman, a lawyer for Dr. Neumeister, said there may have been protocol violations, \u201cbut N.Y.U. has taken the position that those violations were more egregious than we believe they actually were.\u201d The issues could have been easily remedied, he said, and noted that they did not cause the sponsor of the research, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, to shut it down.Both the university and Mr. Lederman said there was no evidence that any study participant had been harmed.Pfizer said that N.Y.U. was responsible for conducting the trial, and that the company had previously tested the same drug, known as an F.A.A.H. inhibitor, for osteoarthritic pain, without significant side effects. \u201cThe safety profile we observed does not preclude future development of our compound,\u201d a Pfizer spokesman said by email.The research team decided to use a drug intended to produce some of marijuana\u2019s effects, made by Pfizer, which financed the trial. Some participants took the drug over a seven-day period; others took a placebo pill. The N.Y.U. team performed scans on each person to see whether brain activation patterns correlated with symptom relief.The study called for recruiting 50 people with a PTSD diagnosis, according to study documents. Only 14 enrolled at the N.Y.U. site, according to federal documents, and many had participated in previous studies by Dr. Neumeister. One had completed a study of another drug 16 days earlier, when the protocol called for a 30-day window, according to the F.D.A.The federal inspection, from July 16 to Aug. 5 last year, found that the research team had failed to assess at least three subjects 24 hours after they had taken the experimental drug, contrary to study protocol, according to the F.D.A. letter. In several instances, the agency found, Dr. Neumeister had falsified documents by signing a fellow investigator\u2019s name on reports. \u201cHowever, in fact, you or another study employee actually conducted these study procedures,\u201d not the colleague, the F.D.A. concluded.\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI had flashbacks, returning nightmares, every symptom coming on full force, not to mention the withdrawal. After going off and back on four or five times, I told them, \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s when she was flown to New York to enter the trial.Ms. Ruffcorn said she had several odd symptoms after the trial, including a hyper, wired sensation that occurred without the usual memories of abuse. For months, she tried to find out whether those reactions were tied to the experimental drug, but because the study was shut down and the data belonged to Pfizer, the N.Y.U. doctors could not tell her whether she\u2019d taken the drug or a placebo.Earlier this month, after much persistence, she found out that she\u2019d taken the placebo. \u201cIt was a big relief,\u201d she said.Dr. Neumeister and N.Y.U. continue to disagree over the seriousness of the research violations, both sides said. But the university has tossed out all of the data as unreliable, and tracked down the study participants to check on their health, Dr. Marmar said.\u201cI honestly believed I had the best qualified and among the most ethical researchers on the faculty\u201d running these studies, Dr. Marmar said.Advertisement"}

The earth is on the brink of falling into a period of darkness for six days. Robots will soon conquer entire industries and eliminate the need for human labor.Censorship in China is a well-known phenomenon, with bureaucrats working assiduously to augment the stature of leaders and restrict discussion of topics deemed controversial, such as Tibet and Taiwan. But the Toronto researchers found that these faithful guardians of the Communist Party line have turned their attention to more mundane matters, devoting time and server strength to preventing rumors, fabricated news reports and superstitious premonitions from going viral.\u201cOnline rumors can be viewed as a kind of social protest by citizens skeptical of official news,\u201d explained Jason Q.

The posts were not selected at random; the researchers made a point of monitoring several dozen users who had a history of sharing what the Chinese deemed sensitive content.About four percent of those studied were censored, including musings on the safety of drinking water in China; speculation that several celebrities were on the verge of death; and supposition that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was undergoing secret medical treatment in China.Zhao Yulian, 36, a technology entrepreneur, was thwarted when she recently tried to share an article about tips to avoid getting cancer. \u201cAt some point,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to ask, Why is this sensitive information?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in a way, that is beside the point. The main threat of far-right attacks in recent years has come from men acting alone or in small groups. They may sympathize with fascist ideology, or they may have passed through the ranks of a far-right party at some point, but they are not acting on orders.Social media has extended the far right\u2019s reach. Sources tell me that Britain First has only a few hundred members. But its Facebook page has more than 1.4 million likes and churns out nationalist, Islamophobic and anti-immigration memes. \u201cSaying UK borders are secure, open to 500 million people,\u201d declares one meme, which displays a photo of the European Union\u2019s flag, \u201cis like saying my home is more secure with the doors and windows left open.\u201d Another shows Muslims praying in the street in London and asks: \u201cIs this what our war heroes died for?\u201d Many of these are widely shared \u2014 and they often echo the coverage of immigration and ethnic minorities found in much of the British press.This points to an uncomfortable truth: Far-right politics cannot be as easily cordoned off from the mainstream as people would like to believe. Fascists attach themselves to popular causes and drag the debate in their direction. Populists and parties of the center take note and then try to appeal to voters susceptible to the far right\u2019s messages by taking xenophobic positions of their own.People in Britain have been doubly shocked by Ms. Cox\u2019s killing because of its timing. The debate over our country\u2019s June 23 referendum on European Union membership has reached fever pitch and exposed new levels of xenophobia and hatred. The discussion over Brexit \u2014 among politicians and in the media \u2014 has often ignored wider questions about representation and democracy and instead focused on the issue of border security, frequently expressed in the most exclusionary, nationalist terms.Both sides are complicit in this to some degree. Whichever way the vote goes on June 23, politicians have said they will tighten immigration policy. But the faction of the pro-Brexit camp led by Nigel Farage and his nationalist UK Independence Party, or UKIP, has done its best to whip up fears. UKIP has sought to distance itself from fascist parties like the B.N.P. But its rhetoric carefully manipulates people\u2019s fears of immigration, while the party poses as the defender of ordinary people abandoned by an out-of-touch elite.The motive of Ms. Cox\u2019s killer will become clearer in the weeks to come. But it shouldn\u2019t take the death of a politician to alert us to the dangers of the politics of hate.Daniel Trilling is the author of \u201cBloody Nasty People: The Rise of Britain\u2019s Far Right.\u201d He is at work on a book about refugees in Europe.Advertisement"}

On the former, Mr. de Blasio often relied instead on the city\u2019s corporation counsel and Henry Berger, the mayor\u2019s special counsel; on the latter, he favored his top political aides. The person requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.More recently, Ms. Wiley was assigned to help craft the administration\u2019s legal response to the state and federal inquiries as well as to requests for the public disclosure of documents, notably emails between Mr. de Blasio and trusted advisers outside the administration.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio thanked Ms. Wiley for her service and congratulated her on her new role.The review board investigates allegations of misconduct by officers and makes recommendations for discipline to the Police Department.

It has been hard through the first half of this year \u2014 coddled as I am by my Democratic-leaning surroundings and Labour-leaning Facebook feed \u2014 to believe that either of two things could happen: Donald Trump winning the presidency, or Britain leaving the European Union. I was proved wrong in Thursday\u2019s referendum, and my confidence that America would not, in the end, elect Mr. Trump has been shaken.A vote for Leave was a vote for increased sovereignty, certainly, but also for a nationalism that we can ill afford in a time of increasing polarization, and that legitimizes and encourages the same elsewhere.Being part of the European Union has brought Britain closer to the other nations of Europe, and also to the rest of the world. It has widened our focus and our expectations, encouraging \u2014 and sometimes compelling \u2014 us to meet and accustom ourselves to difference to a degree that is not possible in Britain alone.Leaving will mean a contraction of ambition and empathy. Perhaps it reflects a desire for just that. But it\u2019s a loss that I feel deeply, and that I think leaves our world worse off than before, both in the decision itself and the precedent it sets.FERGUS McINTOSHBrooklynTo the Editor:While polling showed a close race in recent weeks, the news that Britain has voted to exit the European Union still comes as a shock and surprise. Alas, I can\u2019t help feeling that the vote was based on bigotry toward immigrants.David Cameron has announced that he plans to step down by the fall, which opens the door perhaps for Boris Johnson to be the prime minister. The future is unknown and unsettled, but those of us who are Anglophiles and love the United Kingdom will hope for the best \u2014 especially as the British people\u2019s decision could affect the rest of the world.JENNIFER DORN New YorkTo the Editor:Could I thank President Obama for coming to Britain and telling us to vote Remain? His exhortations, along with those of other foreign politicians, multimillionaire businessmen and bankers, helped persuade the British people that the wealthy Davos elite was interested in keeping Britain in the European Union for its own political and commercial reasons rather than for the good of the Brits.No American would tolerate being governed by a group of unelected bureaucrats with laws imposed on them by politicians of other countries. That is why we voted for Leave. The United Kingdom has now become a free, independent nation once again, and we will continue to work and trade with the whole world.We are pleased that, after the Brexit victory, President Obama said, \u201cThe United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States,\u201d which is a welcome change from his comments when he visited here that if we voted to leave, then we would be at the end of the queue to get a trade deal.DAVID BLENCATHRALondonThe writer, a former member of Parliament, is now a Conservative member of the House of Lords.To the Editor:It is perhaps not surprising that England, the birthplace of the Luddite movement, the group attempting to negate the social and economic disruption of the Industrial Revolution, voted to leave the European Union. After all, the emotions animating \u201cBrexit\u201d are very similar to those of their brethren two centuries ago: fear of rapid technological change, an uncertain future and, of course, the foreign \u201cother.\u201dBut history has shown how unwise and wrong that view was. Nevertheless, we should not ignore the desperation and anguish of those who fear for their way of life and a threatened future. I hope that imprudent and isolationist sentiments do not have similar disastrous effects here in America.PHILIP M. ROSOFFDurham, N.C.To the Editor:I think Thomas Jefferson would be very proud of the people of Great Britain, for as he said, \u201cA little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.\u201d And with 72 percent of the British electorate voting, I feel that Jefferson would be doubly happy knowing that the citizens of Great Britain took their civic duties seriously.Whether or not this is the right decision, only time will tell. But this historic vote demonstrated to the world that democracy does work \u2014 that through civil public discourse the body politic at large can make a well-informed collective decision that all parties can recognize as fair and just.NEIL J. BLUMGlenview, Ill.To the Editor:Dear Brits: We Americans want to congratulate you on your vote to exit the modern world. Now that your prime minister is resigning, you need a brave new leader who can Make Britain Great Again (ca. 1775?).We have just the man for you: He will round up all those pesky immigrants, he\u2019ll negotiate unbelievably good deals with those trading partners you just shoved off, and in a pinch he\u2019ll rebuild Hadrian\u2019s Wall.Quite frankly, we would appreciate if you could take him off our hands.

{"Headline": "Maria Sharapova Is Suspended From Tennis for Two Years", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported bySharapova, 29, said she had been taking Mildronate, whose active ingredient is meldonium, since 2006 to help manage a variety of health problems and was not aware that the drug had been banned.Sharapova faced a suspension of up to four years if the tribunal decided her doping violation was intentional. Because of her prompt admission of her violation, the I.T.F. said, the suspension will be backdated to begin on Jan. 26, and she will be eligible to return at midnight on Jan. 25, 2018.\u201cI cannot accept an unfairly harsh two-year suspension,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tribunal, whose members were selected by the I.T.F., agreed that I did not do anything intentionally wrong, yet they seek to keep me from playing tennis for two years.\u201dA four-year suspension could have been career ending, but if her ban is upheld, Sharapova, who has missed long periods on the tour because of injuries and has seen her ranking fall to No. 26, would be 30 when she returned to a sport in which Serena Williams and Roger Federer remain top players in their mid-30s.The International Tennis Federation appointed a three-member tribunal to investigate the positive doping test for meldonium by Sharapova.\u201cThe I.T.F. tribunal has found that Maria did not intentionally break its rules,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cMaria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban. Based on the decision of the I.T.F. and their factual findings, we hope to see Maria back on court and will continue to partner with her.\u201dThe Court of Arbitration for Sport has been sympathetic to tennis players in recent appeals. In 2013, the court reduced Viktor Troicki\u2019s 18-month ban for refusing to submit a blood sample to 12 months and cut Marin Cilic\u2019s nine-month ban for unknowingly ingesting a banned stimulant to four months.\u201cWe always viewed this as a two-step process, I.T.F. first, then C.A.S,\u201d John Haggerty, Sharapova\u2019s lawyer, said in an email.Haggerty said he believed the I.T.F. wanted to make an example out of Sharapova because she is a famous athlete and to send a message that the federation was tough on doping.\u201cI believe that at C.A.S.,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is made up of an arbitrator selected by Maria, one selected by the I.T.F. and a neutral arbitrator selected by C.A.S., Maria\u2019s suspension will be reduced and she will return to tennis sooner.\u201dSharapova and her representatives have said that her long-term use of Mildronate was to protect her health, not enhance her performance.Since January, more than 300 athletes, many from Russia and other Eastern European countries, have tested positive for meldonium, which is not approved for sale in the United States or the European Union but is sold over the counter in Russia and some other Eastern European countries. The Russian sports ministry, in particular, has been critical of the way the World Anti-Doping Agency handled banning meldonium, arguing that the drug was not performance enhancing.Last month, the Russian sports ministry said that most of its athletes had been reinstated after WADA issued new guidelines on the length of time meldonium takes to leave the body, and athletes were able to prove their positive tests had resulted from using the drug before it was banned.Such leniency was not available to Sharapova, who used meldonium after Jan. 1. The tribunal\u2019s report on the case said Sharapova admitted taking 500 milligrams of Mildronate before each of her five matches at the Australian Open, where she lost to Williams in the quarterfinals. The report also disclosed that meldonium was found in an out-of-competition test in Moscow on Feb. 2.The report detailed Sharapova\u2019s history using the drug, which dated to 2006, when she was 18. Mildronate was among 18 medications and supplements recommended by a Moscow doctor, Anatoly Skalny, to help Sharapova manage frequent illnesses by boosting her immune system. None of the medications were on WADA\u2019s prohibited list at the time.Sharapova worked with Skalny through 2012 and, according to the report, he regularly checked the WADA prohibited list to assure the compliance of his recommendations, which at one point grew to 30 substances.But Sharapova, overwhelmed by the number of pills, changed her approach to nutrition in early 2013 and continued to use only three medications: Magnerot, Riboxin and Mildronate, which she believed would protect her heart and manage her magnesium deficiency, the report said.Since 2013, the report said, the only members of Sharapova\u2019s team who knew she was taking meldonium regularly were her father, Yuri, and her agent, Max Eisenbud. Sharapova also did not disclose the use of the Mildronate or meldonium on any doping control forms since 2014, saying that she thought it was necessary only for substances she took daily.\u201cI did not feel it was a responsibility to have to write down every single match drink I was taking, gel, vitamin I was taking, even if I took it once during the last seven days,\u201d she is quoted as saying in the tribunal\u2019s report. \u201cI did not think it was of high importance.\u201dThe report called her failure to disclose her use of meldonium to antidoping authorities, her doctors, her coach, her trainer, her nutritionist or any other member of her team \u201ca very serious breach of her duty to comply with the rules.\u201d\u201cThis was a deliberate decision, not a mistake,\u201d the ruling said.Haggerty said that players were not required to list everything they were taking.\u201cFor 10 years Mildronate was not on the prohibited list, so Maria had no reason to hide her use of it,\u201d he said.The report repeatedly rejected Sharapova\u2019s argument that the I.T.F. failed to sufficiently warn her that Mildronate had been added to the banned list.WADA published its prohibited list for 2016 on Sept. 29. A summary of the changes to the list was posted on the I.T.F. website on Dec. 7. The WTA and I.T.F. sent subsequent emails in December that included links to the antidoping program, but, Sharapova argued, they did not mention changes to the prohibited list. The federation also issued a wallet card that lists prohibited substances and gave one to Sharapova\u2019s coach, Sven Groeneveld, in January, the report said.The report said that it was relevant to consider that Sharapova had used meldonium for 10 years before it was prohibited, but \u201cshe had a continuing duty to review the Prohibited List each year and from at least 2013 onwards did not take any steps to do so.\u201dEisenbud, a top agent for IMG, took the blame for what he called \u201can administrative error\u201d of not alerting Sharapova to meldonium\u2019s changed status. The tribunal found his reasons for failing to check the banned list even more dubious than Sharapova\u2019s.Eisenbud said he had a routine of checking updates to the WADA prohibited list during his annual family vacation in the Caribbean in November, but the trip was canceled last year because of his separation from his wife. The tribunal asked \u201cwhy it was necessary to take a file to the Caribbean to read by the pool when one email could have provided the answer.\u201dThe report put the responsibility squarely on Sharapova, saying if she had been more open about her use of meldonium, this situation could have been avoided. The tribunal, while confirming that she did not knowingly commit a doping violation, found \u201cmoral fault\u201d in her conduct.\u201cIt may be that she genuinely believed that Mildronate had some general beneficial effect on her heath, but the manner in which the medication was taken, its concealment from the antidoping authorities, her failure to disclose it even to her own team and the lack of any medical justification must inevitably lead to the conclusion that she took Mildronate for the purpose of enhancing performance,\u201d the report said.The tribunal conceded, though, that if Sharapova \u2014 or anyone on her team \u2014 had known that Mildronate was banned, she would have stopped taking it.The report concludes, \u201cShe is the sole author of her own misfortune.\u201dChristopher Clarey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Netflix Survive in the New World It Created?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "FeatureIt helped to develop all the new ways we watch TV \u2014 on-demand, bingeing, mobile. But the Silicon Valley company still has to keep reinventing itself.Supported byTed Sarandos, who runs Netflix\u2019s Hollywood operation and makes the company\u2019s deals with networks and studios, was up first to rehearse his lines. \u201cPilots, the fall season, summer repeats, live ratings\u201d \u2014 all hallmarks of traditional television \u2014 were falling away because of Netflix, he boasted. Unlike a network, which needs shows that are ratings \u201chome runs\u201d to maximize viewers and hence ad dollars, he continued, Netflix also values \u201csingles\u201d and \u201cdoubles\u201d that appeal to narrower segments of subscribers. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data about its customers\u2019 viewing preferences helped it decide what content to buy and how much to pay for it.Sarandos can be an outspoken, even gleeful, critic of network practices in his zeal to promote what Netflix views as its superior model \u2014 on-demand and commercial-free streaming, on any device. That glee was on full display in these remarks. For years, he said, \u201cconsumers have been at the mercy of others when it comes to television. The shows and movies they want to watch are subject to business models they do not understand and do not care about. All they know is frustration.\u201d That, he added, \u201cis the insight Netflix is built on.\u201dWhen Sarandos was done, Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chairman and chief executive, took the stage. A pencil-thin man, he seemed swallowed up by the empty ballroom. He squinted uncomfortably under the lights. He and a number of other Netflix executives had spent the morning at a meeting in Laguna, Calif., where a rare torrential rainstorm grounded air traffic, forcing them to make the five-hour drive to Las Vegas. They arrived only a few hours earlier. To make matters worse, Hastings was feeling ill.Haggard and tired, he stumbled irritably through his presentation. But as he neared the finale, Hastings broke out into a small, satisfied smile. \u201cWhile you have been listening to me talk,\u201d he said, reading from a monitor, \u201cthe Netflix service has gone live in nearly every country in the world but China, where we also hope to be in the future.\u201d Even though this was only a practice run \u2014 and even though it would be a long time before anyone knew whether global expansion would pay off \u2014 the Netflix executives sitting in the ballroom let out a loud, sustained cheer.They had good reason to celebrate. Netflix, since its streaming service debuted in 2007, has had its annual revenue grow sixfold, to $6.8 billion from $1.2 billion. More than 81 million subscribers pay Netflix $8 to $12 a month, and slowly but unmistakably these consumers are giving up cable for internet television: Over the last five years, cable has lost 6.7 million subscribers; more than a quarter of millennials (70 percent of whom use streaming services) report having never subscribed to cable in their lives. Those still paying for cable television were watching less of it. In 2015, for instance, television viewing time was down 3 percent; and 50 percent of that drop was directly attributable to Netflix, according to a study by MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the media business.All of this has made Netflix a Wall Street favorite, with a stock price that rose 134 percent last year. Easy access to capital has allowed the company to bid aggressively on content for its service. This year Netflix will spend $5 billion, nearly three times what HBO spends, on content, which includes what it licenses, shows like AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d and original series like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Its dozens of original shows (more than 600 hours of original programming are planned for this year) often receive as much critical acclaim and popular buzz as anything available on cable. Having invented the binge-streaming phenomenon when it became the first company to put a show\u2019s entire season online at once, it then secured a place in the popular culture: \u201cNetflix and chill.\u201dBut the assembled executives also had reason to worry. Just because Netflix had essentially created this new world of internet TV was no guarantee that it could continue to dominate it. Hulu, a streaming service jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Disney and NBC Universal, had become more assertive in licensing and developing shows, vying with Netflix for deals. And there was other competition as well: small companies like Vimeo and giants like Amazon, an aggressive buyer of original series. Even the networks, which long considered Netflix an ally, had begun to fight back by developing their own streaming apps. Last fall, Time Warner hinted that it was considering withholding its shows from Netflix and other streaming services for a longer period. John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX networks \u2014 and one of the company\u2019s fiercest critics \u2014 told a reporter a few months ago, \u201cI look at Netflix as a company that\u2019s trying to take over the world.\u201dAt the moment, Netflix has a negative cash flow of almost $1 billion; it regularly needs to go to the debt market to replenish its coffers. Its $6.8 billion in revenue last year pales in comparison to the $28 billion or so at media giants like Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. And for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being.Now that future has begun to take shape. The television industry last went through this sort of turbulence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when cable television was maturing. Previously, of course, television had been mostly transmitted via the public airwaves, and the major networks made the bulk of their money from advertising. But cable provided an indisputably better picture, and the proliferation of cable networks came to offer a much greater variety of programming. In time, consumers concluded that it was worth paying for something \u2014 TV \u2014 that had previously been free. This meant that in addition to advertising dollars, each cable channel received revenue from all cable customers, even those who didn\u2019t watch that channel. By 2000, 68.5 million Americans had subscriptions, giving them access to the several hundred channels the industry took to calling \u201cthe cable bundle.\u201dHastings knew the internet would eventually compete with that bundle, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how. And so he had to be flexible. Sarandos says that in 1999, Hastings thought shows would be downloaded rather than streamed. At another point, Netflix created a dedicated device through which to access its content, only to decide that adapting its service to everything from mobile phones to TV sets made more sense. (The Netflix device was spun out into its own company, Roku.) In 2007, even as Netflix\u2019s DVD-by-mail business remained lucrative, and long before the internet was ready to deliver a streaming movie without fits and starts, Hastings directed Netflix to build a stand-alone streaming service.So the company shifted to television. Cable networks like FX and AMC were developing expensive, talked-about dramas, the kind HBO pioneered with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Wire.\u201d But these series, with their complex, season-long story arcs and hourlong format, seemed to be poor candidates for syndication, unlike self-contained, half-hour sitcoms like \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d which can be watched out of order.Hastings and Sarandos realized that Netflix could become, in effect, the syndicator for these hourlong dramas: \u201cWe found an inefficiency,\u201d is how Hastings describes this insight. One of the first such series to appear on Netflix was AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men,\u201d which became available on the site in 2011, between its fourth and fifth seasons. Knowing from its DVD experience that customers often rented a full season of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d in one go, Netflix put the entire first four seasons of \u201cMad Men\u201d online at once. Bingeing took off.Television networks lined up to license their shows to Netflix, failing to see the threat it posed to the established order. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like \u2018Is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?\u2019\u2009\u201d Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, famously joked back in 2010. The occasional voice warned that Netflix would become too big for the industry to control, but mostly the legacy media companies viewed the fees from Netflix as found money. \u201cStreaming video on-demand\u201d rights, as they were called, hadn\u2019t even existed before Netflix asked to pay for them. And because the networks didn\u2019t understand how valuable those rights would become, Netflix got them for very little money.Everyone seemed to be a winner, including the shows themselves. In 2012, for instance, Netflix began streaming the first three seasons of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the dark drama produced by Sony that ran on AMC. Though praised by critics, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d had not yet found its audience.\u201cWhen the folks at Sony said we were going to be on Netflix, I didn\u2019t really know what that meant,\u201d Vince Gilligan, the creator of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d told me. \u201cI knew Netflix was a company that sent you DVDs in the mail. I didn\u2019t even know what streaming was.\u201d Gilligan quickly found out. \u201cIt really kicked our viewership into high gear,\u201d he says. As Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, put it to me: \u201c\u2009\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.\u201dThis was around the time that network executives started to recognize the threat that Netflix could eventually constitute to them. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d says Richard Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG who happens to be Netflix\u2019s most vocal proponent on Wall Street, \u201cwe wrote a piece saying that the networks shouldn\u2019t license to Netflix because they were going to unleash a monster that would undermine their business.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what seemed to be happening.Worse, they realized that Netflix didn\u2019t have to play by the same rules they did. It didn\u2019t care when people watched the shows it licensed. It had no vested interest in preserving the cable bundle. On the contrary, the more consumers who \u201ccut the cord,\u201d the better for Netflix. It didn\u2019t have billions of legacy profits to protect.Yet the networks couldn\u2019t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. Negotiations between a network or a studio and Netflix became fraught, as the networks, understanding the value of their streaming rights, sought much higher fees. In some cases, those negotiations broke down. The Starz deal, for example, was not renewed after it ended in 2012. (Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Starz, would later describe the original deal as \u201cterrible.\u201d)\u201cWe could see that eventually AMC was going to be able to do its own on-demand streaming,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cOr FX. We knew there was no long-term business in being a rerun company, just as we knew there was no long-term business in being a DVD-rental company.\u201dStill, Hastings was cautious. Producing original material is a very different business from licensing someone else\u2019s shows. New content requires hefty upfront costs \u2014 one show alone would most likely cost more than the $30 million a year Netflix reportedly once paid Starz for its entire library of movies. Developing its own series would thrust it into the unfamiliar business of engaging with producers, directors and stars. Back in 2006, the company set up a way to distribute independent films, called Red Envelope Entertainment, but it failed, and Hastings shut it down. (\u201cWe would have been better off spending the money on DVDs,\u201d he told me.) Now it was going to give original content another try \u2014 with much higher stakes.Sarandos had a show he was itching to buy: \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a political drama that was being pitched by David Fincher, the well-known director, and would star Kevin Spacey. Sarandos knew that, according to Netflix\u2019s vast database, many of the company\u2019s subscribers liked the kind of drama that Fincher and Spacey wanted to make. But algorithms alone weren\u2019t the deciding factor. He and Hastings figured that Fincher, who directed films like \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d would create a critical and popular sensation.In any case, Sarandos said, the potential reward vastly outweighed whatever financial and reputational risk \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d represented. \u201cIf it is a flop, we will have overpaid for one series,\u201d he told Hastings. \u201cBut if it succeeds, we will have changed the brand.\u201dIn winning over Fincher, Sarandos faced two other obstacles: a competing offer from HBO, which also wanted \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and the fact that no one had ever made a show for a streaming service before. For decades, when movies went straight to video without a theater run, they were ipso facto failures in Hollywood\u2019s view; for a seasoned director like Fincher, picking Netflix presented the same risk of marginalization. Sarandos overcame both by offering freedom and money. \u201cThere are a thousand reasons for you not to do this with Netflix,\u201d he told Fincher. \u201cBut if you go with us, we\u2019ll commit to two seasons with no pilot and no interference.\u201d Sarandos also offered Fincher a reported $100 million for 26 episodes, at the high end for an hourlong drama.The first season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d became available in February 2013. It was an immediate hit with viewers and critics. Five months later, Netflix posted the first season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d which Sarandos had ordered before \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d went into production. Critics lavished praise on the new show as well. Having begun its life as a Silicon Valley tech company, Netflix had somewhat improbably become a television network.Born and raised in the Boston suburbs \u2014 his great-grandfather was the wealthy investor Alfred Lee Loomis, who played a critical role in the invention of radar \u2014 Hastings, now 55, is one of those tech executives who came to California to attend Stanford (grad school for computer science in his case) and never left. The tech company he ran before Netflix was called Pure Software, which made debugging tools for software engineers. Before Netflix, Hastings had no experience in the entertainment industry.Although news coverage now tends to focus on its shows, Netflix remains every bit as much an engineering company as it is a content company. There is a reason that its shows rarely suffer from streaming glitches, even though, at peak times, they can sometimes account for 37 percent of internet traffic: in 2011 Netflix engineers set up their own content-delivery network, with servers in more than 1,000 locations. Its user interface is relentlessly tested and tweaked to make it more appealing to users. Netflix has the ability to track what people watch, at what time of day, whether they watch all the way through or stop after 10 minutes. Netflix uses \u201cpersonalization\u201d algorithms to put shows in front of its subscribers that are likely to appeal to them. Nathanson, the analyst, says: \u201cThey are a tech company. Their strength is that they have a really good product.\u201dIt is no surprise that Hastings, given his engineering background, believes that data, above all else, yields answers \u2014 and the bigger the data set, the better. \u201cThe worst thing you can do at Netflix is say that you showed it to 12 people in a focus room and they loved it,\u201d says Todd Yellin, the company\u2019s vice president of product innovation. He likes to note that customers will at most consider only 40 to 50 shows or movies before deciding what to watch, which makes it crucial that the company puts just the right 50 titles on each subscriber\u2019s screen. (All the data Netflix collects and dissects can yield surprising correlations: For example, viewers who like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d also often like the FX comedy \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d)There is another underappreciated aspect of Netflix that Hastings views as a competitive advantage: what he calls its \u201chigh performance\u201d culture. The company seeks out and rewards star performers while unapologetically pushing out the rest.One person who helped Hastings create that culture is a woman named Patty McCord. The former head of human resources at Pure Software, she was also Hastings\u2019s neighbor in Santa Cruz. She car-pooled to work with him and socialized with his family on weekends. \u201cI thought the idea for Netflix was kind of stupid,\u201d she told me. But she trusted Hastings\u2019s instincts and wanted to keep working with him. Her title was chief talent officer.The origins of the Netflix culture date to October 2001. The internet bubble burst the year before, and Netflix, once flush with venture capital, was running out of money. Netflix had to lay off roughly 50 employees, shrinking the staff by a third. \u201cIt was Reed\u2019s first layoffs,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was painful.\u201dThe remaining 100 or so employees, despite working harder than before, enjoyed their jobs more. McCord and Hastings concluded that the reason was that they had held onto the self-motivated employees who assumed responsibility naturally. Office politics virtually disappeared; nobody had the time or the patience. \u201cThere was unusual clarity,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was our survival. It was either make this work or we\u2019re dead.\u201d McCord says Hastings told her, \u201cThis is what a great company feels like.\u201dAs luck would have it, the DVD business took off right around the time of the layoffs. By May 2002, Netflix was doing well enough to go public, selling 5.5 million shares at $15 a share. With the $82.5 million Netflix reaped from the offering, Hastings started hiring aggressively again. This time, he and McCord focused on hiring \u201cfully formed adults,\u201d in their words, go-getters who put the company\u2019s interests ahead of their own egos, showed initiative without being asked and embraced accountability. Dissent and argument were encouraged, even demanded.For those who fit in, Netflix was a great place to work \u2014 empowering and rational. There are no performance reviews, no limits on vacation time or maternity leave in the first year and a one-sentence expense policy: Do what is in the company\u2019s best interest. But those who could not adapt found that their tenure at Netflix was stressful and short-lived. There was pressure on newcomers to show that they had what it took to make it at Netflix; those who didn\u2019t were let go. \u201cReed would say, \u2018Why are we coming up with performance plans for people who are not going to work out?\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. Instead, Netflix simply wrote them a check and parted ways.McCord also convinced Hastings that he should ask himself a few times a year whether he would hire the same person in the same job if it opened up that day. If the answer was no, Netflix would write a larger check and let the employee go. \u201cIf you are going to insist on high performance,\u201d McCord says, \u201cthen you have to get rid of the notion of retention. You\u2019ll have to fire some really nice, hard-working people. But you have to do it with dignity.\u201cI held the hands of people weeping, saying, \u2018I want to be here forever,\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. \u201cI would tell them, \u2018Nothing lasts forever.\u2019 I would say to Reed, \u2018I love them, too, but it is our job to be sure that we always have the right people.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2004, the culture was codified enough for Netflix to put it on a sequence of slides, which it posted on its corporate website five years later. It is an extraordinary document, 124 slides in all, covering everything from its salaries (it pays employees what it believes a competitor trying to poach them would) to why it rejects \u201cbrilliant jerks\u201d (\u201ccost to effective teamwork is too high\u201d). The key concept is summed up in the 23rd slide. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, not a family,\u201d it reads. \u201cNetflix leaders hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.\u201dAfter Hastings, the executive I spent the most time with at Netflix was Yellin, a former independent filmmaker who joined the company in early 2006, when he was in his early 40s. Yellin quickly distinguished himself by pushing back hard whenever he thought Hastings was wrong about something. \u201cThere was a culture of questioning, but I pushed the envelope,\u201d he says. He also helped develop a style of meeting that I\u2019d never seen before. At the one I sat in on, there were maybe 50 people in a small circular room with three tiers of seats, like a tiny coliseum, allowing everyone to easily see everyone else. The issue at hand seemed pretty small to me: They were discussing whether montages on the opening screen of the user interface would be more effective in keeping subscribers than still images or trailers. But the intensity of the discussion made it clear that the group took the matter very seriously. Various hypotheses had been tested by sending out montages to 100,000 or so subscribers and comparing the results with another 100,000 who got, say, still images. (This is classic A/B testing, as it\u2019s known.) Every person present had something to say, but while there were strong disagreements, no one\u2019s feathers seemed ruffled.One of my last interviews at Netflix was with Tawni Cranz, the company\u2019s current chief talent officer, who started under Patty McCord in 2007. Five years later, McCord, her mentor, left. When I asked her why, she visibly flinched. She wouldn\u2019t explain, but I learned later that Hastings had let her go.It happened in 2011, after he made his biggest mistake as chief executive. He split Netflix into two companies \u2014 one to manage the DVD business and the other to focus on streaming. Customers were outraged; for many, the move meant a 60 percent price increase if they kept both the DVD and the streaming service. With complaints mounting and subscribers canceling, Hastings quickly reversed course and apologized. In the three weeks following this episode, the price of Netflix shares dropped 45 percent, and Wall Street questioned the company\u2019s acumen. Hastings decided to re-evaluate everyone in the executive ranks, using the litmus test McCord taught him: Would he hire them again today? One of the people this led him to push out was McCord.\u201cIt made me sad,\u201d she said when I called to ask her about it. \u201cI had been working with Reed for 20 years.\u201d Netflix had just given the go-ahead to \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and McCord said she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to walk away in the middle of the next thing.\u201dBut she also felt a sense of pride. She was gratified that Hastings had taken her advice so thoroughly to heart.\u201cTed,\u201d Murray said, as they shook hands warmly, \u201cyou should get a promotion.\u201d He grabbed Sarandos by the lapels, pulled him close and added loudly, \u201cYou are the future!\u201d The two men laughed uproariously.From the time he arrived at Netflix in 2000, Sarandos has had the final say on both Netflix\u2019s licensing deals and its original programming. An Arizona native, Sarandos was working for a large video-retail chain when Hastings hired him to negotiate DVD deals directly with the studios. Sarandos had been in love with movies all his life: He worked his way through college by managing an independent video store. If he had chosen a different path, it\u2019s easy to imagine him having become a traditional Hollywood executive instead of an industry antagonist.At an investment conference late last year, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, which operates the Discovery Channel, articulated the case for having networks rethink their relationship with Netflix. Streaming video-on-demand platforms \u201conly exist because of our content,\u201d Zaslav said, in an obvious reference to Netflix. \u201cTo the extent that our content doesn\u2019t exist on their platforms \u2014 not to be too pejorative \u2014 they are dumb pipes. We as an industry are supporting economic models that don\u2019t make sense.\u201dSarandos, who had spoken earlier in the day, had clearly anticipated the criticism: \u201cZaslav says that we built a great business on their content,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. We did not renew their deal when they wanted a premium. So we replaced it with other programming that got us just as many viewers for less money.\u201dThose who think Netflix will come to dominate television have a simple rationale: Netflix has exposed, and taken advantage of, the limitations of conventional TV. The more time people spend on Netflix \u2014 it\u2019s now up to nearly two hours a day \u2014 the less they watch network television. \u201cOur thesis is that bingeing drives more bingeing,\u201d says Greenfield, the Wall Street analyst. \u201cOnce people start watching shows that don\u2019t have commercials, they never want to go back. Waiting week after week for the next episode of a favorite show,\u201d he says, \u201cis not a good experience for consumers anymore.\u201dStill, despite the rise in Netflix\u2019s share price over the past few years, the company has no shortage of doubters on Wall Street. Some distrust Netflix\u2019s numbers, arguing that millions of people no longer watch the service anymore but keep their subscriptions because they are so inexpensive. Netflix has announced that it will raise prices this year, and the Netflix skeptics believe the price increase will cause subscribers to cancel in droves. Other critics note the slowdown in the growth of domestic subscribers, by far the company\u2019s most profitable segment. In addition, Netflix, between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers, is spending more than it collects in revenue. How long can that continue?Finally, the pessimists point out that Netflix makes very little profit: In the first quarter of this year, for instance, Netflix had nearly $2 billion in revenue but only $28 million in profit. Despite the significant moves by Netflix into original programming, Wall Street still values Netflix more like a platform company \u2014 a business that uses the internet to match buyers and sellers, like Uber \u2014 than a content company, like a studio or a network. Its valuation is currently $5 billion more than Sony, for example. Hastings, who has been very blunt about the company\u2019s strategy of plowing money back into the business, has promised bigger profits sometime in 2017. Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a significant test of investors\u2019 faith in him.One of the most prominent Netflix skeptics is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank. In his view, Netflix\u2019s true advantage in the beginning was that it had the entire game to itself, and the networks, not realizing how valuable streaming rights would be, practically gave them away. He had a \u201cbuy\u201d on the stock from 2007 to 2010, he told me. But, he added, referring to those years when Netflix had streaming all to itself, \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, then it will attract competition.\u201dNow, he said, the networks and studios are charging higher fees for their shows, forcing up Netflix\u2019s costs. Netflix doesn\u2019t own most of the shows that it buys or commissions, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d so it has to pay more when it renews a popular show. In addition to the money it now spends on content, it also has more than $12 billion in future obligations for shows it has ordered. The only way it can pay for all of that is to continue adding subscribers and raise subscription rates. And even then, Pachter says, the networks will extract a piece of any extra revenue Netflix generates. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to think that Netflix can raise its price by $2 a month and keep all the upside,\u201d he said. \u201cI defy you to look at any form of content where the distributor raises prices and the supplier doesn\u2019t get more. That\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard.\u201cNetflix,\u201d Pachter concluded, \u201cis caught in an arms race they invented.\u201d He compared Netflix to a rat racing on a wheel, staying ahead only by going faster and faster and spending more and more: As its costs continue to go up, it needs to constantly generate more subscribers to stay ahead of others.And if that doesn\u2019t happen? If subscriber growth were to stall, for instance, then Wall Street would stop treating it as a growth stock, and its price would start falling. Slower growth would also increase the cost of taking on more debt to pay for its shows. The company would be forced to either raise subscription prices even higher or cut back on those content costs or do both, which could slow subscriber growth even further. Netflix\u2019s virtuous circle \u2014 subscriber growth and content expenditures driving each other \u2014 would become a vicious circle instead.Matthew Ball, a strategist for Otter Media, who writes often about the future of television, thinks the latter is more likely. He says that today, when you have a cable subscription, you have access to hundreds of channels \u2014 in effect, they all share you as a customer. The cable bundle puts you in a television ecosystem, and you flip from one show to the other depending on what you want to watch. In the emerging on-demand world, television won\u2019t work that way: All the networks will have their own streaming service and customers will have to pay a fee for every one. The days when networks could make money from people who never watch their shows will end.One consequence is that networks will have to have one-on-one relationships with their viewers \u2014 something they have little experience with, and which Netflix, with its ability to \u201cpersonalize\u201d its interactions with its 81 million customers, has mastered. Another consequence is that as streaming becomes the primary way people watch television, they are highly unlikely to pay for more than a small handful of subscription-TV networks. What they will want, Ball believes, is a different setup: companies that offer far more programming than any one network can provide. Netflix, clearly, has already created that kind of ecosystem. \u201cNetflix is ABC, it is Discovery, it is AMC, it is USA and all the other networks,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIts subscribers don\u2019t say, \u2018I love Netflix for Westerns, but I\u2019ll go somewhere else for sci-fi.\u2019 The old model just doesn\u2019t work in an on-demand world.\u201dIn this vision of the future, Netflix\u2019s most potent competitor is likely to be Amazon, which is also developing an extensive array of content, including many of its own original shows. Early on, it, too, produced a highly praised series, \u201cTransparent.\u201d It, too, has no allegiance to the cable bundle. And it has the kind of revenue \u2014 exceeding $100 billion \u2014 that neither the networks nor Netflix can approach. Compared to the networks, Netflix may have an imposing war chest, but in a fight with Amazon, it would be outgunned.According to Ball, what Netflix is counting on to maintain its primacy and to start making big profits is \u201cunprecedented scale.\u201d That\u2019s where the effort to create a global network, the one that was announced in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, comes in. In April, when the company announced its first-quarter results, it said it had added 4.5 million international subscribers. Yet success, and profits, are still some way off, as Hastings is the first to acknowledge.YouTube, he notes, is available in more than 50 languages; Netflix can be seen in only 20 languages. Netflix was primarily attracting people in its new countries who speak English as it races to \u201clocalize\u201d its service in each country. Netflix is ordering shows with an international flavor, like \u201cNarcos,\u201d but so far it has only a handful up and running. Netflix wants to make \u201cthe best Bollywood movie that\u2019s ever been produced,\u201d Hastings told an Indian publication; it wants to make Japanese anime; it wants to make local films for every market; it wants global rights when it licenses shows \u2014 something that, once again, contravenes Hollywood\u2019s conventional business model, in which rights are sold on a country-by-country basis. The company still has much to learn about each country\u2019s quirks and tastes and customs, and it will be a while before it can hope to earn a profit from its global customers.\u201cWhen we were in the DVD business,\u201d Hastings said, \u201cit was hard to see how we would get to streaming.\u201d Then it was hard to see how to go from a domestic company to a global one. And how to go from a company that licensed shows to one that had its own original shows. Now it knew exactly where it was going. \u201cOur challenges are execution challenges,\u201d he told me.Asked what the competitive landscape would look like five years in the future, he returned to the analogy he used earlier with the evolution of the telephone. Landlines had been losing out to mobile phones for the past 15 years, he said, but it had been a gradual process. The same, he believed, would be true of television.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a dramatic tipping point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you will see is that the bundle gets used less and less.\u201d For now, even as Hulu and Amazon were emerging as rivals, he claimed that the true competition was still for users\u2019 time: not just the time they spent watching cable but the time they spent reading books, attending concerts.And Hastings was aware that even after the bundle is vanquished, the disruption of his industry will be far from complete. \u201cProspective threats?\u201d he mused when I asked him about all the competition. \u201cMovies and television could become like opera and novels, because there are so many other forms of entertainment. Someday, movies and TV shows will be historic relics. But that might not be for another 100 years.\u201dJoe Nocera is the sports-business columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Still Want to Get the News on Facebook? Read All About It", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byIf you are among the 1.65 billion people who regularly visit Facebook, the news should not have come as a shock.Facebook tinkers with its algorithm constantly, fine-tuning the feed to keep users spending as much time on Facebook as possible. And, according to the company, most people Facebook has surveyed said they wanted to see more content shared by their friends and less from media publishers.But since Facebook detailed its plans, many readers have asked how to keep seeing the news they love in their feeds. Here\u2019s how to do it:\u25a0 Navigate to the Facebook page of a publication you want to regularly see news items from. Here\u2019s The New York Times, clearly something you\u2019d love to keep reading. Make sure the box marked \u201cLike\u201d is checked, which will signify you\u2019re following the page.\u25a0 If on the desktop, hover over the downward-facing arrow on the \u201cLike\u201d button with your mouse. A drop-down menu with a set of options should appear. If on your phone, just tap the \u201cFollowing\u201d button for a similar menu.\u25a0 On the desktop, you should see a label that says \u201cIn Your News Feed,\u201d which will most likely be set to \u201cdefault.\u201d That means what you see from The Times\u2019s Facebook page will rely largely on what the algorithm determines you should see, based on your history of interacting with content shared from The Times\u2019s official account.If you want to see everything The Times posts, click the \u201cSee First\u201d option instead. On a smartphone, just click the \u201cSee First\u201d option under the Following button on the page.\u25a0 If you want to dig deeper, click on the tiny pencil-like button to the right of \u201cIn Your News Feed,\u201d which will show you another list of options. From there, you can choose to be notified by pop-up Facebook notifications when The Times posts certain types of content, like photos or live video.That\u2019s it. From now on, you\u2019ll see every recent new item The Times posts at the top of your news feed since you last visited Facebook. This works for any news outlet with a Facebook page that you already follow, so just navigate to those pages to see all of that content as well.Here\u2019s the caveat: You may not want to see all the many, many news items that a publisher pushes out over a single day, which means clicking \u201cSee First\u201d isn\u2019t for you.Fear not. Part of the logic of Facebook\u2019s algorithm is that it is tailored to show you exactly the type of content you want to see, whether it\u2019s news items, baby photos or live videos. So in essence, the more you interact with news articles shared by the publishers you like \u2014 be it clicking on them and reading or resharing them in your own feed \u2014 the more Facebook will know that you want to see that type of content.In a nutshell, if you\u2019re already a news hound, just keep doing what you\u2019re doing and you\u2019ll probably keep seeing news from the publishers you follow.If not, enjoy your newfound wealth of baby photos.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Maxim Babenko was at a Russian military training base a few months ago, sitting among thousands of spectators at an air show. Looking around, he was impressed by the crowd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seemingly unconditional admiration for the pilots. The applause was riotous; dozens of people reached out just to touch the pilots; children posed endless questions to them about how they could one day fly a fighter jet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespite the fact that the flight was just a show, people were greeting pilots like \u2026 like national heroes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Babenko, a documentary photographer from North Caucasus in Russia, said through an interpreter. The sight of steely, disciplined pilots rendered nonplused made a strong impression on him, underscoring a stark shift in public perception of the military, from indifference to reverence. Since the 1990s, the Russian Air Force had been in disarray, with pilot training underfunded and poorly managed. More recently, improvements to training programs have spurred a growing number of young, would-be pilots to enlist. The continuing conflict in Syria, heavily spotlighted in Russian media, has played its own role in this surge of patriotism and military pride.Mr. Babenko felt compelled to document the lives of these servicemen, to showcase the unseen, and at times mundane, facets of their military lives. He was granted access to the base at Armavir \u00e2\u0080\u0094 always with a chaperone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on six occasions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could have spent more hours with them,\u201d Mr. Babenko said. Yet even with such a limited number of visits, he managed to capture a variety of aspects of life on base, including several portraits of the pilots and their aircraft. His subjects were all men.One immediate and unexpected challenge, Mr. Babenko said, was rooted in superstition: Most of the pilots refused to be photographed with their aircraft if they were scheduled to fly that day. Those fears were dispelled \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for some \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after they became comfortable seeing Mr. Babenko during each successive visit. That acceptance elicited their eventual consent. As it turned out, the superstition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold was weakest on the more experienced pilots, who allowed themselves to be photographed. Regardless of age, may of the pilots were reserved, their words few. After warming up to Mr. Babenko, conversation became more fluid, their backgrounds more accessible. But no matter how jovial the interactions, exchanges always remained formal. Still, a lot was revealed. Mr. Babenko learned that many pilots chose to enlist as a family tradition, following in the footsteps of a father, uncle, brother \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes multiple relatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were aviators. Others spoke of a point in their life when they simply \u00e2\u0080\u009cfell in love with the sky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nearly all expressed a newfound pride in military service.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt some period of time, the pilot profession lost its prestige and appeal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Babenko said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow when they put on their uniforms, they again see the respectful glances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite the public fanfare, and his personal respect for the military men he photographed, Mr. Babenko had no intention of putting the pilots on a pedestal. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to idolize or criticize, only humanize. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not want to shoot a \u00e2\u0080\u0098military parade,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wanted to see with my own eyes at least part of their daily life, and try to show it to others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The photographs are almost banal.In contrast to most images of a war that still reverberates decades later, they show soldiers lazing, showing off their squalid jungle living quarters, discovering the charm of the Vietnamese children they encounter, reveling in a rare ocean swim. There is nothing remotely as chilling as much of the classic Vietnam War photography, no shots like Nick Ut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing from a napalm bombing or  Eddie Adams\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shot of a Saigon police chief firing a bullet into the head of a Viet Cong prisoner. Yet these photographs were taken not by professionals but by young grunts barely out of high school. Grinning wide-eyed at this strange land where they had been sent, often against their will, in circumstances they did not fully understand, with little foreboding of what might be in store, their photographs of ordinary wartime days have a special poignancy.The images, 72 of them taken by 22 servicemen, have been curated by Marissa Roth, a photojournalist, for an exhibition she conceived after learning of a smaller cache of such photographs in Wisconsin and expanding the collection by contacting other veterans. Starting Aug. 6, the exhibit, called \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy War: Wartime Photographs by Vietnam Veterans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will be on display for three months at The Highground, the memorial park in Neillsville, Wis., created by Vietnam veterans, and will travel to other cities afterward. Her collaborator is June Berg, who manages The Highground\u00e2\u0080\u0099s learning center and first helped veterans digitize their Vietnam slides and negatives.Professional photographers assigned to Vietnam, Ms. Roth wrote in an introduction to the exhibition catalog, \u00e2\u0080\u009cviewed the war from the outside looking in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What struck her when she heard about the group of Wisconsin veterans who were offering their photos was that these were \u00e2\u0080\u009cpictures taken from the inside looking out.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEven as the war raged, there were hours of downtime, and those hobbyists and amateurs who had packed a camera, be it an Instamatic or something better, could pull it out of their knapsacks and capture scenes around them. They photographed two soldiers inside a tent, one sewing a uniform patch, the other reading a newspaper; a Special Forces commando holding up two puppies; a platoon trudging uneventfully through rice paddies with grins on their faces; the inside of a \u00e2\u0080\u009chootch\u00e2\u0080\u009d (makeshift barracks) decorated with a Playboy centerfold; a young Vietnamese boy guiding a cow through a field; four infantrymen taking batting practice; a shirtless infantryman idling during a smoke break.Some photographs are deceptively humdrum, taken not long before or after an ominous event, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cin-between moments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Ms. Roth calls them. Pilots at a Thai air base about to take off for the Rolling Thunder aerial bombing campaign against North Vietnam flash \u00e2\u0080\u009cV\u00e2\u0080\u009d for victory with their fingers. Only a caption points out that one of the airmen was later \u00e2\u0080\u009cKIA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (killed in action). A frayed helmet rests on a wooden crate, but the caption points out that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the photographer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own and the fraying reveals two bullet holes. A soldier with a bandage around his skull and one near his mouth lies on the ground waiting to be airlifted by helicopter. A Viet Cong couple, blindfolded, sit holding hands before some fate the viewer will never learn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cClearly they were in love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the soldier-photographer, Fred Gibbs, told Ms. Roth, expressing what she said was a \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman kinship\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite the fact they were his enemy.In the exhibit catalog the photographs are accompanied by diary entries or poems written by the soldiers. One poem written by Sgt. Clyde B. Canny, who fought with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1968 and 1969, is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cVietnam, They Ask, So What Was It Like?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and ends with the following lines:Ms. Roth, 59, is a daughter of refugees who fled Europe a year before World War II. As a freelancer, she has worked for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and other publications.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI came of age in the \u00e2\u0080\u009960s and \u00e2\u0080\u009970s and was profoundly impacted by images I was seeing in Life magazine and on television,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in an interview. These photographs, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome sweet, some poetic, some mundane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009creflect the resilience of the human spirit. Despite their mission, they were still seeing beauty, still seeing poetry.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Roth had to cull through a few thousand pictures before selecting the 72 for the exhibition. Along the way she learned that many veterans had destroyed their photographs because they could not bear to look at them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of brittle emotion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the surface, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still tender. They all lived their lives and got on with it, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of pain and tenderness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Is the story important? What are the broader implications? Will the situation get worse?In a digital age, new information comes quickly. Our job is to respond to it just as fast. Stories are updated, photos are added, details are swapped in, then homepage editors give it increasing prominence on the website and apps to cue in readers to its importance.The GIF above shows how The Times\u2019s treatment of the Orlando shooting evolved as we learned more and discovered the scope of the horror.\u201cAs you can see from the GIF, it went in stages as our reporters on the ground began to understand the immensity of the tragedy,\u201d Ian Fisher, The Times\u2019s weekend editor, said. \u201cThe day was directed by Julie Bloom, the weekend deputy who was one of the few people in the newsroom as the story was first breaking. As the initial, sketchy details came in, she published it as a small story in the middle column. Then it became the main story on the site. Then we went to what we call a \u2018banner\u2019 headline, which goes above the picture and is usually the largest headline.\u201cIn this case, though, we needed to show more,\u201d Mr. Fisher continued. \u201cWe stripped two lines of all-capital text across the entire homepage (moving down the Opinion section). That\u2019s exceedingly rare \u2014 it happens once or twice a year at most. And, except for elections, it\u2019s never news you might welcome.\u201dSteve Kenny, a senior editor on the news desk, had finished his shift an hour before the story broke \u2014 and returned to the office to help with the coverage. He explains how Times editors handled the story:We knew from the beginning that this was going to be a significant story worthy of homepage play. But how much play? How big a story? It took eight hours before we knew the extent of the slaughter.The story grew and was republished one paragraph at a time but remained in the second-lead spot until about 6 a.m., when the police reported that the shooting was a \u201cmass casualty event.\u201d At that point, we made the decision to move it into the lead position, but with a one-column head rather than a banner. We still didn\u2019t have any specifics about what \u201cmass casualty event\u201d meant.The story went from a one-column head to a banner at about 7:30 a.m., after the police held their first press briefing and announced that \u201cabout 20\u201d people had been killed and 42 wounded.The display remained pretty much the same for several hours. We still only had one story, but a live-blog and photos deepened the package. By noon, we knew about 50 people had been killed, and plans were put in place to give it a super-banner display stretching from one end of the homepage to the other.The following day, we decided our most powerful image would be a simple grid of the victims\u2019 photos. Lance Booth, one of our digital photo editors, put together grids of nine people each that we rotated in and out of the photo spot.Advertisement"}

She wore a black-and-white knit bodysuit, her bleached hair in braided pigtails. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m corny,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what?\u201dAs the crowd cheered, Ms. Goddard raised her iPhone and filmed them, her hand making wobbly figure-8s over their heads, before she turned the lens onto herself, twisting her face into a silly grimace. Before the moment passed, she posted the video to Snapchat. Revelers in the crowd, in turn, filmed her filming them, and posted their videos to Snapchat, too.While few in their 30s and older may know of Ms. Goddard, her digital-native followers are enthralled by her jet-setting party lifestyle, which often places her alongside celebrities at events like the N.B.A. All-Star Game and the Grammys.She even gets name-checked in rap songs, including Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s 2015 song \u201cWit My Crew x 1987\u201d (\u201cThick white girl right on my side, she kinda look like, um, YesJulz\u201d).Which is fine, but what, exactly, does she do?This is what you see if you follow YesJulz on Snapchat: Ms. Goddard in Paris in June, celebrating the 34th birthday of her friend Ronnie Fieg, the sneaker impresario, who was starting a collaboration between his brand, Kith, and Colette. After checking in to a luxe hotel (\u201cKeeping it swaggy,\u201d she wrote) and attending a moodily lit dinner with Chris Stamp, of the streetwear label Stampd, and Joe La Puma, of Complex, she hosted a party at the nightclub Le Baron. \u201cWow look at this,\u201d read a caption, posted over a shaky shot of a gyrating crowd bathed in purple light.The next morning, Ms. Goddard addressed the camera directly from her hotel bed, bleary-eyed and wearing a sleeping mask on her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m on a journey of self-awareness,\u201d she said, while receiving a chakra cleansing of crystal therapy. \u201cIf I want to win more, I have to take care of myself.\u201dThere are lots of shots from inside airplanes and Uber taxis. This is where she tends to talk directly to the camera (\u201cThis has been one of the best days ever\u201d) in a husky tone and with her makeup smudged.If Instagram popularized the static selfie, Ms. Goddard uses Snapchat to bring it to life, giving us a snippet-by-snippet account of the daily chaos that surrounds her. If her life looks like a never-ending party, it\u2019s difficult to tell if Ms. Goddard follows the party or if the party follows her.In person, Ms. Goddard is pretty and warm, a street-slang-slinging chatterbox with Disney princess eyes. There\u2019s something cartoonish about her energy that\u2019s sensual and comical in equal parts, like an entrepreneurial Jessica Rabbit.\u201cWhat am I?\u201d Ms. Goddard said over coffee at La Colombe in TriBeCa on a cold Tuesday earlier this year, clad in a gray mock turtleneck sweater, hip-hugging black pants and a downy fur coat. \u201cWell, I\u2019m an influencer for brands. I\u2019m an events producer. I\u2019m an A&R. I\u2019m a publicist. I\u2019m a billion things in one. I\u2019m a host. I\u2019m talent myself.\u201d\u201cWe are literally living in a time when you can say you\u2019re something on the Internet and become that thing,\u201d she said.But she already is the star of her own reality show, one that she extemporaneously films, directs and produces. And her teenage and 20-something fans are of a generation that prefers social media celebrities over traditional ones.\u201cReality TV became so fake that people wanted real reality,\u201d Ms. Goddard said, trying to explain her appeal. \u201cNot from someone who\u2019s a multimillionaire, from somebody they feel they can almost touch.\u201d\u201cOn Instagram, you can be fake,\u201d Ms. Goddard said. \u201cYou take a picture, filter it, Photoshop it, put it up and let people think that\u2019s your life. Snapchat is the complete opposite.\u201dRaised in Tampa, Fla., Ms. Goddard made her mark in Miami by promoting parties at the South Beach clubs Liv and Story, where she would chaperone celebrities like Dwyane Wade and David Beckham.Though she was active on Instagram and Twitter, her game-changing moment came when Snapchat introduced the story feature in 2013, allowing users to string together short video clips to create a narrative. It seemed tailor-made for her staccato, celebrity-filled life.\u201cWorking with someone like Julz, it gives us insight into how to stay relevant,\u201d said Adam Petrick, the global director of marketing at Puma, which hired Ms. Goddard this year as its brand ambassador. \u201cShe\u2019s very multifaceted and outgoing in her interests. She perfectly represents our consumer.\u201dIn addition to wearing Puma products on Snapchat, Ms. Goddard recently shared a 40 percent discount code with her followers, and often tags posts of herself in athleisure outfits with the hashtag #PumaGal.While Mr. Petrick declined to get into specifics of the deal, industry insiders like Mr. Saynt from Socialyte estimate that Ms. Goddard can earn anywhere from $25,000 to $1 million for a campaign. He said that his company recently booked two influencer campaigns for $200,000 each.If the party never ends, neither does the work. Rather than complain, Ms Goddard has turned the always-on mentality into a brand-able moment, with the hashtag #NeverNotWorking.Her work ethos was on display during New York Fashion Week in February, when she was in the city to introduce her client, 070 Shake, to record-label executives at RCA and to fellow hip-hop artists.Dinner, like everything else in Ms. Goddard\u2019s life, was quick. She had another dinner scheduled that night, along with a concert at Webster Hall, and a party after that. After settling the tab, she scrolled through her phones, scanning for anything important. Then she put it away and sighed. She had places to be.\u201cThings are moving so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people not of this world to keep up. The people in the industry who were here before us didn\u2019t grow up with a phone in their hands. They didn\u2019t even grow up in the MySpace era. They were already famous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tripping Down a Virtual Reality Rabbit Hole", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtThis is going to sound like the tech-nerd version of one of those first-person People magazine essays about surviving adversity: You don\u2019t appreciate how much you need to see your hands until you can\u2019t.Your hands \u2013 they\u2019re always there. Even in the most immersive of media experiences \u2014 an IMAX movie or the hypnotic reverie of a darkened opera house \u2014 your sense of where your hands are is an ever-present comfort. Because you can see your hands, you can reach for the popcorn without knocking it over. Because your eyes aren\u2019t locked on the screen, you can check your phone to make sure your babysitter hasn\u2019t texted with an emergency.But then you don virtual reality goggles, and your hands disappear. So does the rest of the world around you. You are bereft, and it is very, very unsettling.This sounds obvious: The whole point of virtual reality is to create a fantasy divorced from the physical world. You\u2019re escaping the dreary mortal coil for a completely simulated experience: There you are, climbing the side of a mountain, exploring a faraway museum, flying through space or getting in bed with someone way out of your league.Getting completely submerged in a simulation is good for things like games, but for most media total immersion feels like a strangely old-fashioned experience. Because it leaves your body helplessly stuck in the physical world while your mind wanders, V.R. doesn\u2019t fit with the way most people work at a computer, watch TV or encounter many other digital experiences.Virtual reality is the opposite of a smartphone, a device that offers you quick hits of the digital world as you go about in the real world. Instead, V.R. is at this point an experience best left for the privacy of one\u2019s cave \u2014 a lonely, sometimes antisocial affair that does not allow for multitasking, for distraction or for the modern world\u2019s easy interplay of the real and the digital.\u201cI\u2019m a real proponent of being careful how we use it, because immersion is not free,\u201d said Jeremy Bailenson, the director of Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, a research center for virtual reality experiences. \u201cImmersion comes at a cost. It takes you out of your environment, it\u2019s perceptually taxing at times, and it\u2019s not something that we can use the way we use other media, for hours and hours and hours a day.\u201dPart of the problem is that the technology still isn\u2019t good enough. People at Oculus, the V.R. start-up that Facebook purchased for $2 billion in 2014, compare their Rift headset to the Apple II personal computer \u2014 one of the earliest incarnations of a device that would change the world. Eventually.The Apple II went on sale in 1977, but a couple of decades would pass before personal computers became ubiquitous. The earliest PCs were also very expensive (the Apple II sold for what would be about $5,000 today) and V.R. is no different. The Rift sells for $599, and the Vive goes for $799; both require a powerful desktop computer that will set you back at least $1,000.Both companies are working to solve some of the issues I had with V.R.In Oculus\u2019s demo room, I threw three-point shots in basketball, repeatedly punched a guy (and took some punches) in an unruly hockey game and passed some digital toys back and forth with an Oculus employee who was also wearing a headset.Compared with the lonelier, hands-free version of Oculus now shipping, the hands-on demo offered less of a split between what my body was doing in the real world and what my eyes were seeing in the virtual one.HTC\u2019s Vive is ahead of Oculus on this score. It comes with hand-sensing controllers that allow for digital manipulation, and its headset has a handy camera that provides an in-goggles map of the room around you, letting you find your chair and your keyboard without having to fumble clumsily for them.But even as the technology improves, V.R. is still something you have to get used to. It\u2019s unusual, in these days of multitasking, to plunge yourself completely into a media experience. You might want to tweet and snap while you watch a presidential debate or the N.B.A. finals. And you\u2019re probably multitasking even when you\u2019re watching something longer and more serious, like a movie.But V.R. doesn\u2019t allow you to easily direct your gaze toward anything beyond the media at hand. Once you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re in it; even handling a snack can be challenging. In a paradoxical way, the intensity of V.R. tends to limit its integration into your daily life.\u201cIn general we never put somebody in a helmet for more than about 20 minutes, and we give them frequent breaks,\u201d said Mr. Bailenson, of Stanford. \u201cBeing perceptually disconnected from the world for much longer may not be something a lot of people want to do.\u201dI\u2019ll take Mr. Wehner\u2019s word for it.But if V.R. isn\u2019t useful for movies and TV shows, and if it\u2019s kind of dodgy for porn, what good is it today? There are some great games on these systems, and there are sure to be many more during the next couple of years. There are also several useful experiences, like designing your Ikea kitchen in V.R.But if you\u2019re not a gamer and you\u2019re not looking for a new kitchen, V.R. is, at this point, just too immersive for most media. A few minutes after donning my goggles, I came to regard my virtual surroundings as a kind of prison. Yes, V.R. is a prison of fantastical sights and sounds and one that is at moments irresistibly exciting, but it\u2019s a prison nevertheless. And before long, it will leave you yearning for escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Being Transgender as a Fact of Nature", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Jane Brody on health and aging.In 1952, George Jorgensen, a Bronx-born G.I., underwent surgical and hormonal treatment in Denmark to become Christine Jorgensen, a nightclub entertainer and advocate for gender identity rights. Ever since, health professionals and lay people alike have debated the origins of gender identity, the wisdom of altering one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biologically determined sex, and whether society should accept the transgender community as a fact of nature.Yet the controversy now raging over the rights of transgender students to use bathroom and locker room facilities that match their gender identity rather than their birth sex reflects the persistence of widespread prejudice and misinformation about the nature and behavior of people who identify as transgender.Perhaps the most important point Dr. Gooren and others make is that a mismatch between gender identity and biological sex is not something people choose. The most common description given by transgendered individuals is a persistent, painfully distressing belief that they are females trapped in a male body, or vice versa.This mismatch is classified in the psychiatric literature as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgender dysphoria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but Dr. Gooren pointed out that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca substantial proportion of the transgender population does not have a clinically significant coexisting psychiatric condition\u00e2\u0080\u009d other than chronic suffering from feeling they are not what their bodies tell them they are.No chromosomal or hormonal causes of being transgender have been identified. Also lacking is convincing evidence that it is caused by some aberration of family dynamics \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how a child is treated or dressed by mom, dad or anyone else.In individuals who transition from female to male, it is possible that excessive production of androgens during pregnancy could have programmed the brain to be male.Among adults, male-to-female transitions are nearly three times more common than female-to-male ones. It has not been unusual for people born male to first acknowledge and express their female gender identity in midlife, often after having married and fathered children.In young children, girls who are tomboys and boys who act more like girls are quite common and should not be assumed to be transgender. Such behavior often changes by adolescence.However, when bodily changes at puberty differ from a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gender identity, they are typically a source of extreme distress. Still, experts warn that at any age, and especially in adolescence, great caution must be taken before irreversible treatments are provided to induce changes that conform to a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discordant gender identity.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPersons with gender identity disorder may have unrealistic expectations about what being a member of the opposite sex entails,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Gooren wrote, using an older term for gender dysphoria. Therefore, he and others have said that before starting hormone treatments, the person should live for at least a year as the desired sex. However, the transition process varies by individual, and many doctors no longer advise a waiting period.Surgical sex reassignment may then follow to remove and reconstruct the genitalia, breasts and internal sex organs to more closely resemble the desired sex. Some people also undergo facial reconstruction. Even after surgery, hormone treatments must continue indefinitely to maintain the desired gender characteristics.It is especially important for transgender individuals seeking treatment to know the risks involved. Long-term studies of people who underwent sex reassignment surgery have been conducted in Sweden and Denmark, where excellent population-wide medical records are kept.The authors suggested that a host of societal factors, including social exclusion, harassment and negative experiences in school and at work, could largely contribute to the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 health problems. The findings underscore the importance of better postoperative support and closer attention to injurious lifestyle issues like smoking and alcohol abuse.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

She has had a string of bad relationships, but now seems to be getting serious with a man who hunts. She claims he does so for food and conservation, which I don\u2019t buy. I also see on his Facebook page that he mounts animal heads on his walls and, disturbingly, decorates them for the holidays. She is angry that I am unwilling to have a relationship with him, but I don\u2019t feel I can. Help!TIFFANY, QUEENSLook! It\u2019s Animal Planet week at Social Q\u2019s. I am no hunter (and don\u2019t get me started on automatic weapons), but I have enjoyed venison osso buco and rabbit stew on many occasions. I have no illusions about how those creatures came to sit on my dinner plate. Would you refuse a friendship with me, too? Whether we kill the animal or merely consume it, we meat-eaters are part of one continuum. That\u2019s a lot of people to snub.I have sat at tables with hunters who gave thanks to the animals that died for our supper. They seemed respectful and a million times more thoughtful about the food chain than most of us. Mounting heads may be part of this respect (or proof that your sister\u2019s new beau is a creep). Only one thing is certain: You are never going to find out unless you get to know him.Staying open for (calm) discussion on our big-ticket issues has been as big a gift (to me) as rigidity has been a hindrance. And if you want to stay close with your sister, you have to make a sincere effort. That doesn\u2019t mean quail hunting with him. But respecting him enough to discover the man in full would be a start.My daughter had a serious boyfriend in high school. He went far away to college in the fall, but promised to keep in touch. She broke up with him at Christmas because he didn\u2019t. He recently came home for the summer and told her that he is gay. My daughter is devastated. She truly loves this guy, and I believe he loves her. Any advice?JANET, MICHIGANHe\u2019s gay! They can be close friends, but a sexual relationship seems unlikely. Sympathize with your daughter. The mismatch of her heart\u2019s desire will not lessen her pain. But don\u2019t demonize the boy; he may feel vulnerable enough. And as many people can tell your daughter, she is better off learning the truth now than discovering it at 40.My husband and I often invite friends to dinner. When they ask what they can bring, I say, \u201cJust yourselves.\u201d These aren\u2019t potlucks. But if my husband fields the question, he assigns them actual dishes, \u201cVegetable side, please.\u201d This is embarrassing. Please make him stop.JENNNot my jurisdiction, I\u2019m afraid, though I share your sentiment. Guests should not be expected to bring anything. That\u2019s what makes them guests. Still, many refuse to come empty-handed. If they ask (or insist), respond, \u201cHow about a bottle of wine or a pie from the farmstand?\u201d Keep it simple. But asking them to blanch broccoli seems a step too far. Try bribing your husband to keep him quiet.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.

{"Headline": "Shareholder Initiatives Show Their Value", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsFor all its imperfections, shareholder democracy has real value. For evidence, look no further than a plethora of cases this week in which voting is proving to be of great consequence.Facebook\u2019s board is planning now for the future of the supervoting power of its founder Mark Zuckerberg, while investors in Sika, the Swiss maker of building materials, are fighting the sale of just such a controlling minority stake. Sometimes, as at Tribune Publishing, votes are merely protests. A mistake at the ballot box, however, is costing T. Rowe Price hard cash.It\u2019s too easy to be jaded about some initiatives. For example, the shareholder votes required by the Securities and Exchange Commission on executive pay are not binding. Yet it has turned out that in most cases, boards have tried to change plans if even a large minority \u2013 maybe 30 percent or so \u2013 expresses displeasure with the rewards. In a reversal from the steady increases in recent years, average compensation for the highest-paid American corporate chieftains fell 15 percent in 2015, according to Equilar.Likewise, it\u2019s easy to argue that investors who buy into companies with multiple classes of shares know what they are getting into. Witness the havoc at Viacom, where Sumner Redstone is using his elite voting status to keep a firm grip despite persistent questions over his mental competence.It\u2019s true that for as long as Mr. Zuckerberg or the founders of Google, to name a few, display the golden touch, shareholders are not apt to complain much. The problems tend to come when the people in control mess up at the disproportionate expense of other owners. Mr. Zuckerberg, for example, has 54 percent of the votes at Facebook but only a 15 percent financial interest.To the credit of Facebook\u2019s board, it said on Thursday that it wanted shareholders to approve a change to the terms of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s supervoting Class B shares to ensure that if the he stops running Facebook some day, his shares will convert to normal voting ones.The proposal coincides with Facebook\u2019s plan to issue a new class of nonvoting stock that will further entrench Mr. Zuckerberg for the time being, which is a less-enlightened governance move. Still, it shows a sensible desire to forestall possible tension with investors down the road.That\u2019s exactly what did not happen at Sika. The Burkard family, which controls the company, struck a deal to sell its holding vehicle to the French giant Saint-Gobain for a hefty $2.8 billion, essentially leaving the other shareholders in the cold. The Burkards\u2019 52 percent voting control and 16 percent economic interest mirror Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s position at Facebook.Sika\u2019s independent board members and other investors, including the usually below-the-radar Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, have fought the sale since it was unveiled in late 2014. So far, they have been successful in enforcing noncontrolling shareholder protections that the Burkards have argued do not apply to the sale as structured.Moreover, Sika\u2019s financial performance has held up. But Saint-Gobain said this week that it was set on the deal despite the lengthy battle. The minority shareholders face twin dangers: If they eventually win, the distraction may by then have damaged Sika\u2019s business; and if they lose, the value of their investment will depend entirely on Saint-Gobain. More respect for matters of shareholder democracy could perhaps have avoided the conflict or pointed to a negotiated solution.As when electing people to office, the ballot choices are not always perfect. Gannett, the publishing group whose pursuit of Tribune Publishing has been rebuffed, did not have the right timing to put its own director nominees up for a vote at its target\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. Instead, it asked investors to withhold votes from Tribune Publishing\u2019s own directors.The certified count is not yet available, but Gannett estimates that five of eight directors received less than 50 percent support from Tribune shareholders if board insiders\u2019 votes, including a 16.5 percent stake associated with Michael W. Ferro Jr., the chairman, are excluded. Tribune Publishing says all directors had majority support.The competing statements are potentially consistent in mathematical terms, and they allow both sides to claim victory. The withheld votes may serve only as a protest, however, if the Tribune Publishing board keeps placing hurdles in the way of discussions with Gannett and instead pursues a jargon-riddled rebranding as Tronc (with a lowercase \u201ct\u201d in the company\u2019s materials) and what looks like a form-over-substance transfer of its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.Yet even votes that do not appear to change outcomes can matter. A group of investors who objected to Michael Dell\u2019s $25 billion deal to take his computer company private in 2013 won a ruling in a Delaware court this week that will net them nearly an extra 30 percent on the deal price. T. Rowe Price wanted to be part of the lawsuit, but it was excluded because it mistakenly voted in favor of the buyout at the time.The investment manager is figuring out how to reimburse its clients, who but for the error would have been nearly $200 million better off, according to The Wall Street Journal. It is another argument for all investors, whether the pushier sort or traditionally passive ones, to pay close attention to voting. Even second-order effects can cost real money.Advertisement"}

Stanley Almodovar III, a 23-year-old pharmacy technician, had posted a Snapchat video of himself singing and laughing on his way to the Pulse nightclub on Saturday. Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36, nicknamed Shaki, had been married to his husband for about a year, worked at a Party City and a Sunglass Hut, and was entranced by interior design.The dead were mostly young, mostly Latino and mostly gay \u2014 though some were none of those and a fair number were straight men and women enjoying an evening of Latin music. And on Monday, when their names were read aloud in the auditorium of a red-brick senior center, the worst fears of their families came true as the roster of the victims of the Orlando attack became horribly real.\u201cHe was not a party boy,\u201d Mr. Guerrero said. The family found out that Juan had been hurt when someone saw him being carried out of the club and into an ambulance. Family members began a frantic search. Finally, a hospital confirmed the awful news. The bereft uncle, like so many other relatives, turned to Facebook to pour out his rage.\u201cOnce again the tentacles of death have touched our family, this time at the hands of a coward, a scoundrel, a disgusting human being without any scruples,\u201d he wrote.Cesar Flores, who moved to the United States from Guatemala in 1984 to chase what he called the American dream, learned around 1 a.m. Monday that his only daughter, Mercedez Marisol Flores, 26, had died in the club along with a girlfriend, Amanda Alvear, 25.\u201cShe was my best, my only girl,\u201d Mr. Flores, who has two sons, said quietly, with evident grief, outside the Beardall Senior Center, where he was to receive help with arrangements to receive his daughter\u2019s body for burial. \u201cShe was a happy girl all the time, but now she\u2019s gone.\u201dThe attacker, Mr. Flores said, should be forgiven. \u201cI cannot hang on to that hate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not weapons that kill \u2014 it\u2019s the heart. That kind of hate is in the blood.\u201dAs he spoke, two people nearby hugged each other for a long time and sobbed. From the front door of the building, a procession of relatives and friends emerged after the briefing, heads bowed. Each family was surrounded by a team of church volunteers in bright T-shirts, their hands linked to protect their charges from reporters\u2019 questions.One woman, Eileen Villega, said the name of a family friend who had been in the nightclub, Angel L. Candelario-Padro, 27, had not appeared on any of the lists of dead or injured. \u201cHis boyfriend is in the hospital, but he doesn\u2019t appear anywhere,\u201d she said. Later, after she had left, his name was indeed found listed among the dead.Luis S. Vielma, 22, worked on a Harry Potter ride at Universal Studios, and was mourned on Twitter by the author J.K. Rowling. He was also an emergency medical student at Seminole State College, whose president, E. Ann McGee, was among several college presidents who found themselves issuing statements of sorrow on Monday, a testimony to the youth lost in the rampage.14 Photos\u201cWe are saddened by the tragic events this weekend, and the loss of one of our own,\u201d Dr. McGee said.Shane Evan Tomlinson, who often sang with his band, Frequency, at Orlando\u2019s Blue Martini nightclub, performed just hours before he was killed.

He had gone to Pulse on Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of a friend, Cory James Connell, 21, who was also killed.\u201cIt\u2019s a great atmosphere,\u201d said Jessica Weyl, 23, a friend who is also straight and goes to Pulse occasionally. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t judgmental. People aren\u2019t feeling the need necessarily to impress each other.\u201dShe added, \u201cAt Pulse it\u2019s just calm, cool, and collected. No one felt pressure to be anyone they weren\u2019t. I\u2019m straight and I love going there. My brother is gay and he loves going there.\u201dMs. Weyl had just finished training for a job in Tomorrowland when she met Mr. Wright.\u201cHe took me under his wing and kind of showed me everything,\u201d she said. She turned to him for questions about Disney policies, but especially when she encountered a guest who spoke Spanish. \u201cHe really connected with a lot of guests \u2014 we do have a lot of South Americans come,\u201d she said. \u201cHe connected especially to those people.\u201dMexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday that three Mexicans were among the dead. The Mexican Consulate in Orlando was working to determine if a fourth victim was of Mexican origin.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said the tragedy\u2019s origins lay in \u201cexpressions of hatred, of discrimination, of phobia against certain people.\u201dMany Latinos in Orlando are of Puerto Rican descent. Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34, was among them. He was proud of his heritage, and had made it his life\u2019s mission to open doors for gay travelers, especially in Latin America. As the national brand manager for ALandCHUCK.travel, an agency that caters to gay people, he organized what the company\u2019s owner, Al Ferguson, called the first-ever gay cruise to Cuba. \u201cHe fell in love with Cuba,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.During the trip, in April, Mr. Sotomayor and Mr. Ferguson met with Mariela Castro, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s daughter and a prominent gay rights activist there. The two men also posed in front of a poster left over from President Obama\u2019s recent trip.On Sunday morning at Pulse, Mr. Sotomayor\u2019s boyfriend of about three years had gone outside to put some things in his car when the shots broke out. Mr. Sotomayor texted him that he was hiding, but safe, and told him not to come back inside, Mr. Ferguson said. About 25 minutes later, he texted his boyfriend again, saying he was still hiding. That was the last message the boyfriend got.Mr. Ferguson said the boyfriend\u2019s parents, who live in Mexico, do not know he is gay.\u201cIt\u2019s a double catastrophe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou face such horrible loss and then can\u2019t share it.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre misidentified the country where the family of one victim, Jerald Arthur Wright, lives.

But no less vital than the sound being made was the punk aesthetic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 urgent and gritty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Mr. Godlis was helping define.The images from those raucous nights in the late 1970s have proved to be just as enduring as the records that came out of the scene. Possibly to the horror of anyone there at the birth of punk, many of these pictures have become part of rock \u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099 roll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iconography.But beyond those familiar pictures are less codified moments that capture the era.The band Television pose on a street corner, their disinterest at being photographed hinting that they would be more influential than popular. John Lydon (also known as Johnny Rotten) somehow seems to be vibrating with disdain while simply sitting on a sofa. Even Keith Richards, slumming it with Jim Carroll (poet, musician and author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Basketball Diaries\u00e2\u0080\u009d), manages to look like just a guy with a guitar onstage.These and other images are collected in Mr. Godlis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistory Is Made at Night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On June 25, he will be signing the book at the Queens Museum, where five of his photographs are included in an exhibition about the Ramones and the birth of punk.Punk now is a style statement, and many of its pioneers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Joey Ramone, Hilly Kristal, Mr. Carroll \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have died.

Every time they got their hopes up that some new forest fire would incinerate Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, he seemed to douse it by pumping out programming for the always-flowing cable and internet news stream.Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to say just about anything, and his merry courting of trouble, was an eye-opening break from the traditional, tightly scripted approach of keeping candidates away from trouble.More important, it made the news all about Mr. Trump, blocking his opponents\u2019 attempts to break through with carefully planned policy speeches, classic endorsement announcements and 30-second commercials. What\u2019s 30 seconds here or there in a constantly churning, 24-hour Trump marathon?What Mr. Trump realized, and Mrs. Clinton should too, Mr. Conant said, is that \u201cthere\u2019s just a steady flow of information, and if you don\u2019t try to provide the content, your opponents or your critics will.\u201dTheir point is that modern candidates do not need to light their \u201chair on fire, and keep it on fire,\u201d as Mr. Trump does. \u201cYou just need to deliver more content,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\u201cHe\u2019s saying things that are so shockingly outrageous, of course they\u2019re going to command the attention of the national news media,\u201d Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we feel a particular pressure to try to outdo that every day, given that most of those statements are in and of themselves going to repel key voter groups that he needs in a general election.\u201dGeoff Garin, a pollster for the super PAC, said television advertising would prove to be more potent against Mr. Trump in the general election. \u201cPeople will think more and more whether he\u2019s a good president, not whether he\u2019s a captivating personality,\u201d he said. That is, the content of his content is going to matter in a different way.That hijacked the news feed once again. I asked Mr. Trump if that was his intention and he said no, that it was only about the judge and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech was too scripted (\u201cphony\u201d) to have much effect.Whatever the case, it was the latest offering from Trump Productions, which has so far proved that content is king. Now, will that sort of content be kingmaker? Or will it better serve the queen?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scapegoat or Spy? Vatican Consultant Commands Attention at Leaks Trial", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Her accusers call her an ambitious schemer, even a spy. The presiding judge has wondered aloud whether she is \u201cfull of hot air.\u201d Vatican prosecutors want her in jail for as many as 15 years, charging that she stole and leaked state secrets.She calls herself a scapegoat, claiming she is the target of a vendetta and a plot by her enemies to discredit her with Pope Francis.Whatever the truth, Francesca Immacolata Chaouqui (pronounced CHOW-kee) has emerged as the central protagonist in what is being billed here as the \u201cVatileaks 2\u201d trial, and become a lightning rod of intrigue and criticism.A hero to some and a villain to others, Ms. Chaouqui \u2014 Calabrian born, 34 years old and more than eight months pregnant \u2014 stands accused with two others of leaking confidential documents to two journalists who wrote separate tell-all books about Vatican mismanagement and corruption. The trial follows the pattern of the first Vatileaks trial, in which Paolo Gabriele, the butler to Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, faced similar charges.The journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi, face up to eight years in prison in a case that has raised widespread criticism that the Vatican is trying to muzzle free speech and squelch embarrassing revelations. One of the most secretive states, the Vatican has defined the disclosures as a threat to its security.Over more than six months of testimony, Vatican watchers hoping that the courtroom revelations would blow the lid off Dan Brown-like intrigue and Machiavellian machinations inside the guarded halls of the Holy See have been disappointed. Instead, the trial, which is expected to end this month, has produced still more embarrassments. Testimony has revealed serious weaknesses in the Vatican\u2019s security system: Unknown intruders were able to enter into what were supposed to be secure offices and break open a safe, as well as breach protected internet connections.Several witnesses called by the prosecution exposed an array of human foibles, nurtured by workplace rivalries, petty jealousies, recriminations and thwarted ambitions. Not least, the trial has raised critical questions among some Vatican observers about Francis\u2019s staffing choices, Ms. Chaouqui foremost among them.A communications consultant, Ms. Chaouqui was part of an eight-member commission established by Francis in July 2013 to review the Vatican\u2019s economic and administrative structures and draft recommendations for reform. His decision to appoint Ms. Chaouqui to the group raised eyebrows because she was seen as too much of an outsider. She now says that she is being set up by her enemies inside the Vatican and that the case against her is \u201cpolitical.\u201d\u201cI am a scapegoat,\u201d she said in a recent interview at the home of her Vatican lawyer, Laura Sgro\u2019, in Rome. \u201cThe prosecutors haven\u2019t produced one single bit of evidence that shows that I gave a document from A to B.\u201dWhen a Vatican gendarme testified that Ms. Chaouqui admitted in November, when she was briefly arrested, that she had given documents to one of the journalists, she retorted in court that the \u201cdocuments\u201d had been tickets to a Vatican event.She says she believes that she worked only for the good of the church, and that the mandate and recommendations of her commission have been thwarted by inaction.\u201cMy commission discovered and denounced very serious crimes\u201d to Vatican prosecutors and financial regulators that were never acted upon, she said in the interview.\u201cI imagined that Vatican justice would take action against these people who committed financial crimes that are really serious, far more than those written up\u201d in the Vatileaks books, she added. \u201cBut until now nothing has happened, at least as far as I know.\u201dSeveral other members of the commission, which was disbanded after 10 months, having completed its mandate, did not respond to emails or declined to comment.The recommendations of the commission led to the creation in February 2014 of the Secretariat for the Economy, which oversees all of the Vatican\u2019s economic and administrative activities.It also recommended the reorganization of the Vatican\u2019s media operations, which has begun.Prosecutors insist that Ms. Chaouqui conspired with another member of the committee, Msgr. Lucio \u00c1ngel Vallejo Balda, and his secretary, Nicola Maio \u2014 both also facing 15 years in prison \u2014 to form a secretive lobby that leaked documents to journalists.But Ms. Sgro\u2019, Ms. Chaouqui\u2019s lawyer, said the prosecution had not yet explained \u201cwhat advantage her client would achieve\u201d from this arrangement.Critics say that Ms. Chaouqui, through Monsignor Vallejo Balda, was attempting to cement her position within the Holy See even after the commission she was part of had been disbanded. Ms. Chaouqui called the theory laughable. \u201cEmployees of the curia make around 2,000 euros a month, which is what I earn in less than a week,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that wouldn\u2019t be my aspiration.\u201dThe swirl of innuendo whipped up around her has been as compelling as it is contradictory. When he took the stand in March, Monsignor Vallejo Balda recounted that Ms. Chaouqui had told him that she was a top Italian spy. He also spoke of a night in a Florentine hotel during which \u2014 \u201cacting seductively\u201d \u2014 Ms. Chaouqui \u201cwanted to conquer me at any cost.\u201d\u201cI understand that this night of love was the thing that most scandalized public opinion, but it\u2019s all very false,\u201d Ms. Chaouqui said in the interview, rolling her eyes. Her encounters with Monsignor Vallejo Balda were part of a \u201cnormal working relationship\u201d between members of the same commission, she said. \u201cI never wanted a job in the curia. I wanted to bring my reforms forward.\u201dAfter working for several prestigious Italian law firms managing their public relations, and then for the professional services firm Ernst & Young, Ms. Chaouqui set up her own communications strategy company. It counted top entrepreneurs, private security companies and governments as clients, she said.Her credentials do not seem to have impressed the Vatican court.\u201cDid you have the impression that she was full of hot air?\u201d the presiding judge, Giuseppe Dalla Torre, recently asked a witness. The witness responded that, in fact, Ms. Chaouqui had made good on her promise to bring a government minister to visit a project.Soon after her selection, the Italian media published a series of disparaging messages, purportedly from Ms. Chaouqui\u2019s Twitter account, including one suggesting that Benedict had leukemia, and that a former Italian government minister was gay.She claims that her account was hacked, and that the messages were part of a larger dossier put together by her enemies to discredit her with the pope. She repeated the assertion in court in May, and again on her Facebook account, to explain why she had been unjustly brought to trial.The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the director of the Vatican Press Office, warned in a statement in May that her accusations were \u201ccalumnious affirmations \u2014 they are absolutely unacceptable, and subject to legal action.\u201dMs. Chaouqui dismissed criticisms that she has been too flippant on her social media accounts in trying to refute the accusations that have been raised in court, which she sees as part of a defamatory campaign against her. \u201cI am not a nun. I am a communicator,\u201d she said. \u201cVatileaks has become the most important communications strategy of my life.\u201dAn article on June 5 about Francesca Immacolata Chaouqui, the central protagonist at the \u201cVatileaks 2\u201d trial in Vatican City, who has become a lightning rod of intrigue and criticism, misstated the given name of one of the two journalists to whom she is accused of leaking state secrets. He is Emiliano Fittipaldi, not Emanuele.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Many Echoes of My Family\u2019s Journey\u2019: Readers React to School Segregation", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byNotebookIt\u2019s clear that people felt compelled to share, criticize and consider the arguments put forth in the article and discuss their own school decisions, and mine. Below are some comments and questions from readers, with responses from me.Some readers objected to my use of the word \u201csegregation\u201d to describe schools in New York City that are almost entirely black and Latino. They believe that segregation occurs only when mandated by law. But both legally and culturally, we have always recognized varying forms of segregation \u2014 de jure, by law, and de facto, by fact. In the North, the lines between de jure and de facto segregation have long been muddied, because while laws requiring segregation were not common, as my article points out, segregation still often resulted from the intentional and discriminatory policies and actions of public officials. To say that the segregation in New York City, or any city, is simply a result of individual housing choices assumes a free and open housing market, where people can simply choose where they want to live. We have never had a free and open housing market in this country, and that is why it was important for me to show the story of the Farragut Houses, and how federal and local policy constrained the choices of black and Puerto Rican residents and how it socially engineered housing segregation where it did not exist before.I\u2019d need a lot more space than this to address why the experience of Asian-Americans, as a whole, is different from black students. The history of a group of people brought here as slaves, for whom the entire American racial caste system was built, is necessarily going to be very different from the experience of a group who chose to immigrate to this country. Though Americans like to group everyone who is not white together, different racial groups have always had vastly different experiences in this country. There is a reason most school desegregation law does not address Asian students. But to try to sum it up quickly, Asian-Americans by and large are the most integrated of all racial groups in this country, both in terms of housing and schools, and they are the most likely to live next to and attend schools with white children. They do not typically experience the intense segregation that black students face, nor are they typically concentrated in high-poverty schools with few resources. As a result, their educational experiences, again, generally speaking, are quite different from those of black and Latino students.The author neglects to describe the condition of the three other local public schools she \u201cconsidered\u201d in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where she lives. Were these schools so inferior that even P.S. 307 seemed a better option? I suspect so, and the author should have come clean about this.I\u2019m African-American and grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the \u201970s and \u201980s. My parents sent me to private and public schools outside the neighborhood because the local schools were so bad. My mother, who also grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was sent by my grandparents to a parochial school in the neighborhood and then a public high school outside the neighborhood. My four children, all born and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, were sent to a wonderful, independent Montessori school in Cobble Hill. My point being that middle-class black residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant seeking better educational opportunities for their children have been abandoning the neighborhood public schools since the 1960s. This history, coupled with recent gentrifiers continuing the tradition of not sending their children to the local public schools, reveals that this is more of a class phenomena than it is a race thing. In case it was not clear in the article, my husband and I applied to three neighborhood Bedford-Stuyvesant schools in addition to P.S. 307, which actually had lower test scores than the three neighborhood schools. The reason we picked P.S. 307 as our first choice was simple mathematics. We did not want to pay for another year of preschool, and P.S. 307 had 100 prekindergarten seats, while our neighborhood schools had between 16 and 32, before sibling preferences. P.S. 307 offered us better odds. Had we gotten into one of the other schools instead, Najya would be in a neighborhood school.With that said, I understand why parents make a different choice than I did. This article was not intended to separate myself from other parents. There are certainly black and white and Asian and Latino parents in this city who have made similar choices as my husband and me, and many who did not. What I did hope to do was get people to grapple more with those choices, to think about the role of public education and to open their eyes to the devastating consequences for those families who have the least choice.And, quickly, I think it\u2019s important to point out that as much as we\u2019d like to negate the role of race, we simply can\u2019t. It is true that the problems facing the New York City public schools are those of both race and class. Mounds of research shows that race has its own effect. If class were the only issue, there are enough poor white children in this country to have schools that are poor and integrated. But that is not the case. In fact, what we know is that the typical poor white family lives in a wealthier neighborhood than a middle-class black family and therefore is more likely to have access to middle-class schools than middle-class black families.Dear Nikole,Thank you for your article on school segregation. We are living a similar experience here in Philadelphia, where our son is one of a small but growing number of white and/or middle-class kids (heavily concentrated in the younger grades) at our neighborhood public school, where about 85 percent of the overall population comes from economically disadvantaged families. It is, frankly, a school we did not envision sending our future children to when we bought our house nearly nine years ago, despite it being down the block. Then we went inside, got involved and were thrilled to find that the school is amazing and a wonderful fit for our family.We are in the school zone (\u201ccatchment\u201d) next to a school that is predominantly white and affluent, drives higher property values and has developed a tradition of parental engagement and financial investment. This year, for the first time, some of these families are being redirected to our school because of overcrowding. There are so many nuances, opportunities and challenges, and we are lucky to have an amazing and clearheaded principal to navigate the local landscape. Basically, we cannot do anything about the other school\u2019s overcrowding, which is likely to impact us, so for now we keep our focus on improving our thriving school and building our community.In this light, I have been working with others to lead community engagement and get families and other community members to walk through the doors and see the school for themselves. We have a small, mixed-income and diverse pocket of the city \u2014 the catchment is only 25 square blocks \u2014 where conventional wisdom among families that can choose otherwise is not to even look at the neighborhood school. This is true but rapidly changing for many schools in Philadelphia, especially around Center City.We love our school. We love our kid\u2019s teachers and his friends, and he delights in seeing them around the neighborhood. The idea is to have the school reflect our neighborhood, but I think a lot about how that happens responsibly, respectfully and for everyone. Over the next few years, what we and other families have started with the best of intentions is likely to snowball. More and more white and/or middle-class families with prekindergarten-age kids are showing interest. Also, no matter the eventual solution for the adjacent catchment school\u2019s overcrowding (redrawing lines, lotteries, etc.), our school will be impacted.I have heard from so many families who have wrestled with these choices, and I commend you. I think your concerns about the unintended consequences of your school possibly gentrifying show just how hard building and maintaining an integrated, equitable system will be. But it is worth the work.These are the types of stories that make this reporting worth it, and that tell me what I know logically but worry about emotionally \u2014 that my daughter will be just fine and that enrolling her in the P.S. 307 was the right thing to do. And, if we are ever in Hawaii, we\u2019d love to meet you, too.Nikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Palantir Buyback Plan Shows Need for New Silicon Valley Pay System", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorPalantir Technologies\u2019 $225 million offer to repurchase its employees\u2019 privately held shares hints that Silicon Valley is starting to make some fundamental changes in the way it compensates its workers.Palantir, a data analytics firm, is one of the largest start-ups around, with a valuation reaching more than $20 billion last year. It is offering $7.40 a share to buy back up to 12.5 percent of an employee\u2019s shares (and in some cases, those of former employees), or $500,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower.The offer has some interesting characteristics, to say the least. Palantir\u2019s worth, measured by the price at which its stock trades in the private share market, has been deflated. The price Palantir is offering is above the private market price and the value assigned to the stock by some prominent mutual funds.Palantir\u2019s offer, though, is at least a cheap way to tell the market that Palantir thinks it is still worth a lot.Palantir has said the offer is intended to increase the morale of employees by offering them \u201cliquidity.\u201d Some employees have been with the company since its founding 11 years ago and are still waiting for that pinnacle event in the life of a hot tech start-up: the initial public offering of stock.Unlike them, the former employees can already sell their shares in the private market. They might take this offer because it is a higher amount. Palantir\u2019s motives for including them in the buyback are unclear. Palantir gets all of the benefits of the nondisclosure and other agreements, but any employee who takes the offer is not likely to be doing those things anyway. Perhaps Palantir is doing this out of the goodness of its heart.Whatever the reason, Palantir\u2019s offer comes at a time of great debate in Silicon Valley over employee compensation. Traditionally, workers received options on a four-year vesting schedule. When they left a company, they would have 90 days to exercise those options or forfeit them.Palantir did not impose restrictions on employees or stockholders selling shares in the private market. Perhaps as a way to get current and former employees to participate, Palantir\u2019s repurchase offer threatened to make it harder to resell the company\u2019s stock in the private market.Employees need to consider another headache \u2013 taxes. Not only must employees put up cash to exercise their options, they must pay taxes, which can be an extraordinary amount if the private company has a high valuation. But because the company is not public yet, one cannot even be sure that valuations will materialize, particularly in the era of the overvalued start-up. This was a problem in the day of the tech bubble. Employees exercised options worth millions of dollars but found that when taxes were due, their companies and stock were worthless.Mr. Kupor notes that extending the exercise time for former employees makes their options more valuable at the expense of employees and investors. (It does so because former employees have a longer time to exercise their options and dilute the other shareholders.) Mr. Kupor has no solution other than to allow companies to extend the time at their discretion. But as we see in the Palantir case, companies can pick and choose favorites, or even refuse to accommodate former employees.The Palantir repurchase and Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s ruminations highlight a more fundamental point: Compensation at venture-backed companies needs to be rethought in an age when many of these companies are staying private longer.In this new world, employees face sale restrictions that only their companies can lift. This forces these companies to provide periodic liquidity events. For instance, Airbnb, the short-term rental site, is making annual stock repurchases. In the public realm where companies are steadily profitable, stock buybacks are a familiar occurrence. More than half a trillion dollars was spent on stock buybacks in the public markets in 2015. But as the value of private, venture-backed companies deflates, they will struggle to give liquidity to their employees.There may be other ways to change compensation. Although options are the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, Palantir raised salaries 20 percent to stem employee attrition. But cash will not solve the problem, either.And so we await the great revamping. In the meantime, former employees of hot start-ups will be faced with choices like the one Palantir is offering: Take our money, whatever we offer, or be stuck.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Branded a \u2018Terrorist\u2019 for Reporting Two Sides of Ukraine\u2019s War", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byReporter's NotebookI have had guns pointed at me, slept in a shipping container and walked past the corpses of shelling victims since the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine began two years ago. But I had never been blacklisted as a terrorist before.So when my name recently appeared on a \u201cterrorist\u201d list of journalists published by a website with close ties to the Ukrainian government, I viewed it with a mix of trepidation and sarcasm.Trepidation because it suggested powerful people in Ukraine, a democracy that aspires to the free flow of information, were going after me and others on the list for simply doing our jobs: reporting both sides of the war, including the pro-Russian rebel side.And sarcasm because, this being Ukraine, the list was not likely to have much credibility elsewhere. I have not, for example, had any trouble flying after appearing on what may be the world\u2019s first list of terrorist journalists.It is also not a secret that I and other reporters have reported from rebel territory; our publications and broadcast outlets regularly use our names and note where we are.The list, published by a Ukrainian nationalist website called Myrotvorets, or the Peacemaker, appeared to have been born out of a simmering frustration.Hard-liners in Ukraine have been furious at the foreign press for some time now, arguing that any coverage of the rebels from their home base in the east played into Russia\u2019s powerful propaganda machine. Russia has portrayed residents in the breakaway regions as victims of an unjustified Ukrainian military assault by a Western-backed \u201cfascist\u201d government in Kiev.The list is a compilation of reporters and others who applied for press passes to work in territory controlled by the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Ukraine\u2019s main enemy in the two-year-old war in the east. Applying for accreditation from Russian-backed rebels, according to the website, was enough to be branded a \u201cterrorist accomplice.\u201dThe website said it had obtained the list of names, and personal information including emails, from hackers who had stolen the rebels\u2019 data.Groups supporting journalists quickly condemned the publication of the names \u2014 and in some cases home addresses \u2014 for seeming to invite violence against reporters.A pro-Russian commentator living in Kiev, Oles Buzina, whose home address was publicized in a Myrotvorets post last year, was shot and killed on a street not far from his home days later.But this time, the site was publishing names and contact details for 5,412 journalists, drivers, fixers, soundmen and translators. Not all of us can be rubbed out.Why were so many reporters accredited to cover the war in Donetsk? Because it served the media strategy of the Russia-backed rebels. About two-thirds of the journalists and support staff on the list were Russian nationals or locals from eastern Ukraine, who might be expected to be sympathetic to the rebels. In addition, 1,816 foreign reporters showed up over the two years and were accredited, according to the list.The ease of accrediting ensured, for example, broad coverage of stray Ukrainian artillery strikes hitting the city and sometimes killing civilians, helping discredit Ukraine\u2019s actions to win back territory. The media strategy seems right out of Russia\u2019s media playbook; Western military analysts have noted Russia\u2019s savvy at what they have called \u201chybrid wars\u201d that blend lethal force with aggressive (and positive) press coverage.For reporters, press passes to travel in rebel-held territory were invaluable for avoiding arrest, duct-taped hands or detention in a basement. To get the coveted slips of paper, journalists visited Angela, a witty woman known as the \u201caccreditation queen.\u201dAngela worked in a seventh-floor office of the separatist headquarters in central Donetsk. Reaching her space meant trekking up a dark stairwell festooned with coarse propaganda for the anti-Western cause: One drawing showed President Obama\u2019s head on the body of a monkey; another showed a Ukrainian politician, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, dressed in a Nazi uniform.With few exceptions, Angela cheerily printed out press passes for anyone who asked \u2014 other than reporters from government-controlled Ukraine.Many Ukrainians remain outraged that, as they see it, the Russian-backed groups have been able to deftly amplify their message with the megaphone of the Western media \u2014 despite the rebels\u2019 virulently anti-Western agenda. The war has now killed more than 10,000 people.Still, Ukraine\u2019s ombudsman, Valeria Lutkovska, condemned the release of the journalists\u2019 names and urged the authorities to shut down the Kiev-based website for revealing personal information.

On the heels of that announcement, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with some 900 lawyers, also said it would bump up its associates\u2019 pay scale to match.The three leading firms will now pay associates on a scale that rises from $180,000 for first-year associates to $315,000 a year, or slightly more, after eight years of service. In addition, associates can earn annual bonuses, which range from $15,000 for the newest lawyers to as much as $100,000 for more seasoned ones.Scott A. Edelman, Milbank\u2019s chairman, said the firm\u2019s new salary scale, set to take effect on July 1, did not come about \u201cbecause of agitation or demands from our associates\u201d but was intended \u201cto ensure the firm\u2019s attorneys were paid consistent with the top firms.\u201dThe decision to move speedily on raising salaries was made, he said, because \u201cwe wanted our associates to know how much we value them. We didn\u2019t want a lot of speculation about that, so we decided to do it quickly.\u201dMilbank, which has 640 lawyers and earned $771 million in revenue last year, gives annual bonuses to all of its lawyers, Mr. Edelman said.Even as the leading firms moved in near concert to increase salaries, this was not happy news for clients.

They are not just going into private equity but choosing, for example, start-ups or going in-house at places like Facebook or Google.\u201dWhile the most prestigious firms will offer more because high pay is a sign of premier status, the pay raise, he noted, squeezes the layer of firms just below the superelite.\u201cMany firms in the middle are now face-to-face with an unwelcome and unavoidable decision\u201d over whether to pay an additional $20,000 to each new lawyer recruit, Mr. MacEwen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christian Pulisic Is the Greatest Thing Since ... What? Slow Down", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported bySANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 Christian Pulisic and his father, Mark, were video chatting on Sunday from separate continents. They had a lot of things to discuss.The previous night in Kansas City, Kan., Pulisic, at 17 years 212 days, had become the youngest player to score a goal for the United States national team \u2014 at least in the institutional memory of American soccer and for certain since 1990, when the federation began stringent record keeping. Mark Pulisic had watched the game from Verl, Germany, reclined on a hotel bed with an iPad in his hands. As he fought off sleep in the middle of the night, the sight of his son celebrating had had the surreal feeling of a dream.Their conversation the next day, though, turned out to be short. Everything was awesome, his son told him, but actually, he added, he needed to run. He had to go eat with the guys.\u201cTypical teenager,\u201d Mark Pulisic said later, laughing. \u201cNot too interested in divulging information to his parents.\u201dThat combination of obvious talent and tangible early success, in turn, has begun a familiar American swirl of hype, expectation and apprehension.It is a process that has made people close to him uneasy.\u201cWe\u2019re just accustomed to having that guy \u2014 whether in basketball, baseball \u2014 that superstar in a global stage,\u201d said Bill Belcher, who played professional indoor soccer with Mark Pulisic and has invited Christian to train with the Harrisburg City Islanders, the U.S.L. team he now coaches. \u201cAny time a young kid comes along who looks like he has potential, we want to anoint him as The One. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair to any kid to heap that on him at such a young age.\u201dFriends, family members, coaches and teammates have lauded Pulisic\u2019s level head and humble attitude. They say he has maintained a quiet, deferential presence around his older teammates, but they have embraced him as a colleague \u2014 even if Kyle Beckerman, a 34-year-old midfielder, could only laugh when asked what it was like to have a teammate half his age.Pulisic\u2019s confidence emerged from a young age. Growing up in Hershey, Pa., he generally played two years above his age. When he trained as a 14-year-old with Becher\u2019s team, it was with men in their 20s and 30s. He rarely dominated games, but his physical and psychological limits were constantly pushed.\u201cMy dad taught me, like, no matter what, when I go out and play against these bigger players, just to be myself,\u201d Pulisic said this week. \u201cI knew that I was good enough and that I had the ability to. I never shy away from anyone, and I don\u2019t think anyone should.\u201dEven before his teenage years, Pulisic could play the ball with either foot and had an innate sense of movement. But he was always small for his age. The early teenage years can be a worrisome period for soccer players and the coaches monitoring them, and Pulisic faced the normal questions: Will he grow? Will his muscles develop? Will the developments manifest as strength, or clumsiness?A timely growth spurt as he was training in U.S. Soccer\u2019s youth residency program helped attract the attention of overseas clubs, including Dortmund.\u201cOnce he got that quickness and burst, it really brought out all the ability he already had,\u201d said Steve Klein, a family friend who helped coach Pulisic at the club and youth national team levels.In 2014, Pulisic and his father moved to Dortmund, where they live now in a four-bedroom townhouse. (Mark Pulisic took a youth coaching position at Dortmund when Christian signed there as a 16-year-old last January.) His sister, stepbrother and mother, Kelley, still live in the United States. Pulisic is too young to drive in Germany, so he gets rides to practice from his father and takes the train around the city. After two years of daily lessons, and games of pickup basketball and H-O-R-S-E at Dortmund\u2019s training site, he speaks German conversationally.Dortmund has been conscious of controlling Pulisic\u2019s media exposure this spring, even as his play began to attract international attention, and Mark Pulisic was happy to learn this week that U.S. Soccer was limiting his son\u2019s media obligations to postgame interviews.But the attention may keep growing, particularly if Pulisic plays well at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he is expected, at least in the early going, to provide Klinsmann with a spark off the bench. Already, he has showed flashes of the subtle traits that capture fans\u2019 imaginations, and hinted at bigger things: a feathery first touch, elastic ankles, rhythmic running and a willingness to mix it up.Michael Bradley, the United States captain, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see right away that he has some special qualities, in terms of his ability to move with the ball, to be light on his feet, to put defenders on the wrong foot, to play in that spot out wide but be a threat in different ways, in terms of his movement, in terms of playing from out to in. I think we all have to understand that he\u2019s still very young, and there\u2019s going to be the normal ups and downs that go with that, that are there with any player.\u201dPulisic received a loud cheer on Saturday when he entered the Bolivia game for the final 20 minutes. Fans behind one of the goals began chanting his name before he even touched the ball. His goal, in the 69th minute, was a simple finish and, in a blowout game, largely trivial. But the entire team jogged over to congratulate Pulisic as he celebrated. His forehead came up only to the shoulders of most of his teammates.After the game, he stood for a short interview in which he played down his first goal.When he was finished, he walked over to sign autographs for a small group of waiting fans.Typical teenager stuff.Advertisement"}

Both players, but particularly Williams, could sign new deals with the team.With those anticipated opt-outs, the Knicks will have roughly $30 million to improve their roster with free-agent signings. With only seven players now signed for next season, they may have to scramble to fill out the bench, especially if they land one of the more desirable free agents, like point guard Mike Conley Jr., an unrestricted free agent who has played nine seasons for the Memphis Grizzlies.Afflalo\u2019s opt-out was expected after he was demoted from the starting lineup. The coaching staff was unhappy with his shot selection at shooting guard and with his defense. The option year would have paid Afflalo $8 million.Williams, an athletic 6-foot-8 forward, had a fairly productive season off the bench, averaging 9.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. He would have made $5.1 million in 2016-17. Depending on how their free-agent pursuit goes, the Knicks could try to re-sign Williams, but with so many teams operating with cap space, the 25-year-old Williams figures to earn a good raise.Among their unsigned players, the Knicks are known to be most interested in retaining Lance Thomas, a favorite of the team president, Phil Jackson. Thomas will also merit a raise from the $1.65 million he made last season.The Knicks do not have a pick in the draft on Thursday night, although Jackson has indicated he is shopping to get one. Last year, he made two draft trades, swapping Tim Hardaway Jr. for point guard Jerian Grant, who was taken with the 19th pick in the first round out of Notre Dame.In the second round, Jackson acquired the 35th pick from Philadelphia, Willy Hernang\u00f3mez, a 6-10 Spaniard and a former teammate of Kristap Porzingis\u2019s with Sevilla in Spain.Jackson believes Hernang\u00f3mez could be the equivalent of a late first-round draft pick and hopes he will join the Knicks next season.

{"Headline": "One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cLet me explain why.\u201dJeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn \u201cto control our own destiny.\u201dBut there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn\u2019s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}

They were stopped by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in New Jersey at 7:40 a.m. Tuesday. They had a cracked windshield, the police said, and were arrested after the authorities said they found illegal guns and ammunition in the car, as well as a small amount of marijuana.The group was not traveling inconspicuously.Its vehicle, a black Dodge truck with red paint and neon green trim, was plastered with decals celebrating gun culture, including a large image of cross hairs, an allusion to the Second Amendment, and an advertisement for Higher Ground Tactical, the shooting range Mr. Cramsey operates in Emmaus, Pa.Photographs of the truck drew wide attention as they circulated on social media.On Wednesday, the three were arraigned before Judge Sheila A. Venable of Hudson County Superior Court in New Jersey and charged on several counts, including unlawful weapons possession, illegal transportation of a firearm, and possession of one pill of Valium and one pill of Xanax each. Mr. Cramsey and Ms. Arendt were also charged for possession of less than 50 grams of marijuana.The three appeared in court via closed circuit television. Judge Venable declined their lawyers\u2019 requests to lower bail from $75,000.Mr. Cramsey\u2019s lawyer, James Lisa, said that his client was legally able to transport the weapons because of his ownership of the gun range. Both Mr. Lisa and Mario Blanch, the lawyer representing Mr. Smith, who the police said drove the vehicle, argued that it had been unlawfully stopped and searched.\u201cIt was not a big enough crack; it was what was on the car rather than the windshield,\u201d Mr. Lisa said. \u201cPolice officers saw the decals and paintings basically expounding the Second Amendment.\u201dThomas Zuppa Jr., an assistant prosecutor with the Hudson County prosecutor\u2019s office, said that the weapons could have been used dangerously. \u201cThis is not just an ordinary gun case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis conduct had the potential to bring danger.\u201dThe Port Authority police said they recovered five pistols, an AR-15 assault rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun.\u201cThis is a disease,\u201d Mr. Cramsey said, his voice trembling.He initially \u201cwanted vengeance\u201d on the person who sold the drugs to his daughter, he said, and noted that he had a shirt, as well as a decal on his truck, that said, \u201cShoot your local heroin dealer.\u201d\u201cI searched a little deeper and found out that he had a little 3-year-old girl. That 3-year-old girl two years ago lost her mom to heroin. So the thought of taking him out wouldn\u2019t make me any better a man,\u201d Mr. Cramsey said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve changed my tune. I\u2019m the inoculation to this disease.\u201dMr. Cramsey\u2019s daughter, Alexandria, died on Feb. 21 in an accidental death from heroin and fentanyl toxicity, according to the Lehigh County, Pa., coroner\u2019s office.A New York City Police Department spokesman would not comment on Mr. Cramsey\u2019s contention in his Facebook post that he was going to save a 16-year-old in Brooklyn. The spokesman referred questions to the Port Authority police, who also declined to comment.On Wednesday, reporters asked Mr. Lisa why there were so many weapons in his client\u2019s car.\u201cNo comment,\u201d he replied.Ashley Southall contributed reporting, and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

Instead, it was more the product of independent local efforts that caught fire through social media.Mr. Gonzales\u2019s group was one of many that arrived on Thursday to express disapproval of Mr. Trump, who has angered many critics with proposals they consider to be anti-immigrant. While protest organizers and attendees said that violence was not their intention, clashes with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have become increasingly common.The disturbances are the result of a combustible mix: the passion of the anti-Trump movement and, on the other side, the often fiery oratory of Mr. Trump himself, who at a rally this year in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, went so far as to urge his supporters to \u201cknock the crap\u201d out of protesters at the event.On Friday, Mr. Trump, who has taken some measures to quell violence inside his events, lashed out at those who created the chaos at Thursday\u2019s event. At a rally in Redding, Calif., Mr. Trump said his supporters \u201cgot accosted by a bunch of thugs burning the American flag.\u201dThe genesis of Thursday night\u2019s protest through social media suggests that tensions accompanying Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies are likely to continue.Michael Joseph, 27, a community organizer, learned from his Facebook news feed that anti-Trump protests were planned for Thursday\u2019s rally. A Native American who supports the Democratic campaign of Mr. Sanders and loathes what Mr. Trump has said about both women and immigrants, Mr. Joseph said he was appalled by the violence that he saw against supporters of Mr. Trump and did his best to break up the melee.\u201cThere\u2019s no justification in hurting others whatsoever, regardless of your political stances,\u201d said Mr. Joseph, who attended the protest with three friends. \u201cI\u2019m pretty disgusted with last night\u2019s \u2018Dump Trump\u2019 protests.\u201dJoshua Tucker, a New York University political science professor who studies social media and political participation, said protest movements that develop on their own, rather than ones organized by a single leader, can be more chaotic because people are reacting to what happens on the street and are given little guidance on decorum.According to those who attended, the several hundred people outside Mr. Trump\u2019s rally were a mix of immigrants\u2019 rights groups, union workers, members of nonprofit organizations and individuals who wanted to voice their concerns.The attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters could have some political benefit for the presumptive Republican nominee, whose backers have been accused of being unruly at his events during the campaign. Embracing the role of the victim, Mr. Trump has been able to paint his critics as the ones sullying the democratic discourse.The protests are also problematic for Democrats. Mrs. Clinton, who has accused Mr. Trump of inciting violence in the past, faced the awkward situation of having to denounce the actions of people speaking out against her likely opponent in the general election.\u201cI condemn all violence in our political arena,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging it. I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump.\u201dThe precise cause for the violence on Thursday night remains unclear. Some protesters claimed that supporters of Mr. Trump instigated it, while others who were there said the violence was escalated by the sudden presence of a few local gang members.\u201cI saw a couple kids that I knew from the neighborhoods that I know run with the local Norte\u00f1os and Sure\u00f1os, and they were just there to fight,\u201d said James Anderson, who lives in San Jose and was attending a protest organized by a Dump Trump Facebook group. \u201cThey weren\u2019t there to protest anything. They were just there to cause havoc and fight.\u201dFor Cesar Juarez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who teaches at a high school in San Jose, the protest was a teaching moment that went awry. After one of his students told him about the protest, he decided to take a group from the school so they could experience the political process in person. But once fists were thrown, he had to abruptly end the class trip.\u201cI kind of sensed that this crowd was getting too rowdy,\u201d he said, \u201cSo I told them, \u2018Let\u2019s leave.\u2019\u201dHowever the protests have come together, they are unlikely to abate any time soon. While Mr. Trump was speaking on Friday in an airplane hangar in Redding, some 88,000 people were talking about \u201cStop Trump\u201d on Facebook. Officials in Cleveland are bracing for rowdy streets next month during the Republican Party\u2019s convention.And Mr. Trump has little chance of avoiding protesters this month when he embarks on his overseas trip. An opposition group has already created a \u201cStand Up to Trump\u201d Facebook page to organize a frosty welcome for the candidate in Ireland. So far, more than 215 protesters have signed up to attend.Nick Corasaniti reported from Redding, Calif., and Alan Rappeport reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Misogyny", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 My mother fled South Korea for two years in her 20s because she couldn\u2019t stomach her domineering father. On her return, she was married off to my conservative father, whom she gradually realized she didn\u2019t care for. Divorce was still taboo, so she opted to go to Canada with me in tow. The pretext for this long-distance marriage was my education, but it was also for her freedom from patriarchal expectations.More than two decades have passed. She keeps her address in Canada but now spends considerable time with my father in Seoul. She also dines occasionally with her father, a frail man in his 90s. The arrangement works since the men in her life have grown subdued and she has more say over her life. With time, gender equality came to our family. Patiently waiting for improvement in gender relations, however, is not a strategy for South Korea.The country awoke on May 17 to shocking news that a young woman had been stabbed to death in a bar restroom in a busy shopping district in Seoul. Reports of murder are hardly rare in this country, but the 30-something male suspect\u2019s motive stunned people. After the arrest, he told the police that he committed the crime because women had always ignored him.The incident prompted testimonials from many women about the amount of misogyny they endure. A large number of men, in turn, dismissed the notion that the killing was an act of misogyny and said that women were being hysterical.Many men would rather not acknowledge that South Korea is an entrenched patriarchy and that toxic gender relations are taking a toll on society. Women\u2019s status has stalled in the 21st century. Too many of them are treated like second-class citizens and suffer undue violence, objectification and discrimination.There is no easy solution, but one important step would be to pass the anti-discrimination bill, which has stalled in the National Assembly for nearly a decade. It would mandate equal treatment for everyone regardless of gender or other factors. A clearly worded law would signal that women and minorities deserve equal rights.It\u2019s only on the surface that South Korea has made strides toward equality for women. The first female president currently leads the nation. We have an independent ministry of gender equality and family. Some 24-hour convenience stores are designated as places of refuge for women fleeing harm.Still, the reality for South Korean women remains bleak.Women made up 86 percent of all violent crime victims in 2013, according to police data (most violent crime is sexual in nature, and women suffer disproportionately from sexual crimes). Women aren\u2019t safe at home, either: Reports of violence against women perpetrated by their husbands have been rising in recent years.Women fare just as poorly in how they\u2019re depicted. South Korean movies often show images of unimaginable cruelty toward the female body. A popular television cooking show recently described sizzling strips of pork belly as \u201cbetter-looking than the rear\u201d of a young girl-group member.It\u2019s no wonder then that the World Economic Forum ranks the country 115th out of 145 countries in gender equality. Women earn only two-thirds of what men earn, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. Women made up 2.3 percent of corporate executives at 348 of the largest 500 companies in South Korea in 2015 (others were exempt from reporting).The typical male response to the May 17 killing hints at just how deep misogyny runs. Men invaded the memorial websites for the victim and flooded comment sections, telling women they were overreacting.\u201cYou are as helpless as you let yourself be,\u201d one man said on Facebook.The culture of misogyny and gender inequality may be affecting family life, in a country facing predictions of population collapse. Research shows that a low fertility rate in developed countries reflects backward attitudes over female gender roles. Last year, the South Korean marriage rate tumbled to the lowest level in 12 years, and the birth rate is perennially one of the lowest in the world.Meanwhile, South Korean men hold the record for doing the least amount of housework among the men in the world\u2019s most developed countries \u2014 an average of just 45 minutes per day, or one-fifth of the time a South Korean woman spends.As gender discussions heated up after the bar killing, the police asked the Korea Communications Standards Commission, the agency in charge of monitoring the internet, to delete online posts, which were said to exacerbate the tensions, in order to \u201cprevent online conflicts from manifesting as society-wide conflicts.\u201dThe government routinely scrubs what it deems unsavory from the internet, so this action wasn\u2019t unusual. But in this case \u2014 removing individual citizens\u2019 posts that used colorful language to express low opinions of men or women \u2014 it simply shut down the debate about women in society. Stifling speech is no cure for a rot deep inside South Korea.Passing the long-stalled anti-discrimination bill would help reduce discrimination, create legal protections and compensation, and, hopefully, reduce misogyny. Although various United Nations conventions urge adoption of such a law, similar efforts have failed three times in the National Assembly since 2007 due to objections from the evangelical lobby and the business community.My mother has made peace with her life. It\u2019s her father who now regrets having infringed on her freedom. \u201cYou could\u2019ve become a somebody,\u201d he repeats at family meals, recalling her various talents. His change of heart comes too late for her, but it\u2019s not too late to give respect to South Korean women of new generations.Se-Woong Koo is the managing editor of Korea Expos\u00e9, an online magazine specializing in the Korean Peninsula.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Dirty", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisOVER the course of the past two months, Donald J. Trump has assailed Hillary Clinton as \u201ca world-class liar,\u201d suggested that she had a role in the death of a White House aide while Bill Clinton was president, darkly referenced Mr. Clinton\u2019s marital affairs and said \u2014 in a 41-minute rip of a speech on Tuesday \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton had \u201cperfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\u201d Once again, the nation seems to be marching toward another brutally nasty presidential campaign, with Mr. Trump leading the parade.But in a year when so many staples of American politics have faltered \u2014 television advertisements, polling, big-ticket endorsements, to name a few \u2014 will the negative campaign, whether wielded by Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, be the reliable weapon it has proved to be in presidential campaigns over the course of American history? Is there anything left to say about two candidates who are so well known and so polarizing?And Mr. Trump, whom Mrs. Clinton hammered with a series of hard-hitting television advertisements about his temperament over the past week, is in even worse shape in that poll: 70 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him. He has been pelted with damaging information. That did not stop him from sweeping aside a packed Republican field and briefly leading Mrs. Clinton in some national polls.\u201cThis is probably just a different ballgame,\u201d said Deborah J. Brooks, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \u201cIt seems like they are at historically high levels of unfavorable ratings, and they are better known than other candidates. It makes it really hard to compare to past races.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s gone way beyond anything I\u2019ve seen over the past 40 years of campaigns,\u201d said Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution. \u201cCandidates typically worry about a backlash from going negative. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to worry about a backlash.\u201dMost candidates, concerned about voters turning on them for being negative, try to leave the toughest attacks to television advertisements or surrogates, such as a running mate. Not Mr. Trump. He has happily done them himself \u2014 in TV appearances, speeches and tweets. (That said, his anemic campaign finance report released last week suggests that he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for advertisements.)In the process, Mr. Trump has often barged past the boundaries of propriety and truth, and at no apparent cost, at least among his supporters. In recent years, presidential campaigns have made it a practice to release detailed documentation of the charges they make in negative advertisements or speeches: a list of votes, transcripts from interviews, legal documents. Media organizations have become increasingly rigorous in policing advertisements, calling out errors and falsehoods that could prove an unwanted embarrassment for the campaign making the accusation.This has not been the case with Mr. Trump. \u201cYou say, \u2018My opponent did this,\u2019 so you have to provide some evidence that they did something,\u201d said Richard R. Lau, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. \u201cBut Trump doesn\u2019t care what the truth is. Trump has gotten so much free advertising for saying outrageous things.\u201dHis approach, attention-grabbing and arguably entertaining, served him well in the crowded field of a Republican primary. But Mr. Trump is now competing for support among a much broader electorate, and against a candidate who has far more experience in presidential campaigns \u2014 and in being the target of all kinds of attacks.Indeed, many analysts said, there is a strong argument that he is vulnerable to a negative campaign in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. Opinions on Mrs. Clinton seem set in cement at this point; short of her being indicted, it\u2019s hard to imagine information that could dramatically change voters\u2019 opinions of her.By contrast, Mr. Trump may be one of the most famous people on the planet, but his life off the public stage has not received much scrutiny, as became clear with the revelations about Trump University, described by some of its students as a fraud.\u201cWhile people know who Donald Trump is, they do not know a lot about him,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who worked for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign and first presidential campaign. \u201cThere is very little awareness of his business record, or other aspects of his career. I think when a story runs about the number of lawsuits he\u2019s been engaged in or the number of people he\u2019s sued or the number of people he\u2019s stiffed payment, that\u2019s new information.\u201dNegative campaigning, as much as voters say they disapprove of it, tends to work. With its dark and detailed invocations of a candidate\u2019s votes and quotes, a negative campaign can provide voters with the type of information they need to make an informed choice.The most effective attacks portray a candidate as ideologically or culturally alien, unqualified for the job or a threat to national security or the economy.In 2004, President George W. Bush lampooned his Democratic opponent, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, with a video clip of Mr. Kerry in a wet suit that made him appear to be windsurfing back and forth across the water. It made Mr. Kerry seem slightly effete, while reinforcing a central Bush critique of Mr. Kerry\u2019s candidacy: that he was a flip-flopper.Four years later, during the Democratic primary in Texas, Mrs. Clinton broadcast an advertisement showing a young girl sleeping peacefully in bed as a telephone rings in the background at 3 a.m., presumably with bad news. Supporters of Mr. Obama were riled, but it raised legitimate questions about the ability of Mr. Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois, to deal with a breaking foreign crisis.No matter the obstacles, there are powerful incentives for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton to turn to negative campaigning. The sheer volume of attacks churning the political ecosphere \u2014 on Facebook, Twitter and cable news \u2014 means it takes a lot for a candidate to break through. \u201cThe news media love to cover the negativity,\u201d said John G. Geer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University. \u201cAnd the ad people know it.\u201dAnd with their high unfavorable ratings, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have considerable strategic motivation to go on the attack.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager until he was forced out last week, said in an interview before his departure there was still much left to tell voters about the former secretary of state.\u201cLook, if you remember during the first Clinton administration \u2014 when Bill was there \u2014 that was 16 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people forget what he was like as a president, and what his policies were. Particularly new voters. And I think many people overlook what Hillary Clinton\u2019s record was like as United States senator.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t started,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there is an opportunity to remind people that her career in public service goes well beyond secretary of state.\u201dJoel Benenson, who is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior strategist, was similarly bullish on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects for making the case against Mr. Trump. Mr. Benenson said Mr. Trump had largely been spared during the primaries.\u201cThey didn\u2019t take him on,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cThey were running in a primary, they were competing for like-minded voters. You have to draw meaningful contrasts and they didn\u2019t do that.\u2019\u2019\u201cEverything he represents and that he is showing day after day is how dangerous and divisive he is and how that undermines our national security and will crash our economy,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen we make a choice, you want to know the good and bad about who you are considering,\u201d Mr. Geer said. \u201cCandidates will only tell you that they are wonderful.\u201dAdam Nagourney is Los Angeles bureau chief and a former chief national political correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion, Reasserting Its Muscle", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft\u2019s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.The deal is Microsoft\u2019s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.It is also further evidence that Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, sees the company\u2019s future further and further removed from the PC software that once helped the company\u2019s co-founder Bill Gates turn Microsoft into the world\u2019s most valuable company.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition.\u201cThis deal is all about bringing together the professional cloud and professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a telephone interview.So valuable is the data that recruiters spend thousands of dollars a month to use it to fill job openings.\u201cThey know the interconnections of the business world,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \u201cThat could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.\u201dMicrosoft has bought its way into new businesses before, though most of its largest deals have not turned out well. In 2014, it paid nearly $9.4 billion for the smartphone operations of Nokia and some years earlier spent more than $6 billion for aQuantive, an internet advertising company, but ended up writing off most of the value of those deals after they performed poorly.In its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Nadella, who took over as chief executive in February 2014, was not involved in those deals. Since assuming leadership of the company, he has made mostly smaller acquisitions, with the exception of the $2.5 billion deal to acquire the maker of the game Minecraft.Mr. Nadella said that when Microsoft pursued deals that hewed closer to a strict set of criteria, one of which is that the acquired company operates in areas that are core to Microsoft\u2019s business, the deals have worked out.\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve gotten it right, we\u2019ve had success in those dimensions,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.In a joint interview, Mr. Nadella and Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, said that their conversations began in February, when the two began talking about different ways in which the companies could work together.Mr. Weiner, for his part, said he began thinking about a LinkedIn combination with Microsoft long before he sat down with Mr. Nadella. He and Mr. Nadella first met a couple of years ago at a conference for chief executives at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of admiration for the work Satya had done since taking over as C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.Microsoft was once a reviled company in Silicon Valley, where LinkedIn is based, but as its dominance in the industry ebbed it came to seem far less threatening.Mr. Nadella has further improved Microsoft\u2019s image in the technology industry by being more open to partnerships with once-bitter tech rivals like Salesforce.com. He has accelerated the company\u2019s shift from traditional software to cloud applications and services, and its stock has risen significantly under his leadership.And with more than $100 billion in cash and short-term investments as its disposal, Microsoft is an attractive suitor for companies that decide they are better off joining forces with a bigger entity.Microsoft is paying considerably less for LinkedIn than it would have just last fall, when LinkedIn shares were trading over $260 a share. Disappointing earnings helped slash the value of the company. The deal calls for Microsoft to pay $196 a share to buy LinkedIn, a healthy premium to the $131.08 its shares closed at on Friday.\u201cThis is a good time for LinkedIn to sell,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. \u201cThey lost money last year. They\u2019ve found it\u2019s very expensive to keep growing. They\u2019re probably as valuable as they will ever be.\u201dYet big challenges remain for the company in today\u2019s technology landscape, where new powerhouses like Amazon.com, the leader in cloud computing, have a significant head start.LinkedIn could help Microsoft accelerate its shift to the internet by giving it a large online property that has became the de facto standard for posting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s online. The site is heavily used by recruiters for finding new workers. Microsoft is one of LinkedIn\u2019s biggest customers.\u201cThe mission statements of LinkedIn and Microsoft have different words, but are essentially the same,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come at it from different perspectives.

{"Headline": "Brexit Would Be a Colossal Blunder", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byBARI, Italy \u2014 The prospect that Britain might next week commit an act of national folly by voting to leave the European Union has politicians throughout Europe alarmed. Integration has been the Continent\u2019s leitmotif for more than six decades. Fracture would suddenly be underway. And what would be left?\u201cIf a British withdrawal were seen by Germany as opening the way to govern Europe as a Germanic federation, the European Union will fall apart,\u201d Michele Emiliano, the president of the southern Puglia region, told me in an interview. \u201cEurope can only function as a union of equal states. Under German dominion, it would contain the genes of its dissolution.\u201dGermany has already become what the postwar strategic architecture of Europe was designed to prevent: the Continent\u2019s most powerful nation. But Britain, through the size of its economy, has played an offsetting role. Absent Britain, Germany would loom larger still, a source of alarm to the economically weaker Mediterranean states.Postwar Italy was fragile, torn between the West and Communism, between \u201cscaling the Alps\u201d and succumbing to the Mafia-suffused inertia of the south, or mezzogiorno. European Union membership was the country\u2019s anchor and magnet, securing it in the free and democratic Western family, luring it toward prosperity. Now that role is played most conspicuously for newer members of the union. But its importance persists.Emiliano, a former mafia-combating public prosecutor, heads a region that is its own tribute to the union\u2019s quiet miracles. Puglia, long a languishing part of the chronically underdeveloped south, is now an area of fast-growing industry and tourism, the poster child of the generally depressed mezzogiorno. Like other outlying regions of the E.U., it has been slowly tugged through stability toward the living standards of the European core.In a Facebook post, Martin Fletcher, a former foreign editor of The Times of London, put these European Union achievements well. \u201cContrary to the cartoon caricature of the E.U. we read about in the national press,\u201d he wrote, the union \u201chas cemented peace in Europe. It allows younger generations to live and work anywhere in Europe in a way my generation could only dream about. It has vastly simplified travel across the Continent. It has brought Eastern Europe into the family of free, democratic nations after decades of Soviet control. It has broken up powerful monopolies and cartels in a way national governments acting alone could not. It has forced member states to clean up the environment.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe would be willfully removing ourselves from a single market of 500 million people without the faintest idea whether, or on what terms, we would be allowed to continue trading with 27 E.U. states who would want to punish us. Why on earth would we take such a monumental risk?\u201dThe answer is that this huge gamble would be taken for the chimera of restored \u201csovereignty.\u201d It would reflect petulant nationalism, base bigotry and laughable little England pretensions. Fletcher expressed the reality behind all this with laconic bluntness: \u201cAs a single country we would have minimal influence on world affairs. Does anyone seriously think the prospect of British sanctions would alarm Vladimir Putin, or have persuaded Iran to curtail its nuclear program?\u201dThe European Union has significant failings, many of them precipitated by the sudden end of the Cold War, the reach to embrace states formerly enslaved in Moscow\u2019s imperium, and the flawed attempt to contain a united Germany by integrating it into a common currency called the euro. It is, as an overarching European structure, short on democracy and long on bureaucracy. But, as Italy\u2019s postwar development demonstrates, its achievements far outweigh its problems, which Britain could play a leading role in addressing.\u201cPolitics is about seizing the moment, interpreting what history has given you the responsibility to do,\u201d Emiliano told me. \u201cThanks to the Americans who landed on Sicilian beaches, I have the freedom to speak and you the freedom to write. I never forget this. If politics is not about respecting the past to secure the future, it is merely a mirror you gaze in, a form of narcissism.\u201dSuch narcissism is rampant in Britain and America these days. For Britain to succumb to its delusions and leave the union would be a colossal blunder of historic proportions.When in Italy, I often think of my late uncle, Bert Cohen, who, as an officer of the 6th South African Armored Division, 19th Field Ambulance, fought the entire Italian campaign, moving up the peninsula from south to north. After the Allied victory, he visited Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps, on September 2, 1945, and went up to Hitler\u2019s mountain retreat, the Eagle\u2019s Nest. He etched his name on the F\u00fchrer\u2019s table. What sweet retribution to have \u201cCohen\u201d inscribed there!Later, he made his life in Britain \u2014 the home of a freedom that, to him, was not insular but European and universal. To vote out would also betray that inscription and all it stands for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mexico City, a Battle Over a Building and the Art in Its Shadow", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 It is a simple sculpture: 64 concrete pyramids that stand in a perfect circle around two-and-a-half acres of rippling, black volcanic rock.Known as \u201cEspacio Escult\u00f3rico\u201d (\u201cSculptural Space\u201d), the sculpture was inaugurated in 1979 here on the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It is considered one of the most important pieces of land art in Mexico, a tranquil oasis in a chaotic city. But the recent construction of a white eight-story building nearby has prompted a furious protest that pits the university\u2019s needs against Mexico\u2019s cultural heritage.For the artists, the building, which belongs to the social science faculty, ruins the line of the sky against the flat tops of the pyramids.\u201cAll the great works of land art \u2014 the horizon is how they function,\u201d the artist Anish Kapoor said in an interview at the site last week. Anything that intrudes on the art, he said, \u201ctakes away some of the poetic, unnameable qualities of the work.\u201dAbout two dozen artists have said they would be willing to auction works to pay to move the building \u2014 among them Mr. Kapoor, a show of whose work opened at the University Museum of Contemporary Art here on Saturday.\u201cYou can\u2019t move the lava. You can\u2019t move the landscape,\u201d said Pedro Reyes, a sculptor who is leading the campaign to dismantle Building H, as it is known. \u201cSo you have to move the building.\u201dSome students raised concerns last year about several construction projects on campus, including Building H, but it was not until Mr. Reyes visited the sculpture in February that he saw the finished building and began campaigning.Much land art, in which the landscape is integral to the work, is remote and can be huge, such as Robert Smithson\u2019s \u201cSpiral Jetty,\u201d on the shore of Great Salt Lake in Utah, and Michael Heizer\u2019s vast, unfinished sculpture \u201cCity,\u201d in the Nevada desert.Patricia Mart\u00edn, an independent curator in Mexico City, said Building H was typical of rampant Mexican construction where \u201cpeople do not make the effort to think\u201d what the impact will be.The ruckus \u201craises a public debate about how to think about space, how to think about art, how a building looks,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThat is healthy.\u201dBut the university says it will not destroy a building that it paid over a $1 million for and that is being used for classes and research.Marcos Mazari Hiriart, director of the architecture faculty, said the construction was a \u201cmistake\u201d and had \u201cdamaged\u201d the horizon of \u201cEspacio Escult\u00f3rico.\u201d But the problem could be remedied by camouflaging the building, not demolishing it, he said.Besides, Mr. Mazari said, the artwork, which stands in a nearly 600-acre ecological reserve that occupies a third of the university campus, was not intended to be protected in perpetuity from intrusion by other construction.\u201cIs it urban art or land art?\u201d he said.Arguing that the land around the work only became a reserve \u2014 and a serendipitous buffer \u2014 a few years after the sculpture was made, he said, \u201cIt became land art over time.\u201dBuilding H does not break any regulations, said Sergio Boeta Angeles, a lawyer in Mexico City who specializes in cultural heritage. \u201cThere is no legal basis for not building it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question.\u201dThe sculpture was a collaboration among six Mexican artists: Helen Escobedo; Manuel Felgu\u00e9rez; Mathias Goeritz; Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez Su\u00e1rez, known as Hers\u00faa; Federico Silva; and Enrique Carbajal, known as Sebasti\u00e1n. Its centerpiece is a naturally formed, jagged mound of 2,000-year-old lava rock that seems still to be bubbling from the earth. Around that stand the pyramids, evenly spaced with a slightly wider gap at the four cardinal points.The work is surrounded by scrubland filled with indigenous plants. Building H is not the only construction that is visible, but it is taller than most and on higher ground.In a city struggling with violence, pollution and chaotic planning, a fuss over one building could seem trivial, Mr. Reyes said. But it is all the more reason to respect the sculpture, he said.\u201cMexico needs peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the most peaceful place in Mexico City.\u201dAllowing the building to stay would set a poor precedent, some said. \u201cIf they leave that building there, who knows what else they\u2019ll build,\u201d said Cesar Cervantes, 27, a geography student who was sitting on the edge of the circle last week.Mr. Mazari said that the university would hold a workshop this month to discuss remedies for Building H \u2013 painting it blue, growing plants over it, planting trees to hide it, covering it with mirrors. The university has formed a committee to monitor campus construction, he said.But the building\u2019s opponents insist the building must go, or its top few floors should be removed so it is no longer visible from the sculpture, a remedy Mr. Mazari calls impractical. If money is the main obstacle, the artists say, they will foot the bill.\u201cWorks like this represent what can be done,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cThey must be looked after.\u201d The fight against the building was \u201ca battle for the poetic spirit of the work,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe lose that in our culture, we lose everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Cemeteries Into Wine at a California Diocese", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byHayward JournalHAYWARD, Calif. \u2014 For an additional $1,000, a family can have a loved one buried near the chardonnay vines glistening in the sun, or if they prefer, near the pinot noir vines at a cemetery here in an East Bay suburb of San Francisco.The vines were planted 10 years ago as a less expensive and more water-frugal alternative to grass at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery here.But this is California, the land of gold and grapes, and the ornamental grapevines are now producing prizewinning wines.The grapevines serve another purpose. \u201cThe cemetery doesn\u2019t seem like such a sad and fearsome place when you go there and see the vines,\u201d Bishop Barber said.These are challenging times for cemetery owners, who are struggling to cover their costs, primarily upkeep of the land. The burial habits of Americans have changed, and nearly half are cremated rather than buried. In 2015, there were 1,300 burials at the Hayward cemetery, down from nearly 2,500 in 1980.\u201cCemeteries are reverting to old practices,\u201d said Keith Eggener, a professor of architectural history at the University of Oregon and the author of a book about American cemeteries. In the 19th century, \u201ccemeteries were full of beautiful trails,\u201d Dr. Eggener said. \u201cPeople would take guests and have picnics. A cemetery was considered a major ornament to a city.\u201dWhen Bishop Barber was a student at the Jesuit novitiate, a training seminary in Los Gatos, Calif., he picked grapes with a small cutting knife in the college\u2019s vineyards, planted in the 1880s, as did Jerry Brown, the current governor, who was once a student there. During the first hour of picking, they would pray in silence until \u201cthe field boss blew the whistle,\u201d the bishop said.\u201cOne nice benefit: Every night at supper they served us some wine with dinner made with grapes previously picked from the same vineyard we worked on that day,\u201d he said.Planting cemetery grapevines in 2006 was a small part of Mr. Seelig\u2019s solution for a money-losing operation.\u201cI wondered if there was a disconnect where cemeteries were no longer relevant to the modern world,\u201d Mr. Seelig said. \u201cWhat I learned is that the model had changed.\u201d The Catholic church\u2019s model \u201cneeded to be updated,\u201d he added.He cut costs, bought a funeral home with a crematory and began marketing cremations with traditional burials to counter what he saw as \u201cpush-button fix for grieving.\u201d The grapevines were a small part of the plan.At $50,000 an acre for planting grass, Mr. Seelig wondered, \u201ccould we plant something else?\u201d He thought about \u201cthe body and blood of Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going into the wine business. I was thinking of the nice foliage.\u201dAn acre of grapevines cost only $17,000 to plant.That first year they put all the cemetery grapes into a press to make ros\u00e9. But they were amazed when they evaluated some of the fruit. The chardonnay and pinot noir grapes from the Hayward cemetery were of \u201coutstanding quality,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. And the cabernet and zinfandel grapes from the nearby Holy Cross Cemetery were \u201cfantastic.\u201dThey approached Mr. Seelig with their idea: Why not make serious wine?And so the cemetery wines have become a start-up business. Unlike most, it is a nonprofit, giving most of its products \u2014 7,200 bottles of altar wine \u2014 to 45 churches. It has donated $35,000 in scholarships to parochial schools. Like most start-ups, it is not yet turning a profit, but the church is investing in the wine business and expects to break even this year. The annual costs run up to $150,000. Mr. Seelig considers it a good investment.Wine tastings are held at parishes and annually at the cemetery. Bishop Barber had one at his home to select the best wine for church altars. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be thinking of the wine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be thinking of our Lord.\u201dAt the cemeteries, the grapevines have become a destination.\u201cIt\u2019s like dynamic pricing of a baseball game,\u201d Mr. Seelig said. You pay for seating \u201cin the bleachers,\u201d but it is more expensive \u201cto be by home plate.\u201d People, he said, \u201clike ambience.\u201d It costs $5,000 to $6,000 for a burial plot near the grapes, $1,000 more than those across the street.\u201cAt our cathedral gift shop, we sell rosaries, statues of Mary and, oh, by the way, bottles of our wine,\u201d Bishop Barber said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Humiliating Practice of Sex-Testing Female Athletes", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byFeatureChand was raised in Gopalpur, a rural village in eastern India with only intermittent electricity. The family home was a small mud hut, with no running water or toilet. Her parents, weavers who earned less than $8 a week laboring on a government-issued loom, were illiterate. They had not imagined a different life for their seven children, but Chand had other ideas. Now, as she took the five-hour bus ride to Delhi from a training center in Punjab, she thought about her impending move to Bangalore for a new training program. She wondered if she would make friends, and how she\u2019d manage there without her beloved coach, who had long been by her side, strategizing about how best to run each race and joking to help her relax whenever she was nervous. She thought little of the meeting in Delhi, because she assumed it was for a doping test.But when Chand arrived in Delhi, she says, she was sent to a clinic to meet a doctor from the Athletics Federation of India \u2014 the Indian affiliate of the International Association of Athletics Federations (I.A.A.F.), which governs track and field. He told her he would forgo the usual urine and blood tests because no nurse was available, and would order an ultrasound instead. That confused Chand, but when she asked him about it, she recalls, he said it was routine.Chand had no idea that her extraordinary showing in Taipei and at a national championship earlier that month had prompted competitors and coaches to tell the federation that her physique seemed suspiciously masculine: Her muscles were too pronounced, her stride was too impressive for someone who was only five feet tall. The doctor would later deny that the ultrasound was a response to those reports, saying he ordered the scan only because Chand had previously complained of chronic abdominal pain. She contends she never had any such pain.Three days after the ultrasound, the federation sent a letter titled \u201cSubject: Gender Verification Issue\u201d to the Indian government\u2019s sports author\u00adity. \u201cIt has been brought to the notice of the undersigned that there are definite doubts regarding the gender of an Athlete Ms. Dutee Chand,\u201d the letter read. It also noted that in the past, such cases \u201chave brought embarrassment to the fair name of sports in India.\u201d The letter requested the author\u00adities perform a \u201cgender verification test\u201d on Chand.Shortly after, Chand says, she was sent to a private hospital in Bangalore, where a curt woman drew her blood to measure her level of natural testosterone, though Chand had no idea that was what was being measured. Chand also underwent a chromosome analysis, an M.R.I. and a gynecological exam that she found mortifying. To evaluate the effects of high testosterone, the international athletic association\u2019s protocol involves measuring and palpating the clitoris, vagina and labia, as well as evaluating breast size and pubic hair scored on an illustrated five-grade scale.The tests were meant to identify competitors whose chromosomes, hormones, genitalia, reproductive organs or secondary sex characteristics don\u2019t develop or align in the typical way. The word \u201chermaphrodite\u201d is considered stigmatizing, so physicians and advocates instead use the term \u201cintersex\u201d or refer to the condition as D.S.D., which stands for either a disorder or a difference of sex development. Estimates of the number of intersex people vary widely, ranging from one in 5,000 to one in 60, because experts dispute which of the myriad conditions to include and how to tally them accurately. Some intersex women, for instance, have XX chromosomes and ovaries, but because of a genetic quirk are born with ambiguous genitalia, neither male nor female. Others have XY chromosomes and undescended testes, but a mutation affecting a key enzyme makes them appear female at birth; they\u2019re raised as girls, though at puberty, rising testosterone levels spur a deeper voice, an elongated clitoris and increased muscle mass. Still other intersex women have XY chromosomes and internal testes but appear female their whole lives, developing rounded hips and breasts, because their cells are insensitive to testosterone. They, like others, may never know their sex development was unusual, unless they\u2019re tested for infertility \u2014 or to compete in world-class sports.When Chand\u2019s results came in a few days later, the doctor said her \u201cmale hormone\u201d levels were too high, meaning she produced more androgens, mostly testosterone, than most women did. The typical female range is roughly 1.0 to 3.3 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood, about one-tenth that of typical males. Chand\u2019s level is not publicly known, but it was above the 10-nanomoles-per-liter threshold that the I.A.A.F. set for female competitors because that level is within the \u201cmale range.\u201d As a result, officials said, she could no longer race.In the two years since, Chand has been at the center of a legal case that contests not only her disqualification but also the international policy her lawyers say discriminates against athletes with atypical sex development. For Chand, who had never heard the words \u201ctestosterone\u201d or \u201cintersex,\u201d it has been a slow and painful education. When she was first told she was being barred because of her testosterone level, she didn\u2019t understand anything the officials were saying. \u201cI said, \u2018What have I done that is wrong?\u2019\u2009\u201d she told me by phone in May through a Hindi translator. \u201cThen the media got my phone number and started calling me and asking about an androgen test, and I had no idea what an androgen test was. The media asked, \u2018Did you have a gender test?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What is a gender test?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe treatment of female athletes, and intersex women in particular, has a long and sordid his\u00adtory. For centuries, sport was the exclusive province of males, the competitive arena where masculinity was cultivated and proven. Sport endowed men with the physical and psychological strength that \u201cmanhood\u201d required. As women in the late 19th century encroached on explicitly male domains \u2014 sport, education, paid labor \u2014 many in society became increasingly anxious; if a woman\u2019s place wasn\u2019t immutable, maybe a man\u2019s role, and the power it entailed, were not secure either.Well into the 20th century, women were discouraged from participating in sports. Some medical experts claimed that vigorous exercise would damage women\u2019s reproductive capacity and their fragile emotional state and would make them muscular, \u201cmannish\u201d and unattractive to men. Critics fretted that athletics would unbind women from femininity\u2019s modesty and self-restraint.By the mid-1940s, international sports administrators began requiring female competitors to bring medical \u201cfemininity certificates\u201d to verify their sex. In the 1950s, many Olympics officials were so uneasy about women\u2019s participation that Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein, a member of the International Olympic Committee, spoke for many when he said he wanted to \u201cbe spared the unesthetic spectacle of women trying to look and act like men,\u201d writes Susan K. Cahn, a his\u00adtory professor at the University at Buffalo, in her book \u201cComing On Strong: Gender and Sexuality in 20th-Century Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d Others were particularly bothered by women in track and field because of the strained expressions on their faces during competition. Such female exertion violated the white middle-class ideal of femininity, as did the athletes\u2019 \u201cmasculinized\u201d physiques, prompting Olympic leaders to consider eliminating those events for women.In 1952, the Soviet Union joined the Olympics, stunning the world with the success and brawn of its female athletes. That year, women accounted for 23 of the Soviet Union\u2019s 71 medals, compared with eight of America\u2019s 76 medals. As the Olympics became another front in the Cold War, rumors spread in the 1960s that Eastern-bloc female athletes were men who bound their genitals to rake in more wins.Though those claims were never substantiated, in 1966 international sports officials decided they couldn\u2019t trust individual nations to certify femininity, and instead implemented a mandatory genital check of every woman competing at international games. In some cases, this involved what came to be called the \u201cnude parade,\u201d as each woman appeared, underpants down, before a panel of doctors; in others, it involved women\u2019s lying on their backs and pulling their knees to their chest for closer inspection. Several Soviet women who had dominated international athletics abruptly dropped out, cementing popular conviction that the Soviets had been tricking authorities. (More recently, some researchers have speculated that those athletes may have been intersex.)Amid complaints about the genital checks, the I.A.A.F. and the I.O.C. introduced a new \u201cgender verification\u201d strategy in the late \u201960s: a chromosome test. Officials considered that a more dignified, objective way to root out not only impostors but also intersex athletes, who, Olympic officials said, needed to be barred to ensure fair play. Ewa Klobukowska, a Polish sprinter, was among the first to be ousted because of that test; she was reportedly found to have both XX and XXY chromosomes. An editorial in the I.O.C. magazine in 1968 insisted the chromosome test \u201cindicates quite definitely the sex of a person,\u201d but many geneticists and endocrinologists disagreed, pointing out that sex was determined by a confluence of genetic, hormonal and physiological factors, not any one alone. Relying on science to arbitrate the male-female divide in sports is fruitless, they said, because science could not draw a line that nature itself refused to draw. They also argued that the tests discriminated against those whose anomalies provided little or no competitive edge and traumatized women who had spent their whole lives certain they were female, only to be told they were not female enough to participate.One of those competitors was Maria Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Pati\u00f1o, a 24-year-old Spanish hurdler who was to run at the 1985 World University Games in Japan. The night before the race, a team official told her that her chromosome test results were abnormal. A more detailed investigation showed that although the outside of her body was fully female, Pati\u00f1o had XY chromosomes and internal testes. But because of a genetic mutation, her cells completely resisted the testosterone she produced, so her body actually had access to less testosterone than a typical woman. Just before the Spanish national championships began, Spanish athletic officials told her she should feign an injury and withdraw from athletics permanently and without fuss. She refused. Instead, she ran the 60-meter hurdles and won, at which point someone leaked her test results to the press. Pati\u00f1o was thrown off the national team, expelled from the athletes\u2019 resi\u00addence and denied her scholarship. Her boyfriend and many friends and fellow athletes abandoned her. Her medals and records were revoked.Pati\u00f1o became the first athlete to formally protest the chromosome test and to argue that disqualification was unjustified. After nearly three years, the I.A.A.F. agreed that without being able to use testosterone, her body had no advantage, and it reinstated Pati\u00f1o. But by then, her hopes for making the Olympics were dashed.When Dutee was about 7, her parents pressed her to stop running and learn to weave instead. But Saraswati argued that with Dutee\u2019s speed, she could earn more as a sprinter. Saraswati, who has since become a police officer, reminded her parents of the benefits her own running had brought to the family. Once the district government realized Saraswati\u2019s athletic potential, she, like other athletes, was given meat and chicken and eggs, food her family had not been able to afford. And she reminded them of the prize money she brought home whenever she did well in marathons. They agreed to let Dutee run.Not long after, Saraswati used a string to measure Dutee\u2019s foot and took a bus to the nearest city, about 60 miles away, to find an affordable pair of sturdy sneakers for her sister. The ride took three hours, frequently picking up passengers carrying goats or chickens and large bundles. When Saraswati gave Dutee the sneakers the next morning, Saraswati told me over the phone through a translator, Dutee yelped. \u201cShe asked me what can happen if she runs wholeheartedly. She asked if she would go abroad like me, and said she had never sat in a bus or a train, and asked where the money will come from for her to go abroad. I said that \u2018if, with these shoes, you run well, you will be sent abroad from the money that will come to you, and not just that, but you\u2019ll also get a tracksuit. So run!\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2006, 10-year-old Dutee was accepted into a state-sponsored sports program more than two hours from the family\u2019s home. Food, lodging and training were covered. She missed home but appreciated the dorm\u2019s electricity, running water and indoor toilets. And she was happy she could send prize money to her parents.1936Stella Walsh and Helen StephensStephens, right, narrowly beat Walsh in the 100-meter dash at the Berlin Olympics. Both were rumored to be male impostors.\u00a0That same year, though Dutee didn\u2019t know it, a catastrophe was unfolding for another Indian sprinter. Santhi Soundarajan, a 25-year-old from southern India, finished second in the 800 meters at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, all the more impressive given her roots as a member of India\u2019s impoverished \u201cuntouchable\u201d caste. The previous decade, the I.O.C. and I.A.A.F. yielded to pressure by the medical and scientific community and stopped sex-testing every female athlete. But the groups retained the right to test an athlete\u2019s chromosomes when questions about her sex arose and to follow that with a hormone test, a gynecological exam and a psychological evaluation.In Soundarajan\u2019s case, the media noted that she wasn\u2019t just fast; she also had a deep voice and a flat chest. The day after Soundarajan\u2019s race, the Athletics Federation of India drew her blood and examined her body. Some of her results were leaked to the media. Shortly after, Soundarajan was watching TV when she saw a news report that she had \u201cfailed\u201d a sex test. Rejected by the local sports federations, stripped of her silver medal, tormented by ongoing scrutiny and unbearably embarrassed, she attempted suicide, reportedly by swallowing poison.As Chand began competing in national athletics, another runner from a poor rural village, this time in South Africa, burst onto the interna\u00adtional athletic stage. When Caster Semenya blew by her opponents in the 800-meter race at the 2009 African Junior Championships, her performance raised suspicions. Shortly after, sports officials tested her as she prepared for the World Athletics Championship. Unconcerned \u2014 she assumed the investigation was for doping \u2014 Semenya won gold again. Almost immediately, the fact that Semenya had been sex-tested was leaked to the press. Instead of attending what is normally the celebratory news conference, Semenya went into hiding. The I.A.A.F. spokesman Nick Davies announced that if Semenya was an impostor, she could be stripped of her medal. He added: \u201cHowever, if it\u2019s a natural thing, and the athlete has always thought she\u2019s a woman or been a woman, it\u2019s not exactly cheating.\u201dAfter nearly a year of negotiations (the details of which are not public) the I.A.A.F. cleared Semenya to run in 2010, and she went on to win the silver medal in the 2012 Olympics. She will be running in Rio. But the federation still faced condemnation over leaks, public smears and the very idea of a sex test. The I.A.A.F. maintained it was obliged to protect female athletes from having \u201cto compete against athletes with hormone-related performance advantages commonly associated with men.\u201d In 2011, the association announced that it would abandon all references to \u201cgender verification\u201d or \u201cgender policy.\u201d Instead, it would institute a test for \u201chyperandrogenism\u201d (high testosterone) when there are \u201creasonable grounds for believing\u201d that a woman may have the condition. Women whose testosterone level was \u201cwithin the male range\u201d would be barred. There were two exceptions: If a woman like Maria Pati\u00f1o was resistant to testosterone\u2019s effects \u2014 or if a woman reduced her testosterone. This entails having her undescended testes surgically removed or taking hormone-suppressing drugs.Not long after the policy went into effect, sports officials referred four female athletes from \u201crural or mountainous regions of developing countries\u201d to a French hospital to reduce their high testosterone, according to a 2013 article in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. The authors, many of whom were physicians who treated the women, describe telling them that leaving in their internal testes \u201ccarries no health risk,\u201d but that removing them would allow the athletes to resume competition, though possibly hurt their performance. The women, who were between 18 and 21, agreed to the procedure. The physicians treating them also recommended surgically reducing their large clitorises to make them look more typical. The article doesn\u2019t mention whether they told their patients that altering their clitorises might impair sexual sensation, but it does say the women agreed to that surgery too.Chand was unaware of any controversy surrounding Semenya or other intersex athletes. Her gender concerns were much more immediate: She saw other 15-year-old girls becoming curvier and heard them talk about getting their periods. She asked her mother why her body wasn\u2019t doing the same thing, and trusted her answer: Chand\u2019s body would change when it was good and ready.In 2012, Chand advanced to a national-level athletic training program, which in addition to food and lodging provided a stipend. At 16, she also became a national champion in the under-18 category, winning the 100 meters in 11.8 seconds. The next year, she won gold in the 100 meters and the 200 meters. In June 2014, she won gold yet again at the Asian championships in Taipei.Not long after that, she received the call to go to Delhi and was tested. After her results came in, officials told her she could return to the national team only if she reduced her testosterone level \u2014 and that she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to compete for a year. The particulars of her results were not made public, but the media learned, and announced, that Chand had \u201cfailed\u201d a \u201cgender test\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cnormal\u201d woman. For days, Chand cried inconsolably and refused to eat or drink. \u201cSome in the news were saying I was a boy, and some said that maybe I was a transsexual,\u201d Chand told me. \u201cI felt naked. I am a human being, but I felt I was an animal. I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation.\u201dMitra and others also urged Chand to take her case to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport \u2014 the Supreme Court for sports disputes \u2014 arguing that the I.A.A.F.\u2019s testosterone policy was discriminatory and should be rescinded. She agreed. Over four days in March 2015, a three-judge panel heard Chand\u2019s appeal, as a total of 16 witnesses, including scientists, sports officials and athletes, testified.Female athletes, intersex and not, wondered just how this case would affect their lives. At the hearing, Paula Radcliffe, the British runner who holds the women\u2019s world record for the marathon, testified for the I.A.A.F., saying elevated testosterone levels \u201cmake the competition unequal in a way greater than simple natural talent and dedication.\u201d She added, \u201cThe concern remains that their bodies respond in different, stronger ways to training and racing than women with normal testosterone levels, and that this renders the competition fundamentally unfair.\u201dMadeleine Pape, a 2008 Olympian from Aus\u00adtra\u00adlia, testified for Chand. Pape lost to Caster Semenya in the 2009 World Championships, Semenya\u2019s last race before her sex-test results were made public. Pape had heard runners complain that Semenya was a man or had male-like advantages, and she was angry that Semenya seemed to win so easily. \u201cAt the time, I felt that people like Caster shouldn\u2019t be allowed to compete,\u201d Pape told me. But in 2012, Pape began work on a sociology Ph.D. focusing on women in sport. \u201cWith my running days behind me, I had the space to think more critically about all that,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil that point, I had no idea that the science of sex differences is extremely contested and has shifted over time, as have the regulations in sports, which change but don\u2019t improve as they try to get at the same questions.\u201dJust what role testosterone plays in improving athletic performance is still being debated. At the hearing, both sides agreed that synthetic testosterone \u2014 doping with anabolic steroids \u2014 does ramp up performance, helping male and female athletes jump higher and run faster. But they disagreed vehemently about whether the body\u2019s own testosterone has the same effect.I.A.A.F. witnesses testified that logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely to work the way its synthetic twin does. They pointed to decades of I.A.A.F. and I.O.C. testing showing that a disproportionate number of elite female athletes, particularly in track and field, have XY chromosomes; by their estimates, the presence of the Y chromosome in this group is more than 140 times higher than it is among the general female population. Surely, witnesses for the I.A.A.F. argued, that overrepresentation indicated that natural testosterone has an outsize influence on athletic prowess.In court, the I.A.A.F. acknowledged that men\u2019s natural testosterone levels, no matter how high, were not regulated; the rationale, it said, was that there was no evidence that men with exceptionally high testosterone have a competitive advantage. Pressed by Chand\u2019s lawyer, the I.A.A.F. also conceded that no research had actually proved that unusually high levels of natural testosterone lead to unusually impressive sports performance in women either. Nor has any study proved that natural testosterone in the \u201cmale range\u201d provides women with a competitive advantage commensurate with the 10 to 12 percent advantage that elite male athletes typically have over elite female athletes in comparable events. In fact, the I.A.A.F.\u2019s own witnesses estimated the performance advantage of women with high testosterone to be between 1 and 3 percent, and the court played down the 3 percent figure, because it was based on limited, unpublished data.Chand\u2019s witnesses also pointed out that researchers had identified more than 200 biological abnormalities that offer specific competitive advantages, among them increased aerobic capacity, resistance to fatigue, exceptionally long limbs, flexible joints, large hands and feet and increased numbers of fast-twitch muscle fibers \u2014 all of which make the idea of a level playing field illusory, and not one of which is regulated if it is innate.But the I.A.A.F. argued that testosterone is different from other factors, because it is responsible for the performance gap between the sexes. That gap is the very reason sports is divided by sex, the I.A.A.F. says, so regulating testosterone is therefore justified.Chand\u2019s hearing, though, was about more than just testosterone. Implicitly, it questioned the decades of relentless scrutiny of female athletes \u2014 especially the most successful ones. Veronica Brenner, a Canadian who won a silver medal in freestyle skiing in 2002, told me she first learned that female Olympians had to pass a sex test when she arrived at the \u201998 Games in Nagano, Japan. \u201cI said: \u2018Are you kidding?\u2019 I\u2019d been competing my whole life, and my gender has never been questioned!\u201d Brenner\u2019s test confirmed that she had XX chromosomes, and she was given what was commonly called a \u201cfemininity card\u201d to prove she was the gender she claimed to be. But she was irked that despite the many advances of female athletes in the last half-century, powerful male athletes are celebrated and powerful female ones are suspect. \u201cWe\u2019d hear comments all the time: \u2018She\u2019s really strong \u2014 she must be part guy.\u2019\u2009\u201dOther critics see testosterone testing as simply the old \u201cgender verification,\u201d the latest effort to keep out women who don\u2019t adhere to gender norms or have a standard female body. Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford University who is a leader of the international campaign against banning intersex athletes and who testified in Chand\u2019s case, says that if an athlete\u2019s androgen test shows she has high testosterone, she must undergo the same gynecological exam that has existed for decades. \u201cThe rationale behind the I.A.A.F.\u2019s \u2018hyperandrogenism regulation\u2019 is to make it sound more scientifically justifiable and less discriminatory, but nothing in those exams has changed from the old policy except the name,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still based on very rigid binary ideas about sex and gender.\u201dCritics of the I.A.A.F. policy argue that if sports officials were truly concerned about fairness, they would quit policing a handful of women with naturally high testosterone and instead rigorously investigate athletes suspected of taking drugs that indisputably enhance performance. They note that in the last year, the I.A.A.F. has faced bribery and blackmail charges and widespread allegations that it intentionally ignored hundreds of suspicious blood tests.St\u00e9phane Bermon, an I.A.A.F. witness who took part in the efforts to identify females with high testosterone, acknowledged that doping was a significant threat to fairness but said that didn\u2019t negate the need to also regulate the participation of women with naturally high testosterone who may have an advantage. He offered an analogy: \u201cAir pollution, like tobacco smoking, contributes to lung cancer, but one should never have to choose between these two before implementing prevention measures,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAs a governing body, I.A.A.F. has to do its best to ensure a level playing field. ... These two topics are different but can lead to the same consequence, which is the impossibility for a dedi\u00adcated athlete to compete and succeed against an opponent who benefits from an unfair advantage.\u201dThe judges concluded that requiring women like Chand to change their bodies in order to compete was unjustifiably discriminatory. The panel sus\u00adpended the policy until July 2017 to give the I.A.A.F. time to prove that the degree of competitive advantage conferred by naturally high testosterone in women was comparable to men\u2019s advantage. If the I.A.A.F. doesn\u2019t supply that evidence, the court said, the regulation \u201cshall be declared void.\u201d It was the first time the court had ever overruled a sport-governing body\u2019s entire policy.Chand was thrilled. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just about me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about all women like me, who come from difficult backgrounds. It is mostly people from poor backgrounds who come into running \u2014 people who know they will get food, housing, a job, if they run well. Richer people can pay their way to become doctors, engineers; poor people don\u2019t even know about their own medical challenges.\u201dChand hoped that the ruling would prompt the I.O.C. to suspend its testosterone policy, too, so she would be eligible to try to qualify for the Rio Games. After all, the I.O.C. policy \u2014 which also called on national Olympic committees to \u201cinvestigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics\u201d \u2014 was based on the same science that the court deemed inadequate.In November 2015, the I.O.C. established new parameters for dealing with gender. But it never actually addressed whether it would suspend its testosterone policy, as the I.A.A.F. was forced to do. That ambiguity left intersex athletes in limbo. Finally, in late February, the I.O.C. said it would not regulate women\u2019s natural testosterone levels \u201cuntil the issues of the case are resolved.\u201d It urged the I.A.A.F. to come up with the evidence by the court\u2019s deadline so the suspended policy could be resurrected. It also said that to avoid discrimination, high-testosterone women who are ineligible to compete against women should be eligible to compete against men.A separate section of the I.O.C. gender guidelines addressed a different group of atypical women (and atypical men): transgender athletes. Unlike the intersex section, the transgender section stresses the importance of human rights, nondiscrimination and inclusion. It eschews most of the I.O.C.\u2019s former requirements, including that trans competitors have their ovaries or testicles removed and undergo surgery so their external genitalia matches their gender identity. In the new guidelines, female-to-male athletes face no restrictions of any kind; male-to-female athletes have some restrictions, including suppressing their testosterone levels below the typi\u00adcal male range. And once they\u2019ve declared their gender as female, they can\u2019t change it again for four years if they want to compete in sports.Reactions among trans advocates ran the gamut. Many trans advocates viewed the liberalized regulations as a victory. But some trans\u00adwomen athletes who long ago had their testicles removed (and as a result, make virtually no testosterone) were unhappy with the policy; they argued that lifting the surgery requirement gave transwomen who still had testosterone-producing testicles an unfair advantage over trans\u00adwomen who didn\u2019t. And still other advocates said that requiring transwomen to suppress their testosterone below 10 nanomoles is premised on the very same claim about testosterone that the court rejected \u2014 that naturally made testosterone is the primary cause of men\u2019s competitive advantage over women.Without evidence that \u201cmale range\u201d testosterone levels really do provide that advantage, some say it\u2019s premature to base a policy on speculation \u2014 especially one that requires people to transform their bodies. In May, the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sports, which manages the country\u2019s antidoping program and recommends ethics standards, issued trans-related guidelines for all Canadian sports organizations. The statement says policies that regulate eligibility, like those related to hormones, should be backed by defensible science. It adds, \u201cThere is simply not the evidence to suggest whether, or to what degree, hormone levels consistently confer competitive advantage.\u201d And yet it\u2019s hard to imagine that many female athletes would easily accept the idea of competing against transwomen athletes without those regulations in place.Those debates are far from Chand\u2019s thoughts. Her focus now is on making the most of the window the ruling provides: allowing her to try to qualify for next month\u2019s Olympics without having to change her body. In the miserable months after her test results were revealed, Chand\u2019s training time and concentration were interrupted, and her hope of ever competing seemed out of reach. Once the ruling was issued, though, she returned to the Indian national team, and intensified her training for the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the 400-meter relay. In addition to working out six hours a day, she tries to relax with naps and Facebook. She has made frequent trips to nations holding qualifying competitions. In May, she competed in India, China and Taiwan; in June, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. She has until July 11 to meet the I.O.C. time requirement.She is painfully aware that if she doesn\u2019t make this summer\u2019s Olympics, she may not have an\u00ad\u00adother chance. The I.A.A.F. may still come up with evidence that satisfies the court and would exclude women like her from competing without altering their bodies. Chand\u2019s best shot to qualify for Rio is in the 100 meters, which she must complete in 11.32 seconds or less. She remains one-hundredth of a second short.Ruth Padawer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goro Hasegawa, Creator of Othello Board Game, Dies at 83", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byThe death was confirmed on the Facebook page of Benkt Steentoft, the event manager of the World Othello Federation. He did not specify a cause.Othello players take turns placing discs on a green board divided into squares, eight across and eight down. Each disc has a black side and a white side and is placed within a single square, and each player takes one color. When one player\u2019s discs occupy spaces on either side of another\u2019s disc, it is captured and flipped over, its color changed to that of the surrounding player\u2019s discs. The player with the most discs of his color on the board at the end of the game wins.Othello is similar in some ways to Go, an ancient game of Asian origin that involves placing black and white stones on a large board to surround an opponents\u2019 stones. It is also quite similar to Reversi, a British game that enjoyed a spurt of popularity in the 1890s. Othello is a licensed brand, so contemporary imitators often call their versions Reversi to avoid copyright infringement.Whether Mr. Hasegawa knew about Reversi when he thought up his game is unclear. Most accounts say that he was an avid Go player, and that he first tried a version of Othello with milk-bottle tops in his hometown, Mito, in the late 1940s or early 1950s.The name of the game \u2014 perhaps inspired by Mr. Hasegawa\u2019s father, Shiro, an English literature aficionado \u2014 is derived from the title of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy about a black general\u2019s fear that he has been betrayed by his wife, who is white.The game struck a chord in Japan when it was first mass-produced there by the Tsukuda Corporation in 1973. Mr. Hasegawa promoted it by organizing tournaments, serving as the head of the Japan Othello Association and helping to broker a licensing deal with Anjar Corporation, an American company that assisted in making the game global. For decades Othello has been advertised with the slogan \u201cA minute to learn ... a lifetime to master.\u201dMr. Hasegawa was born on Oct. 19, 1932. He worked for a medical company before Othello\u2019s success, and afterward wrote books on Othello strategy.At his death he was living in Kashiwa City, Japan. His survivors include his wife, Hideko; two sons, Takeshi and Shinya; and a granddaughter.Advertisement"}

They are inevitable. They will be both positive and negative.\u201dHe added that only time would tell if the outcome was more positive or negative. \u201cThe markets will certainly decline, they have already declined,\u201d he said, \u201cbut everything will be certainly restored.\u201dFrom other precincts, however, the reactions were far less restrained.\u201cWe must express solidarity with the British people, with their right decision to exit the European Union,\u201d Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a populist politician whose statements often reflect the national mood, said in a speech in Parliament. \u201cThey did a great deed!\u201dThe Russian government, which has worked assiduously to undermine European solidarity in recent years, has any number of reasons to celebrate, analysts said.\u201cThe Kremlin is interested in any kind of disagreement, any kind of trouble in the E.U. which makes it weaker,\u201d said Nikolay V. Petrov, a professor of political science at the National Research University\u2019s Higher School of Economics in Moscow.For starters, he noted, the vote removes Britain as an influential voice in European efforts to isolate and punish Russia over its annexation of Crimea and role in destabilizing Ukraine. Second, it helps Mr. Putin in his preferred method of dealing with strong countries one on one rather than as blocs. Third, it can be exploited at home as an example of how a lack of unity can lead to weakness.\u201cIt can be used domestically to demonstrate that we are strong and everybody around us is not that strong,\u201d Mr. Petrov said. As for any negative economic consequences, he added: \u201cThose are not the highest priority.

Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, wrote on Twitter.Mr. Putin, however, said on Friday that he doubted the result would have an impact on European Union sanctions.The Kremlin is also believed to be following the Soviet tradition of underwriting other political groups that seek to weaken the European Union. Many Russian officials and commentators said they expected similar referendums across the Continent.Mr. Putin broke his silence about the British campaign the week before the vote to deny accusations that the Kremlin was trying to sway the outcome.\u201cIt is unpleasant to link Russia to every problem, even those with which we have no link, nor to make Russia into a kind of boogeyman,\u201d he said. \u201cI should say that this is absolutely none of our business. This is the choice of the British people.\u201dThe Russian leader is not a fan of unpredictable votes, and he expressed puzzlement about why the British prime minister, David Cameron, decided to hold the referendum in the first place.\u201cWhy did he initiate this referendum? Why did he do it?\u201d Mr. Putin asked. \u201cTo intimidate Europe, or to threaten someone? What is the point of this if he himself opposes the idea?\u201dUltimately, he said, the decision to call the referendum reflected \u201coverconfidence\u201d on the part of Britain\u2019s leadership.Mr. Putin said Friday that the result reflected public dissatisfaction with issues like security, immigration, the subsidizing of weaker economies and excessive control from Brussels, which he compared unfavorably to the old Soviet Union. \u201cPeople want to be more independent,\u201d he said.Also on Friday, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, told Russian news outlets that he hoped a Britain outside the European Union would understand \u201cthe need to build good relations\u201d with Russia.Although Russia did not officially take a position on the British vote, state-run news reports by the English-language service of RT television and the Sputnik news agency openly supported a British exit from the bloc.State-run news outlets give significant attention to issues that are considered central to the euroskeptic movement, particularly the migrant crisis, and they paint Europe as a continent in crisis. An analysis of Sputnik\u2019s English-language coverage by Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the British-based Institute for Statecraft, found a significant bias toward the exit campaign.Perhaps the only thing tempering the general euphoria were a few sobering notes on the economic impact.Aleksei Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow said Russia would feel the economic effects of Britain\u2019s vote.\u201cWhile this is a political victory, on the economic side of things, Russia will suffer,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOil will fall. The markets will be turbulent. Russia won emotionally but lost economically.\u201dMr. Makarkin said many Russians saw in the vote the possibility that the European Union might crumble, much the way the Soviet Union fell apart 25 years ago.\u201cThe overall mood in Russia can be described as malicious joy,\u201d he said. \u201cA few liberals regret that Britain voted to leave, but in general there is some sort of relief that they have their problems, too, they are collapsing, too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Britain\u2019s position on European Union sanctions on Russia. It supports them strongly; it does not have a hard-line stance against them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reinventing the International Center of Photography for the Selfie Age", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byThe center paid $23.5 million for 11,000 square feet of exhibition space at 250 Bowery, across from the New Museum on the Lower East Side and only blocks from the cluster of anti-Chelsea galleries and restaurants that cater to a millennial crowd. An all-glass, street-level facade is intended to draw foot traffic into a visible public space where talks and events are planned.With its new neighborhood comes an expanded identity. Mark Lubell, the executive director, now refers to the center as an institution dedicated to \u201cphotography and visual culture,\u201d a term meant to incorporate the breadth of the technological change in which photography is a malleable part. Mr. Lubell insists that we are no longer even photographers, per se, but, rather, \u201cimage makers.\u201dIn the context of such multitentacled image-making \u2014 350 million pictures are uploaded daily on Facebook alone \u2014 the center\u2019s curators must make sense of the vast array of imagery presented on myriad platforms and to identify work that most poignantly reflects contemporary experience and warrants historical preservation.\u201cI look at I.C.P. as an arbiter in this wild, wild west world that we\u2019re living in right now,\u201d Mr. Lubell said in an interview earlier this spring, gesturing to an illustration of the center\u2019s new facade on display in his office, which is still in Midtown. In a world where everyone is taking pictures of everything, he said, \u201cthere should be a place with a deep history of the understanding of photography and the power of the image in order to put some of what\u2019s happening today in context.\u201dThe issue was simpler for Cornell Capa, the Magnum photographer who founded the center in 1974 in an elegant neo-Georgian mansion on Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, with galleries in intimate parlors. The impetus to open it derived from Mr. Capa\u2019s growing anxiety in the late 1960s about the diminishing relevance of photojournalism because of the increasing use of film footage on television news. It would be a center for \u201cconcerned photography\u201d \u2014 the term he coined for social-documentary photography in which, he specified, \u201cgenuine human feeling predominates over commercial cynicism or disinterested formalism.\u201dThe center opened just as photography was gaining stature in the art world, yet it proceeded on a course parallel to the museum world \u2014 one in which subject matter took precedence over artistic intent. Its first show was the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, an appropriate choice given Mr. Capa\u2019s relationship to Magnum \u2014 his brother, Robert, was a co-founder, along with Cartier-Bresson. All three were exemplars of bedrock photojournalism.Visitors will confront their reflections in mirrored partitions meant to suggest our \u201cselfie culture\u201d; Closed Circuit Television cameras will document museumgoers with live feeds projected as pixelated patterns of color on a wall in the public space. The idea here is to pay attention to the visual language of machines, something we are all being conditioned to read.In the main gallery, there will be video-based wall-size projections of work by Natalie Bookchin, Jon Rafman and Doug Rickard, who \u201crepresent a clear turn in artistic practice,\u201d Ms. Cotton said, \u201cchoosing to gather and sequence found images and footage from the vast terrain of social media.\u201d She said \u201cauthorship and artistry reside in the ways in which they sequence and edit seemingly disparate and unconnected visual material\u201d to tell new kinds of stories about contemporary behavior.Amid construction debris as the galleries were being completed, Ms. Cotton described the heightened sensory effect she hopes to achieve with the installation. \u201cI create shows for people who like to put things in their mouth to see what they taste like,\u201d she said with a wry smile, describing her goal to create a visceral experience. In a separate gallery, work will be shown by established artists who have long explored issues of identity \u2014 Sophie Calle, Lyle Ashton Harris, Nan Goldin, Martha Rosler and Larry Sultan, among others.Asked if the trustees are on board for this journey, Jeffrey A. Rosen, deputy chairman of Lazard and president of the center\u2019s board, projected confidence. \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, adding that the board does not get involved with programming. \u201cThe director runs the institution,\u201d he said.Stefano Tonchi, editor in chief of W Magazine, joined the board four years ago. He doesn\u2019t think that responding to photography\u2019s digital evolution alters the center\u2019s fundamental purpose. On the contrary, \u201cthe art of photography has really changed so much,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cI think I.C.P. would really like to chronicle these changes and be in step with the times.\u201dThe senior curators Christopher Phillips and Ms. Squiers are working on the next show, \u201cPerpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,\u201d planned for January. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take apart the online visual world and organize it in some way that is more comprehensible,\u201d Ms. Squiers said.The show\u2019s themes will include \u201cISIS and the Imagery of Terror.\u201d Ms. Squiers is looking at the organization\u2019s intensive media campaign of propaganda, designed both to lure recruits and to frighten other people. \u201cThe very violent material that we see all the time in the American press is only a small part of the visual material that ISIS puts out,\u201d Ms. Squiers said. \u201cIn fact, the greater part of its output is a kind of utopian view of what the caliphate is doing for people now and will do for them in the future.\u201dAnother theme of \u201cPerpetual Revolution\u201d will be the impact digital media have had on extreme winter sports. Technology continues to alter our visual experience and even shape our activities. The speed and agility with which GoPro cameras, for example, document treacherous jumps on 500-pound snowmobiles has only increased the bravado of those athletes, making them try ever more dangerous stunts. Ms. Squiers joked that the images in this part of the show might \u201cdraw a new demographic of 14-year-old boys into I.C.P. for my little celebration of these sports.\u201dThe center is emphasizing the need to grasp the contemporary moment, but what about the past as prologue? After all, photography evolved with technological advances that changed the look of the image from one era to another.\u201cThere\u2019s a millennial generation that doesn\u2019t even know some of this great work,\u201d Mr. Lubell said. But some of those people will have to travel across the river from the new center to see what photography once was.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was Orlando Shooter Really Acting for ISIS? For ISIS, It\u2019s All the Same", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byFor the terror planners of the Islamic State, the difference is mostly irrelevant.Influencing distant attackers to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State and then carry out mass murder has become a core part of the group\u2019s propaganda over the past two years. It is a purposeful blurring of the line between operations that are planned and carried out by the terror group\u2019s core fighters and those carried out by its sympathizers.This public oath is about the only requirement that the Islamic State imposes on followers who wish to carry out acts of terror in its name. In an annual speech, the terror group\u2019s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, last month incited its supporters to carry out killings abroad during the holy month of Ramadan.No attack is too small, he advised, specifically naming the United States as a target. \u201cThe smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us,\u201d he said, \u201cand more effective and more damaging to them.\u201dAs early as September 2014, Mr. Adnani made clear that anyone and everyone could, and should, carry out acts of terror in the group\u2019s name. \u201cDo not ask for anyone\u2019s permission,\u201d he said, and suggested that sympathizers who could not buy weapons should instead use rocks, knives or even cars to kill infidels.Since then, the group has worked hard to create a mechanism for inciting terror in situ. It floods the internet with gory propaganda, and employs an army of keyboard jihadists to push the deadly message on Twitter, Facebook and other social media.Accounts of what happened from officials and witnesses.In this case, there was a stark resonance between Islamic State propaganda and the killer\u2019s choice of target. The jihadist group has publicized its hatred of homosexuals, including releasing images of fighters killing people suspected of being gay by throwing them off tall buildings.Once the recruit is caught, or killed, law enforcement officials struggle to put the pieces back together. Yet the fact that there is often no direct link back to the core is intended to protect the organization in an age of surveillance.\u201cI think what the Islamic State has done is very clever, and that is create a situation where someone can carry out an attack without any direct link to the organization,\u201d said Charlie Winter, senior research associate at Georgia State University\u2019s Transcultural Conflict and Violence Initiative. \u201cThey can pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before or during, and that catapults them from being a self-starter jihadist guy, or girl, to someone who can be lionized as a soldier of the Islamic State and regarded as a warrior.\u201dOn Sunday, after it was known that Mr. Mateen had invoked ISIS, the group\u2019s official news agency issued a bulletin quoting \u201ca source\u201d confirming that Mr. Mateen was acting on the Islamic State\u2019s behalf.Jihadists erupted in celebration on the internet. They shared screenshots of Mr. Adnani\u2019s speech calling for lone wolf attacks during Ramadan. And in an act of tribute, several changed their profile pictures on Twitter to a photograph of the Orlando attacker.Advertisement"}

After the service told Ms. Wood she had excessive levels of vitamin D, she cut back on a supplement she had been using and said she almost immediately felt better.Now she has her blood drawn and tested by InsideTracker every four months to check everything from her blood sugar to her B12 levels which, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009callows me to be proactive\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her health. The services typically send their customers to a nearby clinic where they can have a vial of their blood drawn and sent for analyses. But InsideTracker also offers customers the option to have nurses show up at their home and draw blood. (Such services are different from another blood testing company that has been much in the news, Theranos, which aims to provide laboratory test results from a single finger prick.)Home testing services like InsideTracker say they are empowering consumers, allowing them to spot metabolic red flags before they progress to disease. But critics say the services often lack proper medical oversight and convince healthy people that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sick, leading to unnecessary testing and treatment.DirectLabs had sold hundreds of health tests to consumers, ranging from checks for heavy metals and vitamins to screening for parasites and disease. But Mr. Schneiderman said the person fulfilling the medical practitioner role was actually a chiropractor who had never met, spoken to or followed up with any patients.DirectLabs did not respond to a request for comment. DirectLabs and LabCorp agreed to pay fines, and DirectLabs ceased operating in New York. In a statement, Mr. Schneiderman said that allowing consumers to be tested for serious medical conditions without consulting a physician put \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir health in jeopardy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdvocates of home testing, however, say such cases do not reflect industry practices. InsideTracker and another leading company, WellnessFX, said they worked with doctors who reviewed all test results.Paul Jacobson, the chief executive of WellnessFX, based in San Francisco, said the company complied with all regulations and offered customers the option of consulting with a doctor, nutritionist or registered dietitian to discuss their results.WellnessFX sells packages ranging from $78 to $988, offering analyses of 25 to 88 blood biomarkers, including vitamins, lipids, cardiovascular markers and thyroid and reproductive hormones. Depending on the results, the company also suggests supplements, foods and exercise.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need to offer solutions to people; otherwise, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just giving them meaningless information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Jacobson said.Tara Boening, the dietitian for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association, said the team started using InsideTracker this season. The players look at their reports (deficiencies are highlighted in red), which include suggested corrective actions such as eating more red meat and leafy greens if they are low in iron. The players \u00e2\u0080\u009chave been really receptive\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the information, Ms. Boening said.But some doctors say that there is no evidence that such monitoring makes a meaningful improvement in health. Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, cautioned that the levels of vitamin D and other biomarkers that were optimal for one person might be very different from what is optimal for another person. He said InsideTracker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lab reports, for example, classified vitamin D levels below 30 nanograms per milliliter as \u00e2\u0080\u009clow\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even though a level above 20 is perfectly normal and adequate for most people.Dr. Cohen said his major concern with direct-to-consumer blood tests was that they screened for so many biomarkers and created seemingly arbitrary ranges for what is considered normal. Then they give people advice that they already know they should be following.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best-case scenario here is you lose your money and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reminded to get more sleep and to eat more fruits, vegetables and fish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe worst-case scenario is that you end up getting alarmed by supposedly abnormal results that are actually completely normal for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009dInsideTracker was founded by Gil Blander, a biochemist who did postgraduate research on aging at M.I.T. He said the idea behind InsideTracker was analogous to routine maintenance for cars.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe decided, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try to do that for humans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Blander said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can help you find a small issue today that might be a big problem in the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSome, like Joseph Roberts, say the services are life-changing. Four years ago, Mr. Roberts, a former Army Ranger and a retired master sergeant, was plagued by fatigue, depression and weight gain despite frequent exercise. Mr. Roberts, then 39, said doctors told him his symptoms were a normal part of aging.Eventually, he decided to have his blood tested with InsideTracker, and the results surprised him, he said. He was told he had low testosterone and vitamin D, as well as excessive levels of vitamin B12.Mr. Roberts cut back on daily energy drinks, which are loaded with B12. He also saw a doctor to discuss his testosterone levels. He learned his low levels were linked to a brain injury he had sustained as a result of a roadside bomb explosion in Iraq in 2003.

{"Headline": "Coffee May Protect Against Cancer, W.H.O. Concludes", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "An influential panel of experts convened by the World Health Organization concluded on Wednesday that regularly drinking coffee could protect against at least two types of cancer, a decision that followed decades of research pointing to the beverage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many health benefits. The panel also said there was a lack of evidence that it might cause other types of cancer.In their report, the scientists did identify one surprising risk for coffee and tea drinkers. They said that drinking \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery hot\u00e2\u0080\u009d beverages was \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably carcinogenic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the practice was linked to esophageal cancer in some studies. Much of the evidence for coffee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health benefits stems from large epidemiological studies, which cannot prove cause and effect. But the favorable findings on coffee consumption have been so consistent across numerous studies in recent years that many health authorities have endorsed it as part of a healthy diet.Last year, a panel of scientists that shaped the federal government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2015 dietary guidelines said there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong evidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d that three to five cups of coffee daily was not harmful, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoderate\u00e2\u0080\u009d consumption might reduce chronic disease. Another group, the World Cancer Research Fund International, reported that coffee protects against multiple types of cancer. And several systematic reviews of studies involving millions of people have found that regular coffee drinkers live longer than others. Decades ago, the group listed coffee as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpossible carcinogen\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 along with lead and diesel fuel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because of studies that suggested a weak link to bladder and pancreatic cancer. But those early studies did not adequately account for higher smoking rates among coffee drinkers and, since then, more rigorous and better-quality studies have become available, Dr. Loomis said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is less of a concern today than there was before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.In its report, the group cited evidence, for example, that coffee drinkers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 risk of liver cancer decreases 15 percent \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor each one cup per day increment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, the group did not give coffee a ringing endorsement. It placed coffee in its Group 3 category for things with \u00e2\u0080\u009cinadequate\u00e2\u0080\u009d evidence of carcinogenic potential, such as fluoride, low frequency electric fields, and toluene, a solvent used to make nail polish.Geoffrey Kabat, a cancer epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said he felt that the agency did not go far enough in its report. He said that coffee had been studied in populations across the globe and that studies now show a clear lack of evidence of harm. He said the agency tends to give greater weight to studies showing harm, even when they are outnumbered by many more showing benefit.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the evidence shows over all is that coffee drinking is associated with either reduced risk of several cancers or certainly no clear increase in other cancers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a strong signal that this is probably not something that we need to be worrying about.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSince 1971, the cancer research agency has evaluated nearly 1,000 environmental and lifestyle factors to determine the extent to which they can promote cancer. About 120 have been categorized as carcinogenic to humans, including asbestos, cigarettes and plutonium. Other things it has classified as carcinogenic include wood dust, salted fish and processed meats such as bacon, ham and hot dogs. But the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reports have at times been controversial. Critics have called the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranking system arcane and confusing because it classifies things according to the strength of the overall research, not their actual level of danger. Dr. Kabat said the assessment system was useful for cancer researchers but that it served no utility for the public.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really feel that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not contributing to the public good because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stoking these concerns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Still, the news on coffee is likely to be welcomed by many Americans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about 130 million of whom drink coffee every day. Around the world, more than 1.6 billion cups of coffee are consumed daily, making it one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular drinks behind tea. The agency said it was not clear why coffee seems to protect against at least two types of cancers. But it noted that drinking coffee produced \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrong antioxidant effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d in clinical trials, and that it promoted the death of cancer cells in laboratory studies.The report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns about \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery hot\u00e2\u0080\u009d beverages included mention of mate, a type of tea traditionally consumed in South America, the Middle East and some parts of Europe, often at high temperatures. The agency said that regular consumption of beverages hotter than 149 degrees Fahrenheit was \u00e2\u0080\u009cprobably carcinogenic\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on a small number of studies showing a link between the practice and esophageal cancer. One reason is that, over time, scalding hot beverages may injure cells that line the throat, setting the stage for rare cancers. But Dr. Loomis cautioned that the increased risk was seen in people who regularly drink their tea or mate at very high temperatures, typically at 158 degrees Fahrenheit or greater. That is very different from the average tea or coffee drinker in the United States and Europe, where coffee is generally consumed at temperatures below 140 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also an issue that can be easily avoided.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose who are concerned should just wait a few minutes more before drinking their drink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Loomis said.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

He sometimes posed himself laughing, but we, the viewers, are not always aware of that. We do see a certain sadness or angst, revealing the complexity of emotions, but also the capacity for the abstract in the eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structure.

{"Headline": "Is It a Crime to Be Poor?", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 IN the 1830s, the civilized world began to close debtors\u2019 prisons, recognizing them as barbaric and also silly: The one way to ensure that citizens cannot repay debts is to lock them up.In the 21st century, the United States has reinstated a broad system of debtors\u2019 prisons, in effect making it a crime to be poor.If you don\u2019t believe me, come with me to the county jail in Tulsa. On the day I visited, 23 people were incarcerated for failure to pay government fines and fees, including one woman imprisoned because she couldn\u2019t pay a fine for lacking a license plate.I sat in the jail with Rosalind Hall, 53, a warm, mild-mannered woman with graying hair who has been imprisoned for a total of almost 18 months, in short stints, simply for failing to pay a blizzard of fines and fees relating to petty crimes (for which she separately served time). Hall has struggled for three decades with mental illness and drug addictions and has a long history of shoplifting to pay for drugs, but no violent record.Tears welled in her eyes as she told how she was trying to turn her life around, no longer stealing, and steering clear of drugs for the last two years \u2014 but her fines and fees keep increasing and now total $11,258. With depression and bipolar disorder, she has little hope of getting a regular job, so she is periodically arrested for failing to pay.This time, she had already spent 10 days in jail for failing to pay restitution for five bad checks written eight years ago to a grocery store. The bad checks totaled a bit more than $100, but with fees and charges added on she still owes $1,200 in restitution on them \u2014 and that\u2019s after eight years of making payments.\u201cIf I can\u2019t afford to pay it, how can I pay it?\u201d Hall asked me, as we sat in a visiting room in the jail. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201dHall survives on food stamps, castoff clothes provided by churches, a friend\u2019s willingness to give her a room, and $50 a month she earns by cleaning a woman\u2019s house. She allocates $40 to paying restitution, leaving her just $10 a month in cash for her and her beloved puppy (whom her neighbor looks after whenever she\u2019s jailed for debts).\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent true that we have debtor prisons in 2016,\u201d says Jill Webb, a public defender. \u201cThe only reason these people are in jail is that they can\u2019t pay their fines.\u201cNot only that, but we\u2019re paying $64 a day to keep them in jail \u2014 not because of what they\u2019ve done, but because they\u2019re poor.\u201dThis is as unconscionable in 2016 as it was in 1830, and it is a system found across the country. In the last 25 years, as mass incarceration became increasingly costly, states and localities shifted the burden to criminal offenders with an explosion in special fees and surcharges. Here in Oklahoma, criminal defendants can be assessed 66 different kinds of fees, from a \u201ccourthouse security fee\u201d to a \u201csheriff\u2019s fee for pursuing fugitive from justice,\u201d and even a fee for an indigent person applying for a public defender (I\u2019m not kidding: An indigent person is actually billed for requesting a public defender, and if he or she does not pay, an arrest warrant is issued).Even the Tulsa County district attorney, Stephen Kunzweiler, thinks these fines are a ridiculous way to finance his office. \u201cIt\u2019s a dysfunctional system,\u201d he says.\u201cImpoverished defendants have nothing to give,\u201d Harris says, and the result is a system that disproportionately punishes the poor and minorities, leaving them with an overhang of debt from which they can never escape.The Supreme Court has ruled that people should be jailed only when they refuse to pay, not when they can\u2019t, and in theory safeguards protect the indigent. In practice those safeguards are chimerical, and the poor are routinely jailed for being poor. The way forward is to curb these fees, end the use by courts of private collection companies that add their own charges to the debt, and limit court debt to some percentage of a person\u2019s income.For now, some of the sums owed are staggering. Job Fields III told me he owes $70,000 in fees and fines. \u201cIt seems impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got to think positive.\u201d Cynthia Odom told me that she owes $170,000 and constantly struggles with whether to pay the electricity bill, buy food for her two kids, or pay down the debt and stay out of jail.When kids are affected like that, as they often are, this system of jailing people who can\u2019t pay fines is grotesque as well as Kafkaesque.Amanda Goleman, 29, grew up in a meth house and began taking illegal drugs at 12, and her education wound down after she became pregnant in the ninth grade. For a time, she and her daughter were homeless.But Goleman has turned herself around. She has had no offenses for almost four years and has been drug-free for three. For the last year, by her account and her employer\u2019s, she has held a steady job in which she has been promoted \u2014 but she is still a single mom and struggles to pay old fines while also raising her three children, ages 2, 10 and 13.\u201cIt\u2019s either feed my kids or pay the fines,\u201d Goleman said, \u201cbut if I don\u2019t pay then I get a warrant.\u201d Four times she has been arrested and jailed for a few days for being behind in her payments; each time, this created havoc with her children and posed challenges for keeping a job.Webb thinks that these modern debtors\u2019 prisons are so punitive that the underlying motivation is to stigmatize and punish the poor. \u201cIt hurts their families, it doesn\u2019t make us safer, it\u2019s expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another reason other than animosity toward the poor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Artist Takes On Cancer", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Mr. Scheuer conveys the dread that brands cancer patients, whether or not their type of disease is treatable. Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.As sung by a self-proclaimed optimist who has been given the good odds of an 85 percent chance of full remission, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCure\u00e2\u0080\u009d begins with a defenseless Mr. Scheuer, supine on a bed. The camera fragments him into body parts: a mouth, a limb, a trembling torso. From an area near his heart, where a port would have been implanted, rivulets of ink streak down his arms to the tip of his fingers, down his legs to cover the soles of his feet, branching over his quivering or convulsing midriff.  The chemotherapy Mr. Scheuer received was called A-B-V-D:  Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCure\u00e2\u0080\u009d depicts the chemicals striking like lightning, as if to shock the body or map it with bombed roadways, tracking a jagged terrain. The speed of the tattooing brings to mind the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvasive\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csystemic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We are looking at a representation of cancer treatment, but the video evokes terror at the disease\u00e2\u0080\u0099s malevolent capacity to spread quickly.  For viewers familiar with Franz Kafka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Penal Colony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the calligraphy on Mr. Scheuer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin may recall the sentences, etched by torture machinery, on a condemned prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body during the 12 hours it takes for him to die. Remarkably, though, the tone of the singer remains less shocked or shocking, more ruefully contemplative.  In a quiet voice, Mr. Scheuer sings about learning the results of testing done after 12 treatments. Although throughout the ordeal he has been fighting panic and fear, they threaten to engulf him as he worries about ending up like his father, with cancer in his brain and his spinal cord. Clothing starts to grow over him, covering his marked body. Does his being passively clothed mean that he is being costumed for a coffin?  After the doctor informs him that the treatment has worked, after his jacket is buttoned, Mr. Scheuer finally sits up, hearing the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cured.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the sad final tones of his voice and guitar reflect his isolation in a room with bed sheets that remain indelibly imprinted with the sinister designs. Cancer patients, who must shuttle between their homes and hospitals, frequently experience the clash between familiar, comfortable environments and strange, anxiety-producing settings. Ms. Lerner explores the disparity but also the blurring of these worlds in a book composed of portraits of Mr. Scheuer interspersed with snippets of texts from his journals. For me, as for Ms. Lerner and Mr. Scheuer, the contrast involves clothing: One of the humiliations of the hospital entails my flesh being exposed in cubicles where doctors, nurses and technicians are fully clothed.  \u201cBetween Two Spaces\u201d opens with a picture of a suited but barefooted Mr. Scheuer bending over to choose between two pairs of shoes. It concludes with him sporting a coat and hat in a snowy park. Inside his recording studio or at home he appears blanketed or costumed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could control, to the tiniest detail, what I wore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explains in a reprinted journal entry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso the worse I felt the more care I put into the shine of my shoes, the knot of my tie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But in a PET scan or undergoing chemotherapy, he is only partly robed or completely undressed beneath or entering massive machinery. The cover of \u201cBetween Two Spaces\u201d features what looks to be a soothing picture of a naked Mr. Scheuer partly submerged in a bathtub. At least in my experience, bathing in a tub occurs only in the security of home, not in the hospital. Yet the journal entry, appended to this image within the book, mentions his watching a frightening video of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tsunami:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe land is now the sea, the churning, angry ocean. Black, filled with unwilling passengers, debris, creating clouds of mist, blindness, dust dirt smoke all grey and brown, all the houses and their red roofs are squeaking clean of their foundations like boats unmoored.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  What had at first seemed a serene portrait of the artist with his eyes closed, floating on the surface of the water, now portends drowning and death. Out of the hospital, as inside it, the patient endures an inexplicable natural disaster. To my aging eyes, the youthful vulnerability of Benjamin Scheuer makes both the video and the photographs moving. Although, unlike me, he deals with a curable disease, he resembles all cancer patients who must come to terms with the term remission. The poignancy of Mr. Scheuer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Ms. Lerner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s images arises from the implacable effect that estranging clinical spaces impose on previously secure domestic places.  Even the cured must take their cancer experiences home with them where, paradoxically, remission \u00e2\u0080\u0094 untrustworthy as a safe haven \u00e2\u0080\u0094 continues to unmoor us.

[STOP]\u201dThey capture the sense of siege that was palpable here last week during the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, where Facebook has one of the most visible pop-up headquarters along the beach, with a pier festooned with its logo and a club on the sand. But in this case, no one was prepared to view the seaside regiment as a liberating force.Therefore, the word of the week in Cannes was \u201cduopoly.\u201d You could understand why the gathered Mad Men and Women were so mad. For decades, they have enjoyed mutually beneficial relationships with their big clients \u2014 Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Unilever \u2014 reaping great riches by catering to Americans\u2019 wants and tastes, having divined them through focus groups and surveys.If I\u2019m you, the reader, I\u2019m wondering why I should care; isn\u2019t it like the old mob complaining about the new mob being unschooled in the honor code of omert\u00e0?Well, there are much larger questions at play. When one or two companies gain control over a market, it creates dangerous asymmetries that skew competitive balance. And the market we\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t making widgets. It delivers what we read and watch every day, and increasingly every minute: the news and information our democracy needs.While Google has usually been the chief villain here, Facebook seemed to have assumed the role of Frenemy No. 1. Two hours didn\u2019t go by here without some top executive telling me about how Facebook\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d makes it a new intermediary between brands and their customers, and between newspapers and their readers. That gives Facebook the potential to steal them all away if it ever chose to do so. (It says it won\u2019t.)Facebook, which maintained a fortresslike presence here within the Hotel Majestic as well on the beach, had a simple message: We Come in Peace, and we need the ad world.\u201cOur point of view on this is that the whole industry has to collaborate more than ever,\u201d Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global marketing solutions, told me. \u201cThere is a massive shift in the industry.\u201dThat shift is to mobile phones, where more and more digital advertising is going. But the industry hasn\u2019t quite figured out how to make us regularly watch more than three seconds of a telephone-based video ad, or to click on a mobile display ad on purpose.\u201cWe desperately need the agency ecosystem to support and drive this shift to mobile marketing,\u201d Ms. Everson said. Figuring it out is in everybody\u2019s interest.You can point to a clash between New York cynicism and West Coast idealism, but there is a history.But then it offered the brands a chance to increase visibility by paying for it \u2014 that is, to reach the customer fan base that Facebook had initially invited them to create free. You can imagine how that went over.Facebook has been doing a better job of avoiding such surprises, Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at OMD, told me at his company\u2019s beachside tent.But, he said, when Facebook is the mediator between advertisers and their customers, \u201cThey become Facebook\u2019s customers first and the brands\u2019 customers second,\u201d leaving the question, \u201cWho owns the customer data?\u201d The nearly universal complaint in Cannes was that Facebook was not doing enough to share that data, leaving an informational imbalance that, combined with Facebook\u2019s digital market share, gives it asymmetrical negotiating leverage.Ms. Everson said that Facebook\u2019s imperative to protect the privacy of its users precludes deeper sharing. But, she said, it has sophisticated tools to help its partners contact customers and likely customers without making them identifiable.Facebook\u2019s Madison Avenue \u201cpartners\u201d wonder if Facebook isn\u2019t hiding behind privacy to protect its own market advantage.\u201cWe fully understand that the users\u2019 privacy is sacrosanct,\u201d Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM Global, the huge advertising buying firm, told me. \u201cBut there are ways to share data without compromising it; everyone else has found ways to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Brandeis: American Prophet.\u201d The book, part of the Yale Jewish Lives series, is not a full biography \u2014 that ground is already well trod \u2014 but rather a concise and sympathetic exploration of Brandeis\u2019s main intellectual causes. It is well titled: Brandeis resembled an Old Testament prophet \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt called him \u201cold Isaiah\u201d \u2014 with his highly articulated moral vision and true believer\u2019s zeal. It is also well timed: Mr. Rosen persuasively makes his case that recognizing Brandeis as an \u201cAmerican prophet\u201d \u201cseems more important today than ever.\u201dBrandeis was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1856, to immigrant Jewish parents. Like many Southerners \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, whom he revered \u2014 Brandeis developed a strong sympathy for farmers and state governments, and a mistrust of big government and big business.It was not long after Brandeis graduated from Harvard Law School, at the top of his class, and began practicing law in Boston that he developed the first of his intellectual passions. He and his law partner wrote a groundbreaking Harvard Law Review article, \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d which warned that cutting-edge technologies like \u201cinstantaneous photographs\u201d were infringing on what he proposed as a new legal right: \u201cthe right to be let alone.\u201dAt first, Brandeis represented corporations, but he soon found another of his causes: the plight of workers. He won a major victory in 1908, in Muller v. Oregon, when he persuaded a pro-business Supreme Court to uphold a maximum-hours law for women. Brandeis, who had a reverence for facts and a deep interest in the real-world impact of law, transformed legal advocacy by filing what would later be known as a \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d: one with more facts and sociology than legal precedents.Brandeis\u2019s concerns about big corporations went beyond their labor practices: He saw them as antithetical to America\u2019s democratic ideals. In his view, it was the size of these corporations that was the problem \u2014 and this became another cause, a career-long battle against what he called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d Brandeis\u2019s prescription was aggressive trustbusting, and his public advocacy and work for President Wilson helped clear the way for the landmark Clayton Antitrust Act.There was one more cause Brandeis was passionate about: Zionism. When he represented striking New York garment workers, he got to know immigrant Jews who had fled the pogroms of Eastern Europe. Hearing their stories firsthand, Brandeis came to believe that the Jews needed a homeland where they could control their own destiny \u2014 and he soon became the leader of the American Zionist movement.Mr. Rosen is particularly original on this subject, showing how Brandeis rooted his Zionist thinking in American values of democracy and pluralism \u2014 and emphasizing Brandeis\u2019s insistence that any Jewish state had to proceed in a spirit of equality, with full political rights and economic inclusion for its Arab citizens.Wilson appointed Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916, and he was confirmed over the opposition of corporate interests and anti-Semites. On the court, he had many opportunities to give voice to his deeply held beliefs, sometimes in dissent.In Whitney v. California, a case about free-speech rights for radicals, Brandeis wrote a concurrence that is often called the most eloquent opinion ever written on the value of freedom of expression. His dissent in Olmstead v. United States, an early wiretapping case, was perhaps his most visionary, warning that \u201cdiscovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\u201dBecause of his deep distrust of big government, Brandeis was not always a reliable progressive vote on the court, and not all of his decisions have stood the test of time. He joined the majority in striking down a federal law aimed at ending child labor, and later voted to declare three New Deal laws unconstitutional in a single day, delivering a major blow to Roosevelt\u2019s plans for combating the Great Depression. In his deference to state legislatures, Brandeis voted to uphold some highly illiberal state laws, including \u2014 though his reasons for doing so are unclear \u2014 Virginia\u2019s 1924 law authorizing eugenic sterilizations.But despite Brandeis\u2019s occasional misfires, his philosophies, as Mr. Rosen convincingly argues, speak powerfully to our times \u2014 in his views on the threat that technology poses to privacy, on the importance of pluralism and equality in the Middle East and, perhaps most of all, on economic matters.Today\u2019s polemics about what unfettered capitalism is doing to ordinary Americans \u2014 from Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right \u2014 is terrain Brandeis covered, more deeply, with more cogent suggestions for reform. And his warnings about the \u201ccurse of bigness\u201d speak powerfully to an age in which the internet appears structurally inclined to create category-killing behemoths: Google for search, Amazon for retailing and Facebook, it seems, for just about everything else.Most of all, what the Gospel of Brandeis offers is a conviction that fact-based analysis and enlightened policy-making can help to set the world right. Brandeis never abandoned his pure faith that, with hard work and due deliberation, all things are possible. After all, he observed at an arbitration proceeding, \u201cmost of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.\u201dAdam Cohen, a former member of The New York Times editorial board, is the author, most recently, of \u201cImbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck.\u201dLouis D.

{"Headline": "Dizzy and Disoriented, With No Cure in Sight", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "It started in 2010 when I smoked pot for the first time since college. It was cheap, gristly weed I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had in my freezer for nearly six years, but four hours after taking one hit I was still so dizzy I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand up without holding on to the furniture. The next day I was still dizzy, and the next, and the next, but it tapered off gradually until about a month later I was mostly fine.Over the following year I got married, started teaching seventh and eighth grade, and began work on a novel. Every week or so the disequilibrium sneaked up on me. The feeling was one of disorientation as much as dizziness, with some cloudy vision, light nausea and the sensation of being overwhelmed by my surroundings. During one eighth-grade English class, when I turned around to write on the blackboard, I stumbled and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stabilize myself. I fell in front of my students and was too disoriented to stand. My students stared at me slumped on the floor until I mustered enough focus to climb up to a chair and did my best to laugh it off.All this took months, and I continued to be dizzy, all day, every day. It felt as though I woke up every morning having already drunk a dozen beers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some days, depending on how active and stressful my day was, it felt like much more. Most days ended with me in tears. Teaching was nearly impossible; I was unable to write because of blurry vision, and my wife became a caretaker more than a partner; I became addicted to message boards for dizziness, vertigo, benign positional vertigo and M\u00c3\u00a9ni\u00c3\u00a8re\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease. Anonymous posters described how their medications didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work and their doctors couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cure them. They couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep their jobs; their friends didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand them; and their spouses left or tried to be supportive, but eventually both suffered.But there was a downside. A known side effect of the treatment is nightmares. Night after night, I woke up from a tortured dream during which I fought someone off from attacking my wife and baby, or suffered the devastation of them leaving me. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep for more than a few hours at a time (and still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t), and neither could my family. Still, compared to the dizziness, it was a trade worth making. I was tired but still able to finish and sell my novel and to teach, and we had our second son.After nearly three years of being symptom free, I became greedy. Was there a way to live without the dizziness and the nightmares? I thought it might be worth cutting down on the medication to see. In January, I went to half the amount of medication, and I was fine. So I went to a quarter of the amount, and I was fine. So I went off it entirely.The dizziness came back more viciously than ever. This wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t troubling at first; I merely went back on the antidepressants. When they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work after a couple weeks, I grew anxious. But my doctor told me that sometimes the drugs take as long as a month to work. When they were still ineffective after two months, I began to despair. A neurologist explained that sometimes medication doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work a second time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes brain chemistries change, or medications stop proving effective for reasons doctors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.I am pretending for as long as I can, at least in front of my 3-year-old. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDaddy no feel so good?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says when I brace myself on a chair on my way to the kitchen to reheat his dinner. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to see a psychologist who specializes in pain and palliative care to provide techniques to help me get through the day. I am waiting, terrified, to see if this medication, or the next one, will rescue me.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Girls\u2019 Author Recalls Driving Past Manson\u2019s \u2018House\u2019 as a Child", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byEmma Cline remembers driving past San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, Calif., with her family when she was 7 years old. That\u2019s Charles Manson\u2019s house, her parents would say.Too young to catch the joke, Ms. Cline, now 27, believed for years that the hulking complex was really his home. In her mind, Mr. Manson, California\u2019s resident boogeyman, was a sinister, looming presence.\u201cHe didn\u2019t feel like something from the past,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was very much in the air.\u201dThat was the start of her Manson obsession. As she grew older, she became fixated on the young women who orbited Mr. Manson, a charismatic cult leader who orchestrated killings in Southern California in 1969, including the murder of the actress Sharon Tate. It bothered Ms. Cline that his female accomplices and devotees seemed like footnotes in his story.\u201cThe girls and the women involved were relegated to bit players in the narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019d be these little details, but I never got a sense of them as full characters.\u201dThe story begins in Northern California in the summer of 1969, as a lonely 14-year-old girl, Evie, becomes mesmerized by group of carefree, feral looking girls she sees laughing in a park. She later learns that they are followers of a charismatic musician and prophet named Russell. Eventually, they take Evie to a run-down ranch where the girls live in squalor. Evie is so desperate to belong and to win the approval of a sultry older girl that she ignores signs of abuse and brainwashing.The narrative shifts between the summer of the murders, and Evie\u2019s later years as an unemployed, middle-aged home aide who was spared the worst but still can\u2019t escape her past.\u201cThe Girls\u201d stands apart from other treatments of Mr. Manson, though. In a recent interview at a coffee shop near her apartment in Gowanus, Brooklyn, Ms. Cline said she wasn\u2019t interested in writing about him as a historical figure. Instead, she wanted to explore violent acts committed by women. Ms. Cline deliberately stripped her fictional cult leader, Russell, of the glamorous sheen that she feels Mr. Manson acquired over the decades.\u201cI felt like everyone had heard enough of that story, the charismatic cult leader,\u201d said Ms. Cline, who has long strawberry-blond hair, light-blue eyes and a habit of staring into space while formulating her thoughts.Ms. Cline\u2019s fascination with commune life stems partly from her childhood. She is one of seven siblings, and the oldest of five girls. Growing up in Sonoma County, Calif., where her parents own a winery, the Cline children lived in a state of happy and comfortable chaos, and learned to fend for themselves. On their birthdays, the children would get a box of cereal that they didn\u2019t have to share with their siblings. (Ms. Cline always chose frosted cornflakes.)\u201cIt really was like a little commune \u2014 extremely chaotic and slightly feral,\u201d she said.Ms. Cline found her niche as the creative one among her siblings. (The others have pursued a dizzying range of careers, including biomedical engineering, aeronautical engineering and rodeo management.) Ms. Cline took up acting. She appeared in a few local commercials and played the young Billie Jean King in a television movie about the tennis star. \u201cThat was as close to stardom as I got,\u201d she said. In college at Middlebury, she wrote fiction and studied visual arts.Around that time, she decided to pursue writing seriously. When she enrolled in Columbia University\u2019s M.F.A. program in 2011, she had already written 200 pages of a novel set in a commune. Heidi Julavits, who taught Ms. Cline at Columbia, recalls being riveted by the novel\u2019s first chapter. \u201cWhat grabbed me was this tension between innocence and a sense that something very sinister was going to happen,\u201d she said.Bits and pieces of the commune novel made their way into \u201cThe Girls.\u201d Ms. Cline finished the draft a year after she graduated, while working as a fiction reader at The New Yorker. To save money, she lived rent-free in a spruced up garden shed in her friend\u2019s backyard near the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn.The novel has been buoyed by a handful of ecstatic reviews and embraced by high-profile novelists like Jennifer Egan and Richard Ford, who in an interview praised \u201cThe Girls\u201d for its \u201cdaring and aspiration\u201d and its \u201cacute writerly attention to physical and emotional details.\u201dBut Ms. Cline seems unfazed. It helps that she is social media averse, staying off Twitter and Facebook, and that she is busy working on her next novel.\u201cIn so many ways, my life hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d she said.Of course, in significant ways, it has. She\u2019s under contract for two books from Random House, more job security than most novelists enjoy. And she no longer lives in a shed.Advertisement"}

Only three technology companies have made their debuts so far in 2016. Additionally, Thursday was Britain\u2019s day to vote to stay or leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit, which some feared would shake up the markets.

Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software company\u2019s finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets became more uncertain, investors preferred that companies going public turn a profit.Twilio had $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.Bessemer Venture Partners first backed Twilio in 2009 and is its largest shareholder, owning about 25 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Fidelity Investments and Union Square Ventures also hold significant stakes. These entities, as well as certain executives, hold 98.6 percent of the voting power after the public offering because of their ownership of supervoting stock.Jeff Lawson, 38, founded the company eight years ago and is its chief executive. Before Twilio, he started Nine Star, a retailer of equipment and apparel for the skate, ski, surf and BMX sports crowd. He also worked for Amazon as technical product manager and was chief technology officer at StubHub.The company plans to use the net proceeds to expand its engineering, sales and marketing and customer support teams, and potentially to acquire businesses or other assets.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase managed the offering.

{"Headline": "Finding Ways to Keep Patients at Home", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "My patient was a proudly elegant woman in her 70s who lived alone. Her Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease had so severely restricted her ability to move that it would take her hours to get dressed in the morning. And leaving the house was virtually impossible, so she had to rely on neighbors and friends from her church community for help with shopping.She was adamant that she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want aggressive treatment to keep her alive. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been hospitalized many times, and she told me she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to take a hospital bed that would be better used for someone else. So she dutifully completed an advance directive that made her wishes clear. It said that she would not want to be kept alive on a breathing machine, and that she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want cardiopulmonary resuscitation if her heart stopped. She also wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be fed through a tube if she was no longer able to eat. What was most important to her, though, was staying at home and avoiding a nursing home.As a palliative care physician, I always urge my patients to complete advance directives. These are legal documents that tell doctors and family members what treatment they do and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ever unable to make decisions for themselves. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important, because if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what my patients want, the default is to do everything to keep them alive, which typically results in unnecessary and costly treatment. Indeed, one of the most often-cited arguments for advance directives is the fact that 25 percent of Medicare spending is for people in the last year of life.When my patient developed a cough and a fever, likely a result of pneumonia, she became too confused to make decisions for herself. Thanks to her advance directive, her family knew that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want aggressive treatment, and we knew that she wanted to stay home. So we arranged for short-term daily nursing visits and enough support so that, with additional help from her family, she was able to remain at home as she wanted.  I thought that she would get worse without aggressive treatment in the hospital, and that we would enroll her in hospice, so I was surprised when she began to improve. Soon she was able to make decisions for herself and even returned to the same level of independence that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had before she became sick. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when it became obvious to me that advance directives have their limits. My patient lived, as many people with chronic, serious illnesses do, on a thin ledge of independence. The smallest nudge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a few missed medication doses, the loss of just a little support \u00e2\u0080\u0094 left her entirely vulnerable. In my patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, that nudge came two months later, when her neighbors ran into financial problems and their daughter, who had been doing the grocery shopping for my patient, had to take an after-school job. My patient valued her independence more than anything, so whenever her neighbors and her out-of-state family checked on her, or when we called her, she told us all that she was fine.For three weeks, my patient subsisted on nothing but white rice, because that was all she had in the house. When her grand niece called us and asked us to check on her, we sent a social worker and a nurse to visit her. We found her housebound, surrounded by garbage, with no clean laundry and no toilet paper. Despite our best efforts, we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do enough to keep her safe at home, so she went to live in a nursing home, where she spent the last two months of her life. An advance directive had helped her stay out of the hospital, as she had wanted. And perhaps it even made a bed available for someone who needed it more, as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hoped. But that piece of paper didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help her to live out her final months with the sort of comfort and dignity that she deserved.When we talk about advance directives and reducing costly and unnecessary treatment at the end of life, we should also be talking about ways we can provide more support. We need to make sure that people like my patient have access to the kinds of care that can help them remain safely and comfortably at home.  Now when I help my patients complete an advance directive that defines the treatment they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want, we also discuss what support they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need in the future. I talk with my patients and their families about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be necessary to keep them safe and comfortable in their homes today, and next month and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for the next few years. Those sorts of discussions are essential, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not enough. We also need to revise the way we think about advance directives. Advance directives help reduce health care costs at the end of life by avoiding aggressive treatment, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the most compelling argument for them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not enough to reduce what we spend on aggressive treatment at the end of life; we also need to spend those resources in better ways. For someone around my patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, the average cost of a hospitalization is about $13,000. So Medicare should have been willing to spend $13,000 to keep her safe and comfortable at home. That sum would have been more than enough to pay for a visiting nurse to continue to check on her after she recovered from pneumonia and a home health aide to help her with bathing and dressing. And it could have paid the girl next door to do her grocery shopping so a frail elderly woman didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to subsist on white rice because it was the only food she had.We should have been able to provide all of that help. My patient was adamant that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spend her last days of life in a hospital, taking up a bed that someone else could use. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make sure that when people like her forgo costly treatment at the end of life, they get something in return.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Upheaval Amid \u2018Alarming\u2019 Revelations at William Koch\u2019s Florida School", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byIt turned out, William I. Koch said in an interview, that a \u201cpower elites group\u201d in the school ran \u201cthe asylum.\u201dThe school, which has 580 students, has many perks, including a physical therapist on staff, chef-prepared lunches, an equestrian club and a flight simulator. The debate team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars traveling to competitions nationwide, Mr. Koch said.\u201cWe are finding alarming things of how money was misspent,\u201d Mr. Koch said at his company\u2019s offices. \u201cIf people think they\u2019ve got a honey pot, there\u2019s going to be a lot of bears around it, trying to get it.\u201dA few years ago, students requested that the school establish a football team, an idea the administration embraced. But that was when the troubles took off. An athlete who read at a third-grade level was given a full scholarship, the football team had its own locker room and the coach earned more than $200,000 a year, according to tax records and interviews with former employees.The former head of school, Robert C. Parsons, whose official title was president and chief executive, is a former chief financial officer at the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Parsons started at Oxbridge in 2011 with a compensation package worth $1 million, tax records show, seven times his academy salary. Eventually, he made about $600,000 a year at the school.But in interviews, former employees questioned Mr. Koch\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Parsons in the first place, because he was suspended for five days after a 2009 Naval inspector general report accused him and his former boss of operating a \u201cslush fund\u201d to pay for tailgate parties.Mr. Koch said he did not think Mr. Parsons\u2019 record at the Naval Academy was a red flag because the government is \u201call screwed up.\u201dTheir experiences underscore the pitfalls that confront business leaders whose professional success does not always translate into the education field.Mr. Koch has discovered similar challenges, though he had a personal motivation for starting Oxbridge.He said he founded the school to give his own children a better academic experience than he had. By his account, he went from being an awkward ugly duckling who was flunking out of middle school in Kansas, to a military academy cadet who embraced a love of study. He longed for a place where students, not teachers\u2019 unions or principals, ruled.He completed a Ph.D. at M.I.T., but acknowledges that he still cannot spell very well. And he chokes up just talking about the troubled students who have made a turnaround at Oxbridge, which his children attend and from which his son has just graduated.\u201cMy biggest failing is I\u2019m too trusting of people,\u201d Mr. Koch said.Oxbridge was created in less than a year on a 45-acre campus that once held a Jewish community center.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people appreciate how much happened here in five years,\u201d said Bob Kaufmann, the chairman of the school\u2019s executive committee, who has been given the task of reducing spending. \u201cThis is a happy place for children.\u201dOxbridge graduates have been accepted this fall to nearly all of the Ivy League universities. One senior won a $100,000 Siemens scholarship for inventing a water-purification method.Mr. Bodnar, who had been on the admissions committee, said the committee\u2019s recommendations were often overruled by the football coaches.He said that there were so many academically struggling athletes that tutors were overwhelmed, and that the players had to be put in classes separate from the rest of the student body.John Klemme, the academic dean who will take over as head of school, said that some of the struggling students \u201cwould have been written off\u201d at other schools, but had found their way to a superior education because of their football prowess.\u201cThis is not to be a rich kids\u2019 school,\u201d Mr. Klemme said.Mr. Koch said that about 40 percent of students \u2014 including those who do not play football \u2014 received some kind of scholarship.Phillip Taylor, 17, a junior, said he loved the school and the opportunities he had been given, such as spring break study at Cambridge University in Britain. Still, he said he resented the double standard on admissions afforded to football players.\u201cMy experience was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned so much. But it does bother me.\u201dHis mother, Cheryl Taylor, also had a daughter in the school\u2019s freshman class in the school\u2019s inaugural year. She said parents like her who are impressed by the education the school offered were startled by its cultural shift.\u201cAt first, you had to be academically qualified, but that changed dramatically about two years in,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cFootball began to outshine everything else.\u201dThe problems at Oxbridge, where tuition is $31,500 a year, went beyond sports. In interviews, several former employees said Mr. Parsons had created a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment. Employee turnover was high and tens of thousands of dollars were spent on severance packages, tax records show.\u201cIf he likes somebody and she\u2019s a pretty girl, they got a signing bonus or a higher salary or a bonus,\u201d Ulle Sinisalu Boshko, the school\u2019s former controller, said of Mr. Parsons.Reached by a New York Times reporter on the phone for comment last week, Mr. Parsons hung up. Reached on Sunday, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d and hung up again.After inquiries from The Post, Mr. Koch hired a team of accountants, lawyers and a retired F.B.I. agent to look into the conduct of school officials, including whether employees were rigging bids with vendors and whether they had broken rules by housing students in their homes.Mr. Koch said he had not been able to verify any \u201csuper sexual harassment\u201d beyond what he called \u201cPG-13\u201d comments like \u201cGod, that girl\u2019s hot\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s got a great behind.\u201d But the investigation, he said, turned up information that led to the firing of Mr. Parsons and the forcing out of the athletic director and the coach.Mr. Koch said the investigators did not find any evidence of kickbacks to employees from vendors. He said that if any evidence of grade-changing emerged, the employees responsible would be fired. He said budget watchdogs would be hired to cut costs and pay closer attention to spending.\u201cThe attitude that was there at the school was that they had a rich guy backing it and they could do whatever they wanted,\u201d he said.He also wants to figure out how to get others to donate to the school, he said. That was one reason he did not name the school after himself.An earlier version of this article misstated the dateline. It is West Palm Beach, not Palm Beach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Sugar Really Bad for You? It Depends", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "We spoke with some top scientists who study sugar and its effects on metabolic health to help answer some common questions about sugar. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they had to say.Why are food labels being revised? The shift came after years of urging by many nutrition experts, who say that excess sugar is a primary cause of obesity and heart disease, the leading killer of Americans. Many in the food industry opposed the emphasis on added sugars, arguing that the focus should be on calories rather than sugar. They say that highlighting\u00c2\u00a0added sugar on labels is unscientific, and that the sugar that occurs naturally in foods like fruits and vegetables is essentially no different than the sugar commonly added to packaged foods. But scientists say it is not that simple.So, is added sugar different from the naturally occurring sugar\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0food?It depends. Most sugars are essentially combinations of two molecules, glucose and fructose, in different ratios. The sugar in a fresh apple, for instance, is generally the same as the table sugar that might be added to homemade apple pie. Both are known technically as sucrose, and they are broken down in the intestine into glucose and fructose. Glucose can be metabolized by any cell in the body. But fructose is handled almost exclusively by the liver.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you get to that point, the liver doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it\u00c2\u00a0came from fruit or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kimber Stanhope, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studies the effects of sugar on health. Dr. Stanhope noted that while the liver may not know whether the fructose came from an apple or a soft drink, the way the liver processes that fructose could possibly be affected by some of the beneficial components in fruit. In contrast to soda, fruit contains fiber, vitamins, minerals and numerous other bioactive components. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u2019t know if and how these components may counteract the negative effects of fructose overload in the liver,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.The type of sugar that is often added to processed foods is high-fructose corn syrup, which is the food industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favored sweetener for everything from soft drinks to breads, sauces, snacks and salad dressings. Made commercially from cornstarch, high-fructose corn syrup is generally much cheaper than regular sugar. It contains the same components as table sugar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 glucose and fructose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in slightly different proportions.What about \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural\u00e2\u0080\u009d sweeteners?Is high-fructose corn syrup worse than regular sugar? How is it different?High-fructose corn syrup and regular sugar are so similar that most experts say their effects on the body are essentially the same.Why doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the F.D.A. require that added sugars be listed in teaspoons rather than grams?When the new food labels go into effect, the daily recommended limit for added sugars will be 50 grams, or roughly 12 teaspoons, daily. (One teaspoon of sugar is 4.2 grams.) But the new food labels will list the amount of added sugars solely in grams.Many nutrition advocates have urged the F.D.A. to require that food labels list added sugars in both teaspoons and grams on food labels, arguing that Americans often underestimate the actual amount of sugar in a product when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expressed in grams alone.But the F.D.A. ultimately sided with the food industry, which opposed the teaspoon proposal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be difficult, if not impossible, for a manufacturer to determine the volume contribution that each ingredient provides toward the added sugars declaration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the agency said.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, a cookie made with white chocolate chips and dried fruit would have added sugars in the form of sugar in the batter as well as in the white chocolate chips and the dried fruit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The F.D.A. also said that requiring both grams and teaspoons would \u00e2\u0080\u009ccause clutter and make the labels more difficult to read.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut Michael Jacobson, the president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group that had petitioned the F.D.A. to require the teaspoon measurement, said the agency was under enormous pressure from the food industry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich knows that consumers would be far more concerned about a product labeled 10 teaspoons than 42 grams.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSo what\u2019s the issue with added sugars?It mainly comes down to the way they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re packaged.Naturally occurring sugar is almost always found in foods that contain fiber, which slows the rate at which the sugar is digested and absorbed. (One exception to that rule is honey, which has no fiber.) Fiber also limits the amount of sugar you can consume in one sitting.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easily eat that much sugar from fruit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut nobody has any problem consuming a very high level of sugar from a beverage or from brownies and cookies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhy is it a problem to have too much sugar?Many nutrition experts say that sugar in moderation is fine for most people. But in excess it can lead to metabolic problems beyond its effects on weight gain. The reason, studies suggest, is fructose. Any fructose you eat is sent straight to\u00c2\u00a0your liver, which specializes in turning it into droplets of fat called triglycerides.Over time, this combination \u00e2\u0080\u0093 higher triglycerides and lower HDL \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is one major reason sugar promotes\u00c2\u00a0heart disease, said Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and adviser to the United Kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national obesity forum. This sequence of events may even overshadow the effects of LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triglycerides and HDL that are more predictive of cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Malhotra said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not saying LDL isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t important. But if there is a hierarchy, triglycerides and HDL are more important than LDL.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDr. Malhotra said that when people reduce their sugar intake, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir overall cholesterol profile improves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see this in so many of my patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe effects are rapid.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHow much sugar is too much?One of the largest studies of added sugar consumption, which was led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that adults who got more than 15 percent of their daily calories from added sugar had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. For the average adult, that translates to about 300 calories, or 18 teaspoons of added sugar, daily. That may sound like a lot, but it\u2019s actually quite easy to take in that much, or even more, without realizing it. A single 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola, for example, has almost 10 teaspoons of sugar; it can add up quickly.The study found that most adults got more than 10 percent of their daily calories from added sugar, and that for 10 percent of people, more than 25 percent\u00c2\u00a0of their calories came from added sugar. The biggest sources for adults were soft drinks, fruit juices, desserts and candy.While those might seem like obvious junk foods, Dr. Malhotra said, about half of the sugar Americans consume is \u00e2\u0080\u009chidden\u00e2\u0080\u009d in less obvious places like salad dressings, bread, low-fat yogurt and ketchup. In fact, of the 600,000 food items for sale in America, about 80 percent contain added sugar.\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould I tell you the exact limit where sugar starts to definitely impact cardiovascular health?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult.

{"Headline": "Hugh Honour, Art Historian and Author, Dies at 88", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byHugh Honour, a self-taught art historian who produced indispensable works on Neo-Classicism and romanticism and who, with John Fleming, wrote the monumental survey \u201cThe Visual Arts: A History,\u201d one of the first to pay serious attention to non-Western art, died on May 19 at his home in Tofori, Italy. He was 88.His death was reported in the Italian press and in British newspapers.Mr. Honour moved to Italy in the mid-1950s to be with Mr. Fleming, and the two men, who were partners until Mr. Fleming\u2019s death in 2001, entered into a highly productive writing and editing relationship. Allen Lane, the founder of Penguin Books, lived near them in a rented villa and proposed that they oversee a series, \u201cStyle and Civilization,\u201d which would explore significant periods in art history, each with its own brief volume.The two editors accepted and performed brilliantly. Michael Levey\u2019s \u201cEarly Renaissance\u201d was the first nonliterary work to win the Hawthornden Prize when it was published in 1967, and several other books in the series, notably Linda Nochlin\u2019s \u201cRealism\u201d (1971) and Mr. Honour\u2019s own contribution, \u201cNeo-Classicism\u201d (1968), quickly became standard works. All were published under the Pelican imprint.With Mr. Fleming, Mr. Honour went on to edit two more series for Penguin in the same format: \u201cArchitect and Society\u201d and \u201cArt in Context.\u201d \u201cThe Visual Arts: A History\u201d was published in Britain in 1982 as \u201cA World History of Art.\u201dIntended to compete with E. H. Gombrich\u2019s imposing survey, \u201cThe Story of Art,\u201d the new work expanded the field to include the arts of Asia, Africa, Oceania and the indigenous cultures of the New World.\u201cSpanning continents and millennia, ranging from man\u2019s earliest cave paintings to the works of Picasso and beyond, this is a hugely ambitious book,\u201d the art critic Andrew Graham Dixon wrote in the British newspaper The Independent. \u201cBut thanks to the breadth of their scholarship, the depth of their enthusiasm and the enviable freshness of their writing, Honour and Fleming triumphantly accomplish the herculean task they have set themselves.\u201dWriting in The Spectator after Mr. Honour\u2019s death, the arts journalist Laura Freeman described the book as \u201cthe scaffolding around which I have built everything I have learnt since of art history.\u201d She added, \u201cThey give you not just the sweep of world art history but mini-essays, timelines and diversions: Roman luxury, Lady Murasaki on calligraphy, the cult of the carts at Chartres, a shaman\u2019s mask.\u201dThe book, awarded the Mitchell Prize for the History of Art in 1982, is now in its seventh edition.In a post on his Facebook page, Luca Menesini, the mayor of the municipality of Capannori, where the village of Tofori is situated, northwest of Florence, wrote that \u201cthe tranquillity and beauty of our hills\u201d made it possible for Mr. Honour to pursue his studies, \u201cwhich will remain forever his important contribution to culture.\u201dPatrick Hugh Honour was born on Sept. 26, 1927, in Eastbourne, East Sussex. He attended King\u2019s School in Canterbury and studied 18th-century English literature at St. Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree.As a volunteer at the print room of the British Museum, Mr. Honour helped catalog the collection of English drawings. He then worked briefly as an assistant to the director of the Leeds Art Gallery and Temple Newsam House, an affiliated Tudor-Jacobean House landscaped by Capability Brown.In 1954 he joined Mr. Fleming, a solicitor and amateur art historian whom he had met at Cambridge, in Lerici, on the Ligurian coast. Mr. Fleming had been hired to read to the literary scholar Percy Lubbock, a close friend of Henry James\u2019s, who had lost his sight. Through Mr. Lubbock the two men entered into the artistic and literary milieu of I Tatti, the art historian Bernard Berenson\u2019s villa.Mr. Honour began contributing reviews and articles to The Times of London and The Connoisseur magazine and wrote \u201cHorace Walpole,\u201d a study of the 18th-century politician and man of letters, published in 1957.After the couple moved to Asolo, near Venice, Mr. Honour, in \u201cChinoiserie: A Vision of Cathay\u201d (1961), turned his attention to the Western fascination with Chinese art in the 18th century that found expression in the visual and decorative arts.The book took an unusual tack, setting chinoiserie in a political and economic context and treating the style as a specific form of Western fantasy. His approach led to an invitation to organize the traveling exhibition \u201cThe European Vision of America\u201d for the United States Bicentennial in 1976. As a companion to the exhibition, he wrote \u201cThe New Golden Land: European Images of America From the Discoveries to the Present Time.\u201dAfter writing a travel book, \u201cThe Companion Guide to Venice\u201d (1965), Mr. Honour embarked with Mr. Fleming on the Penguin \u201cStyle and Civilization\u201d project. In addition to editing that multivolume series, they wrote \u201cThe Penguin Dictionary of Architecture\u201d (1966), with Nikolaus Pevsner, and \u201cThe Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts\u201d (1977).Mr. Honour had ended \u201cNeo-Clacissism\u201d with a cliffhanger. Describing the 1808 Ingres painting \u201cOedipus and the Sphinx,\u201d he wrote: \u201cA new vision of antiquity is here beginning to emerge \u2014 very different from the cool, calm land of liberty and reason described by Winckelmann and painted by David. In this grim mountain cleft there is no sign of an eternal springtime. The dark irrational gods are once more closing in.\u201dHe continued the story with \u201cRomanticism,\u201d published in 1979. In The New York Review of Books, Charles Rosen and Henri Zerner called it \u201cthe best book yet available (and perhaps ever written) on romanticism in the visual arts.\u201dIn the 1980s, the De Menil Foundation in Houston engaged Mr. Honour to take part in its gargantuan project, begun in the 1960s, to document the representation of blacks in Western visual art. Mr. Honour contributed the fourth volume in the series, a two-part work titled \u201cThe Image of the Black in Western Art: From the American Revolution to World War I\u201d (1989).With Mr. Fleming, Mr. Honour, who leaves no immediate survivors, returned to Venice and the world of Henry James in \u201cThe Venetian Hours of Henry James, Whistler and Sargent.\u201dPublished in 1991, it bore Mr. Honour\u2019s stylistic stamp: authoritative, concise, evocative.\u201cNowhere, not even in Holland, where the correspondence between the real aspects and the little polished canvases is so constant and so exquisite, do art and life seem so interfused and, as it were, so consanguineous,\u201d he and Mr. Fleming wrote. \u201cAll the splendor of light and color, all the Venetian air and the Venetian history are on the walls and ceilings of the palaces; and all the genius of the masters, all the images and visions they have left upon canvas, seem to tremble in the sunbeams and dance upon the waves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The question now is not just who will buy it, but what exactly they will be paying for.But while company\u2019s public image \u2014 and troubles \u2014 have centered around its aggressive and boundary-testing flagship news site, Gawker.com, potential buyers may be interested in a less visible part of its business: e-commerce.In recent years, Gawker Media has tried to build up its e-commerce revenue \u2014 earned from lucrative commissions taken from referrals to sites like Amazon \u2014 as a hedge against an increasingly uncertain online news environment, in which platforms like Google and Facebook take ever-larger shares of advertising revenue.But while that kind of revenue was growing, Gawker Media\u2019s commerce plans never fully came to fruition. The effort was hindered by an obsessive focus on developing Kinja, the company\u2019s internal content management and commenting system, as well as the creation of numerous subsites with distinct brands, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s financial situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.Now, with financial independence off the table, Gawker Media\u2019s e-commerce operation may nonetheless play an outsize role in determining the company\u2019s fate. Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, a technology publisher that entered a first bid for the company \u2014 reportedly between $90 million and $100 million \u2014 wrote in a memo to staff that \u201clike us, GMG is heavily active in driving commerce-based revenues, and has an impressive publishing and commerce platform with Kinja.\u201dMr. Denton also referred to the consumer component in his own announcement.While affirming his site\u2019s commitment to \u201ctelling the true stories that underpin credibility with our millions of readers,\u2019\u2019 he also wrote, \u201ca combination would marry Ziff Davis\u2019 strength in e-commerce, licensing and video with GMG\u2019s premium media brands.\u201dZiff Davis, a major presence in the pre-blog technology and gaming press, filed for bankruptcy itself in 2008, and is now, in a substantially different form, a subsidiary of the internet services and publishing conglomerate j2 Global. The company\u2019s interest in a deal was fueled by Gawker\u2019s portfolio of tech, lifestyle and gaming sites that together, through e-commerce and advertising, make up 85 percent of Gawker Media\u2019s total revenue, according to another person briefed on the finances.If it was difficult to imagine Gawker Media, the persistently antagonistic outsider, as part of a larger and more risk-averse company, Mr. Shah\u2019s memo provided some clues.\u201cThe additions of Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Kotaku would fortify our position in consumer tech and gaming,\u201d Mr. Shah wrote in his memo. \u201cWith the addition of Jalopnik, Deadspin and Jezebel, we would broaden our position as a lifestyle publisher.\u201dThe memo did not mention Gawker.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ben Simmons Looks to LeBron James as Model as N.B.A. Draft Looms", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesOn the day LeBron James was having his victory parade in Cleveland, Ben Simmons spoke with me in a Manhattan hotel about anticipating his championship moment. That moment came at the N.B.A. draft a day later when Simmons, a 19-year-old who is coming off a single season at Louisiana State, was selected No. 1 by the Philadelphia 76ers.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal right now,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt probably won\u2019t hit me until I\u2019m in the city, I\u2019m actually part of the organization.\u201dOn Thursday night, it hit him. \u201cIt honestly feels like all the pressure just has hopped off me,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cNow I can relax. I know where I\u2019m going to be. I know where I\u2019m headed.\u201dSimmons epitomizes the rare gem produced on the supply side of the basketball industry. At 6 feet 10 inches, he is a versatile player at home anywhere on the floor.Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, Simmons pushed his parents to send him to the United States after looking at YouTube clips, studying rankings and looking at his high school competition.\u201cPart of it was him saying, \u2018I\u2019m ready,\u2019\u201d his father, David, recalled.During the recruiting process, Simmons rejected the idea that a top player should naturally attend one of the most successful big-time programs. He said no to Kentucky and no to Duke. Instead he went to L.S.U., where his godfather, David Patrick, was the associate head coach. Patrick is now an assistant at Texas Christian.\u201cThe point for me was going to a school that didn\u2019t have a rich basketball history like a Kentucky or a Duke,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI knew it was going to be hard. I like a challenge. I accepted that.\u201dL.S.U. severely underachieved. There were injuries and problems with team chemistry issues. The Tigers did not make the N.C.A.A. tournament and elected not to participate in the National Invitation Tournament.\u201cIt was tough, because I\u2019ve never been on a losing team,\u201d Simmons said.But having ended up on one \u2014 and having shouldered the blame for the team\u2019s failures \u2014 will help Simmons in his transition to the N.B.A. if he does not get off to a flying start.\u201cThe experience at L.S.U. helped me understand that things are not always going to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cI was getting all of that thrown on me, but I had to deal with it, and it came with the territory.\u201dSimmons signed last March with Klutch Sports. The agency\u2019s highest-profile client is James, the top draft pick at 18 years old in 2003, who Simmons says has become a friend and a mentor. They talk frequently, discussing topics like footwork and how Simmons\u2019s life is about to dramatically change.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot just being around LeBron,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cPeople say things about him all the time, but he would never say anything back. That\u2019s what I learned from him: Don\u2019t retaliate to articles or pieces or to things that are said about me.\u201dSimmons is the subject of a documentary, \u201cOne and Done,\u201d scheduled to appear on Showtime in October. The film explores Simmons\u2019s journey from Australia to Florida to L.S.U. to the N.B.A. It illustrates the global system that delivers players to college programs in the United States.\u201cI think it\u2019s great because you\u2019re watching somebody go from high school to the N.B.A., and you see what\u2019s actually happening,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI want people to understand it\u2019s not all about the money, cars and things like that. A lot of different things go into this.\u201dThe underlying question the film examines is whether the most talented high school athletes should be forced to spend a \u201csham year\u201d in college or play professionally outside the United States rather than having the opportunity to go straight to the N.B.A.\u201cI look at the N.B.A. as a job, a great job to have, so I think for me, I would have loved the opportunity to go to the N.B.A. out of high school,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready, you\u2019re not ready. If you are ready, I think you should be able top to go.\u201dHe added: \u201cI enjoyed my time at L.S.U. I wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. My dad went to college \u2014 my sisters, brothers \u2014 so I felt like I just had to, and I enjoyed it.\u201dSimmons is the youngest of six children. His father, David, was born and raised in the South Bronx; his mother, Julie, is from Australia.David Simmons played college basketball at Oklahoma City University and spent his professional career in South America and finally in Australia, where he met and married Julie.\u201cI never would have imagined any of this,\u201d David Simmons said. \u201cThere was no plan for this. All of our kids were treated the same. They were all coached the same way. Ben just happened to be the kid who turned out to be 6-10 with the same skills they all had.\u201dBecause of his high profile, his extraordinary skills and the desperation of the team that makes him their first selection, Simmons may have a shorter-than-usual honeymoon.In the era of social media, anyone can text a good game. Anyone can Facebook or Snapchat a good game. But at some point, you have to play a good game \u2014 especially if you are a high-profile rookie in championship-starved Philadelphia.\u201cI\u2019ll have time to mature and develop, and one day, hopefully, I can bring a ring to wherever I am,\u201d Simmons said.He smiled. \u201cLeBron did it,\u201d Simmons said.I reminded him that James had left Cleveland, then returned.\u201cI think it had to happen,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt helped him mature his game, understand how to be a better player, teammate and leader. He came back to Cleveland knowing how to win a championship.\u201dImpressive insight from a 19-year-old who will have to remind a forlorn franchise what winning looks like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Garrison Keillor You Never Knew", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byST. PAUL, MINN. \u2014 Garrison Keillor was riding shotgun in a rented Chevy, motoring east through the steamy Midwestern heat.His linen suit was appropriately rumpled \u2014 everything about this public radio legend suggests disregard for crisp lines \u2014 and his gangly legs were jacked up against the glove box, as he resisted suggestions to slide his seat back. Hitching a ride with a reporter from Minneapolis to his home here, he filled the yawning silences with a weird little singsong, \u201cbomp, bomp, bomp, bomp.\u201dHe had just spent hours rehearsing for the following night, May 21, when he hosted \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d at the State Theater in Minneapolis, before a packed, adoring crowd for the last time.After more than four decades of hosting this homespun Americana musical variety program, which he created and which, in turn, created him, Mr. Keillor is retiring. He has done this before, in 1987, though that retirement ended up being a sabbatical. In 2011, there were rumors \u2014 baseless, Mr. Keillor\u2019s people said \u2014 that he was thinking of abandoning ship then, too.But this time, Mr. Keillor, 73, said he means it. He has named a successor and lined up meaty post-\u201cPrairie\u201d projects, among them columns for The Washington Post, a screenplay and a book. While he has a solo tour planned through the year, along with a \u201cPrairie\u201d-esque Labor Day weekend show at the Minnesota State Fair, he will host his final official \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d on July 1 at, of all places, the Hollywood Bowl.Yet as familiar and cherished as \u201cPrairie\u201d has become to millions, it was always about Mr. Keillor\u2019s fascinations, rather than the inner tickings of its host.\u201cIt was never about self expression, never,\u201d Mr. Keillor said.Everything about \u201cPrairie Home\u201d \u2014 the Guy Noir and Lives of the Cowboys sketches, the spots for Powdermilk Biscuits and the Ketchup Advisory Board, the monologues about the fictional Lake Wobegon \u2014 sprang from Mr. Keillor\u2019s imagination. But the man spinning the plates at the center of it all managed to stay a mystery, even to people who know him well.\u201cGarrison in person is quite different,\u201d said his longtime friend, the writer Mark Singer. \u201cGarrison does not express emotion in interpersonal conversations the way the rest of us do.\u201dPerformers often cultivate alternate personas, but with Mr. Keillor the difference is startling. That night, onstage in Minneapolis, he was garrulous and affable, and afterward ventured out onto the sidewalk to meet his hundreds-strong admirers, many of whom feel they know him intimately.As fans flocked around him, Mr. Keillor graciously deflected questions, directing queries back to the scrum. This helps him gather story ideas but also serves as a bridge from his onstage personality to his default setting, the introverted, removed man who seems miles away, even when you\u2019re sitting two feet from him on his porch, eating the jelly beans he has set out.\u201cHis gaze is often floating and takes you in from a strange distance,\u201d said the writer and editor Roger Angell, who in 1970 edited Mr. Keillor\u2019s first piece for The New Yorker. \u201cHe is certainly the strangest person I know.\u201d\u201cPrairie Home\u201d captured a time, before tweets and Facebook posts, when people talked more over fence posts and pots of coffee but nowadays feels increasingly removed from many listeners\u2019 lives.\u201cA lot of the conversation has been: \u2018Did Garrison wait too long? Should Garrison have done this years ago?\u2019\u201d said Eric Nuzum, former vice president for programming at NPR. \u201cThe problem of \u2018Prairie Home Companion\u2019 is it\u2019s part of public radio\u2019s past, not their future,\u201d Mr. Nuzum said. (American Public Media distributes \u201cPrairie Home\u201d; NPR member stations air programs from APM as well as from other distributors.)Still, Mr. Keillor played an outsize role in shaping what public radio has become.He was a pioneering force and taught public radio valuable lessons, Mr. Nuzum said. The live performances and touring built audiences and kept them connected and deeply loyal. That proved lucrative, as did sales of \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d recordings, books, clothes and tchotchkes. Mr. Keillor also became one of public radio\u2019s earliest celebrities, appearing on the cover of Time in 1985.The show itself, with its singing, quirky sidekicks, stealthily dark humor and fart jokes, forged a new path.Adored as he has been by millions, Mr. Keillor drove a few critics around the bend.Yet Mr. Glass believes that many people mistake \u201cPrairie Home\u201d for quaint, homespun nostalgia, even though the tales from Lake Wobegon are, as often as not, richly emotional, contemporary and quite dark.In recent monologues, Mr. Keillor has lambasted the gun lobby, told of people\u2019s relatives being buried alive and mentioned a would-be suicidal woman left bald after she accidentally set her hair on fire in her gas oven, a presumably fictitious anecdote that is trademark Keillor: equal parts alarming, heartbreaking and funny.\u201cLike Howard Stern, Garrison Keillor created a packaging that nonlisteners took as real,\u201d Mr. Glass said. \u201cAnd the actual show is so much more complex, and human and complicated than nonlisteners think it is.\u201dMr. Keillor has had health concerns, suffering a stroke in 2009, and, less than a week after the Minneapolis show, a seizure. But he insists it\u2019s his other projects that compelled him to step away. After July, he will continue to have a small radio foothold, hosting \u201cThe Writer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d a stand-alone five-minute radio program he started in the early \u201990s. And \u201cPrairie Home\u201d reruns will continue to air. Jon McTaggart, chief executive of American Public Media Group, the parent of American Public Media, said that as much as \u201cPrairie Home\u201d contributed financially, he has faith in the allure of the new version of the show and that \u201cthis transition has been planned for a while.\u201dStill, the future of \u201cPrairie Home Companion,\u201d and public radio, without Mr. Keillor remains somewhat of an open question.Mr. Keillor\u2019s handpicked successor, the folk musician Chris Thile, 35, who first performed on the show as a teenager, cheerfully admitted in an interview that it could all go down the drain if audiences reject him after he begins hosting on Oct. 15. Details are still being hammered out, but Mr. Thile plans to do musical numbers and comedy bits. There will be no Lake Wobegon.\u201cPublic radio always wondered what it was going to do when Garrison leaves,\u201d Mr. Nuzum said. \u201cIt\u2019s about to find out.\u201dStripped of the sentimental trappings of the show, which he writes almost entirely by himself, Mr. Keillor\u2019s words leap off the page and bite. In an excoriating book review in The New York Times, he called Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy \u201ca French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore.\u201d Thrice wed \u2014 he and his third wife, Jenny Lind Nilsson, a violinist, have a daughter, Maia, who just graduated from high school \u2014 he once described marriage as \u201cthe deathbed of romance.\u201dThroughout his career, Mr. Keillor penned columns, stories and books. He wrote regularly for The New Yorker, where he had a desk, until Tina Brown\u2019s arrival as editor in 1992. \u201cThe day I heard that she would replace Bob Gottlieb, I packed up my stuff in a couple cardboard boxes and left in a cab and have not looked back,\u201d he said in an email. But it was radio, his Plan B, that came to define his life.Born in 1942 in Anoka, Minn., Mr. Keillor grew up the third of six children. His family was Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist Christian sect that forbade dancing and going to the movies. But Mr. Keillor\u2019s youngest sister, Linda Keillor Berg, said theirs was a happy home, where family members routinely gathered to sing hymns.\u201cBecoming a star of any kind wasn\u2019t an ambition our parents seeded in any of us,\u201d Ms. Keillor Berg said, but Mr. Keillor could not be contained. In junior high, rather than signing poems with his given name, Gary, he began using the more regal sounding Garrison. It stuck. He went on to write for the local paper, majored in English at the University of Minnesota, and in 1969 took a job at a radio station as a classical music announcer.There, he began breaking from convention, interspersing Mozart overtures with songs by the Beach Boys and Grateful Dead. One morning, he aired a live predawn show featuring a cowboy singer and a performer who made wine glasses sing. He later asked his boss, Bill Kling, who founded Minnesota Public Radio and also started American Public Media, to weigh in. \u201cI said I thought it was awful, that it was one of the worst ways to wake up I had ever remembered,\u201d Mr. Kling said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, you know, it\u2019s a beginning.\u2019\u201dMr. Keillor\u2019s big break came when his short, slyly racy short story about local parents hiring a live-in prostitute for their teenage son fell into the hands of Mr. Angell at The New Yorker. \u201cI thought it was brilliant,\u201d Mr. Angell said. \u201cThe nearest thing to E. B. White that had come along.\u201dIt was Mr. Keillor\u2019s wildest dream come true. But it also made him miserable.\u201cWriting for the magazine put me in thrall to their reputation, to their style, to having fathers who were more talented than yourself,\u201d said Mr. Keillor who, at that time, was supporting his first wife and their son, Jason. He recalled sitting frozen at his typewriter in his bedroom in Minnesota, wondering, \u201cHow do you measure up to the gods?\u201dIn 1974, The New Yorker gave him what would turn out to be a pivotal assignment, covering the Grand Ole Opry\u2019s final show at the Ryman Auditorium before its move to Opryland. Mr. Keillor was struck by the musicians\u2019 rapport, by Minnie Pearl\u2019s wry humor. He soon called Mr. Kling, telling him this was the kind of show they had to do back home.Scant months later, the first \u201cPrairie Home Companion\u201d was performed live in St. Paul before an audience of 12. Mr. Keillor\u2019s New Yorker colleagues were astonished, wondering how this painfully shy man could possibly host a radio show, let alone divert his energies from a burgeoning literary career. But Mr. Keillor adored the socializing, the camaraderie and the musicians\u2019 gregariousness and generosity.\u201cWith radio, I owned it. I owned it. Nobody else was doing this,\u201d Mr. Keillor said. \u201cYou find yourself on new ground, and you are so free. You are so free.\u201dOnstage, a new side of Mr. Keillor shone; looser, less aloof, at times even jolly. Margaret Moos Pick, Mr. Keillor\u2019s early producer and former longtime girlfriend, said his Lake Wobegon monologues put him into something like a state of hypnosis. In them, he could lose himself.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s necessarily a happy man,\u201d Mr. Angell said, \u201cBut the time he is happy is when he is doing his monologue.\u201dAs audiences embraced the show, more stations picked it up, and it began broadcasting nationally in 1980. Mr. Singer, a friend from The New Yorker, said the show appealed to baby boomers and felt like a counterweight to the Reagan era, when images of American life suddenly felt scripted and controlled. \u201cIt was an antidote to all that,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cThere was just a deeply wonderful feeling that this was speaking to many of us.\u201dCuriously, Mr. Keillor has always found it difficult spending so much time with the strong, good-looking, above average people of Lake Wobegon, which he based on his relatives, past and present.In \u201cThe Keillor Reader\u201d (2014), he complained bitterly about \u201ctheir industriousness, their infernal humility, their schoolmarmish sincerity, their earnest interest in you, their clich\u00e9s falling like clockwork \u2014 it can be tiring to be around.\u201dSpeaking on his porch, Mr. Keillor said of Lake Wobegonians, i.e., his relatives, \u201cI am frustrated by them in real life.\u201d They were too controlled by good manners, he said, and \u201chave a very hard time breaking through.\u201dSo why devote so much of his professional life ruminating about them? \u201cIt\u2019s the people I think I know,\u201d he replied.Will he miss them, and the weekly jolt of the show?\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cNo.\u201dAnd yet. It was gloriously warm and sunny in Minneapolis for his last show there. In the State Theater, the audience \u2014 nearly all white and middle-aged or older, the very Midwesterners Mr. Keillor has such a fraught yet close connection with \u2014 packed the auditorium.After his show drew to a close, Mr. Keillor stayed onstage and began leading the audience in song, keeping them singing and swaying for perhaps half an hour.Then he stepped offstage and swept through the wings, heading toward the lobby, where he would greet his people like a preacher. He stood for photographs with fans for nearly two hours.As he passed by backstage, striding purposefully, he glanced at me, registered no recognition, and continued on, muttering, \u201cbomp, bomp, bomp, bomp.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Says \u2018Special Relationship\u2019 With Britain Will Endure", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 President Obama on Friday sought to assure Britain and the European Union that the United States would not pick sides once the two are divorced. But he acknowledged, somewhat ruefully, that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the union, which he had publicly opposed, spoke \u201cto the ongoing changes and challenges raised by globalization.\u201d\u201cThe world has shrunk,\u201d he told the entrepreneurs, adding that they embodied this trend. \u201cIt promises to bring extraordinary benefits, but it also has challenges, and it also evokes concerns and fears.\u201dRather than dwell on the wrenching change to come, Mr. Obama emphasized continuity. \u201cOne thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will endure.\u201d And, he added, \u201cThe E.U. will remain one of our Indispensable partners.\u201dThe president said he had spoken with Prime Minister David Cameron, who told him Britain\u2019s departure would be orderly, and with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who will loom even larger as a partner for the United States in a European club that no longer has a Britain as a member.But Mr. Obama\u2019s soothing words did not disguise how personal a setback the vote was for him. In April, while visiting Mr. Cameron in London and celebrating the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, he implored Britons not to vote in favor of leaving. Britain, he warned, risked going \u201cto the back of the queue\u201d in negotiating trade deals with the United States.The \u201cBrexit\u201d vote runs counter to Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of open, interconnected societies, and it illustrates the frustrating cycle of his engagement with the world: \u201cAmerica\u2019s first Pacific president,\u201d as Mr. Obama has called himself, who tried to pull the United States out of the Middle East, now finds himself, near the end of his presidency, confronting a crisis in Europe fueled in part by the refugees attempting to flee the Middle East.As a practical matter, the terms of the divorce vote will consume Britain and Europe for at least two years, making both less valuable as trading partners and less reliable as allies in dealing with a dangerous world. It will also deal a blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious European trade deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which was already losing momentum on both sides because of growing anti-trade sentiment.\u201cFrom the start of the administration, we\u2019ve wanted to work with them on all the big global challenges,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, a former assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the interest of the U.S. to work with the E.U. on Iran sanctions, on Russia sanctions, and on military interventions in the Middle East, then it\u2019s a major setback.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.At the same time, Mr. Obama has had an ambivalent relationship with Europe during his presidency. His heavy emphasis on Asia \u2014 a policy dubbed the pivot \u2014 stoked suspicions in Europe that he was moving away from the continent to the faster-growing markets of the East. In his first term, the centerpiece of his Europe policy was an effort to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia.Critics said the tendency to take Europe for granted predated Mr. Obama. \u201cSince 2000, both the Bush and Obama administrations have acted as if Europe as a task had been solved and that we no longer needed to \u2018tend the garden\u2019 as George P. Shultz used to say,\u201d said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany, referring to Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cThe Europeans played their part by acting as if they didn\u2019t need us.\u201dEven after Mr. Obama worked closely with Europeans on difficult issues like the NATO air campaign in Libya, there was a sense that he looked on the trans-Atlantic alliance with a gimlet eye. In April, he struck a nerve by suggesting that Britain and France had been \u201cfree riders\u201d in that operation, leaving the United States to bear most of the military burden.Some critics suggest Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctance to be more militarily involved in Syria had an indirect effect on the British vote because of the flood of refugees the civil war has sent to Europe, destabilizing the continent and firing up nativist sentiment. Syrian refugees, however, account for far less of Britain\u2019s immigrant population than they do in Germany, for example.Mr. Obama has a chance to demonstrate his support for Europe at a NATO summit in Warsaw next month. But there again, the loss of Britain as a member of the European Union will be felt. Britain has historically been one of NATO\u2019s strongest boosters. It has resisted initiatives like a joint European military headquarters because it could compete with NATO. European officials said Germany and France might revive the proposal as a way to reinforce Europe\u2019s unity in the wake of the British vote.Britain\u2019s decision to leave Europe just as Mr. Obama was putting on an extravagant celebration of entrepreneurship and engagement in Silicon Valley undercut his message that innovation, open borders and free trade can improve people\u2019s lives. It is the same assertion that has also underpinned his efforts to forge a new dynamic in the Middle East.In his Cairo speech in 2009 promising a \u201cnew beginning\u201d in the Middle East, Mr. Obama first proposed to host entrepreneurship summits to explore ways to strengthen relationships between the United States and the Muslim world. The annual conferences proceeded as he envisioned, but the broader strategy has not been as simple to implement.Mr. Obama acknowledged that much of the upheaval gripping American voters \u2014 an angst that is propelling the campaign of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2014 is driven by fear of technology-driven globalization and anger at job losses prompted by automation. Mr. Trump has exploited such fears, Mr. Obama told National Public Radio in December, calling them \u201cjustified, but just misdirected.\u201dOn Friday, even as he held a Google-sponsored virtual conference with entrepreneurs in Britain, Iraq, South Korea and Mexico, the president conceded that interconnectivity still makes many people uncomfortable.\u201cWe are better off in a world in which we are trading, and networking, and communicating and sharing ideas,\u201d Mr. Obama said before a panel discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, on Friday.\u201cBut that also means that cultures are colliding,\u201d he added, \u201cand sometimes it\u2019s disruptive, and people get worried.\u201dMark Landler contributed reporting from WashingtonAdvertisement"}

With little explanation, Lanc\u00f4me canceled the show on Sunday.The singer, Denise Ho, said the reason was clear: Lanc\u00f4me, the French cosmetics company owned by L\u2019Or\u00e9al, wanted to avoid upsetting the government of China, one of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s largest markets.Many multinationals and global industries tread carefully in China, wary of risking the ire of the government and losing access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after that of the United States.The controversy for Lanc\u00f4me centers on an important market for the parent company.Fu King-wa, an associate professor at the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong, said the episode involving Ms. Ho would be a lesson in the need to better understand local culture and to formulate better communications strategies.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, maybe some miscommunication between headquarters and local branch,\u201d Dr. Fu said.\u201cInternational brands, if they want to do business in China, that always has certain kinds of risk,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you choose to stay in this market, either you pay attention to all these kinds of politically sensitive issues, or you just follow Google\u201d and leave the market.Polina Huard, a spokeswoman for the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group in Paris, said the company had no comment beyond a statement distributed on social media. Listerine, a brand that Ms. Ho also promotes, said on Tuesday that the company was still working with her.The first sign of trouble for Lanc\u00f4me came on Saturday, when The Global Times, a Chinese state-supported publication, posted on the microblog site Weibo that Lanc\u00f4me and Listerine had hired \u201cHong Kong Poison, Tibet Poison\u201d for publicity events. \u201cPoison\u201d and \u201cIndependence\u201d sound similar in Chinese.The Global Times asked its more than four million followers to comment, and thousands did. \u201cMaking Chinese people\u2019s money, and hiring this kind of person as a spokesperson? Let\u2019s boycott them, shall we?\u201d one user wrote.\u201cThe two brands probably don\u2019t want to do business in China anymore,\u201d another wrote.The largest pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong have called a protest on Wednesday at a busy Lanc\u00f4me retail location to condemn the brand for what they said amounted to \u201ckowtowing to money.\u201d The groups are calling for people in Hong Kong to boycott all brands under L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\u201cWhat is most ironic is that L\u2019Or\u00e9al is an international brand from France, known for its history of democracy and freedom movements against totalitarianism,\u201d the parties said in a joint statement on Tuesday.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ask Well: Why Do Mosquito Bites Itch?", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Reader Question \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 502 votesMosquitoes have been much in the news lately because their bites can spread nasty diseases like the Zika virus, but regardless of whether mosquitoes are carrying a dangerous pathogen, their bites can be exasperating for a simple reason: They itch.When a mosquito bites, it pierces your skin and draws blood with the tip of its strawlike mouth, or proboscis. In the process, the mosquito injects some of its own saliva, which contains an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting around the proboscis and trapping the insect. (Only female mosquitoes, which need the nutrients from blood to produce eggs, bite.)Your immune system recognizes the proteins in the mosquito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saliva as a foreign substance and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmounts an immediate attack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d releasing histamine as part of the immune response, said Jonathan Day, a professor of medical entomology at the University of Florida in Vero Beach.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the histamine reaction that causes the itching,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like the reaction when you get pollen in your eyes, and it causes local itching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The histamine also causes your blood vessels to enlarge, creating the wheal, or swollen bump, around the bite.But not everyone reacts to mosquitoes with an itchy wheal. Some adults have no reaction and may not even notice they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been bitten.And over time, many people develop a tolerance to bites from mosquitoes, Dr. Day said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost adults are used to the mosquitoes around their home and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t react as strongly as they did when they were kids,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if they travel and encounter new species, they will get that severe reaction they had as a kid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The Aedes aegypti mosquito \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan bite people without being noticed because it approaches from behind and bites on the ankles and elbows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Benjamin Haynes, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although active mainly during the day, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit can bite at night in well-lit areas\u00e2\u0080\u009d and prefers \u00e2\u0080\u009cto bite indoors, and primarily bite humans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.A small number of people will become increasingly sensitive to mosquito bites as they get older, and rare cases of dangerous allergic reactions have been reported.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

The last she remembers of Mr. Mateen is that he grabbed her arm to stop her from getting into the car and leaving him forever.\u201cHe tried to reach in his back pocket, I don\u2019t know if he had a gun with him, but my mother felt that and she screamed out,\u201d Ms. Yusufiy said at an interview at the home where she lives with her fianc\u00e9, here in the steep green hillsides above Boulder. \u201cThat was the last time I saw him.\u201d\u201cI had let that chapter of my life go a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s somebody that hurt me and traumatized me.\u201dShe spent part of Sunday being interviewed by F.B.I. agents, who were inside the home for about an hour. Although officials said they had investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 and 2014, Ms. Yusufiy said that Sunday was the first time she had been approached by law enforcement officials to talk about him.She answered phone calls from her mother and watched as her online photographs and social-media profiles were scattered across the internet. As she sat to speak of her memories of Mr. Mateen, she lightly touched a tree-of-life necklace her brother had given her and held a bracelet from her mother that she wears for protection.Ms. Yusufiy said she had immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2000, following her father, who had come a year earlier. She grew up in northern New Jersey and met Mr. Mateen around the time her parents started to talk to her about marrying.\u201cI had already started getting hints from my family \u2014 Oh, it\u2019s time for you to get married, we want to set you up with somebody,\u201d she said. She said she figured if she was to marry young, she would do it on her own terms: \u201cI wanted to find somebody that I could relate to, and find him for myself.\u201dShe said Mr. Mateen seemed nice at first. He joked around, had a decent job, aspired to become a police officer and respected his family, she said. He was an American but had roots in their shared culture, she said. After a few dates, she said their parents met to make formal marriage plans.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any knowledge or feeling of his instability,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents actually did not feel good about it. But I guess I was in a stage of really wanting to make my own decisions and be independent. So I decided to go on with it anyway, and go to Florida and marry him.\u201dAfter about six weeks, she said she began to notice erratic behavior and a temper that would flare, sometimes without warning or provocation. She said he became verbally and physically abusive. He forbade her to call her parents, and he allowed her only to go to her job as a day care teacher. He made her hand over her paycheck.\u201cHe was totally two different people sometimes, and would turn and abuse me, out of nowhere, when I was sleeping,\u201d Ms. Yusufiy said.She said that Mr. Mateen was religious, but that he had never expressed sympathies for terrorist organizations or radical Islamists. But he did make anti-gay comments when he was angry, she said.\u201cThere were definitely moments when he\u2019d express his intolerance toward homosexuals,\u201d she said.He kept a silver handgun in the house, and he went target shooting with friends. Ms. Yusufiy said that some of his friends were in law enforcement, and that he sometimes went shooting with them. He never threatened her with the gun, but its presence worried her.In 2009, Ms. Yusufiy said her parents began to sense the depth of the trouble and flew to Florida to intervene. After her parents extricated her from the marriage, they flew back to New Jersey.\u201cI\u2019m blessed to have the family that I do because they saved me from death,\u201d she said.Ms. Yusufiy said she had last heard from Mr. Mateen when he sent her a Facebook message about a year ago, casually trying to reconnect. She said she told him never to contact her again and blocked him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Shareholder Vote Produces Odd Results", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsFacebook shareholders sent a curious message about the social network\u2019s governance this week. More than half of Facebook owners not named Mark Zuckerberg clicked the corporate equivalent of a \u201cLike\u201d button for just three of the company\u2019s directors.Weirdly, shareholders seemed to prefer the venture capitalist Peter Thiel over top executives like Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and Mr. Zuckerberg himself. It is a brainteaser that suggests institutional investors are more inclined to tick boxes than follow their heads.First, some background: In the weeks before Monday\u2019s annual meeting, it was revealed that Mr. Thiel had bankrolled Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker, the gossip website founded by Nick Denton. The wrester, whose real name is Terry Bollea, sued Gawker for posting a sex video that involved him. A Florida jury awarded Mr. Bollea $140 million, and Gawker has since filed for bankruptcy.Mr. Thiel\u2019s personal vendetta against Gawker, which previously revealed that he is gay, raised important questions about his First Amendment bona fides. That matters because Facebook is diving headlong into the publishing business, where constitutional protections on free speech are critical. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Facebook is paying more than $50 million to media organizations, including The New York Times, to produce videos for its live-streaming feed.So it\u2019s odd that Mr. Thiel, along with Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, received 70 percent approval from investors, after stripping out Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s 59 percent control over Facebook\u2019s shareholders, according to a Breakingviews analysis. The only other director to receive a majority of non-Zuckerberg votes was Erskine Bowles, who was deputy chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, at 51 percent.Adjusting for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s share, Ms. Sandberg and the founder of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, did not muster a majority of minority shareholders\u2019 approval, nor did their boss. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen received the least support among Facebook directors, with just 45 percent of those voting sanctioning his re-election to the board.It is impossible to know why shareholders voted this way. Big investment funds like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard own 5 percent or more of Facebook apiece. Their votes are often determined by algorithms that take into account the recommendations of proxy advisory firms, which are themselves forged by qualitative factors like the independence of a director and time served on other boards. It shows that even the most disciplined of processes can produce oddball results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remote? That\u2019s No Way to Describe This Work", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byPreoccupationsBack in 2007, during a weekly check-in, my wife\u2019s manager delivered some unexpected good news: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in the office to do this job,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could work from wherever you want.\u201d A fast six months later, we left hot, crowded Austin, Tex., and moved into an apartment on Munjoy Hill in Portland, Me., with a commanding view of Casco Bay only steps away.My wife managed a geographically dispersed web services team, and I worked as a researcher at a think tank in Washington. The separate rooms where we worked seemed like extensions of offices elsewhere, not places in our house. I had to laugh when I overheard our new downstairs neighbors refer to us as trust funders because they never saw us leave the house to go to work.We did not know many people and accepted any invitation we received, which is how we ended up at a barbecue, given for a candidate for governor, in a suburban backyard. That was when I fully realized that I belonged to a nascent class of worker that no one knew much about.The candidate raising campaign funds was a hard-working lawyer who seemed genuinely well meaning, but no one had told him that his economic platform of protecting manufacturing jobs and Maine\u2019s traditional industries wasn\u2019t going to fly with an audience of health care professionals, programmers, web designers and researchers. With plates of potato salad in our hands, we muttered to each other that this guy didn\u2019t have a place in his platform for people like us, many of whom worked for employers in other states. Our checkbooks stayed in our pockets.But first, what to call these workers? We were dissatisfied with the choices currently available.One term given to people who work at home is \u201cremote worker.\u201d Early on, my wife wondered why such a headquarters-centric label was being used, given that her company had multiple offices in different states and employees who lived in a variety of locations.\u201cTelecommuter,\u201d another frequent label, has such a dial-up-era feel. With people now communicating not only by email but also via Skype, Slack and other channels, it hardly encompasses the capabilities that workers now have in the home.Another term is \u201cvirtual work,\u201d as if the work is somehow less tangible than what people do in traditional offices. But the work that we do is just as exhilarating and boring as any other sort of work.So why use adjectives suggesting that employees are less available, less capable or less real \u2014 in fact, just plain lesser? Yes, my wife and I work differently from someone who commutes to a headquarters, but we make just as much of a contribution.It was at the first face-to-face meeting my wife and I had with Creative Portland representatives (we had been communicating by Facebook) that a new label came to me: We \u201cwork in place.\u201dThis phrase builds off other well-known phrases, like \u201cshelter in place\u201d or \u201caging in place,\u201d which everybody understands as \u201cdoing whatever you\u2019re doing, where you are.\u201d It\u2019s worker-centric, not office-centric. Less literally, it refers to work undertaken according to where you are in your life: caring for aging parents, raising a young family, supporting a partner, healing after an illness. In all the circumstances, the work is work. You don\u2019t have to qualify it. It doesn\u2019t diminish the work or the person doing it.As an example of the changes that are needed, consider a 2013 economic productivity report for Maine. The report is based on calculations that don\u2019t include workers whose employers are based in other states. Say that I want to persuade my state legislators (or candidates for governor) that the state should shift its economic development policy from recruiting companies through tax incentives (which often end up as a net loss for the state) to recruiting households like mine. We bring talent and income; we pay taxes; we want to contribute to our communities. Yet there\u2019s little data to make the argument that we have a sizable economic impact worth encouraging.My wife and I still work out of our home in South Portland; I\u2019m a writer and she\u2019s a digital strategist for a software company. A time will come when our children \u2014 a kindergartner and a new baby \u2014 will ask us for career advice. We hope to be able to say something optimistic and realistic: \u201cYou can be whatever you want, and you can work wherever you want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan in His Labyrinth", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a large labyrinth. As he drifts from room to room \u2014 and there are about 1,000 of them in his new Ankara palace \u2014 Erdogan no doubt has time to reflect on Turkey\u2019s travails and perhaps ponder how events can escape the control of even the most megalomaniacal ruler.Here\u2019s a sobering thought: Erdogan, the would-be leader of the Sunni world, after 13 years in power, alone in his vast palace with his neo-Ottoman dream in shreds and Turkish society polarized to the point of violence.Most of the victims then were Kurds. Mystery still surrounds the bombing.For Erdogan, the word \u201cterrorist\u201d chiefly denotes the Kurdish militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has fought an intermittent insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s.In Turkey\u2019s southeast, many towns are under curfew. Erdogan is waging a relentless campaign against the Kurds in the shadow of the Syrian war. Kurdish territorial inroads and self-government in northern Syria have awoken the darkest specter in the Turkish psyche: a border-straddling Kurdistan.ISIS, by comparison, has been an object of ambivalence. Erdogan has played a double game.For a long time he allowed ISIS recruits to move across Turkey and over the border to the Islamic State\u2019s Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. Given a choice between the terrorists of the Islamic State in northern Syria and what, for him, are the Syrian-Kurdish terrorists of the P.K.K.-affiliated Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D (and its associated militia, the Y.P.G.), the Turkish president has no doubt who is more menacing.ISIS has had anti-Kurdish uses for Erdogan. By contrast, the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, known as Rojava, is only trouble from a Turkish perspective. That the Y.P.G. has, in effect, been America\u2019s most effective ground force against ISIS complicates Erdogan\u2019s position. Turkey is a NATO ally opposed to America\u2019s anti-ISIS Syrian-Kurdish alliance.Welcome to the Middle East. I hope everything is clear in this Kurdish alphabet soup (I have not even mentioned Turkey\u2019s Kurdish-dominated Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., out of deference to you, dear reader.) If all is fog, please at least retain the following:Erdogan has found himself in a terrible neighborhood, his country destabilized by more than five years of war in Syria and the millions of refugees pouring across the border. He has been frustrated, with reason, by President Obama\u2019s unwillingness to back with a coherent policy his statement in 2011 that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must \u201cstep aside.\u201d But, in the end, Turkey\u2019s descent into violence is of Erdogan\u2019s own creation.Prickly and erratic, he has perceived enemies everywhere \u2014 in the press (whose freedom he has stifled), among former business allies, in the secular Turkey that resists his increasingly unbridled attempts to advance an Islamist agenda. Turning his back on years of attempted reconciliation with the Kurds, he has adopted an uncompromising brutality. Seeing his power threatened, he was prepared to countenance violence to instill an atmosphere of fear in the run up to last year\u2019s November election, so that he could emerge as strongman-savior.Borrowing from Vladimir Putin\u2019s playbook, Erdogan has gone through the alternating-office routine \u2014 in his case, prime minister to president \u2014 in order to render the Constitution pliant to his appetite for power. Forsaking diplomacy for braggadocio, he has gotten into fights with Israel, with Egypt, with Russia, to the point that Turkey\u2019s economy was reeling and he found himself obliged to apologize to Russia and settle differences with Israel in recent days.Above all, Erdogan has contrived to turn Turkey \u2014 the poster child of moderate democratic Islam not so many years ago \u2014 into a divided and combustible country where the Erdogan personality cult grows daily at the expense of freedom. It was typical of the Erdogan order that access to Twitter and Facebook was cut off for hours in the aftermath of the airport attack.In doing all this, Erdogan knew that he has the United States and Europe where he wants them. For strategic reasons (military for America; refugees for Europe), they need Erdogan more than he needs them. So he does what he wants \u2014 with dire consequences.Funny how the \u201czero problems\u201d foreign policy of early \u201cneo-Ottomanism\u201d morphed into a very problematic reality: Erdogan has reaped the bitter harvest of his machinations.I grieve for the victims of the terrorist attack at Ataturk airport. It was in many ways a bloodbath foretold.Advertisement"}

(In medical school, he had been a member of the Bard Hall Players.)Ms. Thomas, who was then doing community theater in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, became even more interested when she uncovered their mutual love for Shakespeare, especially \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d\u201cI thought he was cool,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so in my literary, artsy world. I\u2019d never met a scientist before. He was deeply involved in community theater.\u201dThe next day, he friended her on Facebook. ( \u201cI was well aware of her grandfather\u2019s canon,\u201d said Dr. Tattersall, who had been in a high school production of \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d)\u201cI thought I was getting a vibe,\u201d she said of her bold move in asking him out. His response, in which he told her that she was \u201cswell\u201d but that he had a girlfriend, was not the one she was looking for.Although she said she was a little crushed and embarrassed by his comeback, they found themselves hanging out that summer. By fall, he was available again, and asked her out on a real date.\u201cIt was just us hanging out, but circumstances were different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not in a hurry to jump into a relationship.\u201dIt soon became clear, though, that they wanted to spend more time with each other, and by January they were directing \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d together for the Bard Hall Players.\u201cIt was great to have her around because she had pretty much memorized the play,\u201d he said. \u201cI was struck by how well we were going through it together.\u201dAfter she moved in with him in 2013, he inspired Ms. Thomas, who had dropped out of the University of Southern California in 2008, to go back to college. And this spring, in a moment of near-perfect synchronicity, the couple, who became engaged last year, both had graduation ceremonies.\u201cHe\u2019s graduating, I\u2019m graduating,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat better way to celebrate the occasion than with a wedding.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Order of Business for E.U. in Brussels? Weeds, Then \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byWhile Berlin, Europe\u2019s de facto capital, has hosted crisis meetings in recent days to discuss how to respond to Britain\u2019s vote, Brussels, the putative capital of Europe, has stuck doggedly to its own stately rhythms. On Friday and Monday, it plowed ahead with arcane debates about weeds, fish, organic farming and other subjects that have come to form the substance of the so-called European project.This scrutiny of technical minutiae has turned the European Union into a regulatory superpower, allowing it to help set norms and standards used around the world. But that tight focus has crippled its ability to grapple with big issues or to engage with many ordinary people. As the British vote showed, many people feel no connection with what began as an idealistic peace project after World War II, but is now widely viewed as a meddling and undemocratic bureaucratic machine.One thing many in Brussels now agree on is that something has to change in the way the European Union works. But deciding what that is, exactly, will not happen swiftly, Frans Timmermans, the Dutch first vice president of the bloc\u2019s executive body, the European Commission, cautioned Monday in a post on Facebook.\u201cThe Brexit vote is not an isolated incident and is not just about Europe,\u201d Mr. Timmermans wrote. \u201cIt is also about a broad sentiment in Western societies that we have lost control of our destinies.\u201dBut the leaders will do so only after sticking to the original agenda focused on migration, investment and other matters. The all-important discussion will be squeezed into a dinner attended by Mr. Cameron and other leaders on Tuesday. The British leader will then be excluded from the second day of the summit meeting when leaders of the 27 remaining countries will begin assessing the future direction of the bloc without Britain.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.Founded on the premise that countries, including former enemies, can and must work in harmony, the European Union, with its elaborate machinery of consensus-driven decision making, instinctively recoils from any public airing of the bloc\u2019s anxieties and deep divisions.Like nearly all Britons in Brussels, Mr. Adamson said he was stunned and angered by the victory for opponents of the European Union. \u201cWe are all in shock and trying to come with terms with what happened,\u201d he said.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Confronted with the biggest crisis to hit Europe\u2019s six-decade push for greater integration, the European Commission has sought to present a face of implacable calm, despite anguish over Brexit among its officials.Asked on Monday at a news briefing what conclusions the commission might draw from the British vote, its chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said that this was a matter for Britain. \u201cThe commission didn\u2019t call the referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who did are the ones who have to draw conclusions.\u201dBehind the scenes, most Britons working in the commission and other European institutions in Brussels are in a state of barely disguised despair.Catherine Bearder, a British member of the European Parliament for the Liberal Democrats, said she felt \u201cgutted\u201d on Monday.\u201cI think there is a feeling across the board of, \u2018What on earth is Britain doing?\u2019 \u201d she said.Waiting until October to start negotiating on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit and its future relationship with the bloc might give time for Britain to perhaps change its mind. But this would also slow any efforts to reshape a union that even the most stalwart fans of European integration acknowledge is far from perfect.Those who support the idea of turning Europe into a federal state are even hoping that the crisis set off by the British vote will invigorate their sagging cause, a prospect that is unlikely to fly.British opponents of the bloc campaigned on the idea that the constant meddling of unelected officials in Brussels was holding their country down and destroying its way of life. By banning weed killers, in one example.In reality, officials in the European Commission have been pushing for months to extend an approval, first granted in 2002 and now set to expire on Friday, for the use in Europe of popular weed killers, like Roundup.But they had problems getting member states to agree in the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feeds. Delays by France, Germany and other governments meant that the issue, like many others in the European Union, continued to be kicked down the road.\u201cThe idea that we wanted a ban was just one of the false myths spread by British tabloids,\u201d said Enricio Brivio, a spokesman for the European Commission\u2019s department that deals with health and food safety. \u201cWhat could we do? I do not know.\u201dMr. Agnew, the UKIP member of the European Parliament, acknowledged that the officials \u201chad actually tried to do the right thing.\u201d He nonetheless derided their fruitless efforts as a symptom of the \u201cE.U.\u2019s shambolic decision making.\u201dAs debates on weed killer and other matters continue in Brussels, the European Commission is trying to avoid a breakdown of its bureaucratic system in the event that the hundreds of British citizens working in the organization suddenly decide to leave. It has assured them that their jobs are safe despite their country\u2019s vote to withdraw.Some lower officials are hanging tight for the moment, saying they did not come to Brussels just to work for Britain. It remains to be seen, many cautioned, whether Brussels gets the message that there needs to be fundamental reform of the European project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "In his earliest memories, Zhang Wei recalls his mother singing and dancing in a theatrical troupe, performing operatic versions of Chinese folk tales. Like magic, she transformed from one character into another as Mr. Zhang watched from the wings.As the Cultural Revolution ended and China opened to the West, however, the troupe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performances changed, adding outside influences and modern references to attract new audiences. The characters in those dramas struck him as absurd \u00e2\u0080\u0094 neither \u00e2\u0080\u009creally Chinese nor really Western.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRapid economic growth, urbanization and sporadic political liberalization over the following decades, Mr. Zhang said, changed the country to such an extent that the Chinese people faced an existential challenge. Their identity seemed to be always in transition, he explained, shifting as rapidly as his mother did from one role to another.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomeone who used to be dirt poor can suddenly become a millionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cThen next day be put into prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Zhang set out in 2007 to capture the \u201c21st century mind-set\u201d of the average Chinese person and photographed hundreds of people in simple, direct portraits. He abandoned the project two years later after being unable to depict the ephemeral nature of life amid dizzying change.He had come to realize that in the modern world, people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense of identity is formed by mass media and advertising. Self-worth is measured against that of entertainers, leaders and heroes promoted by a consumer-driven society. In an effort to show how these external influences affect self-definition, he took elements of his earlier portraits of everyday Chinese people and combined them using Photoshop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps a touch of alchemy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to create virtual portraits of the personalities that, Mr. Zhang said, for better or worse, shaped today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese mind-set.Among them are Marilyn Monroe, Steve Jobs, Bruce Lee, John Lennon, Vladimir Lenin and the singularly named trinity of Elvis, Madonna and Mao.Influenced by the Japanese computer game Artificial Girl 3, Mr. Zhang painstakingly combined an ear from one model, a wisp of mustache from another and a dimple from a third, often taking weeks at his computer to complete a single portrait. Thus the famous and the unknown \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecome a part of each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.At first glance the composite portraits seem real. But a double take reveals something slightly askew. He could create more precise images of his rich and famous subjects, but chose to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmake them more absurd\u00e2\u0080\u009d by exaggerating a few characteristics.Mr. Zhang calls his project \u00e2\u0080\u009cArtificial Theater\u00e2\u0080\u009d because he sees his countrymen taking on a series of roles and discarding them as Chinese society changes. Indeed, everyone is like an actor, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause to survive in this world sometimes you have to perform or act. Or even to be a hypocrite.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe celebrities in his portraits are all easily recognizable to his Chinese audience. But the images do not celebrate fame. Instead, they deconstruct the cult of celebrity. Mr. Zhang knows from his childhood that heroes come and go, depending on fashion and politics, and can even become villains. His famous subjects are not, he emphasized, necessarily his own heroes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not trying to make any value judgments from an ideological point of view,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are really heroes worth looking up to, only history can tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

A vast empire put itself out of existence and turned out the lights.There is no better place to ponder all that cannot possibly happen until it does.There is no better juncture, either.

{"Headline": "Put a Ring on It? Why It Doesn't Matter", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Advertisement\nHere are some comments, edited for clarity, from our readers showing how personal the decision is to wear a ring, whether male or female.I am in a gym for 1-2 hours a day typically and have eczema on my hands. Between safety considerations and the constant need to moisturize, I rarely wear my wedding band. I am entirely committed to my marriage. My husband has a ring that has raised edges that irritate his neighboring fingers even to the point of creating lumps. We often go ringless. That said, my father never wore his band and was an adulterer. I think the point is that it really can be a simple matter of personal preference with no greater implications to the state of one\u2019s marriage.My personal experience with wearing wedding rings was this: when I wore mine, I got significantly less attention and flirtation from men. When my ex-husband wore his, he got significantly MORE attention and flirtation from women. Make of that what one will \u2014 it was noticeable, and also rather funny.I don\u2019t think you can call men wearing wedding rings a \u201ctradition\u201d since it didn\u2019t become common until fairly recently. I think it\u2019s more of a fad that\u2019s winding down.It\u2019s only a symbol and doesn\u2019t mean a marriage is happy or not (that\u2019s like saying a bigger engagement ring equals more love). My parents have been married for 47 years and I don\u2019t remember my dad wearing one. My husband does physical work and wearing a ring carries some risk of injury if the ring got caught or his hand smashed, etc. When we married in 2014, I told him I had no problem with him not wearing his ring for work \u2014 or ever, if he didn\u2019t want to. However, despite the potential risks, my husband wears his ring all the time and I actually think it\u2019s kind of sweet.While what this article says may be true from the rich and shameless, there are lots of people who work with their hands and around equipment that don\u2019t wear a ring for safety reasons. Medical personnel for sanitary reasons may choose not to wear a ring. People that work around heavy equipment, fast moving machinery, or that grab things can get the ring snagged and then have their fingers yanked off or broken. Don\u2019t judge people until you know the whole story.I lost mine 4 years ago. Neither of us care. A ring doesn\u2019t make you faithful. The ONLY time I wish I had a wedding band is when I\u2019m judged as being a single dad out with my kids.Rings mean nothing. The person who is married is the one who decides fidelity.This is really a personal choice thing. The ring, a lump of metal on an arbitrary appendage, isn\u2019t the partnership itself. Its presence doesn\u2019t define us, and its absence doesn\u2019t unmake us. Jewelry, or the lack thereof, is no substitute for good communication.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "The houses of Marktown were not exactly what Alyssa Schukar expected to find when she moved to Chicago and started looking for a community project. In an industrial corner of East Chicago, Ind., she came across a tiny, nearly century-old community of narrow streets with gable-roofed homes whose windows faced gardens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looked like a seaside village in England,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schukar recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe architecture was strange and felt like it was not meant to be there. It has a very recognizable look, and a lot of tourists drive through and take pictures because it is such an odd scene.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen it was built in 1917 as a planned community for workers at a nearby steel pipe factory, it was considered exemplary. Years later, its unique character landed it on the National Register of Historic Places. But Ms. Schukar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment that it looks out of place has taken on added significance, and not just because some homes look rundown. Already ringed by industry, its residents face the prospect of the tiny town shrinking even further as BP, which has a refinery that abuts the community, has been buying and demolishing homes in order to create a green buffer around its facility.Community can be a stubborn thing, especially in places that have been hit by urban blight where the bonds among people are sturdier than any brick and mortar. People who live in the four blocks that make up Marktown spend time outside, they know each other and help each other. In some ways they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all they got: There is no school, doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office or supermarket.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though they feel abandoned by the city of East Chicago, they take care of each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schukar said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the most striking things I heard was when a community member said that with each building torn down, she feels a little more vulnerable. Marktown is this green bubble in the midst of this industry, and they have each other and their safety because of that. With every home torn down they feel a little more exposed to the world outside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schukar moved to Chicago two years ago from Omaha, where she had been a newspaper photographer. She had always been partial to documenting communities, spending time on long-term stories. So when she arrived in Chicago to start freelancing, she also was on the lookout for a long-term project. She soon found it when she read a newspaper article about Marktown and how some residents were resisting any offers to sell their homes.She knew enough not to go in and just start shooting. Residents, she learned, had had enough with curious tourists and photographers who would drop by, make a few pictures and disappear. She wanted to make clear to them she was in for the long haul, something she helped convey after befriending Kim Rodriguez, a lifelong resident and unofficial mayor of the community. Ms. Schukar got a tour, made some pictures, then returned and gave people copies of the images.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an easy place to take pictures because the buildings are rundown and it feels like a throwback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schukar said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if I go there, have a conversation and know how people relate, then I can understand the life of the community, not just the individual I am photographing. I feel I am a better photographer for it and also a better journalist and can understand what the community is like and what issues they are facing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhat she discovered was a place that was among the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first planned communities and now was reeling from the effects of time, misfortune and shrinkage, planned or otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was originally built as a self-sustaining community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Schukar said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey had grocery stores, restaurants and a community center. As the population dwindled, all of those resources have left. They are isolated from any convenience now. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a whole lot of public transportation. The only business there now is a bar, which largely serves the steel mills and refinery\u00e2\u0080\u009d Despite that, Ms. Schukar said, residents like Ms. Rodriguez  help neighbors help one another. And although being surrounded by industry may seem scary, she said the residents who had stayed didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to worry about any risks.Ms. Rodriguez does not want to leave, and she has enlisted her neighbors to stay put and demand better services from the city. Nor do they wish to see BP demolish any more homes, although one preservationist told a local newspaper that the company is not barred from tearing down homes it has purchased.Brett Clanton, a spokesman for BP, said the company was not trying to \u00e2\u0080\u009cforce or coerce homeowners\u00e2\u0080\u009d to leave the area.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor many years the BP Whiting refinery has purchased properties around the perimeter of the plant in an effort to create additional green space and buffer around the refinery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clanton said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are working with homeowners and landowners who choose to sell and we pay fair market value for their properties \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of which have been vacant for several years.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the time she has spent there, Ms. Schukar has made a point to put the residents in the spotlight, collaborating with the Inside Out project by the French artist JR, making 20 large posters of residents that were pasted on houses and fences.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople appreciated that because it showed it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just the houses people cared about,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people who lived there were being recognized, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

For hours each day, he trained on the sidewalks of his native Santiago, in the Dominican Republic. Martial arts instilled in Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a a sense of conviction, he said, enabling him to ward off his tormentors and earn some titles.He continued practicing through adolescence, but when his father died, he largely set karate aside. At a loss for what to do next, Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a moved to New York.In the city he found a job at a health insurance company and started a family. Karate became a savored indulgence, squeezed in between work and child rearing. That changed when a friend asked Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a to oversee an after-school karate program at a church in Bushwick.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw these Hispanic kids all bruised up from practicing on the marble floor and it broke my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted something better, just like I once did.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWithin months, the number of children studying with Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a expanded to about 80 from 10, so he moved the program to a more comfortable space on DeKalb Avenue. There, he developed a reputation as a neighborhood mentor, doling out wisdom along with foot sweeps and roundhouse blocks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKarate is about discipline and focus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese kids have to know self-defense for their own security and confidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe dojo became a refuge for local children and a godsend for their working parents, many of whom could not afford child care. Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a provided free robes and tried to keep prices down, sometimes entirely waiving fees for families unable to make the $70 monthly payment.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy kids used to waste hours after school playing video games because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them outside alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laura Jimenez, a cashier who has been bringing her children, Yoskar and Natalie, to Kanku-Dai for two years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned so much about listening and respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen the dojo caught fire, Ms. Jimenez and her children watched on the news in tears. They hardly understood the extent of the destruction: Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a had no fire insurance, and inside the dojo was expensive training equipment along with $7,000 in cash, all incinerated.Before the flames even subsided, discussions in the community had begun about how to help. Green Fitness Studio, on nearby Varet Street, offered the group space for about six weeks, while Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a scoured the area for vacancies. He found one on Central Avenue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a 2,500-square-foot property that allowed for expanded class sizes. The rental deposit nearly wiped out his savings, Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a said, but he paid it with the help of an online fund-raising campaign.Most of the equipment came from donations: mats from a dojo in Yonkers; d\u00c3\u00a9cor from a sensei in Weehawken, N.J.; punching bags from a local supplier; American and Japanese flags from a printing company. Students and their parents gave the walls a fresh coat of paint. In May, Kanku-Dai was open for business once again.On a recent afternoon, the dojo was teeming with young martial artists preparing for a belt test. In the closest thing to unison that schoolchildren can muster, the class of 30 mirrored Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gestures, calling out each move in Japanese.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore the dojo, lots of these kids were running around after school with no guidance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Xiomara Contreras, watching her son, Emilio, 5. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHommy gives them a role model.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBefore he started attending classes, Emilio was shy and lacked confidence, Ms. Contreras said, but that seems to have changed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Emilio said, glancing at Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be a black belt.\u00e2\u0080\u009dRelated:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Billy Ray Cyrus, Like Miley, Knows About Reinvention", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported bySurrounded by images of music icons, Billy Ray Cyrus, the actor and country singer, saw a bit of himself in David Bowie.\u201cI\u2019m sending this to Miley,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said, referring to his pop star daughter, while reaching for the garment.Even beyond appearances, it\u2019s possible to see why both of them admire Mr. Bowie, that relentless pop chameleon. Mr. Cyrus, though never quite respected for his music or hairstyle, has managed to stretch his down-home charisma, distinctive look and willingness to engage with the kitschy and the lowbrow into a constantly regenerating career of nearly 25 years.Along the way, there were detours to tabloid purgatory, borderline irrelevance and \u201cSharknado 2.\u201d And yet even after going Hollywood, Mr. Cyrus has enough juice in the country-music universe to carry an acerbic, self-mocking original series, \u201cStill the King,\u201d which premieres Sunday, June 12, on CMT.\u201cI told Miley about it,\u201d he added, \u201cand she said, \u2018Dad, that\u2019s exactly what you need.\u2019\u201d\u201cStill the King,\u201d a single-camera comedy with a gritty Southern feel, finds Mr. Cyrus, a co-creator of the show, playing an exaggerated take on the worst version of himself: \u201cBurnin\u2019 Vernon,\u201d a louche one-hit wonder scamming his way into a job as a preacher and into the life of the teenage daughter he didn\u2019t know he had.Jayson Dinsmore, the executive vice president of development for CMT, said the show represents a new push for the network into premium scripted programming. He compared Mr. Cyrus\u2019s role in \u201cStill the King\u201d to that of Larry David in the art-imitating-life comedy \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d \u2014 but with a star who\u2019s \u201cundeniably charming.\u201d\u201cSometimes we forget how successful Billy Ray has been,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who has multigenerational fans.\u201d Also, Mr. Dinsmore added, Mr. Cyrus is \u201cincredibly good looking \u2014 women flock to him,\u201d a boon for a network whose viewers lean female.Mr. Cyrus, a Kentucky native and politician\u2019s son, whose own glad-handing puts him somewhere between George W. Bush and Joe Biden in manner, said that, \u201cI kind of traded my musical soul to be an actor.\u201dDespite never truly being welcomed into the country establishment, \u201cI\u2019m a singer-songwriter first and foremost\u201d and not technically a one-hit wonder, he said.\u201cSome Gave All\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cyrus\u2019s first album \u2014 \u201chad four hit singles on it,\u201d he insisted, adding a few expletives for emphasis. \u201cHere\u2019s the damn truth: I\u2019ve had more hits than any one-hit wonder in the world. I don\u2019t mean that as bragging because I wish that my name wasn\u2019t even in that conversation. But if you look on Wikipedia, it\u2019ll say that.\u201dDespite his early musical success, Mr. Cyrus saw the writing on the Nashville wall when his third album in three years failed to match the first two. \u201cI said, uh-oh, they\u2019re coming after me,\u201d Mr. Cyrus recalled. \u201cThe teeter has gone to totter \u2014 I\u2019m on the way down.\u201d He cited his message-driven songwriting, including an emphasis on the environment. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing they want to hear from me,\u201d he said.Thus began one of the stranger recent sagas in American celebrity bootstrapping as Mr. Cyrus willed his family (six Cyrus children in all) \u2014 and especially the daughter born Destiny Hope Cyrus \u2014 into becoming a household name.Following in the footsteps of diversified country stars like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton \u2014 and more recently, rappers like LL Cool J and Ice Cube \u2014 Mr. Cyrus aimed for longevity onscreen, first in an appropriately bizarre meeting with an auteurist director.\u201cI had two stolen chickens in my agent\u2019s car while I did the interview with David Lynch,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said, having rescued the baby birds with Miley and her brother before they could become snake food at a petting zoo in Malibu.After he cameoed as the philandering pool guy in \u201cMulholland Drive,\u201d Mr. Cyrus was cast as the lead \u2014 a Christian physician \u2014 in \u201cDoc,\u201d which ran from 2001 to 2004 on Pax TV. Ms. Cyrus guest-starred on the show and by 2006 had debuted as the meta-pop star Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel, with Mr. Cyrus appearing as her father, Robby Ray.\u201cWhen you work as much in the business as we do, there\u2019s gonna be peaks and valleys,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said. \u201cFame is a dangerous thing, but when you volunteer for it, you have to accept that it ain\u2019t all roses.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s a lady singing about it right now,\u201d he added, motioning to the speakers playing \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d with Janis Joplin.For her part, Ms. Cyrus relishes a low-key relationship with her father these days. The pair prefers hanging at home, playing music together (she bought him a Tibetan singing bowl for his birthday) \u2014 \u201cno TV on, just us talking, not on our phones or out to dinner for show,\u201d she told this reporter last year. \u201cI feel lucky that I\u2019m his kid. When I sit with my dad, there\u2019s a million things I could say that he could\u2019ve done differently \u2014 as you could with any parent \u2014 but he\u2019s the best dad I could\u2019ve ever chosen.\u201dThough he stresses his outsider status, Mr. Cyrus, who favors distressed jeans, big sunglasses and western boots, also enjoys his insider connections. At the John Varvatos store on the Bowery, a staffer referred to Mr. Cyrus as a \u201cfriend of the brand,\u201d gifting him an American flag scarf and leather jacket.Further downtown, while perusing the Morrison gallery\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll photos, he told persuasive big-fish stories, as if holding court on a barstool, of intimate interactions with the likes of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, George Jones and even Kurt Cobain.\u201cI wrote a poem about Kurt the day he died called \u2018The Circus,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cyrus said. It was about life under the spotlight. \u201cThat\u2019s when I said to myself, I need to step back from this because I don\u2019t want to die.\u201dMr. Cyrus eased his hard living \u2014 his only real indulgence since the mid-90s is marijuana, he said, but \u201cjust about enough to keep me from drinking\u201d \u2014 though his ambition hasn\u2019t slowed.In addition to his 14th studio album, \u201cThin Line,\u201d due for release in September, he has been writing an environmental horror film about \u201cfracking and all the damage it\u2019s doing \u2014 but with blood and guts,\u201d he said.But good-natured as ever, he shrugged off any suggestion that his continued relevance is due only to his headline-making daughter. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Mr. Cyrus said, aviator glasses shining on a New York street. \u201cI was here first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance.When Apple\u2019s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\u201cIs Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cTheir app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.\u201dAs the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Big outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services.Fanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them \u2014 \u201clike a street artist, but in an app,\u201d as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review.Apple\u2019s initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify\u2019s method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple\u2019s requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut.Ms. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place.\u201cIt ruined our whole launch,\u201d she said.Apple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created.Getting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple\u2019s system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque.\u201cIt used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,\u201d said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. \u201cNow it feels more like a lottery ticket.\u201dWhen an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous.Apple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. \u201cWe got a banner right on top of the App Store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 100,000 downloads in two weeks.\u201d When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple.The new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple\u2019s editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer.Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. \u201cSearch will be table stakes,\u201d he said.While overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry.The company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists.Apple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. \u201cIt signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cA lot of developers were asking and hoping for this.\u201dDevelopers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way.\u201cYou can\u2019t fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,\u201d Mr. Ryu said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "War Wounds That Time Alone Can\u2019t Heal", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "In a clip from \"Almost Sunrise,\" Katinka Hooyer, a medical anthropologist and postdoctoral research fellow in Family and Community Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, talks about the meaning of love and feeling moral pain.Jane Brody on health and aging.No doubt in the course of your life, you did something, or failed to do something, that left you feeling guilty or ashamed. What if that something was in such violation of your moral compass that you felt unable to forgive yourself, undeserving of happiness, perhaps even unfit to live?That is the fate of an untold number of servicemen and women who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and other wars. Many participated in, witnessed or were unable to help in the face of atrocities, from failing to aid an injured person to killing a child, by accident or in self-defense.For some veterans, this leaves emotional wounds that time refuses to heal. It radically changes them and how they deal with the world. It has a name: moral injury. Unlike a better known casualty of war, post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, moral injury is not yet a recognized psychiatric diagnosis, although the harm it inflicts is as bad if not worse.Therapists both within and outside the Department of Veterans Affairs increasingly recognize moral injury as the reason so many returning vets are self-destructive and are not helped, or only partly helped, by established treatments for PTSD.Moral injury has some of the symptoms of PTSD, especially anger, depression, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia and self-medication with drugs or alcohol. And it may benefit from some of the same treatments. But moral injury has an added burden of guilt, grief, shame, regret, sorrow and alienation that requires a very different approach to reach the core of a sufferer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s psyche.Unlike the soldiers who were drafted to serve in Vietnam, the members of the armed forces today chose to enlist. Those deployed to Iraq thought at first they were fighting to bring democracy to the country, then were told later it was to win hearts and minds. But to many of those in battle, the real effect was \u00e2\u0080\u009cto terrorize people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as one veteran says in the film. Another said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what we signed up for.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThat war can be morally compromising is not a new idea and has been true in every war. But the therapeutic community is only now becoming aware of the dimensions of moral injury and how it can be treated.Father Thomas Keating, a founding member of Contemplative Outreach, says in the film, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAntidepressants don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach the depth of what these men are feeling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that they did something terribly wrong and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if they can be forgiven.The first challenge, though, is to get emotionally damaged veterans to acknowledge their hidden agony and seek professional help instead of trying to suppress it, often by engaging in self-destructive behaviors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of vets won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seek help because what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haunting them are not heroic acts, or they were betrayed, or they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live with themselves because they made a mistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brett Litz, a mental health specialist with the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a leading expert on moral injury.The second challenge is to win their trust, to reassure them that they will not be judged and are deserving of forgiveness.Along the way, the two men raise awareness of the unrelenting pain of moral injury many vets face and encourage them to seek treatment. Mr. Voss and Mr. Anderson were helped by a number of counselors and treatments, including a Native American spiritual healer and a meditative technique called power breathing. They also found communing with nature to be restorative, enabling them to again recognize beauty in the world.Shira Maguen, a research psychologist and clinician at the San Francisco V.A. Medical Center, who studies and treats vets suffering from moral injury, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a big focus on self-forgiveness. We have them write a letter to the person they killed or to a younger version of themselves. We focus on making amends, planning for their future and moving forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d especially important since many think they have no future.Dr. Maguen, who studied how killing during combat affects suicidal ideation in returning vets, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose who had killed were at much higher risk of suicide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even when controlling for factors like PTSD, depression and alcohol and drug abuse. She said in an interview that decades after the Vietnam War, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere was still an impact on veterans who killed enemy combatants, and an even stronger effect on those who killed women and children.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo overcome veterans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reluctance to seek help for moral injury, Dr. Maguen incorporates mental health care into routine clinical visits.In Boston, Dr. Litz and colleagues are testing a therapeutic approach called adaptive disclosure, a technique akin to confession. With eyes closed, the vets are asked to verbally share vivid details of their trauma with an imagined compassionate person who loves them, then imagine how that person would respond. The therapist guides the conversation along a path toward healing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisclosing, sharing, confessing is fundamental to repair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Litz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn doing so, the vets learn that what happened to them can be tolerated, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not rejected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They are also encouraged to \u00e2\u0080\u009cengage in the world in a way that is repairing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, by helping children or writing letters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The goal is to find forgiveness within themselves or from others.One fact that all agree on: The process is a lengthy one. As Mr. Voss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew after the walk I still had a long road of healing ahead of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, however, he has some useful tools and he shares them freely.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "No Venture Capital Needed, or Wanted", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byThe business world is filled with starry-eyed entrepreneurs who hope that the blessings of angel investors and venture capitalists will transform their start-up dreams into companies with billion-dollar valuations.But some successful start-ups have been bucking the trend by growing and expanding without taking a dime from major outside equity investors.Ron Rudzin, an entrepreneur from Queens with a long history in the furniture business, took $350,000 of his own money to write a business plan in 2007 to form his online mattress company, Saatva.\u201cPeople who raise money, rather than be self-funded, tend to spend wildly because it\u2019s other people\u2019s money and they throw a bunch of stuff on the wall and see what sticks. I don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d Mr. Rudzin said. \u201cI\u2019m much more meticulous and efficient. I might go a little slower, but in the end I believe I win.\u201dAt age 16, he took a job at Jennifer Furniture, a fledgling company that later became a national chain selling convertible sofas and furniture. He spent more than 20 years working his way from sales representative to store manager and to vice president of national sales. He held equity interests in four of its stores as the company expanded into a national chain.After he left Jennifer Furniture, he invested in various enterprises, but he had always had his eye on starting his own e-commerce company. \u201cI felt the world was going in that direction,\u201d he said.Mr. Rudzin\u2019s vision was to sell American-made, high quality, coil-based mattresses online at a fraction of the price retailers charged for store-based brands. He added service to the equation by having them hand-delivered and set up in customers\u2019 home. It worked. \u201cWe were the first ones out there,\u201d he said.The company said that sales, which totaled $2 million in its first full year in 2011, surged to $76 million in 2015. Mr. Rudzin is projecting sales of $180 million this year and at least $275 million in 2018.Saatva has added two other lines of mattresses, foam and latex, and offers three firmness levels. The company had gained enough visibility to be asked to donate a mattress for Pope Francis during his visit to a Philadelphia seminary in 2015.Those who buck the odds by \u201cbootstrapping\u201d their own enterprises are rare, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge anomaly,\u201d said Mark Walsh, head of innovation and investment at the Small Business Administration. He estimated that as few as one in 50 brick-and-mortar companies and one in 10 online companies could build their businesses into $50 million or $100 million enterprises on their own.But taking venture capital can be risky. In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.\u201cWe don\u2019t need it,\u201d said Harrison Tang, a founder of Spokeo. But Mr. Tang, 34, did not always feel that way. When he created Spokeo with three college buddies from Stanford University in 2006, he tried to get equity financing, but was turned down by more than six angel and venture capital investors. Even his father, an entrepreneur himself, told his son he never expected to get the money he lent him back.\u201cThat\u2019s how much confidence people had in us,\u201d Mr. Tang said, laughing. But he \u2014 and his three other founders \u2014 Ray Chen, Mike Daly, and Eric Liang \u2014 pressed on by borrowing $300,000 from parents and other family members.Initially, Spokeo was a free program that aggregated information about people from social network sites, like Facebook and Friendster.When the founders ran short of cash in 2008, they revamped the site, turning it into a people search program that gathers data based on names, phone numbers and email addresses, and started charging a subscription fee. The company said that its revenue surged to $78.5 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2011. Mr. Tang expects revenue to easily exceed $100 million by 2018.Mr. Tang said he was proud that all four founders remain with the company, which might not have been the case if equity investors had been involved. \u201cWe have been winning,\u201d he said.So, he wrote a business plan around importing such beef from Uruguay, New Zealand and Australia for his M.B.A. thesis at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business in 2005.Though very popular now, organic food was a concept met with much skepticism at the time.\u201cMy professor hated it, and my classmates thought it was a terrible idea,\u201d he said. Even his parents wondered why a man with degrees from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Management and Technology program and an M.B.A. from Dartmouth would want to start a meat company.\u201cPeople thought that it was only tree-huggers who were into organic, and tree-huggers were vegetarians, not meat eaters,\u201d he said.In 2006, Mr. Ehrlich tried to find angel investors, but refused to accept the terms. \u201cThey wanted between 10 percent and 20 percent equity for a six-month loan,\u201d he said.So he used $100,000 from savings and student loans to secure debt financing. It was a tough slog in those early years, and Mr. Ehrlich nearly decided to shut down in 2008. But everything changed in early 2009, when he signed on two national retailers, Wegmans and Costco.The company, which is based in Woburn, Mass., said it sold 10.1 million pounds of grass-fed beef in 2015, up from 240,000 pounds in 2008. Sales, which totaled $665,000 in 2008, surged to $7 million in 2009 and more than $50 million in 2015.Equity investors are now coming to him, and he\u2019s the one turning them down.Verde \u2014 like Saatva and Spokeo \u2014 does not rule out taking venture capital money in the future. But these founders say it would be for strategic rather than financial reasons to bring on venture capital expertise.\u201cMost V.C.s are former entrepreneurs themselves,\u201d said Ben Veghte, a vice president at the National Venture Capital Association. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been in the trenches and understand what it takes to build something from nothing and to build a successful company.\u201dAnd for businesses with plans to go public, the guidance of a venture capitalist may be needed.Mr. Walsh of the Small Business Administration said it was rare that a company went public without at least some outside equity holders.\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing a company going public on the Nasdaq in the last 20 years who arrived at the I.P.O. with only management owning the company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a rite of passage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Views From the Inside, an Activist Challenges Vietnam\u2019s Rulers", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileMr. Quang A went ahead anyway, choosing his best suit and a fresh shirt. He uploaded a photo of himself in his smart attire to Facebook. Then he stepped outside onto a narrow street in the Vietnamese capital.\u201cI went out at 6:22 a.m. At 6:25 I was arrested,\u201d he said. A phalanx of security men shoved him into a car and slammed the doors. Mr. Quang A was isolated inside with two plainclothes police officers and a driver. The windows were tinted dark, and the license plate was covered. It was, Mr. Quang A said later, a \u201cmoving prison.\u201dThey drove for the next seven hours, first to Hung Yen, a city of historic temples east of the capital, and then back to his home, just as President Obama\u2019s plane was lifting off for the next stop.Mr. Quang A, 69, a computer scientist, a former businessman and, for a decade since his retirement, a full-time critic of the Communist government, takes the long view on how to open up Vietnam\u2019s repressive political system. American human rights activists criticized Mr. Obama for agreeing to sell Vietnam lethal weapons without winning any concessions, particularly the release of political prisoners. But Mr. Quang A said he believed the president did the right thing.\u201cIf you transform human beings into a commodity for barter, I oppose it,\u201d Mr. Quang A said. He made that argument when he met the assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor, Tom Malinowski, just before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival. (He arrived late to the meeting with Mr. Malinowski because the police threw a cordon around his house for several hours beforehand.)Mr. Quang A said it was like negotiating with hostage takers. \u201cYou create incentives for the Vietnamese authorities to arrest more and more to create access for future barter.\u201dMr. Quang A is not the classic outsider. He was a member of the Communist Party, though never an official, and left the party 23 years ago.\u201cAmong our members about 60 percent were party members,\u201d he said. \u201cThey still have party connections and know a lot of people in the establishment. We use that information channel.\u201dHis latest approach to bring change is to mobilize popular outrage against huge fish kills in the sea off central Vietnam. The fish appear to have been killed by the untreated effluent from a new steel plant owned by a company in Taiwan. \u201cWe take the fish crisis as an opportunity,\u201d he said, chatting at a cafe near his house, and not far from a military post.Security forces have brutally put down protests against the plant, beating some protesters and hauling many into detention. On two consecutive Sundays last month, the police outside his house stopped him from showing up at the weekly protests.\u201cIf you have influence, they crack down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the authorities were smart, they would know that the protesters don\u2019t want to overthrow them, but want to negotiate to change the policies.\u201dThat turned out to be a big break. \u201cGeneral Giap helped me escape from the army,\u201d he said. He was assigned to a civilian job at an informatics branch of the government, but he stayed only briefly.It was the period of a slight opening in the economy, and Mr. Quang A started a joint venture selling Vietnamese-assembled computers to Russia. It was while dealing with the government as a businessman, he said, that he became disenchanted with the Communist Party and decided to try to undermine its power.As he assumed the role of activist, he first translated books by the Hungarian economist Janos Kornai and the Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, both critics of Communist rule.On relations with China, Mr. Quang A has some sympathy with the government. \u201cIt is in a very difficult position. I would not want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a good neighbor with China, but not a good friend.\u201dThe Saturday Profile article on June 4, about Nguyen Quang A, a longtime critic of the Communist government in Vietnam and one of several dissidents blocked from meeting President Obama during his recent trip there, referred incorrectly to Nguyen Huu Vinh, a friend of Mr. Quang A\u2019s who was jailed for five years for posting anti-state writings on the internet. Mr. Vinh is a former police officer, not the son of one. A reader alerted The Times to the error shortly after the article was published online, but editors failed to follow up with a correction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Man\u2019s Quest to Get Americans to Care About Rugby", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "FeatureIn the U.S., the sport has long been overshadowed by football. Now a former bond trader is working to bring it back to the mainstream.Supported byLast fall, he was thinking of his late father and the National Football League games they used to attend at the old Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. On cold days, they sat on copies of the Sunday paper and used phone books to keep their feet from freezing on the frigid concrete. They saw the same people every weekend in the stands. They felt they were part of the game in a way that was hard to put into words. All his life, Schoninger had been going to N.F.L. games \u2014 10 last year with his teenage son, Charlie. Charlie loved football, but to Schoninger it seemed that on the professional level, the ethos of the game, which evolved from rugby more than a century ago, had curdled. Materialism and profiteering had eaten away any nobility the N.F.L. game once possessed, leaving in its place a violent, vainglorious, $13-billion-a-year entertainment spectacle staged by helmeted mercenaries for the enrichment of grasping billionaires. Rugby was different, or seemed so, even in the nature of the game: Players vied for the ball in scrums, bulled it forward in mauls, booted it through goal posts or dashed with it across the try line in the course of 80 nearly continuous minutes of free-flowing improvisation, versus what unfolded in the three-plus hours it took to play a 60-minute N.F.L. game, where the actual amount of action averages only 10 minutes 43 seconds. In football, specialists did the same thing over and over; in rugby, you played offense and defense \u2014 anyone could score.One day in February, Schoninger confided to me that his secret ambition was to supplant the N.F.L. He was kidding. Or not. It was hard to tell.\u201cThe N.F.L. is on top right now, and rugby is at the bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things always look better at the top and worse at the bottom than they really are.\u201dPRO Rugby, his new league for a sport that in America has a fan base that would barely register as an N.F.L. rounding error, was just two months from kicking off its 30-game season in April, with clubs in Denver, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego and Obetz, Ohio. Opening day was marked D-Day on a wall calendar.\u201cWhat if nobody comes?\u201d I asked. Rugby-dream stress was showing on Schoninger\u2019s face in a way it hadn\u2019t when I asked the same heartless question in October.\u201cYou mean what happens if I don\u2019t sell a single ticket, or a single hot dog, or a single parking space? If nobody buys any PRO Rugby T-shirts or hats? If I don\u2019t get one sponsor? If nobody wants to broadcast a single game?\u201dHe shuddered.\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve become a rugby believer. If I fail, it\u2019s not the money I\u2019ve spent \u2014 well, it\u2019s the money I\u2019ve spent, but it\u2019s also that I was wrong. Wrong about the support from the rugby community. Wrong about the time being right. That\u2019s what would hurt. It\u2019s like opening a restaurant and then no one comes. That would hurt. But then, if this were easy, it would have been done already.\u201dThe first bona fide rugby in the United States was played in 1874, between Harvard and McGill University. Six years later, at Yale, the future T. rex of American sports was hatched when Walter Camp, the innovative coach and writer known as the father of American football, separated the rugby scrum into football\u2019s \u201cline of scrimmage.\u201d Both rugby and football were popular in American colleges and universities in the early 20th century, and at one point, alarmed by the prevalence of injuries, Stanford and Berkeley gave up football for rugby \u2014 a programming decision that was reversed after New Zealand\u2019s mighty All Blacks, on a tour in 1913, humiliated a squad of all-stars in California, 51-3.New Zealand and other top teams were not represented when the United States won Olympic rugby gold medals in Antwerp in 1920 and Paris in 1924. The 17-3 victory in Paris over a heavily favored French team by a United States squad made up mostly of California collegians was one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history. But the outraged reaction of some 40,000 French fans at the Stade Colombes jeopardized the very principle of the better and more peaceful world through sports on which the modern Olympics were based. David Wallechinsky recounts the scene in \u201cThe Complete Book of the Olympics\u201d: \u201cAfter two French players were injured, the U.S. team was booed and hissed the remainder of the game. Fighting broke out in the stands, and Gideon Nelson, an art teacher from Illinois\u201d \u2014 and a United States reserve player \u2014 \u201cwas knocked unconscious after being hit in the face with a walking stick.\u201d The Americans left the field under a police escort and a barrage of rocks and bottles.Rugby was dropped from subsequent Olympics. In America the game went into a long dormancy from which it did not emerge until the 1960s, when it began to catch on again with colleges and clubs. Ed Hagerty, whose life before rugby included a turn as an altar boy in Grace Kelly\u2019s wedding in 1956, discovered his passion for the game at Holy Cross in 1963. \u201cIt was kind of countercultural,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe wore discarded football jerseys.\u201d After graduation, Hagerty played for local clubs in New York and was working as the publisher of Popular Science when he quit to eke out a living as editor of Scrumdown, a rugby newspaper started in 1975 by Jon Prusmack. One of the first Scrumdown editorials summed up the state of the American game, suggesting that ruggers from New Zealand, Australia and Britain were to their American counterparts what Rudolf Nureyev was to Zorba the Greek.To close the talent gap, promote and govern the sport at all levels and establish a United States national team, the 115,000-member organization known today as USA Rugby was formed in 1976. This August, rugby is returning to the Olympics after a 92-year hiatus. The United States will defend its gold medal in Rio de Janeiro, playing a shorter, less complex form of the game that features seven players on a side instead of the traditional 15.Reflecting his faith and his cool appraisal of numbers, Schoninger spent a year at Emory University studying theology, then transferred to Tulane, from which he graduated in 1982 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He landed a $13,000-a-year job as a runner on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and later worked as a construction manager for Morse Diesel, the general contractor for the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. He returned to Wall Street in 2000 to trade stocks and bonds at Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer. Bearish by temperament, with a keen feel for risk, he eventually started his own shop, DJS Capital Management, managing a bond portfolio of several hundred million dollars for more than a dozen clients.In 2013 Schoninger bought an inactive company called Stadium Capital Financing Group that Morgan Stanley needed to unload to comply with new banking regulations. Trying to revive the business, he began shopping for undervalued second-tier sports teams (minor-league baseball, lacrosse, D-league basketball) whose revenues might be leveraged to raise capital for new stadiums. He wasn\u2019t having much luck when, in the autumn of 2014, he was introduced to Jason Moore, an Australian sports-marketing impresario who for years had been trying to raise up to $300 million to create an American rugby league drawing on the N.F.L.\u2019s gladiatorial-entertainment template. \u201cWe wanted to showcase rugby the way Americans consume sports, marketing it with American pizazz and style,\u201d Moore told me. He aimed to sell franchises, host games in midsize soccer venues and pay players upward of $100,000, but he had yet to secure the all-important \u201csanction\u201d from USA Rugby, without which it is difficult to hire referees, coaches or players or to get insurance.\u201cThere were 61,500 people at Soldier Field, the largest rugby crowd in American history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the moment things changed for me. I realized that if great teams wanted to play here, and you could fill Soldier Field, you could do well building a professional league.\u201dSchoninger met with USA Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Nigel Melville, a former scrum-half captain of the English national team, in fall 2014. Using USA Rugby\u2019s demographic and event data, Schoninger spent the winter doing due diligence. He drew up budgets for what he envisioned would be six league-owned franchises. He would start modestly, building around cities with vibrant rugby clubs and prominent teams among the hundreds of college and university rugby programs. Salaries ranging from $20,000 to $35,000 would be on a par with other second-tier professional sports vying for sunlight in the shadow of the N.F.L. Through Facebook, he could reach rugby fans with a precision never before possible. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have built a league on my budget without social media,\u201d he says.The expenses for each team \u2014 salaries, coaches, training facilities, venue costs, marketing, uniforms \u2014 would run to about $1.5 million per year. Schoninger didn\u2019t have, or want, partners, and would be financing everything himself the first year. Revenues \u2014 who knew? Could he get sponsors? Sell broadcast rights? How many people would buy tickets? When professional rugby began in England, the first Harlequins game, at Stoop stadium, drew around 1,400. Fans now routinely fill all 14,800 seats, and games at the national stadium in Twickenham attract capacity crowds of 82,000. A survey by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association found that there were 1.3 million rugby \u201cparticipants\u201d in the United States, some 431,000 of them hard-core devotees who played or watched the game more than eight times a year. (The N.F.L., for comparison\u2019s sake, estimates its fan base at 202 million.)In April 2015, the USA Rugby board, which had considered many proposals over the years, agreed to sanction Schoninger\u2019s plan. Schoninger intended to kick off exactly a year later \u2014 hoping to ride the public interest generated by the Rugby World Cup in the fall of 2015 and the return of rugby to the Olympics in Rio this summer. First, he needed a name and a logo. He couldn\u2019t use the word \u201cleague\u201d because \u201crugby league\u201d signified a much less popular version of the game that developed after the so-called Great Schism of 1895, when working-class players from northern England who wanted to be paid split off from teams adhering to the supposed purity of amateur competition. A branding firm in San Francisco proposed a number of logos and names. Some, like the National Rugby Association, or N.R.A., were red-carded for unwanted connotations. Logos that looked decent on a ball or jersey might look crummy on a trailer or a pitch. He finally settled on a red oval shaped like a rugby ball with the winning name in block letters: PRO, for Professional Rugby Organization. He added the word \u201cRugby\u201d below the acronym lest there be any confusion about what PRO actually stood for.Having never been the public face of an organization, Schoninger found himself in some novel situations. In December he sat down in the Pig \u2019N\u2019 Whistle bar in Manhattan with Matt McCarthy, a host of a webcast called Rugby Wrap Up. McCar\u00adthy reached across the table and palpated Schoninger\u2019s arm.\u201cDoug, I just want to make sure you\u2019re real \u2014 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m as real as you are,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201c\u2014 because you\u2019re like Sasquatch to most American rugby fans.\u201dThe league\u2019s initial website and its Facebook page went up in October, and Sasquatch had been living and dying on the number of \u201clikes.\u201d He was relieved that only one fussbudget had taken issue with the redundancy in the name PRO Rugby. He hired a director of operations, Stephen Lewis, a well-connected Scotsman who was named USA Rugby\u2019s 2014 coach of the year. Dominic DeFalco, a recent Penn State graduate who played rugby there, came aboard over the summer as assistant director. Just before Christmas, Schoninger organized a skills combine in San Diego to assess domestic prospects and shoot footage for video spots.There were setbacks. Schoninger couldn\u2019t find a venue for a team in New York, and his hopes were further hindered by the state\u2019s exorbitant workman\u2019s-compensation insurance rates. Philadelphia\u2019s rugby community was not as vigorous as he\u2019d hoped. Venues in the Boston area didn\u2019t pan out. By January it was clear that the first season would feature no teams on the East Coast. But Sacramento proved fertile ground. Having three teams in California meant that players could travel to some games by bus instead of plane, saving Schoninger $1,500 a game on transportation.When I stopped by the office in February, coaches had been hired, the schedule set, but Schoninger wasn\u2019t sure how many players \u2014 drawn mostly from the U.S., with a sprinkling of international stars \u2014 would sign contracts, and he hadn\u2019t found a national sponsor or settled on a broadcast deal.\u201cI was always the downside guy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take risks if you don\u2019t understand the downside. But here we are, two months away, and no one can tell me what our revenues are going to be.\u201dCardio training for Sacramento players. The league\u2019s inaugural season \u2014 five teams, 16 weeks, 30 games \u2014 began in April.Lewis, the director of operations, came in to say he\u2019d heard from the San Francisco coach, Paul Keeler, that no one liked the colors of the team\u2019s uniform.\u201cToo much gray,\u201d Lewis said.\u201cThe designer wanted gray \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be evocative of San Francisco fog,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cNo one likes it.\u201d\u201cWe can change it.\u201dDeFalco pulled up computer photos of all the proposed league uniforms \u2014 a palette of bold colors meant to evoke the geography of each team\u2019s city.\u201cAre we paying this guy to come up with these designs?\u201d said Lewis, who had already dubbed his boss the Mad Couturier because he insisted on putting a line across the jerseys to mark the upper limit of a legal tackle.\u201cWhat\u2019s our rule?\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cCriticism is only accepted with suggested solutions,\u201d DeFalco said.\u201cIn some ways, the reason you have a Season 1 is so you can fix things in Season 2,\u201d Schoninger said, sighing.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m running for court clerk in one of those elections where there\u2019s only one candidate,\u201d he said as he parked.When he finished explaining why viewers might want to witness the fruition of his rugby dream instead of, say, assess the structural features of Finnish lapphunds at the Sacramento Dog Show, also taking place that day, he headed to Bonney Field. The temperature was climbing to near-record levels. He was frazzled from weeks of cross-country travel and negotiations. The cable channel ONE World Sports would be broadcasting a third of the season. AOL was live-streaming the Sacramento game. Hawk-Eye Innovations, a sports-technology company, was producing the seven-camera video feed. Thanks to a payroll imbroglio, he\u2019d recently spent seven hours manually entering salary information for his 130 new players. Where was the credit-card machine Bank of America had promised? And why, oh why, had he scheduled opening-day games in two cities? The Ohio team\u2019s flight barely got in to Denver in the midst of a blizzard.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be like a snow day, and people will show up,\u201d he said.\u201cDouglas wakes up every morning, and the glass is half full,\u201d said his wife, Abigail Asher, a noted art consultant.When the gates of Bonney Field opened, early arrivals huddled in the shade of the press box. In the V.I.P. tent, waitresses were loading tables with dishes of salsa and colored tortilla chips.At 3:30 the players were announced \u2014 Sacramento in green and white; San Francisco in fog-free red and black. It\u2019s a risible misconception that rugby is populated by athletes inferior to high-level American footballers. The \u201cboys,\u201d as they are called by coaches, fans and even the players themselves, are built like a herd of genetically modified water buffalo and seem as inexhaustible as a class of A.D.H.D. preschoolers.For all the finesse and savvy the players need to succeed in a game that they, not the coaches on the sideline, control, rugby still has a brutal heart. Lest there be any doubt, an ambulance was parked behind the bleachers. But it\u2019s a paradox of the sport that helmetless rugby players may actually suffer fewer concussions than their cousins in the N.F.L. The concussion rate at last year\u2019s World Cup, according to USA Rugby, was 11 per 1,000 player-hours, compared with an estimated 54 per 1,000 player-hours last season in the N.F.L. (The N.F.L. calculates concussions per game, not per player-hour.) Credit below-the-shoulder tackling rules and self-preservation \u2014 not having a helmet lessens the temptation to deploy your head as a spear.At 4 o\u2019clock, Dan Power, a loquacious former rugby player with a gift for decoding the chaos on the pitch, leaned into his press-box mike and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the wait is finally over.\u201dPreseason odds had made the talent-laden San Francisco team the heavy favorite, and at first the game unfolded accordingly. It was all a bit bewildering to the untutored eye. The ball would vanish in a clot of bodies and then mysteriously reappear on the grass like a giant egg, and a scrum half would pluck it up and fling it underhand across the field in what might become a series of thrilling laterals that delivered it to a speedster on the wing who would hie down the sideline and fling himself across the try-line, jabbing the ball onto the ground for the proverbial \u201ctouch down.\u201d The heat began to afflict players on both sides with cramps, and occasionally some of the boys were leveled by head-on collisions that left them looking as if the next game they played might in fact be the game they played in heaven.When play resumed, San Francisco lock Nick Grass, evidently having missed the memo about fellowship and respect, was sent off with a yellow card after he appeared to gouge the eyes of Sacramento flanker Kyle Sumsion. \u201cA little bit of \u2018How\u2019s your father\u2019 going on out there,\u201d said the color commentator, Lou Stanfill, framing the fisticuffs in sports-talk fashion as an exchange of pleasantries. (Grass was later suspended for six games.) When San Francisco hooker Tom Coolican was yellow-carded, Sacramento used its two-man advantage to pull ahead. The crowd of just under 3,400 drummed their feet on the aluminum bleachers. The home team closed out the win, 37-25. The fans stood and clapped, and then the players from both teams lined up in front of the stands and applauded the crowd.For the moment, as the heat of a sun-baked afternoon ebbed, he lingered in the afterglow of the day\u2019s success, reviewing the debut with anyone who wanted to talk about it. He fell into conversations with the announcers as they packed up, and the coaches, and one of the stadium managers, who said 800 people had paid for parking. Even the Mad Couturier\u2019s jersey tackle line had gotten good reviews. He chatted with the players who were gathered under the V.I.P. tent swigging beer and carbo-loading plates of lasagna in preparation for their professional responsibilities next week. A few fans who recognized Schoninger waited patiently to thank him, and he fell into conversation with them too. It was getting dark. His wife and son were waiting to go back to the hotel, but he kept getting tangled in talk \u2014 in essence the same conversation he\u2019d been having day after day for the last year and a half, a rolling, jabbering maul of rugby rugby rugby. Sure, it was all in a day\u2019s work, but it was more than that. It was what needed to be done; it was part of what he\u2019d come to think of as his mission, spreading the gospel of the professional game, one convert at a time.\u201cThese,\u201d he said, still a bit amazed, \u201care my people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201dWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201dIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201dEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201dBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201dYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201dIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rafael Nadal Withdraws From Wimbledon", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byRafael Nadal announced Thursday that he would not play Wimbledon as he continues to recover from a left wrist injury, which also forced him to withdraw from the French Open.Nadal, ranked No. 4, is a two-time Wimbledon champion, but he has not advanced past the fourth round since losing the final in 2011. This year\u2019s tournament begins June 27.Nadal said the pain in his left wrist began at the Madrid tournament in early May and continued at the Rome event the next week. At the time, he treated it with anti-inflammatories. But the injury grew worse when he arrived in Paris.He played his second-round match after receiving a painkilling injection, and on May 27, the day he withdrew, he said he \u201ccould not move much the wrist.\u201dHe said his doctor told him he risked a tear if he continued playing.\u201cIf I continue to play, it will break, and that will mean months off the tour,\u201d Nadal said.Nadal\u2019s spokesman, Benito Perez-Barbadillo, said in a statement that Nadal\u2019s wrist would remain in a cast for two more weeks, and then he would begin anti-inflammatory treatments and physical therapy.The first major United States Open tuneup event on hardcourts is the Rogers Cup in Toronto in late July.

{"Headline": "Kerrey\u2019s Vietnam Dilemma", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 Lives can turn in an instant. For former Senator Bob Kerrey, that moment came on Feb. 25, 1969, when, as a young lieutenant in the Navy SEALs, he led his squad into the Vietnamese village of Thanh Phong. By the time they withdrew, 20 civilians had been slaughtered, including 13 children, according to survivors.\u201cIt haunted me from the moment we pulled out of the area,\u201d Kerrey told me in a telephone conversation. \u201cI knew we had done something wrong. I did not walk away saying that was great. It did not go away. But if you don\u2019t adjust you end your life, and we are talking, so I did not end my life.\u201dIn fact, Kerrey went to work to build a special relationship between the United States and Vietnam. He was an early advocate of the normalization through which many wounds have healed. Trade has flourished. The rapturous reception extended last month to President Obama \u2014 the warmest accorded by any nation during his presidency, as he confided to an American diplomat \u2014 was a measure of an almost miraculous reconciliation.One area in which Kerrey has worked hard is education, both as senator and later as president of the New School in New York. For many years he helped to raise money for a project Obama announced: the opening of the Fulbright University Vietnam, the first such private institution in the country. Financed in part by the U.S. Congress, the school will accept its first students next year. Kerrey has been named chairman of the board.Kerrey was awarded a Bronze Star after his unit falsely reported that it had killed 21 Vietcong guerrillas. For more than 30 years he kept silent until The New York Times and CBS News were about to publish a joint investigation in 2001.I asked Kerrey if all his efforts on behalf of Vietnam had a redemptive purpose. He said the episode and his work were \u201ca double helix,\u201d inseparable from each other. I asked him about his long silence. \u201cFor a soldier in a war,\u201d he said, \u201cto keep silent is not an anomaly but a rule.\u201d I asked him about the medal. \u201cI have never worn it,\u201d he said, \u201cand the anger would not end if I mailed it back to the Department of Defense.\u201dIt is human \u2014 in fact it is uniquely human \u2014 to seek redemption. The crime begets a reproachful whisper that will not be stilled. In every war I have covered, from Beirut to Bosnia, I have listened to men (always men) recount moments that left shame \u2014 the terrorizing of a child in a quest for intelligence, the abandonment of a son encircled by the enemy. More than one million innocent Vietnamese civilians were killed; Kerrey\u2019s story is one of many. We were not there in the heat, in the night, in that tension, with that responsibility. I listen to Kerrey and think: There but for the grace of God go I.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in redemption,\u201d Kerrey told me. \u201cDo good deeds undo a bad deed? I don\u2019t think that. You cannot change your past. You can only change the future.\u201dTo go through this pain again (\u201cPart of me wants to run away from it,\u201d he told me) is a gauge of Kerrey\u2019s commitment. It is brave. I understand Pham Thuy Huong of Hanoi, who wrote on Facebook, \u201cI cannot look at his face.\u201d I listen to Kerrey and think also of Bui Van Vat, a 65-year-old grandfather whose throat was slit, survivors said. The elevation of peace over grievance involves wrestling with impossible moral dilemmas. Acceptance that there is no wholly satisfactory answer is part of moving forward.Nguyen Ngoc Chu, a mathematician, suggested in a statement supporting Kerrey that there were valuable lessons in the discussion for the university\u2019s first students: that every judgment requires historical context; that successful people live for the future rather than in past hatreds.Certainly, this unusually vigorous and open debate is an example of what the university should embody in a country under one-party rule. As Ben Wilkinson, the executive director of the Trust for University Innovation in Vietnam, the nonprofit corporation behind the project, told me, \u201cThe university will be a major advance for organized civil society.\u201dKerrey should resist calls to quit. As no other, he embodies the agony of overcoming war\u2019s legacy. But he should send back that medal. He should push for the establishment of a Bui Van Vat fellowship in international humanitarian law. And he should ensure that somewhere on campus the words with which Muhammad Ali explained his conscience-driven refusal of the draft are engraved: \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing against them Vietcong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(The short answer: challenging and quite sad at times.)Surprisingly, most respondents agreed to participate in the Matteses\u2019 artwork and were paid a few dollars for their time. Then the artists animated the interviews \u2014 with software downloaded from the internet, of course \u2014 and looped cartoonlike footage of the participants\u2019 talking heads on monitors set into the underside of desks, so that London gallerygoers have to peer around the banal-looking office furniture to watch.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a black box, for obvious reasons,\u201d Mr. Szoka said. \u201cJust as with cybersecurity, you don\u2019t want to make too clear what\u2019s happening, so that people can\u2019t circumnavigate the system.\u201d\u201cIt had been shown in museums, so when it was removed, we were surprised,\u201d said Mr. Mattes, who wrote to the company to find out why it was removed. He said he received legalese in response.He added: \u201cIt was hard for me to imagine that the internet is more conservative than art museums. I grew up with the idea that art is old and boring, and the Net is fun and exciting, the wild, wild web, where anything can happen.\u201dThat got them thinking about the process. \u201cWe wondered, is there some software?\u201d Mr. Mattes recalled. \u201cAn algorithm that compiles all the red flags? Most people believe the removal is done that way.\u201dThe moderators in general don\u2019t know which company they are working for, said Mr. Mattes. And they see truly disturbing graphic images on a daily basis.\u201cThe worst video I ever saw, personally, was an individual killing and dissecting cats,\u201d one moderator says in the current show.He goes on to recall the video as \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d and says, \u201cThe cats were killed in a majority of ways: running them over, electrocution, beating, stabbing.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI personally am just not going to continue answering this.\u201dOne particular incident came up over and over. \u201cA lot of them mentioned being asked to remove images of Osama Bin Laden after he was killed,\u201d Ms. Mattes said, which she thought was somehow \u201cpolitically related\u201d and therefore troubling.The Carroll/Fletcher show also features the Matteses\u2019 2016 series, \u201cImage Search Results\u201d (the phrase is from Google\u2019s comprehensive image search). One work renders the internet as a spooky undersea landscape with each water level representing a more unknowable depth. They had the result printed on a beach towel.A more lighthearted series, \u201cBy Everyone for No One Every Day (BEFNOED)\u201d (2014), is a comment on the universe of content online that may never have any viewers at all. It asks the question, If a tree falls online, does it make a sound?For it, the Matteses hired people anonymously on crowdsourcing sites to perform what Ms. Mattes called \u201csimple, absurd acts.\u201d One man does handstand push-ups with \u201cEva and Franco Mattes\u201d written on his belly.In the gallery, the monitors displaying the bizarre acts are awkwardly installed, so that people must contort themselves to watch, even lying on the floor, \u201cforcing the viewer into being a performer,\u201d Mr. Mattes said.The installation is typical in its blend of confrontation and playfulness. In an email, Mr. Vickers of the Serpentine Galleries placed the artists on a direct line with the post-World War I Dada movement: \u201c\u2018The beginnings of Dada,\u2019 poet Tristan Tzara recalled, \u2018were not the beginnings of art, but of disgust.\u2019\u201dChristiane Paul, an adjunct curator of new media arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said: \u201cThey have a reputation of being pranksters, but there\u2019s no posturing about it. It\u2019s driven by a deep engagement with the issues.\u201dMs. Paul cited \u201cLife Sharing\u201d (2000\u201303) as a \u201clandmark project\u201d by the Matteses. For that work, they made many intimate aspects of their lives \u2014 right down to their bank statements \u2014 available online.\u201cThey anticipated what would happen with social media platforms,\u201d Ms. Paul said of the now common sharing of mundane activities on blogs, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Both Ms. Mattes and Mr. Mattes hail from the Italian province of Brescia \u2014 and it\u2019s worth noting that they declined to say which towns, in an attempt to preserve a sliver of privacy.They met in 1995 through mutual friends while traveling in Spain, and have been together, and making art as a team, ever since. They\u2019ve been based in Brooklyn for seven years.The \u201cDark Content\u201d works have a journalistic aspect, but Mr. Mattes said he was amazed that there was not more literature shining a light on the topic of content monitoring.He rejected the idea that the radical duo was going soft by looking at the moderators as human beings.\u201cA lot of our work has been confrontational, like the one of me hanging myself,\u201d Mr. Mattes said. \u201c But we are not looking to punch people in the face, either. Hopefully there\u2019s something we can we learn from their experiences.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I been shot!\u201d she cries out to her children in the next room, as blood soaks through the summer dress she wears as a nightgown.That same night, 15-year-old Veronica Lopez is hit as she rides in a Jeep that is speeding along a waterfront drive. \u201cBabe, they shot me in the stomach,\u201d the girl tells a friend, who later says he covered her body with his own as the gunfire continued.\u201cHelp, I\u2019ve been shot!\u201d another teenager screams as he limps down a darkened street, a bullet having torn through his leg.It is Friday night in Chicago, and the Memorial Day weekend is just getting started. Police Department officials plan to deploy more than a thousand extra officers to deal with the violence they fear will intensify with the unofficial start of summer.There is no stopping the gunfire, which comes in bursts and waves, interrupting holiday barbecues, igniting gang rivalries, engulfing neighborhoods, blocks, families.From Friday evening to the end of Monday, 64 people will have been shot in this city of 2.7 million, six of them fatally. In a population made up of nearly equal numbers of whites, blacks and Hispanics, 52 of the shooting victims are black, 11 Hispanic and one white.  Eight are women, the rest men. Some 12 people are shot in cars, 11 along city sidewalks, and at least four on home porches.It is a level of violence that has become the terrifying norm, particularly in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. With far fewer residents, Chicago has more homicides than  Los Angeles or New York.In an effort to capture what is happening on Chicago\u2019s streets, and why, The New York Times dispatched a team of reporters, photographers and videographers to virtually all of the shooting scenes across the city. Working around the clock through the three-day weekend, The Times interviewed relatives, witnesses, police officers and others, and captured how much violence has become a part of the city\u2019s fabric. The Times intends to follow the cases throughout the year.  This weekend, among the six killed are a father, Garvin Whitmore, who loved to travel but was scared of riding on roller coasters, and Mark Lindsey, whose outsize personality brought him his nickname, Lavish. The oldest person struck by a bullet is 57. The youngest person to die is Ms. Lopez, a high school student and former cheerleader.And so the logic of one Chicago mother, who watches another mother weep over her dead son in their South Side neighborhood, is this: She is glad her own son is in jail, because the alternative is unbearable.\u201cHe was bound to be shot this summer,\u201d she says.Rain is in the forecast, but Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson wants to make sure that his officers won\u2019t let their guard down as they head into the holiday weekend.\u201cI think you all know how important this weekend is,\u201d Mr. Johnson tells nearly 20 of Chicago\u2019s highest-ranking police officials at Public Safety Headquarters. \u201cViolence from the previous Memorial Day weekends hasn\u2019t been good.\u201dThe year, so far, has been steeped in blood. Shootings \u2014 1,177 as of the Friday morning before Memorial Day \u2014 are up by 50 percent for the year. Two hundred and thirty-three people are dead.Mayor Rahm Emanuel is also pushing for a quiet weekend. At a community event promoting nonviolence on the South Side, he greets men playing basketball, watches children draw, and compliments a mural underway, which reads: \u201cHearts Up. \u2026 Guns Down.\u201dA few hours later, the shooting starts.Tim Miller and a group of friends are sitting on the steps in front of their apartment building drinking beer when they spot a teenager walking out of an alley between low-rise apartment buildings onto South Racine Avenue. He has been shot and cries out for help. Two of his friends coming down the street are also shouting for assistance. The wounded teenager is bleeding heavily from his thigh. Mr. Miller and his friends, all in their 20s, put pressure on it, and then an ice pack. One goes inside to call 911. The police and an ambulance are on the way. So is Pauley LaPointe. With the crackle of the police scanner, he steers his Ford Crown Victoria toward the scene and punches the gas. He makes his living by selling video to the city's television news stations, and is often the first to report at a shooting scene.Mark Lindsey is outside his mother\u2019s house after a visit. He has chopped off his signature dreadlocks, and a woman has sent him a compliment. He forwards her message to a cousin. It\u2019s working already, he writes.He is behind the wheel of his red Chevy Monte Carlo, a car he so prizes that neighbors see him wash it again and again. A  man approaches on foot and opens fire,  and Mr. Lindsey, 25, is hit. The car lurches forward and strikes a parked pickup truck.His mother hears the gunfire, runs out and yanks on the locked car door. \u201cSomeone get him out of the car!\u201d she shouts over and over.The screams continue for long minutes. They are jarring here. This section of Ashburn, on the city\u2019s Southwest Side, had seemed somewhat removed from the worst of the gun violence.This block on West 75th Place is a cluster of small, neatly edged lawns rolling toward a quiet street where children play soccer. Late at night, television screens glow in living rooms. \u201cThis stuff don\u2019t happen here,\u201d says Mr. Lindsey\u2019s cousin Lorenzo Carter, 28. \u201cWe know everybody in this neighborhood.\u201dIn only a matter of minutes the police and ambulance will arrive, but the mother is frantic. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d she shouts.Witnesses see Mr. Lindsey in the driver\u2019s seat, his head resting against the window. He is taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center and is pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m.Mr. Lindsey worked at a railroad management company, friends say. \u201cHe was one of the success stories,\u201d says Leroy Cook, 26.The police have made no arrests in the case, and a motive is uncertain. Mr. Lindsey was arrested just a day before on a domestic battery charge. He was released on bond.Neighbors say the shooting shows that the violence is trickling onto blocks that had long been considered safe. \u201cShooting in Chicago is like a cancer,\u201d says Charles Parker, 46, standing on the street with another neighbor. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to spread out, and I just figured it was a matter of time.\u201dCalvin Ward, 50, is smoking a cigarette on the front steps at his wife\u2019s home on Paxton Avenue just after 1 a.m. when two young men come up the street and fire in his direction six times.Four bullets pierce the screen on the front door. One round grazes Mr. Ward\u2019s arm. Another tears into the house, flies through the living room and penetrates the bedroom wall before striking his wife, Julia Rhoden, sitting on her bed. She jumps up and runs out of the room, calling for help. When he hears Ms. Rhoden\u2019s screams, Mr. Ward scrambles to get a towel, and applies pressure to the wound as he waits for an ambulanceThe violence in this city has long been concentrated along blocks like the one on Paxton, where sleep is often disturbed in the middle of the night by the sound of gunshots. It\u2019s a world away from the glimmering downtown skyline and the mostly white, wealthier neighborhoods north of the tourist-clogged Loop.\u201cIt starts to become normal,\u201d says Darryl Edwards Sr., a neighbor who was awakened by the shots.Three years ago, he and his wife consulted a Google map before moving here, trying to see if there were people hanging out on the corners. He\u2019s happy with his choice \u2013 even though he estimates there have been gunshots on this block about 10 times.\u201cYou get some gunshots every day in some neighborhoods \u2014 every day,\u201d Mr. Edwards says. \u201cSo I say 10 in three years, that ain\u2019t too bad.\u201dMr. Ward is separated from Ms. Rhoden, but he is at her house visiting a 16-year-old daughter. He says he has no idea why the two men shot at him. \u201cI ain\u2019t no gangbanger or nothing,\u201d he says.Records show that Mr. Ward has been convicted several times of battery, and in 2012 was found guilty of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.\u201cI hope they catch them,\u201d Mr. Ward said of assailant, \u201cbut I doubt it.\u201d   A day after Ms. Rhoden is sent home from the hospital, she is resting in bed, her feet swelling and the bullet still lodged in her back. It is too close to her spine to be removed, she says doctors told her.Still, she is confident she will  recover, physically. Her mental state is a different story.\u201cEmotionally, I\u2019m not good \u2014 this put a fear in me,\u201d Ms. Rhoden says.A group of friends are crammed into a blue Jeep Grand Cherokee,  music blaring. One of them, Jose Alvarez, calls himself \u201cChi Rack Alvarez\u201d on Facebook, a play on Chicago\u2019s war-inspired nickname, Chiraq. He records a video of himself flashing signs disrespecting a gang, and posts it to Snapchat.Mr. Alvarez, 28, is at the wheel as the Jeep heads north on Lake Shore Drive, speeding by the affluent neighborhoods of the North Side, when a dark vehicle pulls alongside and someone inside opens fire.There are 15 shots in all, Mr. Alvarez estimates later from his hospital bed. He escapes with minor injuries: a bullet wound in the arm and a graze of his forehead.Not his friend Veronica Lopez, 15. \u201cI turned around, put my whole body on her, and hold her wound while they are still shooting through the door,\u201d Mr. Alvarez says. \u201cI was trying to save her, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201dMs. Lopez, a high school freshman, becomes the youngest murder victim of the mayhem over Memorial Day weekend.So much of Chicago\u2019s street violence is documented electronically that detectives scour the internet for the gang ties and grudges that often spark the gunfire. The police describe Mr. Alvarez as a gang member and say he may have been the intended target of the shooting. Mr. Alvarez insists that the police are wrong in labeling him part of a gang.After Ms. Lopez\u2019s death, he changed his Facebook profile name to \u201cRip Princess Veronica.\u201d  He says he expects the killers to boast about the shooting on social media.Damien Cionzynski, a 25-year-old forklift operator, is killed at a BP gas station just within the city limits. He is the third fatality of the weekend. The police, citing surveillance video and a witness, say they have identified two persons of interest in the killing and soon have one of them in custody.  Mr. Cionzynski\u2019s landlord, Sue Harle, says he came from Poland as a child and grew up in the area. He rented a basement room in her house  just a few blocks from where he was killed. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t lived half a life,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope they find these guys.\u201dThe doors are open at the Universal Missionary Baptist Church in Austin, on the West Side, and  a steady stream of people are  dropping off rifles, revolvers, even replica guns \u2014 61 weapons by the end of the day. Some are  rusty. Some date to the 1920s. Most donors walk away with gift cards for $100, an incentive paid for by the city to get some firearms off the streets.  \u201cThat\u2019s one gun gone,\u201d says Cordelia Brooks, who turned in a weapon that had once belonged to her grandfather and had barely been touched in years.  Officer Bob Garcia strains to find the serial numbers etched on one revolver. It has a night sight guide and bullets that resemble shotgun shells.  \u201cA criminal would love to get his hands on this,\u201d Officer Garcia says.The Chicago Police have regularly seized more illegally possessed guns than New York or Los Angeles. People arrested here generally face a one-year minimum sentence for illegal possession. But efforts to make the laws more like New York\u2019s, which mandate a three-and-a-half-year minimum sentence for an illegal, loaded weapon, have so far failed in the state legislature, and Chicago\u2019s bans on handgun ownership and on gun sales have been struck down by the courts in recent years. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a South Side priest, says guns have become part of the \u201cwardrobe\u201d for some in the city. They would rather risk a short prison term than face the danger of walking the streets without a gun.Sharod Roper, 24, who grew up in the Englewood neighborhood, says he had occasionally carried a gun to protect himself from being robbed, but never used it. \u201cI have to have a gun to scare them off,\u201d he says.\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d Shorlanda Tutson cries. Her face is soaked with tears. Her hands stretch toward the sky.The body of her son, Garvin Whitmore, 27, is in the car he borrowed from her, now covered with a white sheet. Mr. Whitmore and his fianc\u00e9e, Ashley Harrison, 26, had been sitting in the car outside a liquor store, in a South Side neighborhood accustomed to gunfire, when, in broad daylight, shooting started. Mr. Whitmore was fatally shot in the head. Ms. Harrison, the mother of his two children, grabbed a gun from the car, jumped out and fired into the air. She was later charged with discharging the weapon, and the police say they are following leads from video and forensic evidence in the case. Standing off to the side is a woman, in tears. She does not know Mr. Whitmore's family, she says, but understands their  pain. The woman, Noel, says she does not want her last name used, for fear of bringing more troubles to her family. She says her nephew was killed a year ago as he left a party. Her 20-year-old son is a member of a gang. He has been shot each summer for the past three years. She is relieved that he is now in the Cook County jail.She says she tried to raise him right, but the forces outside her door were stronger. \u201cSomehow these streets suck my son in,\u201d she says. \u201cHis friends, they\u2019re dropping like flies. The boys, the girls, all of them. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\u201dIn a police command center packed wall to wall with computer screens, Officer Richard Walton  is tracking  in real time the shooting that left Mr. Whitmore dead. Witnesses say the suspect fled in a white sport utility vehicle. Officer Walton has views from all the city cameras mounted along nearby intersections, and there, on one monitor, comes a white S.U.V., making a sharp turn onto South Princeton Avenue.\u201cYou can even see a figure in the driver\u2019s seat, right there,\u201d Officer Walton says, after alerting officers on the scene which way the suspect is headed and sending them images of the car.From this nerve center, a dozen police officers monitor the city minute by minute. There is a map of the city overlaid with rectangles glowing red and orange to show current hot zones for gang disputes. A screen tracks the locations of the latest gunshots, capturing the sounds of shots and estimating their origin down to 15 feet. Facial recognition software helps narrow down suspects whose images are caught on security cameras.Sometimes only minutes after the gunshots end, a computer system takes a victim\u2019s name and displays any arrests and gang ties \u2014 as well as whether the victim has a rating on the department\u2019s list of people most likely to shoot someone or be shot. Police officials say most shootings involve a relatively small group of people with the worst ratings on the list. The police and social service workers have been going to some of their homes to warn that the authorities are watching them and offer job training and educational assistance as a way out of gangs. Of the 64 people shot over the weekend, 50 of them, or 78 percent, are included on the department\u2019s list. At least seven of the people shot over the weekend have been shot before. For one man, only 23 years old, it is his third time being shot.About a block away from the Lexington Street shooting, a fight breaks out. Now the anger is aimed at arriving police officers.         Distrust of the police flashes on the streets, again and again. \u201cPlease sir, don\u2019t beat me,\u201d one man yells, mockingly, at the scene of early morning gunfire that has left three men shot \u2014 two in their legs and another in his back \u2014 along West Walnut Street on the West Side. Four men in their 20s are watching as the police mark the scene. Shell casings speckle the street. The men, who say they have been drinking a concoction of Pineapple Crush, hard candy and cough syrup, call out tauntingly to the officers. \u201cMan, you remind me of Clint Eastwood,\u201d one says. The Chicago Police Department, the nation\u2019s second-largest municipal force, with about 12,000 officers, has a deeply strained history with its residents, particularly African- Americans. The distrust makes solving so many shootings all the harder. The distrust means hurdles for law enforcement. Witnesses say they cannot remember what happened. The wounded refuse to cooperate. Victims drive themselves to hospitals, rather than call the police. They give the same story, over and over again: I felt a sting and realized I had been shot; I didn\u2019t see anything.How residents feel about crime and the police in Chicago, according to a recent poll:CHICAGONeighborhoods where ...WEST SIDESOUTH SIDEHow residents feel about crime and the police in Chicago, according to a recent poll:CHICAGOWEST SIDESOUTHSIDENeighbor-hoods where ...So crimes go unsolved. In 2015, the authorities made arrests in just over a quarter of that year\u2019s approximately 470 homicides. That only frustrates residents and fuels resentment. Just before 3 a.m. on Saturday, a young man, bleeding badly, cries out for help after being shot on North Kimball Avenue. But then he begs the neighbors not to call the authorities. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018I want to call 911,\u2019 he\u2019s running from my house,\u201d Mauricio Sandoval, 37, says. \u201cHe don\u2019t say nothing. I see the shot in the back. I\u2019m scared too, you know.\u201dOver four decades, Herb Harrington, 64, has seen generations pass through his barber shop in the Austin neighborhood, and cut the hair of many of the neighborhood children who have since become involved in gangs.Mr. Harrington is trimming a customer\u2019s hair in his shop when he hears a series of loud bangs. They come from the direction of the nearby Christ Outreach Deliverance Center on West Chicago Avenue, where a 23-year-old man is bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to his leg.  \u201cI heard five shots and I thought it was fireworks, but that was just wishful thinking,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cIt was real close, and one of the customers went outside and saw a young man laying on the ground.\u201d Mr. Harrington says he feels the area has become more violent. \u201cEvery week it\u2019s someone else,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s retaliation, this person for that person, and it doesn\u2019t stop. Every time there\u2019s a body down, there\u2019s going to be another one and another one.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re talking about poverty and families broken up and people not having opportunity and losing their way,\u201d he says. \u201cViolence is what we talk about in these chairs. We talk about it. We analyze it. But we don\u2019t have easy answers.\u201dA 34-year-old woman watches as an ex-boyfriend, his arm wobbly from alcohol, holds a gun to her cousin\u2019s head. Their dispute is over money. The cousin, Dontae Brock, pushes the gun away. They think it is a joke. But the ex-boyfriend pulls the trigger, she tells the police, the shots striking Mr. Brock in the torso. The woman, at the wheel of her Ford Explorer, says she sees what looks like a flash of fire on the floor of her car as the blasts hit. Moments  later, she jerks the Explorer into reverse, then speeds to a nearby hospital, where Mr. Brock, who was shot in the passenger seat, is told he will survive. Returning to her mother\u2019s rowhouse later, next to the scene of the shooting, the woman \u2014  a mother of four, her cousin\u2019s blood streaked across the back of her white T-shirt \u2014 says she has made up her mind: \u201cI got to leave this city.\u201d Her 56-year-old mother, wearing bright pink pants, plops down on her stoop, the John Hancock Center looming in the skyline about a mile away. For about six years, she has lived on this street of old sand-colored brick rowhouses that were part of Chicago\u2019s infamous Cabrini-Green housing project just north of downtown. She was cleaning ribs in the kitchen when she heard the gunfire and dropped to the floor. Now she smokes a cigarette and sinks her head into her hands.\u201cI hate the person that invented guns,\u201d she says.Police scanners announce Chicago\u2019s crime problem in staccato bursts, over and over, with the same words: \u201cShots fired.\u201dMany of the gunshots here hit no one, but they still leave a sense of worry and vulnerability. Since the start of the year, Chicagoans have called the police 28,000 times to report gunfire. Some are multiple calls about a single shooting and others turn out to be fireworks, but the possibility of being shot leaves its mark, even beyond those killed and wounded.At his home on the South Side, Rod Reeves, 42, turns on the spigot and shows how his garden hose, punctured by bullets, now leaks. Mr. Reeves says he and his family ducked behind a brick wall in their home to avoid stray shots when gunfire broke out on his block.\u201cI guess it\u2019s good to have a brick house,\u201d Mr. Reeves says.The police don\u2019t know exactly what led to a shooting in Roseland, on the city\u2019s far South Side. But the residents are fairly certain.\u201cThere\u2019s always retaliation,\u201d says one resident near where a 17-year-old was shot in the arm, insisting that her name and photograph not be published. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to come back and kill me.\u201dRetaliation drives a good share of Chicago\u2019s violence, scarring bystanders and relatives and, in a notorious case last year, killing a 9-year-old boy whose father was in a gang.Residents say it has gotten worse in recent years as gang structure has shifted. Some are vast and highly organized, while others span only a few blocks. New gang names pile on top of old ones, and they can change rapidly. So can their boundaries. And while once the violence associated with gangs was largely related to drug disputes, lately it is driven more by basic rivalries over turf and dominance, the police say.\u201cWhy did I gang bang?\u201d  asks Johnathan Hallman, 28, who lives on the South Side. \u201cJust to be around something, like just to be a part of something, man. Because when you growing up, man, you see all these other people, older people that\u2019s in the gang life or whatever. They making they little money and they doing they thing. You see the little ice, the car they driving. It\u2019s just an inspiration, man.\u201dMr. Hallman says he joined a gang at a young age, but eventually decided it was not all he thought it would be. He got out, he says.There is a routine in place whenever violence breaks out around the all-night laundromat in North Lawndale, on the West Side, which it frequently does. The employee on duty calls a co-worker, Frederick Clark, and says \u201cattack.\u201d Mr. Clark, 54, then alerts the police and heads into work. He has fielded about 20 such calls in the last six months, he says.\u201cI myself have been attacked 13 times in eight years here,\u201d Mr. Clark says. \u201cNever with guns, but I\u2019ve had to defend myself.\u201dSo when two men are shot just outside the laundromat, on South Harding Avenue, around 11 p.m. on Sunday, the business barely skips a beat. It doesn\u2019t close  or even slow much.For all the trauma, pain and anxiety that the illegal use of handguns has caused people in communities like North Lawndale, there is also a practical response: This is where people live and work. And so they do. Milk to pick up? Work to get to? Laundry to do? When the police secure the area after the shootings, reporters stand outside the perimeter and watch. But one man lifts the police tape to get to the laundromat. Another man grows angry when police officers stop him from doing the same. \u201cIt\u2019s yellow tape, not red,\u201d he shouts at the officers, so familiar with the rules of crime scenes that he knows red tape signals crucial evidence.More than 200 men and women are crammed into cells at the Cook County jail, awaiting their first appearances in court. Some sit with their eyes closed, trying to sleep. Others bounce their knees and stare anxiously from the cells. The police are still in the early stages of their investigations into the weekend\u2019s shootings, and not one of the people being held in the cells awaiting an appearance in Cook County bond court has been charged with shooting anyone over the weekend.Peter McDaniel is cleaning up behind a three-story apartment building in the 11th Police District on the West Side, the hardest hit area of the city this weekend. Signs of distress are everywhere, with brick and stone homes in decay, their expansive porches crumbling and windows boarded up. Many people have reinforced their homes with chained and padlocked gates. Signs warn of mean dogs. Streets are pockmarked by vacant and overgrown lots. Over the course of the weekend at least nine shootings took place in the 11th, one right near Mr. McDaniel.He hit the ground and emerged unhurt. But two men had gunshot wounds and the assailants, driving a black car, escaped.This year, at least 32 killings have occurred in this area of about six square miles.Mr. McDaniel blames a bitter and violent rivalry between two gangs, including one he says he has left. \u201cWe can\u2019t get along,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just always been that way.\u201dThe holiday is winding down. People toss out garbage from sidewalk parties. Coolers go back into car trunks for the rides home from the lakefront. The city gets ready to go back to work.Then a flurry of chaos bursts over the police scanner: Two men have been shot, on opposite sides of town, and neither one will survive. On the South Side, on a block of boarded businesses and apartments along Calumet Avenue, a woman wanders up to a police line. The body of James Taylor, 44, hit by multiple bullets, lies beside a car. The woman, a relative, asks if she can see the body, but an officer says no. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way you want to see that person,\u201d he tells her. On the far North Side, in a neighborhood of sari shops and kebab houses, police officers scan flashlights through bushes and behind buildings along North Rockwell Street, looking for evidence and for an assailant who is still on the loose. Johan Jean, 39, has been struck in the neck, and the police say a dispute earlier in the day in a Target store might  have led to the shooting. In the alleyway where he has died, smoke still swirls from an outdoor grill.Scanner audio via BroadcastifyDesign by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.

{"Headline": "While Young Britons Favor Staying in E.U., They Aren\u2019t Big on Voting", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 On June 23, tens of thousands of young Britons will be gathered at the Glastonbury music festival, whose headliners include Coldplay, Muse and Adele. Others will be avidly following the European Soccer Championship in France or biting their nails in anticipation of the next episode of hit teenage soap \u201cHollyoaks.\u201dOh, and there is the referendum that day asking them whether Britain should leave the European Union.\u201cWait, are we even registered to vote?\u201d Priya Patel, 25, asked her friend recently, as they waited outside a theater in east London to see their favorite stars arrive at the British Soap Awards.Would she want Britain to stay in the European Union?\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Ms. Patel, a medical practitioner, answered impatiently, switching her attention to her smartphone, visibly more interested in televised dramas than in the long-running tensions between her country and Brussels.\u201cWait, what just happened?\u201d she exclaimed as a \u201cHollyoaks\u201d star rolled by in a car.Holding the attention of young voters \u2014 and getting them to turn out on June 23 \u2014 is one of the biggest challenges for both sides in the campaign over Britain\u2019s place in Europe, especially for the advocates of remaining in the European Union.The problem for the pro-European forces is that young people are historically less likely to vote.In this case, some analysts say, it could be particularly hard to motivate them, not just because many of them will be immersed in summer activities, but also because they are being asked to embrace the status quo rather than to take up an idealistic cause of change of the type that typically energizes young people.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get them passionate about remaining,\u201d said Scott Townsin, 26, who recently directed a campaign video urging young people to vote in favor of staying in the European Union.Older voters tend to decide based on information they get from traditional media. But with young people, Mr. Townsin said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be loud, you\u2019ve got to compete with brands, favorite friends, Instagram, whatever, to get their attention.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dZak Reynolds, 20, from London, said he had yet to make up his mind. One of his parents will vote to stay in, the other to leave.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of propaganda stuff,\u201d he said.Sam Hemphill, 24, an engineering student from Swindon in southwest England, said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Britain\u2019s remaining.Part of his uncertainty, he said, was driven by the perception that the campaigns \u201care both lying.\u201d\u201cAll the facts and figures feel manipulated, which makes the decision hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are both polar opposites appealing on emotions rather than facts.\u201dThe In campaign used targeted Facebook ads to imply (falsely) that a British exit, or Brexit, could stop British soccer clubs from signing European players. (\u201cIf we leave the E.U., how will Tottenham be affected?\u201d one ad asked.)The Out campaign lent its support to a pop concert in Birmingham, only to have three acts pull out because they did not agree with its anti-Europe position.The voter registration deadline was Thursday, prompting ambitious drives by both sides to sign up supporters.Groups like Bite the Ballot, an organization that tries to encourage youths to vote, teamed up with Starbucks, which favors Britain\u2019s remaining in the European Union, to hold registration drives in coffee shops across the country.Uber, which has not taken a position on the referendum, flashed ads on customers\u2019 smartphones reminding them to register.Some surveys indicate that half of those between ages 18 and 30 want to remain in Europe, with the proportion higher among those under 25.Young Britons are generally comfortable with a multicultural society, surveys have found, and they value the opportunity to work and travel in 28 European nations without a visa.A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of those 18 to 34 years old in Britain had a favorable view of the European Union, compared with 38 percent of people 50 and over.The 180,000 or so people attending the five-day festival in Glastonbury will have to vote by mail \u2014 a relatively tedious process \u2014 or apply to have someone else vote on their behalf. (There will be no polling booths on the festival grounds, 900 acres of farmland in Somerset, since people have to vote where they are registered.)The same voting rules apply to the 300,000 to 500,000 British fans, many of them under 30, who the police expect will travel to France for the monthlong European Soccer Championship.Some of the efforts to get young people to vote are paying off.Ashleigh Breedy, a 34-year-old florist in favor of Brexit, said the referendum was so important that she would vote for the very first time.\u201cAll that money we\u2019re sending to Belgium and them telling us what to do,\u201d she said, referring to Brussels, where the European Commission is based.\u201cOur queen doesn\u2019t have a say,\u201d she said. \u201cIs Belgium going to tell our queen what to do?\u201d she asked, puffing on a cigarette and drinking a can of Red Bull. \u201cIf enough of us stand up to leave, we\u2019ll leave.\u201dBrexit campaigners are calling for more controls on immigration and greater national sovereignty; the option of remaining is appealing to voters because of the economic benefits.Charlie Carline, 31, a British exit supporter who will be in France on referendum day, said he had made sure to vote by mail.It is \u201cvery important,\u201d he wrote in a message on Facebook. \u201cI want out of the European Union dictatorship. Look at the state of Europe because of these power-ridden scum leaders.\u201dBy contrast, some of the young people supporting Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union are less passionate. For them, the monthslong campaign often felt more like well-fed Conservative politicians arguing over a dining bill.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to get bored by it,\u201d said Josh Glancy, 29, who plans to go to Glastonbury and who applied for a postal vote only because a friend had insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of spat among the Tory party, so I\u2019ve become quite fed up with it.\u201dStill, he said he planned to vote to stay in Europe because he liked \u201cthe idea of a Europe that can cooperate\u201d over issues including the migrant crisis.Vahan Salorian, 23, who juggles work as a composer, primary school music teacher and pub supervisor, said he would vote for Britain to remain in Europe.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching with mild terror\u201d the possibility of a British exit, he said, wearing a T-shirt decorated with avocados and sipping beer with friends in a park in east London. \u201cI\u2019m terrified it might happen.\u201dMr. Salorian, who is from the rural town of Barnoldswick in northern England, said living in a cosmopolitan city like London shaped his views. Friends in Barnoldswick, he said, were planning to vote out even though the area has had very little immigration.Back in east London at the British Soap Awards, Jennifer Burnett, 33, said she was registered to vote, but was unsure about her intentions.She had more definite views about the soaps. \u201cI know exactly who I\u2019m going to vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cVote \u2018Hollyoaks\u2019!\u201d she exclaimed, raising a plastic champagne cup in a celebratory gesture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Separate, Equal and Dysfunctional Branches of Government", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The continuing breakdown in Washington\u2019s ability to govern seemed to spread like a contagion Thursday through all three branches of government.The dysfunction somehow managed to reach new levels. The Supreme Court, left short-handed by a Republican refusal to act on President Obama\u2019s nominee in the final year of his presidency, deadlocked on a major immigration case. The inaction validated a lower court finding against the administration\u2019s attempt to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to live legally in the United States.Mr. Obama, who sought to address the nation\u2019s immigration crisis through his executive powers because of a persistent impasse on Capitol Hill, was unable to achieve one of his major goals \u2014 which pleased Republicans but left the president angry and disappointed.Democrats ended a raucous 25-hour protest on the House floor, failing to gain a vote on gun safety issues but exulting in the attention they received via a breakout social media campaign that threw the House rule book out the Capitol\u2019s neoclassical windows. Republican leaders accused Democrats of trying to capitalize on the Orlando, Fla., shooting while destroying the decorum of the House.The decision by Democrats to act out in the House was just the latest attempt to upend the political status quo in a year distinguished by political disruption, from Donald J. Trump rattling the Republican establishment to Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 the democratic socialist who made an appearance at the House protest \u2014 drawing huge crowds of young voters with calls to radically change the way Americans think about government.Partisan turmoil is nothing new in Washington. But the cloistered Supreme Court now finds itself disrupted as well by its empty seat, unable to fully function because of a Senate unwilling to act.In what passes in today\u2019s capital for a breakthrough, eight Senate Republicans joined Democrats in giving majority support to a bipartisan compromise to prevent terrorism suspects from buying firearms. But that plan, engineered by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, can go nowhere until she rounds up significantly more Republican support.Tempers were short and patience waned after a long night of confrontation on the House floor occupied by Democrats to the outrage of Republicans, who forced an adjournment vote shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday.\u201cThis is the people\u2019s House, this is Congress, the House of Representatives, the oldest democracy in the world and they\u2019re descending it into chaos,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters Thursday as the protest was winding up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a proud moment for democracy or for the people who staged these stunts.\u201dAs part of that final vote, House Republicans approved and sent to the Senate a bill to address the Zika health threat months after the White House sought the money. But the package, assembled with little Democratic participation, contained elements they knew Senate Democrats would oppose. The calculation appeared to be that if Democrats now block it, they will the ones blamed rather than Republicans.Democrats saw that as just another provocation.\u201cWhat you are seeing happening is a level of frustration that is just boiling over,\u201d said Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, one of the ringleaders of the Democratic floor revolt.For the duration of the sit-in, the House chamber, where electronic devices and photographs are frowned on, was awash in selfies, Facebook Live and Periscope. Even normally staid C-Span engaged in guerrilla video warfare, streaming a feed from a House member\u2019s phone on its House channel, showing the action as seen from the floor instead of the usual camera angles from the gallery above.House Democrats joyfully flouted House rules. Republicans said that some of their members urged the leadership to employ a cell-signal-jamming device to cut off the coverage, but that was deemed a bad idea.Mr. Ryan and other Republicans suggested there could be repercussions in the form of ethics complaints or other actions against Democrats.\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are reviewing everything right now, as to what happened and how to make sure that we can bring order to this chaos.\u201dWhat the payoff will be for that chaos orchestrated by House Democrats remains unclear. They were already expected to gain seats in the November election but a takeover is still considered a long shot, even with Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee. And Mr. Ryan showed that he could still command the majority-really-rules House even during the protest.Still, the defiance by House Democrats, who angrily declined to head out of town without so much as a vote on gun control after the killings in Orlando proved that they were willing to fight. They had seen their brethren in the Senate, who have much more legislative leverage, force a vote on gun proposals and did not want to be pushed aside by the House majority.But the inability of the Supreme Court to issue a decision, the Senate stalemate on guns, the dispute over Zika and the disorder on the House floor as lawmakers almost came to blows in an American version of foreign legislators duking it out could just turn people off Washington even more \u2014 if that is possible.With dawn just a few hours off, Mr. Ryan jammed through the Zika spending bill and his motion to adjourn to allow Republicans to leave town without even so much as the briefest of debates.\u201cSo we\u2019re locked out of everything, if I am understanding the rule correctly?\u201d Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is considered an expert on House rules, asked of Mr. Ryan. \u201cThis is a lousy process, Mr. Speaker.\u201dThe House, as they say on Capitol Hill, was not in order, and the rest of the government was struggling as well.Advertisement"}
