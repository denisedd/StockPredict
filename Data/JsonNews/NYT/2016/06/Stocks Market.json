{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Managers Work to Stanch Loss of Investors", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byHedge fund titans once ran their firms like elite private clubs, picking who made it past the velvet rope and how much they would pay for access to supercharged performance.Some big-name investors \u2014 MetLife, American International Group and the New York City pension plan, among them \u2014 have recently begun to withdraw their money from hedge funds in larger numbers. And the investors who stay are getting a chance to sit at the negotiating table and dictate lower fees and better terms for sharing in the returns that managers make.It\u2019s an unusual position for many hedge fund managers, who as a group are not known for sharing well with others.Now, in a bid to persuade investors to stay, some managers are sweetening the deal by lowering fees in return for locking up investor money for a longer period of time and setting certain performance targets that if exceeded, investors would pay a fee. For newcomers, managers are even offering the favorable terms once exclusively offered to longtime loyal clients.\u201cManagers are having to negotiate, and investors are demanding much more than they used to in the absence of value,\u201d said Adam I. Taback, head of global alternative investments at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cHigh fees are like an expensive car,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fine as long as you\u2019re getting performance out of it.\u201dIn recent years, investor criticism of hedge fund underperformance against a roaring stock market was met with frustration by managers who complained that investors couldn\u2019t have their cake and eat it, too. A hedge fund manager\u2019s job was to protect in down years but not outperform in good years, the industry argued. But when markets began to fall last summer, so did hedge fund returns, rendering the point moot for many investors.Over the last 18 months some of the best-known managers \u2014 including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management \u2014 have consistently lost money. Others that made bets on macroeconomic trends were caught off guard by wrong-footed bets and had to shutter their firms.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, for example, was one of the most popular stocks held by hedge funds in 2015, and its stock price soared to more than $260 a share at one point. But when news of a government investigation came to light and issues with the company\u2019s pricing strategy became apparent, the stock came crashing down. On Friday, Valeant\u2019s share closed at a low of $24.Mr. Ackman, who has been Valeant\u2019s biggest cheerleader, has lost billions of dollars so far on his bet on the company. His Pershing Square Holdings is down 17.5 percent so far this year through June 7, in large part because of the Valeant position.Other hedge fund titans including Paulson & Company and Viking Global Investors have collectively lost billions of dollars on the Valeant trade.\u201cI see the herd mentality among hedge funds every day,\u201d Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at China Investment Corporation, China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, said at the SkyBridge Alternatives, or SALT, hedge fund conference in Las Vegas last month. Describing how some funds spend \u201ctwo seconds\u201d on one theme before deciding to put investor money behind the idea, she added: \u201cWe pay 2 and 20 for treatment like this. I am reflecting that maybe we are not making the right decision.\u201dAll of this has prompted some self-reflection within the industry.\u201cWe are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds,\u201d Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, wrote to investors in a recent letter, describing a \u201ccatastrophic period\u201d for the industry.Some insurance companies have shown their displeasure, too.\u201cWe had a very negative experience in hedge funds,\u201d Peter D. Hancock, the chief executive of A.I.G., told investors earlier this year. The insurance group plans to pull about half of its $11 billion in hedge fund holdings.MetLife, another insurance giant that has roughly $1.8 billion invested in hedge funds, has been sending out redemption requests to those managers. Steven Goulart, its chief investment officer, recently told shareholders that the exit was prompted by inconsistent performance. The market environment will \u201ccontinue to be challenging for hedge funds,\u201d he added.Investors pulled $15.1 billion from the industry in the first quarter of the year. But these exits are a drop in the ocean compared with the $2.9 trillion the industry manages. Other institutional investors, meanwhile, continue to pump money in.Still, the pressure is mounting.\u201cNow the fact that people are willing to cut, you\u2019re going to see pressure on managers who are not at the top of the pyramid are going to have to cut,\u201d said Mark W. Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital.In a move that is largely unheard-of in the industry, Mr. Robbins recently apologized to investors in an attempt to stem the outflow of investor money from his firm. He pledged to \u201cright the ship as quickly as possible\u201d and even offered investors the opportunity to put more money into a new fund that would waive fees.Mr. Robbins has continued to lose money this year. Investors in his flagship fund have lost 6.5 percent as of the end of May. So Mr. Robbins is now offering more favorable redemption terms, allowing existing investors that add more money into the fund to step into the shoes of investors that have left, according to three people briefed on the firm\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them.As long as performance continues to lag, hedge funds will be scrutinized and hedge fund giants will be at a disadvantage.David Rubenstein the billionaire co-founder of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, perhaps summed up the sentiment best when he told an audience of money managers at the SALT conference in May, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed about the industry.\u201dIn case there was any hesitation, Mr. Rubenstein added: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be upset about what we do. We should be proud.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sungevity, a Solar Panel Provider, to Go Public in Merger", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported bySungevity, one of the leading national providers of rooftop solar panels, plans to merge with an asset management firm to become a publicly traded company, executives said Wednesday.The merger with Easterly Acquisition, which is expected to be approved later this year, would give Sungevity easier access to financing to help expand its business, with a goal of bringing solar panels to every house, said Andrew Birch, the solar company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.Since its founding in 2007, the company has rapidly expanded, but its market share has lagged behind publicly traded competitors like SolarCity and Sunrun, according to data compiled by GTM Research, which tracks the solar industry. The deal with Easterly, which is putting about $200 million into Sungevity, is intended to bring more mutual funds and global institutional investors into the mix.\u201cSolar\u2019s now an economic proposition for tens of millions of homes across the markets that we serve, so the challenge for the industry now is, how do we scale?\u201d Mr. Birch said. The Easterly plan, he added, \u201cgives us access to the public market, and it gives us access to investors who are looking for exposure to that adoption curve.\u201dBut Sungevity\u2019s business model is simpler, requires less capital and should prove more appealing, said Darrell Crate, chairman of Easterly, which, in a similar transaction, created a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, develops and manages government-leased properties.Sungevity \u2014 which operates in 13 states, Washington D.C. and Europe \u2014 focuses on using software to assess sites for solar and then to design, monitor and manage the systems and customer relationships. It relies on a network of partners to handle financing and installation, rather than using its own employees and equipment.\u201cPublic shareholders appreciate simplicity, transparency and clarity,\u201d Mr. Crate said. \u201cThe wisdom of making this a software-based, technology-enabled company allows them to scale and capture the revenue growth without having to grow head count at an equal rate.\u201dExecutives said they expected the merger to go through by the end of the year, when Mr. Birch said he anticipated his company would break even. On approval, Sungevity\u2019s outstanding equity and convertible debt will become shares of Easterly common stock, and Easterly will change its name to Sungevity Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of states in which the solar panel provider Sungevity operates. It is 13, not 12.Advertisement"}

Immigration may turn out to be that issue for the Brexit vote.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe big question now is whether concerns about immigration will be strong enough for the \u201cout\u201d camp to win.Immigration may have more pull as an issue of sovereignty. Those who support Brexit believe that the European Union has taken too many powers from the British government. Britain must now abide by European Union rules that allow the union\u2019s citizens freedom of movement across the region. This generally prevents Britain from placing restrictions on legal immigration from nations in the European Union.By coming out of the union, it would regain that power. And taking that back might seem particularly important to those voters who fear that Britain will have to take in large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa who have fled to Europe.That is hardly the most reassuring prediction for those who want Britain to stay in the European Union. But it may be all they have to cling to in the next two and a half weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncertainty Over \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Damps I.P.O.s in London", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain has been one of the most active markets for initial public offerings in Europe in recent years as a flurry of companies have sought to list their shares in London \u2014 far outpacing the level of activity in Paris, Frankfurt and other European financial capitals.A vote by Britain to exit the European Union, however, could change all that, at least for the short term.Investors have been reluctant to invest in new London listings, and several companies have delayed announcing their intention to file until after the vote on Thursday.Uncertainty over the outcome of the vote has kept many in the market on the sidelines as the margins in the polls have seesawed between the \u201cleave\u201d and the \u201cremain\u201d camps in recent weeks.The most recent polls, however, pointed to growing support to stay in the European Union. On Monday, global stock markets rallied and the British pound strengthened against the dollar.Still, Edward Sankey, the co-head of equity capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Deutsche Bank, said he expected little activity in new stocks for a while.British citizens will vote on whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. While a vote to leave would give Britain more autonomy, it could also create great economic uncertainty.\u201cIf there is an exit, a number of issuers will take time to figure out the market reaction before deciding to press ahead,\u201d he said.Bankers here say that several companies that had privately planned to go public have delayed their plans to list until after the outcome of the referendum, to avoid the uncertainty that can lead to wild swings in the financial markets and stock prices.Although the London market has had relative success \u2014 Jimmy Choo, WorldPay and Pets at Home are among its most notable listings in recent years \u2014 it has already been a challenging year for initial public offerings globally.Turbulent markets in the first quarter, driven in part by uncertainty about the Chinese economy, have weighed on I.P.O.s in Europe and around the world.\u201cBetween now and end of July, the pipeline is not huge,\u201d Tom Johnson, the co-head of Barclays\u2019 equity capital markets business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. \u201cThere will be quite a few in the second half potentially. I think the second half will be materially larger.\u201dThe number of new listings in Europe this year is at its lowest level since 2013. There were 77 initial public offerings that generated $15.7 billion in proceeds in Europe through June 17, according to data from Thomson Reuters.That compared with 113 offerings that generated $32.7 billion in proceeds in Europe in the period last year and 113 offerings that generated $33.1 billion in proceeds in the region through June 17 in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters.London accounted for 34 percent of all listings and has been home to two of the top 10 biggest deals in Europe this year, in terms of proceeds.The five largest offerings this year, however, have all come in Continental Europe.The biggest listing this year, by far, was Dong Energy, the Danish utility and the world\u2019s largest offshore wind power operator.It generated about $2.6 billion in proceeds as the signature transaction in what has been a down year for initial public offerings in Europe and could stand as the biggest listing in the region this year.The offering on Nasdaq in Copenhagen valued Dong Energy at about $15 billion.The next three largest deals, in terms of proceeds, were the Dutch government\u2019s sale of a stake in the insurer ASR Nederland, the sale of the lighting business of the Dutch electronics giant Philips and GE Capital\u2019s sale of Moneta Money Bank, its former banking business in the Czech Republic.Moneta listed in Prague, while ASR and Philips Lighting had their offerings in Amsterdam.The biggest deal in Britain this year has been the spinoff of National Australia Bank\u2019s British unit, Clydesdale Bank. That transaction generated about $570 million in proceeds.Globally, the I.P.O. market remains well above the level where it was during the financial crisis as private equity firms exit investments they made in the years before the crisis.And privatizations by European governments and companies seeking to separate noncore businesses are expected to drive initial public offerings this year, but an uptick in activity might not come until the fall, no matter how Britain votes, financial industry experts say.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Investors Are Gripped by a Panic Last Seen in 2008", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 First came the shock. Then fear seized world markets. As frenzied selling accelerated in Tokyo, Hong Kong and London, unfathomable amounts of wealth vanished in a matter of hours.As economists pored over the rout like accident investigators dispatched to the scene of a crash, most offered assurances that a Lehman-style financial panic was not unfolding. In that debacle, investors indiscriminately fled all assets connected to the disastrous American housing bubble. Mortgages had been carved into exotic investments and peddled around the globe, meaning they lurked everywhere. Distrust spread like a virus.This time, the source of the trouble is both identifiable and relatively confined. Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union face significant uncertainty in their economic and financial dealings as they embark on complex divorce proceedings.Fears that drawn-out negotiations could disrupt trade prompted investors to push their money toward safety. As night fell in London, the British pound was down more than 7 percent. Stock markets plummeted around the globe; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 3.6 percent in New York. London closed down a similar margin, and Tokyo surrendered more than 4 percent. Investors poured money into government bonds, seeking refuge.\u201cAs of now, this doesn\u2019t look like an end-of-the-world event,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research organization. \u201cIt looks bad, but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic game-changer similar to Lehman.\u201d Then he paused. \u201cYet.\u201dIn the best case, the plunge in markets represents an abrupt adjustment to the changing geography of global commerce. Britain has been diminished as a place for banking and business, and so the pound has lost some luster.In the worst case, investors have begun a fearful march away from risk, potentially starving emerging markets and stripping European countries of needed capital. It could last as long as the uncertainties dogging Europe \u2014 perhaps years.If recent traumas have clarified anything, it is the tendency for trouble to emerge unexpectedly. The global financial system is so intertwined that links can remain opaque.One key factor undergirds confidence that the so-called Brexit will not deliver Lehman-like troubles. In 2008, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic failed to recognize the mounting disaster. They failed to prepare adequate relief. While people may argue over the degree to which regulators have tamed the speculative excesses of finance, few dispute that improvements have been delivered.\u201cThe financial systems in the U.S. and Europe, including the U.K., are far more capitalized and less leveraged than they were in 2008,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThe proclivity to panic in ways that create financial instability are much more limited.\u201dThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank have tools they can wield to defuse threats to banks. They can simply print money and lend it out as needed.Less than an hour after markets opened in London on Friday, Britain\u2019s central bank governor, Mark J. Carney, stood before television cameras and struck a resolute pose as he promised to do what it took to stabilize markets. He announced that he was prepared to unleash another \u00a3250 billion (about $370 billion) in pursuit of financial tranquillity.\u201cWe expect institutions to draw on this funding if and when appropriate,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cThe bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses.\u201dThose words appeared to assuage fears, as the pound and stock prices both pared their losses.In recent years, the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have subjected financial institutions to so-called stress tests. They regularly scrutinize banks\u2019 portfolios and the money they hold in reserve to make sure they can hold up in various outbreaks of trouble.Yet, these are academic exercises.\u201cThis is the real stress test,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.The immediate run on stocks and currencies might yet grow into something worse, shaking consumer confidence and prompting households to limit their spending. As businesses lose profit opportunities, they are likely to put off investing and hiring.If that happens, it could create a spiral ending in recession, both in Britain and across Europe, adding to pressure on banks. The markets seemed to be warning of this possibility as they savaged the value of banking stocks on Friday.The greater the odds that the European Union will splinter, the more investors are likely to demand extra payouts for fresh loans to debt-saturated countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. That could squeeze businesses there, making it harder for them to borrow, further crimping their economies.\u201cThat could then spread to the banks and go global, and that could smell like a Lehman,\u201d said Markus Schomer, chief economist for PineBridge Investments, a global asset management firm. He put very low odds on this \u201creferendum contagion\u201d case.If history is a guide, hedge funds, private equity and other realms of finance will also suffer. There, aggressive players borrow enormous sums of money to place outsize bets. Crises have previously revealed those taking on outsize risk. Long Term Capital Management, which borrowed heavily, appeared robust before losses in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s brought it to the verge of a collapse that threatened the broader financial system and required a private bailout.As the prominent investor Warren E. Buffett once put it, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201dThose who had been paying attention to the American housing crisis were hardly surprised when Lehman\u2019s afflictions burst into public view. Lenders had been writing mortgages to seemingly anyone in possession of a signature. Lehman had been repackaging these loans and selling them for vast profits.The surprise was that Lehman actually went bankrupt, exposing its trading partners to losses. By contrast, polls had suggested that Britain might really walk. This is a source of hope, given that central banks, governments and investors had more time to prepare.\u201cLehman came out of the blue,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThis is like a train wreck where you can see the trains coming together for a long distance and you\u2019re hoping the trains will swerve away.\u201dBut any comfort in that is sapped by the fact that Britain, one of the oldest democracies on earth, put itself in this spot through an exercise of free will. Now, the world waits to see how far the pain spreads.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s because many hedge fund managers watched the elections from the sidelines. Any winners and losers will be determined in the days and weeks after the vote.\u201cThere was a ton of cash on the sidelines,\u201d he added.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union poses difficult questions for investment firms like Greylock, which made big bets on Greece as it teetered on the brink of economic collapse. At a time when many European countries are dealing with flagging economies, Mr. Humes said he was concerned that the Brexit vote would feed a growing populist surge across the Continent, threatening to chip away at the foundation of the European Union.\u201cVery few, if any, were so convinced that Brexit was going to happen that they would risk enough capital to make money from it,\u201d he said.As to whether he planned to make any fresh bets after the vote, Mr. Ader said, \u201cThis will take a long time to shake out.\u201dIt may not be surprising that a number of hedge funds are proceeding with caution. The last major episode of market turmoil, when Chinese stocks tumbled last summer, sent many hedge funds reeling. Some have yet to recover.Whether Mr. Soros took any positions to profit from a Brexit is unclear. A day after the referendum, he warned of the consequences of the Brexit vote.Mr. Cooperman, who cited optimistic figures about the \u201cremain\u201d vote, also sounded a cautious note when he spoke at a Youth INC charity event at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan on Wednesday.\u201cI think Brexit is going to have a very negative impact on Europe if it happens,\u201d Mr. Cooperman told an audience of investment professionals.By Friday, he had adopted a darker view.\u201cMy friend at Microsoft was dead wrong, as was I,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said, referring to the source of his optimistic probability of Britain\u2019s voting to remain.\u201cThis, too, shall pass.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Financial Markets Too Complacent About the Global Economy?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe latest polling suggests the British are inclined to drop out of the European Union, throwing the future of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc into doubt.The United States in November may elect a president who promises to abandon many norms of governance, and a horrendous terrorist attack has opened up new talk in the presidential race of upending the nation\u2019s longstanding economic and diplomatic relationships with the rest of the world.Oh, and last month the United States experienced its weakest job growth in six years.If there was a good time for financial markets to show signs of fear for global economic and political stability, this would seem to be it.In the last several days there has been some evidence, if you look carefully enough, of the risk that some big, disruptive events will become priced into markets. The British pound has fallen steeply on currency markets, reflecting the risk of \u201cBrexit,\u201d and government bond prices in advanced nations have soared (and their yields have fallen) as investors have plowed money into safe assets.But many other financial market conditions are more consistent with what you expect to see when everything is basically going fine \u2014 not indicative of a major risk of financial, economic or geopolitical upheaval.The American stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, is hovering just below record highs. A measure of expected market volatility, the Vix, has spiked in the last few days but remains well below its level of just a few months ago. Oil prices have been rising steadily since February and haven\u2019t moved much in the last week, let alone shown the drop you might expect if a collapse in global demand seemed imminent.There are two possibilities of what is going on. At best, the markets are telling us something important that excitable journalists and pundits aren\u2019t. Call this the markets-are-smart theory.At worst, markets are complacent, and deep-seated flaws in how financial markets work mean that current stock and commodity prices aren\u2019t reflecting the major risks that lie ahead.And even if any of those forecasts turns out to be wrong, the consequences for the economy and corporate profits won\u2019t be as severe as fearful headlines suggest. The British economy will remain basically sound as the nation renegotiates its trade relationships; Mr. Trump will govern more like a conventional president than his words now suggest; and any economic slump in the United States will be short and mild.In this story, stock, bond and currency traders have the wisdom to look past the noise that the aforementioned excitable journalists and pundits don\u2019t.The other argument is scarier.Markets are very good at incorporating news into asset prices when it\u2019s clear and straightforward how one should affect the other. When a company releases an earnings report, analysts can quickly figure out what it should mean for the stock price, and the stock moves accordingly. When data comes out that makes a Federal Reserve rate increase 10 percent more likely, it\u2019s fairly straightforward to translate that into the proper pricing of Treasury bonds and the dollar. A disruption to an oil pipeline has a relatively clear-cut impact on the price of crude.So traders are efficient at pricing in pieces of news that affect asset prices in predictable ways over the short and medium term. They\u2019re a lot worse at predicting which major threats to the global economy will spiral out of control and which will turn out to hardly matter.Consider two examples from recent years.In the summer and fall of 2011, investors were panicked that the eurozone would unravel because of the fiscal crisis that started in Greece. Global stock markets, commodities and risky forms of debt plummeted; volatility skyrocketed.But things turned out to be more or less fine. More aggressive action by the European Central Bank and European political leaders starting late that year helped calm everyone. And while the European economy is not in great shape, the Continent experienced no epic financial crisis. If you had the nerve to buy eurozone stocks in September 2011, you have enjoyed a 51 percent return on your money.Other times, instead of being too fearful of cataclysmic events, financial markets are too complacent. What we now call the global financial crisis got its start in mid-2007, as losses on mortgage-related securities mounted and global money markets froze up.But after some initial efforts by the Federal Reserve and other government officials to contain the damage, financial markets rallied 11 percent from mid-August through mid-October, pushing the stock market to new highs and suggesting all was well. Of course, as it turned out, a severe recession and catastrophic financial crisis were just around the corner. People who bought into any risky assets, whether stocks or mortgage-backed securities, at the October highs lost their shirts.Even if that\u2019s so, the next few months will be a great test of just how much markets really know about the future. And given the precarious headlines of the last few months, anyone who wants to make sure they don\u2019t lose their shirts again should hope that they\u2019ve got it right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MSCI Delays Adding China Stock to Emerging Markets Benchmark", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese stocks had seemed poised to join an important global benchmark, paving the way for overseas money to pour into the country\u2019s markets.But the provider of the index, MSCI, decided that China was not yet ready, again holding off on adding mainland stocks to its influential emerging-markets benchmark.The decision, announced on Tuesday, was a blow not only to despondent local investors but for the Chinese government more broadly. For several years, China had been pushing hard to increase its sway in global financial markets, an effort that recently resulted in having its currency, the renminbi, included in the exclusive club of currencies at the International Monetary Fund.A year ago, China seemed close to having won over MSCI, whose remaining major concern was the difficulty for foreigners to buy and sell stocks in China, where the government has significant influence over markets.One stock market crash later, however, the government\u2019s grip has grown tighter.The extra money flowing into mainland stocks, or A shares, would have provided a much-needed boost. Despite the government intervention, Chinese stocks have been in a deep slump, off about 40 percent in the last 12 months.\u201cInternational institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A shares market before its inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,\u201d Remy Briand, the global head of research at MSCI, said in a statement on Tuesday.MSCI said it would reconsider A shares for inclusion in 2017.The index provider\u2019s decision to delay for another year highlights persistent concerns among global investors about government meddling in local markets as well as the quality of regulation and company accounts.\u201cAccounting in China is a state secret,\u201d said Hugh Young, who oversees investments in Asia for Aberdeen, one of the world\u2019s largest emerging markets investors. \u201cOur money goes into companies, and we have had trouble finding the right ones to invest in.\u201dMost large investors get their China equity exposure by investing in large companies listed in Hong Kong or other overseas markets \u2014 like the internet giants Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 where companies must adhere to globally accepted financial rules and regulations. MSCI\u2019s weighing toward China was already 25 percent, the largest of all the countries it tracks; analysts were guessing that China\u2019s inclusion would add another 1 percent of Chinese exposure.MSCI said investors were also bothered by the stiff limits imposed on foreign investors withdrawing their funds from China.The verdict will do little to lift the mood in China\u2019s once bustling brokerage halls.On a recent afternoon inside a poorly lit trading hall near People\u2019s Park in Shanghai, a dozen or so elderly investors were chatting among themselves as the final minutes of another trading day ticked away.As the stock prices flashing on a bank of 21 LCD screens attested, the main Shanghai share index had staged a modest rally to recover from its earlier losses. But once again, the index had slumped back down into negative turf by the 3 p.m. close.\u201cIt\u2019s not about waiting it out, because if you try you will probably get wiped out,\u201d said Mr. Ye, a 62-year-old retiree who declined to give his full name when speaking critically about the government\u2019s stock market rescue efforts.\u201cIt is really painful,\u201d he added, estimating that most of the investors at the Shanghai trading hall had lost money over the past year. \u201cThis market isn\u2019t really regulated.\u201dThe MSCI decision speaks to the caution signs in the market.When the index company delayed its decision a year ago, mainland stocks were at their frothiest. They had more than doubled over the previous 12 months.At the time, the company said it was concerned about a number of restrictions in China. Certain rules made it challenging for global investors to move money in and out of the country, or even to prove with certainty their ownership of shares.Global investors also fretted about the curious ability of Chinese companies to stop trading in their stock whenever it seemed to suit their own needs. The practice stopped shares under pressure from falling further, but it did so by preventing investors from cashing out.With an eye on making the cut at MSCI, China sought to address these concerns in recent months.Last week, China said it would grant an initial renminbi-denominated investment quota to the United States, allowing American funds to purchase stocks worth as much as 250 billion renminbi, or $38 billion. American investors could previously buy into Chinese stocks through other methods, but the new quota provided significant direct access and ranked as the second-biggest of its kind under the renminbi program, after Hong Kong\u2019s.Still, efforts to improve market regulations may be cold comfort for ordinary Chinese investors who are still nursing losses from last year\u2019s stock market fallout.Mr. Tao, a 63-year-old retiree at the Shanghai brokerage who declined to give his first name because he spoke critically of the government\u2019s actions, said he used a bit of his monthly pension of 1,600 renminbi, or $243, to dabble in the stock market.Taking a break outside the brokerage to chat over a red Double Happiness cigarette, Mr. Tao said he was sitting on tidy profits until the market turned downward last June.Since then, his investments have given back more than 70 percent of those gains.\u201cIn investing, one misstep and you\u2019re nabbed,\u201d Mr. Tao said.He added that it could take years to recover his lost profits. \u201cNow I just want to wait it out,\u201d he said.Neil Gough reported from Shanghai and Landon Thomas Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}

Mr. Macri took office six months ago after a period of market isolation under the previous administration. Argentina had been cut off from global markets after a $100 billion debt default in 2001 and a long legal battle with hedge fund creditors that was resolved this year.Argentina\u2019s government returned to global bond markets in April, after a 15-year hiatus, with an issuance of $16.5 billion. Several of the nation\u2019s provinces have been raising money on these bond markets in recent weeks.Havanna, which makes alfajores, a sweet biscuit snack, and runs more than 300 coffee shops in Argentina and across Latin America, sold 4.27 million shares \u2014 10 percent of the company \u2014 at 37 pesos per share, valuing it at around $114.7 million.Demand doubled the number of shares offered, so they were priced at the top of the marketed range.\u201cThere was so much demand for this stock,\u201d said Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, a brokerage firm in Buenos Aires that managed Havanna\u2019s sale. \u201cThis is very encouraging not only for Havanna, but for other companies who want to go public.\u201dDespite the small size of the offering, 17 percent of orders came from abroad, Mr. Ilac said.While initial price offerings from Argentina have been sporadic in recent years, Havanna is predicted to lead a fresh wave in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.Already, Grupo Supervielle \u2014 the holding company for Banco Supervielle, a bank \u2014 raised $280 million last month in an initial public offering in both New York and Buenos Aires. But Havanna\u2019s offering was the first entirely local equity offering since the oil company Petrolera Pampa\u2019s in 2013.Mr. Macri\u2019s government is dealing with an overhaul of the economy, including efforts to bolster growth, rein in inflation and narrow the fiscal deficit. But if policy makers face serious setbacks, analysts say, this would suppress investor demand in Argentina.\u201cSustaining this incipient interest in Argentine assets from financial markets depends on how the macro-economy evolves,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, an economist at a consulting firm in Buenos Aires.An article on Tuesday about the initial public offering of Havanna, an Argentine confectioner and coffee shop chain, misstated the number of years ago that the last local initial public offering came to market in Argentina. It was nearly six years ago, not three. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}

But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. When finance is hit by social and political crises, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend intervention. It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis. It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund.

{"Headline": "Andrew Caspersen, Charged in $40 Million Fraud, Had Gambling Addiction, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFederal prosecutors claim that Andrew Caspersen ran a Ponzi-like scheme to defraud friends, family and a hedge fund foundation of nearly $40 million over an 18-month period.But on Tuesday, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer contended that his client, a former Wall Street executive with an Ivy League pedigree, was the victim of an uncontrollable gambling addiction that drove him for more than a decade. So gripping was Mr. Caspersen\u2019s addiction, the lawyer said, that he checked his phone throughout the day for updates on the stock market\u2019s direction and his \u201call in\u201d bearish bets that ran into tens of millions of dollars.Dressed in a black suit and pink tie at his arraignment in a Manhattan federal courtroom Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Caspersen, 39, told a judge that he had been treated for \u201ccompulsive gambling and mental health illness\u201d issues since his arrest in March.Mr. Caspersen appeared on Tuesday before Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court and pleaded not guilty to a criminal document that included one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. However, negotiations have been taking place for several weeks, and he is expected to plead guilty at a July 7 hearing.After the short proceeding, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, described him as \u201cremorseful and relieved.\u201d Mr. Caspersen has been cast as a man of privilege who took advantage of his social standing and professional position to fuel his trading addiction.\u201cHe had every intention of paying everyone back,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said. \u201cThis is a pathological gambling addiction.\u201dBefore his arrest, Mr. Caspersen was seen as a successful Wall Street executive with the right credentials and pedigree. He had attended the Groton School, Princeton and Harvard Law School, and had gone on to become an executive at the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners.On Tuesday, Mr. Shechtman described Mr. Caspersen\u2019s addiction as having started with casino gambling and sports betting, and quickly turning into betting on the stock market while he was a student at Harvard Law. Mr. Caspersen\u2019s father and brothers all attended Harvard, where a student center at the law school is named for the family.Over the last decade, Mr. Caspersen squandered more than $20 million of his own money, including a family inheritance, Mr. Shechtman said, adding that Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Christina, were essentially broke and were selling their multimillion-dollar Bronxville, N.Y., home.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s trading strategy was not particularly sophisticated. He almost exclusively traded one-week put options betting on a decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. What was remarkable was the bold nature of the bets, in which Mr. Caspersen would instruct his broker to trade all the cash available in his account each week, his lawyer said.As recently as Feb. 11, Mr. Caspersen had $112.8 million in a brokerage account and could have easily paid back the $38.5 million he had owed family and friends. Instead, the very next trading day he ordered his broker, at an unnamed Wall Street firm, to place a new round of all-in bets that the market would fall that week.Mr. Caspersen even took about $1 million from the family of a longtime girlfriend, Catherine F. MacRae, who died on Sept. 11, 2001, during the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Together with Ms. MacRae\u2019s family, Mr. Caspersen had created a memorial fund to benefit education programs for children from low-income families. The lawyer said the money in the scheme was not from that fund.Prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the Manhattan United States attorney, added more details on Tuesday to the criminal complaint they filed in March.The authorities now say that Mr. Caspersen had sought to defraud investors out of $150 million, up from the $95 million cited in the criminal complaint. The new criminal filing said he used some of the money he raised to \u201cmake periodic interest payments to earlier investors.\u201dMr. Caspersen promised investors an annual return of 15 to 20 percent by putting up money that he said would be used to \u201cmake secured loans to private equity firms,\u201d the authorities said.In all, prosecutors said he used five fictitious investment vehicles to raise money to carry out the scheme. They said he also doctored documents and made up an employee at one firm as part of his bluff when he was questioned by investors.An internal investigation by PJT Partners concluded that the amount of money Mr. Caspersen actually took in from investors in the last two years was about $40 million, of which $14 million came from friends and relatives, including his mother, Barbara Caspersen.The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a related civil fraud complaint against him.Mr. Shechtman said news media reports have wrongly characterized his client as a man driven by greed and self-interest.\u201cThis is not about Wall Street greed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about addiction and mental illness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Macroeconomics of Brexit: Motivated Reasoning?", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still on vacation, but had some time to catch up today, and felt an urge to scratch an itch I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been feeling. You see, much of the discussion of Brexit and its impacts bothers me. I believe that Brexit is a tragic development, which will do substantial long-run economic harm. But what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing overwhelmingly from economists is the claim that it will also have severe short-run adverse impacts. And that claim seems dubious.Or maybe more to the point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a claim that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow in any clear way from standard macroeconomics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being presented as if it does. And I worry that what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is a case of motivated reasoning, which could end up damaging economists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 credibility.OK, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start at the beginning. Brexit will almost certainly have an adverse effect on British trade; even if the UK ends up with a Norway-type agreement with the EU, the loss of guaranteed access to the EU market will affect firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions about investments, and inhibit trade flows.This reduction in trade relative to what would otherwise happen will, in turn, make the British economy less productive and poorer than it would otherwise have been. It takes fairly heroic assumptions to make this into a specific number, but 2-3 percent lower income in perpetuity seems plausible.So far, so good, or rather so bad: this is standard economics, basically Ricardo with a dash of new trade theory. But what about warnings that Brexit will precipitate a British recession, or at least a drastic slowdown in the short run? Where are those coming from?The trade arguments are about the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply side: less trade means lower productivity and hence lower productive capacity. But the kind of recession we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about here is a demand-side phenomenon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a slump brought on by inadequate spending. And why, exactly, is that supposed to happen?As best I can tell, the case for a UK recession or at least slowdown rests on two not entirely distinct propositions: the idea that uncertainty will deter investment and possibly consumption, and the idea that an increase in perceived risks will worsen financial conditions. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take these on in turn.But in that case we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying that bad things will happen because firms will perceive an increased probability of bad things happening. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either circular reasoning, assuming one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion, or both.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also note that any major policy change creates uncertainty, because nobody knows how it will work out. So why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we hear recession warnings when countries are contemplating major trade liberalization, or privatization schemes, or labor market reforms? The \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty depresses investment\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument seems to be rolled out selectively, only deployed against policies economists dislike for other reasons.Meanwhile, what about the argument that Brexit will worsen financial conditions, increasing risk spreads? Well, this seems to me to be another circular argument \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claiming that bad things will happen because investors will expect bad things to happen.In other words, the arguments for big short-run damage from Brexit look quite weak. An economist who tried to make similar arguments for or against most policies would face a lot of criticism. But in this case we have a near-consensus accepting these weak arguments. Why?My suspicion is that the same thing is happening here. Economists have very good reasons to believe that Brexit will do bad things in the long run, but are strongly tempted to sex up their arguments by making very dubious claims about the short run. And the fact that so many respectable people are making these dubious claims makes them seem well-reasoned when they aren\u2019t.Unfortunately, that sort of thing, aside from being inherently a bad practice, can all too easily backfire. Indeed, the rebound in British stocks, which are now above pre-Brexit levels, is already causing some backlash against conventional economists and their Chicken Little warnings.Sorry, people, sloppy thinking is always a vice, no matter what cause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used for.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Will Markets Recover From \u2018Brexit\u2019? Clues From Past Crises", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byStrategiesOne day, perhaps three or four months from now, they are likely to look even better, until the next crisis comes.Those statements are not based on visions of the future. I subscribe to the view that while history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, it rhymes.And in this case, history provides some limited reassurance. Barring a severe global recession, which doesn\u2019t seem imminent, stock market drops of this magnitude generally reverse themselves within three or four months. That\u2019s because big, quick declines embody reflexive panic \u2014 urgent desires to cut losses before the larger meaning of a market shock has been digested. Sometimes there are quick recoveries \u2014 as we saw after the initial declines after the so-called Brexit vote \u2014 which are followed by further losses until the markets find equilibrium.In the United States, on Aug. 1, 2011, when Congress could not reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 3 percent, partly rebounded, then fell 14 percent by Oct. 3. It recovered within three months.Finally, on March 27, 2012, the European debt crisis forced Spain into budget austerity, setting off labor strikes and driving the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 3 percent in one day, and a total of 11 percent. The recovery time? Again, a mere three months.\u201cIt is important for long-term investors to note that in each of these instances, stocks rebounded to their pre-shock level in three or four months,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said, \u201ceven when a recession took place.\u201dThat said, neither Japan nor Europe nor the United States is in wonderful economic shape right now. Japan and Europe have endured severe market and economic downturns after these market shocks. The United States economy has grown very slowly and could be threatened by the shock waves emanating from Europe.It is also worth noting that the post-2009 period is too brief to conclude much about the long-term performance of the markets. There has been a tenacious bull market in stocks in the United States since then, fueled in part by central bank policy that has engineered ultralow interest rates. The market has been running out of steam.That is why a deeper dive provides a useful perspective.First, from a market standpoint, the Brexit crisis so far hasn\u2019t caused much damage. In the history of the S.&P. 500, for example, the decline on June 24, which came to 3.6 percent, was inconsequential when measured as a percentage of the index\u2019s total value. Using that measure, the decline ranked as only the 180th-largest since 1928, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.What distinguished the early phase of this crisis, statistically, is that the markets were so poorly positioned in advance of the British vote. It was almost as though they were moving full speed in one direction and had to turn around and sprint the other way.Paul T. Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, brought this to my attention. Using a technical indicator \u2014 the 50-day moving average of the S.&P. 500 \u2014 he found that stocks were \u201coverbought\u201d before the vote, meaning that traders had pushed prices well above recent levels. That would probably have been fine if a majority of voters had called for Britain to stay in the European Union.But that upward momentum before the Brexit vote set up a nasty market downturn. The combination of an overbought market immediately before an extremely oversold one was so unusual, he said, that \u201cextraordinary may be an understatement. Using that overbought-oversold measure, the two-day price reversal was the biggest since 1928.\u201dOnly two episodes came close.One was in October 1989, when the failure of a leveraged buyout of United Airlines devastated the junk bond market. The S.&P. 500 fell 6.5 percent over two days. (That compares with a 5.3 percent decline in the two days after the Brexit vote.) There was a partial recovery and another downturn, but in less than three months the market returned to its old level.That example is comforting; the second is not: It occurred during World War II, when Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands and began to overrun France. On May 10, 1940, Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister of Britain, and Winston Churchill replaced him.Worldwide markets were grossly unprepared for what came next. Over two days, the S.&P. 500 in the United States declined 8.3 percent. And over the next two years, the war deepened, millions died and as an incidental casualty, the stock market declined another 33 percent. It took more than three years for the S.&P. 500 to return to its former level.In early 1940, historical stock data would not have helped much in forecasting market returns for the rest of the year. Much bigger factors than 50-day moving averages determined the course of events.If only by comparison, today\u2019s problems seem manageable and easily understood. Events in Europe are still unfolding. But the preponderance of data strongly suggests that the markets will settle down in days, weeks or months, not years.Other crises are sure to follow in this election year. We don\u2019t know what lurks beneath the surface of moving events and won\u2019t find out until the smoke clears.

{"Headline": "Dear Conservatives, You Can Go Green Again", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byThis is a shame, because conservatives used to be almost by definition conservationists, focused on preserving our shared heritage from destructive influences. You can, in fact, date the rise of the conservation movement as a political force in this country to a December 1887 dinner party of wealthy big game hunters, largely Republicans, hosted in a Madison Avenue house by Theodore Roosevelt (still a hero to many modern conservatives, despite certain progressive leanings). He and his guests that night formed the Boone and Crockett Club, dedicated to preservation and management of game.So what does it take to bring conservatives back, after a quarter-century of their reflexively treating even the mention of environmental issues as a treasonous attack on business and the nation? It\u2019s possible they are already returning, with the House of Representatives last month approving a major environmental reform by an astonishingly bipartisan 403 to 12 margin, and the Senate almost certain to follow.It\u2019s also arguably a model for further cooperation on environmental issues. But how to make progress on other vital environmental issues? It will help for environmentalists to acknowledge past contributions by conservatives and also the potential value of conservative approaches for the future.On the other hand, if conservatives genuinely oppose big government, Mr. Adler adds, they should start by opposing costly government programs that are a leading cause of environmental damage \u2014 including fossil fuel subsidies, ethanol subsidies, agricultural subsidies and many of the ill-conceived dam and irrigation projects of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.Mr. Adler doesn\u2019t draw the line at turning federal lands over to private ownership, under the right circumstances \u2014 for instance, with groups like the Nature Conservancy among the potential private owners. I think that would be a betrayal of Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s considerable bequest to the nation, with Cliven Bundy clones more likely to be among the owners. But Mr. Adler and I could certainly talk about market-based alternatives to the current federal mismanagement.With recent polls suggesting that climate change has begun to loom ominously for many Republicans as it does for the majority of Democrats, it may be time for big, bold, even alarmingly bipartisan thoughts. In the end, our need for clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, a climate that does not change too drastically and forests, oceans and wildlife that remain healthy and resilient has almost nothing to do with whether we are Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, and everything to do with being fellow residents of Planet Earth, with no place else to call home.

{"Headline": "How China Fell Off the Miracle Path", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR years now, Donald J. Trump has been sounding the alarm on China, calling it an economic bully that has been \u201ceating our lunch.\u201d The crux of Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep it cheap and give Chinese exports an unfair advantage. But that narrative is so last decade. China is now a threat to the United States not because it is strong but because it is fragile.Four key forces have been shaping the rise and fall of nations since the 2008 financial crisis, and none of them bode well for China. Debts have risen dangerously fast in the emerging world, especially in China. Trade growth has collapsed everywhere, a sharp blow to leading exporters, again led by China. Many countries are reverting to autocratic rule in an effort to fight the global slowdown, none more self-destructively than China. And, for reasons unrelated to the 2008 collapse, growth in the world\u2019s working-age population is slowing, and turned negative last year in China, depleting the work force.It will be difficult for any country to grow as rapidly as 6 percent, and all but impossible for China. Nevertheless, in an effort to exceed that target, Beijing is pumping debt into wasteful projects, and digging itself into a hole. The economy is now slowing and will decelerate further when the country is forced to reduce its debt burden, as inevitably it will be. The next step could be a deeper slowdown or even a financial crisis, which will have global repercussions because seven years of heavy stimulus have turned the world\u2019s second largest economy into a bloated giant.In Beijing, confidence has given way to a case of nerves. Local residents often sense trouble coming before foreign investors and are the first to flee before a crisis. Chinese moved a record $675 billion out of the country in 2015, some of it for purchases of foreign real estate. If China were eating America\u2019s lunch, its people would not be rushing to buy safe-haven apartments in New York or San Francisco. Far from conspiring to cheapen its currency, as Mr. Trump charges, Beijing is struggling to keep the weakening renminbi from falling more, which would further erode local confidence and make a crisis more likely.The seeds of China\u2019s current problems were planted in the months after the global economic crisis of 2008. When I visited Beijing in September of that year, just before the Wall Street implosion, the country\u2019s economy was slowing, but the city was calm. Beijing had hosted the Summer Olympics, and in preparation had temporarily shuttered smokestack industries and eased censorship. The skies were clear, the conversation much more candid than it is today.The nation had good reason to feel confident. Like Japan, South Korea and other Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economies, China had generated a long run of double-digit growth by investing in export industries. But Wen Jiabao, then prime minister, was not complacent. He was warning that after three decades of heavy industrialization, China was \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunbalanced,\u201d with too many factories belching too much smog. Many prominent Chinese recognized that with per-capita income rising above $8,000, their nation would face a natural slowdown, as Japan and South Korea had when they reached a similar middle-income level. Meanwhile, among outsiders, there was hopeful talk of how China would evolve into a democracy as it grew richer \u2014 again following the path of earlier Asian miracles.Then, two weeks after I left, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States, tipping the global economy into recession. Demand collapsed across the world, crushing export growth in China. The leadership in Beijing panicked, apparently fearing that if the recession reached its shores, social unrest would follow. Mr. Wen reversed course and doubled down on the old industrial model \u2014 fueling investment in factories with trillions in state lending and spending.At first, the bet appeared to work. In 2009, China managed once again to beat its longstanding growth target of 8 percent, as the West struggled to recover from its deep recession. The rapid spending unleashed by Beijing contrasted sharply with the relative gridlock in Washington and the global elite, gathering for their annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, in 2011, marveled at the benefits of state capitalism. China, they said, was proving that unchecked autocracies had an advantage in managing the economy, particularly in a crisis.But looking back, we can see that this was the moment China began to fall off the miracle path.As its debt mania progressed, more of the lending was diverted into wasteful speculation. Normally, frenzied borrowing occurs amid excitement about a new innovation like the internet. But this spree spread on conviction that Beijing, obsessed with hitting its growth target, would not let lenders or borrowers fail. More and more unqualified players got in the game. The state banks soon had to compete with \u201cshadow banks,\u201d including crowdfunding websites that offered ordinary people a chance to invest in debt for as little as one renminbi (15 cents), promising fantastic returns.Try as the Chinese authorities might to steer the money into industry, they could never fully commit to stopping shadow banks from financing an increasingly questionable array of borrowers speculating in real estate. When I visited Shanghai in August 2010, I was stunned to see apartment blocks rising two to three rows deep all along the 110-mile route to Hangzhou. Many of the biggest debtors are front companies set up by local governments to evade national regulators. Small cities are borrowing to build futuristic museums, aquatic centers and apartment blocks that exceed local demand and are often as empty as ghost towns.My research shows that during the 30 worst debt manias of the past 50 years, private debt \u2014 which in China is often held by local governments \u2014 rose over five years by at least 40 percentage points as a share of gross domestic product. In all 30 cases, the economy slowed sharply, typically by more than half, in the next five years.China\u2019s mania is now the largest ever in the postwar emerging world. After holding steady at around 150 percent of G.D.P. for much of the boom, China\u2019s public and private debts surged after Mr. Wen\u2019s about face in 2008, rising to 230 percent of G.D.P. by 2014. That 80-percentage-point increase is also more than three times the increase in the United States before its bubble collapsed in 2008. Since then, United States debt has held steady as a share of its economy. Though many Americans still think the nation is drowning in debt, its burden is much less worrisome than China\u2019s because it is not growing.Paradoxically, the authoritarian form of government that helped guide China to those years of economic growth may now be undermining its economic stability. My research suggests that compared with democracies, autocracies generate far more unstable growth, and that\u2019s the risk in China now. Looking at the available records going back to 1950 shows that extreme swings between fast and slow growth are much more common under autocratic regimes. On a list of 36 countries that have been whipsawed between rapid growth and recession throughout the postwar era, three out of four were autocracies.Because these governments face no check on their powers, they can force feed periods of strong growth. But they can also veer off in the wrong direction with no one to set them straight. In the early stages of China\u2019s boom under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing did what authoritarian governments do best, suppressing opposition to breakneck development, steering the people\u2019s savings toward building export factories and commandeering land to build the roads and bridges to bring the manufactured goods to market. But the same decision-making process, centralized in a small circle in Beijing, allowed the government to impulsively shift course in 2008 and push through the lending campaign that put China on the increasingly unstable path of more debt, and less growth.ON my recent trips to China, I keep looking for Beijing to snap back to reality, but in vain. As the economy grows more unstable, the authorities have tried to control the business cycle with an increasingly heavy hand that extends into its financial markets. In late 2014, hoping to give its struggling companies a new lift, Beijing began to praise buying stocks as a patriotic act. Millions of ordinary Chinese signed up to play the market for the first time, many unaided by a high school degree, and started borrowing to buy shares as prices rose. When the bubble burst last June, Beijing did not let it implode, as it had in 2008. It ordered people not to sell or even to speak critically of stocks. The market collapsed anyway.Afterward the Davos crowd finally started to question whether Beijing could simply command its economy to grow. It looked as if the lesson might be learned in China, too, but when I visited this April, authorities had begun a new stimulus campaign, and debt was still growing three times faster than the economy. Against this backdrop, residents spoke of dizzying price rises in Shanghai and Beijing real estate and in obscure markets like steel rebar futures. Their intention was to keep dancing until the borrowed money stopped flowing.The sputtering global economy is one shock away from slipping into recession. In the postwar period, every previous global recession started with a downturn in the United States, but the next one is likely to begin with a shock in China. Through heavy stimulus, China was the largest contributor to global growth this decade, but it is fragile. China\u2019s miracle growth period is over, and it now faces the curse of debt.Ruchir Sharma is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

{"Headline": "This Is Just the Start of the Brexit\u2019s Economic Disaster", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 A few weeks before Britons voted on whether to remain part of the European Union, Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign, was asked why he should be trusted over the overwhelming number of economists and international authorities who opposed Brexit. \u201cPeople in this country have had enough of experts,\u201d he replied.Experts are, of course, known to make mistakes. But in this case, the people who voted for Brexit will pay a big price for ignoring economic expertise. The harmful effects of this vote are both immediate and lasting.Britons are already worse off. The pound has \u2014 so far \u2014 plunged by nearly 9 percent against the dollar, slashing the value of British assets, with higher import prices likely to follow. The stock market has also taken a hit. The prices of property, most British people\u2019s main asset, are almost certain to fall, too. While Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has already pledged 250 billion pounds (about $345 billion) to support the financial system and has said he could offer more if necessary, central bankers cannot protect against an enduring economic shock.Rarely have businesses faced such uncertainty. Britain\u2019s economy had already slowed as they put investment decisions on hold ahead of the referendum. Now, a country renowned for its political and legal stability is descending into chaos. The future prime minister is unknown, as is the direction his or her policies will take. The favorite to replace David Cameron, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who opportunistically campaigned for Brexit, styles himself as pro-market and pro-globalization, but in the lead-up to the vote he said he supports curbs on European Union migration, tariffs on Chinese steel and higher public spending. The future terms on which Britain will trade with both the European Union and all the countries with which it has negotiated trade deals on Britain\u2019s behalf are uncertain. Domestic regulations on everything from finance to environmental protection may change.All that uncertainty is amplified by the prospect of a second referendum on Scottish independence, which may this time be won. In Northern Ireland, the political party Sinn Fein has already called for a referendum on a united Ireland.Faced with such uncertainty, businesses are likely to continue to put investments on hold. Consumers may pull back, too. The resulting downturn will cause the government\u2019s budget deficit, already large, to swell. The pound\u2019s depreciation, which might have been expected to boost exports, is unlikely to do much to cushion the blow. Its huge decline in 2008 failed to boost exports and Brexit will dent them.This unpredictable situation will not be brief. Once triggered, the formal process of leaving the European Union is supposed to take two years. But extricating the union\u2019s second-biggest economy from 43 years of European Union legislation is a daunting task.Negotiating a new trade relationship with the European Union is equally tricky. Britain seems certain to lose access to the single market \u2014 with which it does nearly half its trade \u2014 because this is conditional on accepting the free movement of people and contributing to the European Union\u2019s budget. (These were key issues for pro-Brexit voters.) That will jeopardize the foreign investment and good jobs predicated on single-market membership. Britain-based financial institutions will lose their rights to operate freely across the European Union.Brexit\u2019s supporters are deluded when they argue that Britain could cherry pick what it likes about the European Union and discard the rest. Since exports to the European Union (13 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) matter much more to Britain than exports to Britain (3 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) do to the European Union, the European Union will call the shots. Other governments have every incentive to be tough, both to steal a competitive advantage and to deter others from following Britain out the door.A fallback position is trading with Europe on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, as the United States does. But that entails tariffs on good exports \u2014 up to 10 percent on car exports, for example, most of which go to the European Union \u2014 as well as non-tariff barriers that gum up trade. It offers little access to Europe\u2019s markets in services, in which Britain specializes. Less open markets will stunt competition, crimping productivity growth and living standards.Brexit\u2019s supporters claim that a deregulated Britain that trades with the rest of the world would prosper once unshackled from Brussels\u2019s overregulation and protectionism. But Britain has the least regulated labor markets in the European Union and the second-least regulated product markets, so any potential benefits from deregulation are likely to be meager. Moreover, Britain is likely to end up with worse access to markets in the rest of the world. While it won\u2019t be hamstrung by protectionist interests in the European Union, its relatively smaller economy, largely open markets and desperation for new deals will weaken its clout in trade negotiations.The young, the higher educated and city dwellers, the most dynamic members of Britain\u2019s economy, voted to Remain. They were outvoted by the old, the less educated and non-urban English, who often rely on taxpayer largess. With economic opportunities stunted, everyone will suffer for Leave voters wrongly blaming hard-working, taxpaying European migrants for everything they dislike about modern Britain and wrongly trusting economic charlatans like Mr. Gove.Philippe Legrain is the author of \u201cEuropean Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics Are in a Mess and How to Put Them Right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s long enough to tell some tales to bolster your advice, and if it\u2019s written with enough soul, there\u2019s a good chance the recipient will keep it for a long time. Plus, it\u2019s a literal conversation piece, since the good letters will inspire more curiosity about how the writers oversee their own financial affairs.A good letter, according to Ms. Palmer, should include at least one story about a large financial challenge and another one about a big money triumph. Then, include a list of crucial habits and the tangible things they have helped the family achieve.Then, there was some variable life insurance. And an annuity. And an adviser who promoted a \u201cblack box\u201d investment strategy, as if that were a good thing.So better that their daughters avoid any such blunders from the beginning.In it, Mr. Spooner takes to its logical conclusion Ms. Shearer\u2019s advice about not understanding something: Don\u2019t trust the person who claims to be omniscient either.Kimberly Palmer, author of \u201cSmart Mom, Rich Mom: How to Build Wealth While Raising a Family,\u201d offers a template that parents or grandparents can use to pass on financial advice.In a chapter titled \u201cBeware of Genius,\u201d Mr. Spooner tells the story of an impenetrable Alan Greenspan speech he once heard. He instructs his grandchildren to consider the following hypothetical: \u201cIf someone cannot explain his economic concepts to you in several simple paragraphs, then you should view those concepts as probably being dangerous to your financial health.\u201dAs an investment adviser with the firm, he thought he knew it well enough. He had made plans to sell after any change in leadership. But the new chief executive liked him. \u201cWe can be blinded by flattery from the seats of power,\u201d he wrote to his grandchildren. \u201cBe aware of this in your business lives.\u201dSelling something that is still valuable is the hardest part of any trade, he added. So if you can\u2019t name three good reasons to continue owning something, he warned his grandchildren, then it\u2019s time to sell. In retrospect, he did not have three good ones, but he kept the stock anyway as it fell to $1 a share. (It had been above $55.) He held on to it as the stock rebounded and made some money buying shares of other blue-chip companies during the downturn.Another idea that I\u2019ll include in my own letter someday: You could just follow Ms. Shearer\u2019s lead and invest in a variety of index funds that own every stock in a particular market, thus avoiding this sort of concentrated stock risk.\u201cWhen Daddy and I first got married, we kept the roughest of notebooks and would sit down once a month and try to figure out what happened to our finances,\u201d she wrote. \u201cCommunication, and shared values/goals about money, are really important.\u201dWith the publication of their daughter\u2019s book, written correspondence may be among their biggest legacies. Mr. Palmer would leave a letter for the girls for each night he was away from home when they were growing up. The family eventually collected them in a bound volume.Ms. Shearer\u2019s money letter is now a public document, thanks to her daughter\u2019s own writing. If any of you have written or received your own money letters (or plan to write one now), I\u2019d love to see them and perhaps include them in a future article. You can upload them via a tool on our website.As part of Lesson No. 6, Ms. Shearer encouraged her daughters to read good personal advice books.

Many of them had already done various calculations, but now that the decision is real, a surfeit of new scenarios has emerged.Most of the war-gaming has been focused on the direct economic blow to Britain. But the catastrophe-shouting there has almost certainly been overly loud: Yes, Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer in the near term as the government reconstitutes and tries to negotiate its divorce with Europe. And yes, the pound will probably continue to lose value, and the uncertainty of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe will paralyze investment until new rules of engagement are put in place.All of which will makes markets around the world shudder, shrug and generally behave like petulant teenagers. \u201cStocks have entered a new realm of volatility, unlikely to abate anytime soon,\u201d according to a Wells Fargo research note issued on Monday. It warned, \u201cGet used to it.\u201dBut it would be wrong to focus exclusively on Britain when considering the possible financial ramifications and permutations. In a truly dire scenario, Britain is just the leading domino. It\u2019s the next dominoes \u2014 most likely across the Channel \u2014 that matter more.\u201cWe see Brexit as just one step in a process that is unavoidable of further referendums by other nations to exit the E.U.,\u201d Felix Zulauf, an investor who operates a hedge fund in Switzerland, wrote in a note on Monday, contending that \u201cthe damage\u201d of Brexit \u201cwill therefore be far worse for the E.U. than for the U.K.\u201dOf far greater concern will be if other European Union countries attempt their own exits \u2014 even if their efforts are unsuccessful. More glimmers of no-confidence among nations in the consortium could ultimately lead to a crisis that would be felt far beyond Europe.Consider this: Italy\u2019s government is considering pumping as much as $45 billion into its banking system after the Brexit vote. Shares of the biggest Italian banks have fallen more than 20 percent since the results of the vote were announced. And Italian banks are considered particularly vulnerable because they hold hundreds of billions of euros in bad loans. If Brexit forces a material economic slowdown across the Continent, Italy\u2019s banks \u2014 without a rescue plan \u2014 could significantly suffer.Remember: There\u2019s no need to panic now, at least not yet. But if, down the line, Italy\u2019s economy were to falter and help from the European Union was not forthcoming without tough conditions \u2014 remember Greece and the possibility of Grexit? \u2014 we could witness the seceding of Italy, which will be the third-largest member of the consortium after Germany and France (assuming that Britain does officially leave).That, in turn, could lead to a true catastrophe: Italy would probably be forced to return to the lira, which would most likely be tremendously devalued. An unstable lira would cause huge problems for investors and banks across the globe that have interests in Italy, as well as a massive credit crunch within the country. (By the way, you could replace \u201cItaly\u201d with \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cPortugal\u201d in this scenario and end up in much the same place.)Long before then, however, there is a decent chance that we will see another country \u2014 probably the Netherlands \u2014 try to make a run for it. After Britain voted to break away from the European Union, Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the Netherlands\u2019 surging anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, posted on Twitter, \u201cHurray for the British.\u201d He added: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. It\u2019s time for a Dutch referendum.\u201d He used this hashtag: #ByeByeEU.The Netherlands is a relatively healthy country, so \u2014 as a matter of pure economics \u2014 the repercussions of its leaving the European Union would most likely be muted. But if Brexit wasn\u2019t enough of an inspiration for other fiercely nationalistic and economically healthy countries to seek an exit, watching a place like the Netherlands that actually uses the euro (unlike Britain, which never switched from the pound) could prove to be a convincing model.Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has already predicted that several countries will leave the European Union within the next five years, which is increasingly becoming the conventional wisdom. Given the low growth of so many countries in the union, it is hard to imagine that a populistic revolt won\u2019t emerge.\u201cThe global economy remains stuck in a deflationary expansion of minimal growth and minimal rates,\u201d Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to investors on Monday. \u201cAnd electorates are increasingly voting in the developed world against wage deflation, high unemployment, immigration and inequality.\u201dJames Pethokoukis, a commentator at the American Enterprise Institute, recently found a memorandum written in 2011 during the euro crisis by Willem Buiter, the global chief economist at Citigroup, that imagined the destruction of the European Union. \u201cA breakup of the Euro Area would be rather like the movie \u2018War of the Roses\u2019 version of a divorce: disruptive, destructive and without any winners,\u201d he wrote, describing how \u201ceven a partial one involving the exit of one or more fiscally and competitively weak countries, would be chaotic.\u201dHere\u2019s what would happen: \u201cExit, partial or full, would likely be precipitated by disorderly sovereign defaults in the fiscally weak and uncompetitive member states, whose currencies would weaken dramatically and whose banks would fail,\u201d Mr. Buiter wrote at the time. \u201cIf Spain and Italy were to exit, there would be a collapse of systemically important financial institutions throughout the European Union and North America and years of global depression.\u201dFor now, let\u2019s hope these worst-case scenarios are just that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In American Markets, Panic Begins to Subside", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byThe market panic that initially met Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union showed signs of subsiding on Monday.While stocks continued to slide for a second trading day, by the close of business Monday a measure of calm appeared to be returning to certain significant corners of the market.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was stable for most of the day after dropping around 2 percent in the first minutes of trading. It ended the day down 1.8 percent. Markets in Japan and China finished Monday in positive territory.A gauge of expected future volatility in the markets, the so-called VIX, fell on Monday after spiking on Friday, and remained far below the level it reached last summer when problems in the Chinese economy came to the fore.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting contagion here,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, based in Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty well insulated,\u201d he said of the American economy.The outlook was less sanguine in Europe.Investors continued dumping European stocks and seeking out the safety of gold and bonds on Monday, despite comments from British and European officials intended to calm markets.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke for the first time since the so-called Brexit vote, before markets opened on Monday. He said that while Britain\u2019s public finances would be affected by an exit from the bloc, the broader economy was still in good shape.\u201cOur economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cIt is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.\u201d\u201cWe were prepared for the unexpected,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are equipped for whatever happens.\u201dBut Mr. Osborne\u2019s comments appeared to do little to shore up the nation\u2019s currency. The British pound fell on Monday to its lowest level against the dollar since the 1980s.In another blow to the British economy, the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency announced on Monday that it was stripping Great Britain of its AAA rating. The country\u2019s rating was dropped two notches, to AA.Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts said in their report that the vote last week \u201cwill weaken the predictability, stability, and effectiveness of policy making in the U.K. and affect its economy, G.D.P. growth and fiscal and external balances.\u201dThere is still enormous uncertainty about how exactly Britain\u2019s exit will play out, and how it will ripple through the economy. The most obvious victims are likely to be the big European banks, which have relied on an ability to operate easily across borders.Trading in financial stocks like Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland was briefly suspended on Monday because of precipitous declines.Barclays fell 17 percent on Monday on top of its 17 percent decline on Friday. That brought the bank\u2019s stock below the bottom it reached during the 2011 eurozone crisis, though it remained far above the trough reached during the financial crisis.\u201cBanks are one of the most exposed sectors to Brexit,\u201d Andrew Coombs, a Citigroup analyst, said in a research note distributed on Monday.He noted that British banks were particularly vulnerable \u201cgiven the likely headwinds of a deteriorating domestic economy, and higher risk premia associated with a less predictable political and economic landscape.\u201dBut, he warned, \u201cthe European investment banks are also not immune, with sizable operations in London, which may now need to be reviewed.\u201dItalian officials said on Monday that they were looking at creating what amounted to a bailout fund to help struggling banks in the country.Throughout Europe, however, investors have not been assuming the worst \u2014 they seem to have reserved their harshest punishment so far for bank stocks. By contrast, a broad index of European shares, the Euro Stoxx, fell 2.8 percent on Monday but was still above the lows it reached earlier this year.In the United States, the S.&P. 500-stock index finished down 1.8 percent, or 36.87 points, at 2,000.54 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent, or 260.51 points, to 17,140.24. The Nasdaq composite was down 2.4 percent, or 113.54 points, to 4,594.44.Some economists said that the turmoil in Europe could slightly stunt American growth. Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that they had reduced their estimates for American economic growth in the second half of 2016, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent.But other analysts were far more optimistic. Pantheon Macroeconomics said on Monday that it still anticipated American economic growth to gain steam this year, driven by improving consumer confidence.For American investors, the biggest fallout from the British vote may be the influence that it has on the Federal Reserve and its plans for raising interest rates in the economy.Traders were betting on Monday that the Fed would have to keep rates lower for longer, which could help stimulate the economy. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was supposed to attend a meeting of central bank chiefs this week in Portugal, but she called that off after the British vote last week.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting on Monday with officials from the nation\u2019s central bank and Finance Ministry to discuss how to contain the fallout from the vote in Britain, which pummeled markets in Japan and elsewhere on Friday.Japan was hit especially hard. The Nikkei suffered its biggest one-day point drop in 16 years and the yen jumped about 5 percent against the dollar.On Monday, Japanese authorities issued their strongest warning yet that they were prepared to intervene in the market to curb the rise of the yen. Markets elsewhere in the region were mostly little changed. Japan, however, generally fears an excessively strong currency, which can hurt the country\u2019s economy by making its exports more expensive and consequently less competitive.\u201cThere is still uncertainty and risk in the financial markets, and it\u2019s important that we continue to work for stability,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters after a meeting at the prime minister\u2019s office.He added that he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to \u201ccoordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose on Monday. It rose 2.4 percent, not 2.9 percent.David Jolly, Prashant S. Rao and Jonathan Soble contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "The industry argued that a hedge fund manager\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job was to protect in down years and not outperform in good years, but when hedge fund returns fell with the markets last summer, the point was moot. Some of the best-known managers, including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management, have lost money. The company that results from the merger will combine the traditional antivirus product that has been Symantec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus with Blue Coat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new online protection services. Executives see little overlap between the two businesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dan Schulman, Symantec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman, said in a news release. Blue Coat had filed plans to go public and did not formally put itself up for sale, but it received interest from potential buyers and held talks primarily with Symantec. The prospectus for its initial public offering said that Blue Coat lost $289 million on top of $598 million in sales for the 12 months ending April 30. But the company has been trying to expand under Bain Capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis represented a compelling opportunity for us because we could realize some gains for our investors but also reinvest into the combined company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital. Brooke Buchanan, a representative for Theranos, said the company would continue to do business using the stand-alone retail locations it already runs, apart from the Walgreens stores. It has five such locations in Arizona and one in California, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has rejected Theranos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best interests to terminate our partnership,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brad Fluegel, senior vice president of Walgreens, said in a news release. The 40 blood-draw sites inside Walgreens stores in Arizona were a primary source of revenue for Theranos, as well as mark of credibility. Having easily accessible locations in corner drugstores was part of Theranos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grand plan to upend the laboratory testing business. For its part, Walgreens had hoped to add lab testing to increase traffic to stores and pick up some of the cachet of being associated with a cutting-edge Silicon Valley start-up.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 a Splitting Hangover for the City of London", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Luke Hickmore had an aperitif Thursday night, watched the early results on Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and went to bed. He didn\u2019t sleep long.Mr. Hickmore, 46, helps oversee $13.7 billion for Aberdeen Asset Management, a global investment firm. He switched on his TV at 3:30 a.m., and said he thought, \u201cHang on a sec, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go the way the market priced in.\u201dThe financial district stretches from the stately offices of hedge funds in Mayfair to Canary Wharf, where glass-and-steel bank headquarters have replaced abandoned docks. But its heart, Britain\u2019s version of Wall Street, is known as the City of London or simply \u201cthe City,\u201d referring to roughly a square mile where you can find the old walls of Londinium, the city built by the Romans.Brexit is on everyone\u2019s mind, as bankers absorb a second Big Bang as profound as the one three decades ago \u2014 though one without a road map forward.After the tumult of Friday, bankers, traders and other finance types could be found at the Pavilion End, a City pub in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. A group stood outside the pub, as is the custom in London when the weather allows. Some had their jackets off, white dress shirts and suit trousers with ties, and held pints of beer as they pondered where the City\u2019s jobs might move. Paris. Amsterdam. Frankfurt seemed the most likely. But few seemed excited about the prospect of living there.\u201cThere\u2019s no confidence; it\u2019s been shredded,\u201d said Andrew Towill, 28, one of four employees of a multinational real estate consultancy who were also standing outside the Pavilion End.Anna Benjamin, 50, said not much was different on Friday in their business \u201cbecause we\u2019re dealing with projects that are ongoing. But there is a definite feeling that once they start coming to an end, where is the next one coming from?\u201dJohn Lowes, 35, said there was a general \u201cfeeling of real concern.\u201d\u201cNow what happens? We just don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.The group worried about returning to the kind of conditions they faced during the financial crisis.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Robert Harper, 37, said. \u201cThere were times when I had nothing to do.\u201dAs with every financial shock, there are winners and losers.Many of the less well-to-do will suffer. While older voters led the charge for Brexit, the value of their pensions took a hit along with the British stock market and economy.Executives described a tense night on trading floors. At Goldman Sachs, there was activity on the London floor throughout the night, with TVs blaring referendum returns. In a note to JPMorgan Chase employees, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the firm \u201cprocessed 1,000 trading tickets per second at one point,\u201d many times the typical trading volume. The chief executive at Citigroup in New York, Michael Corbat, personally walked the trading floor, a relatively rare move for a Wall Street chief these days.It will take days and months to sift through the ramifications for the markets and the City, as Britain negotiates its post-Brexit relationships and global financial firms figure out their next steps. The aftermath of a Leave vote was predictable in many ways, unforeseen in others.Earlier this week, at a conference, Andrew Jackson, chief investment officer at Cairn Capital, a London-based firm, was asked about the best way to prepare for a possible Brexit vote.Much further, it turned out. RBS fell 18 percent on Friday, Barclays 17.9 percent and Lloyds Banking Group 21 percent.Many hedge funds stayed on the sidelines heading into the referendum, looking to pounce in the aftermath.\u201cIt is early to tell, but there will be very few that have done exceedingly well or exceedingly badly,\u201d said Anthony Lawler, an executive at GAM, an investment management firm that oversees portfolios of hedge funds for institutional clients.Many investors, he said, preferred voting on probabilities, not binary yes-or-no outcomes. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a massive sudden move, that\u2019s very difficult to trade.\u201dMr. Hickmore said he had already reduced risk by moving away from bets that bond yields would go higher.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold that choice through a U.K. referendum vote like this, because the risk of you being wrong is so high,\u201d he said.Bets were being made, however. The pound rallied sharply Thursday as polls indicated a vote to remain in the European Union, only to collapse starting late Thursday night, well before the official results were announced.Mr. Odey, who declined to comment, has long supported a Brexit vote. After suffering losses in his portfolio earlier this year, his faith in Brexit paid off.\u201cI would rather we were out of Europe,\u201d Mr. Odey said in an interview in 2014, adding then that it was a \u201cprobably a protest vote.\u201dBack in the City, some less-celebrated finance types, cramped outside a dark pub called Ye Olde Watling, contemplated an uncertain future. One wondered aloud whether he could still build a career in London. With the prospect of Frankfurt in the air, another joked that he was giving German lessons now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silence and Sobs as Parliament Honors Jo Cox, Slain British Lawmaker", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byAs legislators from all parties sat together on the green leather benches and stood intermingled in the aisles \u2014 rather than divided by party affiliation as usual \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron called on them to honor Ms. Cox, 41, by \u201cuniting against the hatred that killed her.\u201dJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, to which Ms. Cox belonged, said that \u201cwe need a kinder, gentler politics.\u201d\u201cWe all have a responsibility, in this House and beyond, not to whip up hatred and sow division,\u201d he added.The loss of the energetic and popular Ms. Cox, who was elected in May last year, was a special blow to the Labour Party. \u201cWe have lost one of our own, and society as a whole has lost one of our very best,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said.Parliament had been in recess as the nation prepared for the referendum on Thursday, but members were summoned back to Westminster after the killing of Ms. Cox on a street in Birstall, a town in her district in West Yorkshire. Her husband, Brendan Cox, her children, 3 and 5, her sister and her parents were in the gallery to listen to the tributes.Mr. Cameron called Ms. Cox \u201ca loving, determined, passionate and progressive politician who epitomized the best of humanity and who proved so often the power of politics to make our world a better place.\u201dThe prime minister said he had first met Ms. Cox in 2006 in the Darfur region of Sudan.

Her decision to receive him \u201chad not been entirely welcome,\u201d Mr. Cameron said to gentle laughter, but \u201cit was typical of her determination to reach across party lines on issues that she felt were so much more important than party politics.\u201dMr. Cameron added: \u201cWe express our anger at the sickening and despicable attack that killed her as she did her job, serving her constituents on the streets of Birstall.\u201dEchoing the sentiment of others, he said her legacy must be a politics of \u201chope not fear, respect not hate, unity not division.\u201dMr. Kinnock hit out at a poster calling for Britain to leave the European Union that showed a line of refugees under the headline \u201cBreaking Point.\u201d Ms. Cox, who favored remaining in the bloc, \u201cwould have responded with outrage and with robust rejection of the calculated narrative of cynicism, division and despair that it represents,\u201d he said.Markets have been jittery as polls have fluctuated, but, on Monday, the pound surged against the dollar, and stocks in Europe rose, as traders took note of new polls suggesting a shift in momentum toward remaining in the union.Also on Monday, the man accused of killing Ms. Cox confirmed to a London court by video link from Belmarsh prison, in southeastern London, that he was Thomas Mair, 52. Wearing a gray tracksuit, he sat with his arms folded. On Saturday, when charged and asked his name, he had answered: \u201cMy name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\u201dMr. Mair did not apply for bail and has not yet entered a plea, his lawyer said, and he will remain in custody. He faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offense and possession of an offensive weapon. Another hearing in his case has been scheduled for Thursday, the day of the referendum.Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is \u2018Brexit\u2019 Europe\u2019s Lehman Brothers Moment?", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byAftershocksIs this another Lehman Brothers moment?The short answer is \u201cno.\u201dThe long answer is \u201cno, but.\u201dLehman was a financial event with long-lasting geopolitical consequences. \u201cBrexit\u201d is a geopolitical event that may or may not turn out to have long-lasting financial consequences.The most fundamental similarity between Britain\u2019s vote and the Lehman failure is that both were deep shocks to markets and upended the understanding that investors, banks and policy makers had about the way the world worked.In 2008, the widespread view was that the United States government would not allow a large, interconnected financial firm to go bankrupt, and that Lehman would be bailed out just as Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae were. In 2016, the assumption was that while Britain might threaten to leave the European Union, its voters would never actually choose such a disruptive path.So in both cases, an event prompted a reordering of what we thought was plausible. In 2008 it went like this: If the United States would let Lehman fail, could Goldman Sachs and Citigroup be the next dominoes to fall? If an investment bank like Lehman could default, could any financial firm really be trusted?And Lehman Brothers had $619 billion in liabilities, which by definition were somebody else\u2019s assets. Who knew for sure what other banks were sitting on huge losses from Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy that would make them insolvent?Against that backdrop, banks globally hoarded cash and became highly reluctant to lend to anyone. It was a modern version of a bank run.There are few signs any of that is happening in response to Brexit. European bank stocks have fallen sharply since the June 23 vote. They\u2019ve actually fallen by a larger percentage than during the first three trading days after the Lehman declaration. But nothing in the bank lending markets suggests widespread panic.In the three trading days after the Lehman bankruptcy announcement, the premium banks charged to lend to one another in dollars rose by about half a percentage point. A comparable measure of the health of the British banking system has risen only 0.08 percent since Brexit, and actually was down Tuesday. The spread has risen even less in euro-denominated bank lending.That\u2019s good news. It suggests investors think that profits by banks will get hammered by Brexit \u2014 but not that this will endanger their very solvency.Banks may be facing huge costs as they weigh whether to relocate operations from London to continental Europe. Investors will find uncertainty around their businesses and leaner profits as central banks potentially cut interest rates further. But collectively, it appears that investors believe that banks will weather the storm, or at least that governments won\u2019t let them fail.So the mechanisms of financial contagion that turned the collapse of the fourth-largest American investment bank into a global crisis just don\u2019t seem to be gearing up. And that is reflected even in the most widely followed markets. Yes, the British pound is down sharply on currency markets. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is down only 4.5 percent, and is still above its levels from as recently as March.But if financial contagion doesn\u2019t appear to be a grave threat, political contagion does.The modern global economy is built on the notion of a free flow of trade, capital and people among the major advanced nations of Europe, North America and Asia. The European Union has been a key vehicle through which that modern order has evolved.Britain\u2019s E.U. exit won\u2019t by itself change that, and even British advocates of leaving the trading bloc say that they want continued good relations, trade and otherwise, with Europe. Things might work out just fine, with perhaps a more inward-focused Britain but no other major changes to this global financial and economic order.But if this is just a first step toward raising much higher walls between the major powers of Europe \u2014 if countries like France, Spain, Italy and even Germany retreat inward and build distrust that rips at that order?It will make Lehman seem like a historical asterisk.In September 2008, no one predicted that the Lehman bankruptcy could lead to a Greek sovereign debt crisis that would halt half a century of progress toward European unity. The risk with Brexit is, similarly, not in the consequences we know, but in the ones that we don\u2019t know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Not-So-Obvious Things to Consider When Deciding to Buy or Rent", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byReal EstateWhether to buy or rent a home is among the biggest financial decisions most of us make. It is basically a complex math problem in which the reward for getting it right can be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 and the punishment for getting it wrong similarly enormous.These dimensions have inherent but hard-to-calculate value. They have to do with how owning a home lets you stop worrying about rent increases, forces you to save money and gives you certain tax benefits, and on the flip side, how renting means you don\u2019t have to worry about the unpredictable costs of maintaining a home. Anyone trying to make a housing decision should at least think about them a bit before taking, or not taking, the plunge.Suppose you live in a city that you find desirable and could envision living in for a very long time. Suppose you work in a field in which you can\u2019t plausibly expect your income to rise significantly in the decades ahead.That makes a case for buying over renting.The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.Buying a home is a way of locking in an affordable place to live, essentially an insurance policy against escalating rents. If you rent, you are forever at risk of your region\u2019s becoming newly popular, attracting an influx of people and high-paying jobs that drives up your cost of living beyond what your income can support.Of course, your region may not be one of those new boom areas, in which case this insurance policy would prove unnecessary; you could even end up in a place with falling rents and home values, like Detroit in the last couple of decades. But that\u2019s the nature of insurance: You may pay for it but turn out not to need it.Oh, and some places have rent control laws that might protect a long-term renter. But keep in mind, those laws can always be changed \u2014 and they can create inflexibility, making it impossible to move to a more suitable home in the same location without seeing a steep rise in rent.How much is this insurance policy worth? If taken to an extreme, it could lead you to make bad decisions. During the housing boom at the middle of the last decade, people used \u201cIf I don\u2019t buy now, I won\u2019t be able to afford to buy tomorrow\u201d as a rationale to overpay for homes.Two factors that might help shape your decision:How disruptive would it be for you to move somewhere else? The more disruptive, the more you should value this insurance against higher rents.How freely does your city allow new home building? Rents are less likely to increase sharply if the housing supply can rise to meet new demand.Sometimes people say that renting is \u201cjust throwing money away,\u201d which is a little misleading. You could just as easily say that when you buy a home, the mortgage interest and property taxes you pay are throwing money away.But that line of thinking does get one dimension of home buying right: When you buy a home with a standard mortgage, you gradually pay off the balance \u2014 slowly at first, faster as time goes on. Someone who takes out a $500,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4 percent has paid down about $8,000 of debt after one year, and $47,000 after five years.In terms of a personal balance sheet, less debt is equivalent to more savings \u2014 assuming the value of the home is stable or rising. People who buy houses while in their early 30s with a 30-year mortgage and stay in it will own a valuable asset free and clear when they hit retirement age. They could either live rent- or mortgage-payment free during retirement, or sell the house, move somewhere cheaper and have a nice pile of cash savings.Theoretically, one could construct the same strategy while renting, putting money away into a savings or investment account while paying a landlord for a place to live. The beauty of owning is that it happens automatically, by virtue of paying your mortgage. That means less temptation to spend the money instead of saving in a given month; you can get access to it through a home-equity loan, but that requires making the active effort of going to a bank.So if, psychologically, you find it hard to save and are always tempted to take a vacation rather than plow money into a brokerage account, buying a house with borrowed money is a way to trick yourself into doing so and help ensure you have a meaningful net worth when retirement rolls around.Suppose you had plenty of cash and were trying to decide whether to buy a home outright, or invest most of the money in stocks and bonds and use some of it to pay rent on a home.At first glance, renting might make sense. The stock market, for example, has a higher return than real estate historically, so in theory that portfolio could pay the rent and keep growing rapidly.But a quirk of the tax code tends to obliterate that advantage. When you invest money in financial assets, you have to pay taxes on the returns they offer \u2014 the interest paid by corporate bonds, for example, or the dividends from stocks, or the capital gains when you sell either for a profit.When you buy a home for your own use, the return it pays you \u2014 namely, giving you a place to live, not interest or dividend payments \u2014 is tax free. This is what economists call \u201cimputed rent,\u201d and it is one of the subtle advantages to buying that is hard to account for in standard buy versus rent analysis.It\u2019s a little more complicated if you buy a home using a mortgage, but the same dynamic applies. Your down payment could earn a fully taxable return as an investment, but give you a tax-free return \u2014 free rent \u2014 if used to buy a home.That\u2019s not the end of the favorable tax treatment, though. If you buy a portfolio of stocks and then sell them at a profit 10 years later, you pay capital gains tax on every dollar of what you made. But when selling a primary residence at a profit, the first $250,000 in profits for a single person and first $500,000 for a married couple is tax free.The home mortgage interest deduction gets a lot of attention as a distortion of the tax code that makes home buying more attractive, but these more subtle dimensions can be just as significant.These have all been quirks of homeownership that tilt the economics in favor of buying. But here\u2019s an important one that points in the other direction.Both renters and homeowners pay costs for maintenance on their properties; they just do so in different ways with very different implications.If you rent and the dishwasher breaks, your landlord is on the hook to repair or replace it. You may ultimately pay the bill in the sense that expected maintenance costs are built into the rent you pay, but you have no risk of that number varying depending on luck.Homeowners, on the other hand, face not a set monthly payment covering the costs of repairs and maintenance, but a great deal of volatility.An urgent $2,000 air-conditioner repair bill, or even a $15,000 roof repair, might arise at any time. Other things, like replacing a shabby carpet or applying a fresh coat of paint, allow the homeowner more control over when the transaction happens, but still, it\u2019s a lumpy pattern of expenditures.Most rent versus buy calculators ask users to put in an estimate of monthly maintenance costs for the home they would purchase. But the issue is not the expected average of those costs but the possibility of their lumpiness and unpredictability. That can be especially problematic for a person who empties savings to buy a home only to need to pay for an expensive repair a few months later.None of these factors alone should be decisive, and the basics that you plug into online calculators \u2014 like the monthly mortgage payment, rent on a comparable place and closing costs \u2014 are more important. But when it\u2019s a close call, weighing these factors carefully \u2014 and how much they apply in your particular case \u2014 can help you make a smarter housing decision.The continuation of a cover article this weekend about deciding whether to buy a home or rent appears twice in some copies, on Pages 12 and 13.

{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers\u2019 Wages Rebound, While Wall Street Squirms", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesWall Street hasn\u2019t had much to cheer about lately. But there are some signs that rank-and-file workers do.Where the economy is heading now isn\u2019t clear. But consider the overall picture since the recession ended in 2009. Until about a year ago, big businesses and investors prospered, despite extremely slow economic growth, while wages for most employees languished.As the Federal Reserve and other central banks pumped out money, corporations racked up handsome profits, and those fortunate enough to hold shares in big companies made fortunes. If you had invested $10,000 in a Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fund at the end of February 2009, it would have more than tripled by the end of last year, including dividends.Rising corporate profits provided fuel for the sizzling stock market. By the fourth quarter of 2011, pretax corporate profits reached 14.5 percent of national income, the highest level since 1950, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data compiled by Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher.What was good for business wasn\u2019t great for workers, however. By 2012, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie had dropped to the lowest level since 1951, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, found. Companies bolstered profits by cutting costs \u2014 including the cost of labor \u2014 and they got away with it because unemployment was high and jobs were scarce.Almost imperceptibly, the recovery entered a new stage. Over the last year or so, conditions appeared to have changed \u2014 for business, investors and workers.For many rank-and-file workers, the labor market improved significantly, even if the gains have been uneven. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent from 5 percent in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, a bright spot in a report filled mainly with grim numbers. For example, job creation slackened sharply, with a net gain of a mere 38,000 jobs. But the report also confirmed that hourly wages have been rising, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the year.On Wednesday, in the survey known as the \u201cbeige book,\u201d the Federal Reserve reported that \u201ctight labor markets were widely noted,\u201d and pay raises were \u201cconcentrated in areas of labor tightness.\u201dPurchasing power for many workers has finally climbed back to prerecession levels. By March, using inflation-adjusted figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that median weekly wages had at last surpassed their 2009 peak.Mr. Bivens cautioned that the real-wage improvement last year was at least partly because of unusually low inflation, and not entirely because of monetary wage increases. Oil, gas and other commodity prices plummeted last year, making wage growth, after adjusting for inflation, look relatively high. \u201cIt\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not clear whether that growth rate for real wages is sustainable,\u201d he said.Still, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie has unquestionably been growing, though it hasn\u2019t regained the prerecession levels of 2007. Reaching that modest goal will require further economic growth. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly making headway, but we have a while to go before I\u2019d say conditions were normal,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.On the other hand, from the standpoint of corporate executives and stock market investors, conditions have worsened considerably over the last year. The market has struggled to hold its own. The S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t reached a new peak since May 2015. Corporate profits, which had supported the long bull market in stocks, have been weak. In the first quarter of 2016, earnings declined 5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimated.On Tuesday, Mr. Yardeni summarized the year this way: \u201cLabor compensation is up 5 percent while profits are down 5.8 percent. Workers finally may be gaining income share as the labor market has tightened, boosting both employment and hourly pay. This development is squeezing profit margins.\u201dRising incomes spurred consumer spending, which grew in April at its fastest rate since 2014. Inflation remains very low but has been rising. Investors are betting that on the heels of the latest jobs report, the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise interest rates this month.Further wage increases and a sustained uptick in inflation could induce the Fed to act later on. But unless such developments are accompanied by much stronger economic growth, neither workers nor businesses nor investors are likely to celebrate very loudly.An article last Sunday about signs of rising wages as the labor market tightens misspelled the surname of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s director of research and policy, who tracks wage trends. He is Josh Bivens, not Bevins.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Credit Suisse Chief Contends With Rising Tensions, and a Sinking Stock", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byAnother downturn in the stock price of Credit Suisse has put Tidjane Thiam, the bank\u2019s embattled chief executive, on the defensive \u2014 again.On Friday, Mr. Thiam sent employees a memorandum that said hedge funds were betting against shares of Credit Suisse \u2014 taking the view that Mr. Thiam would have to raise more capital from investors. Credit Suisse officials say the chief executive regularly sends updates to employees.Mr. Thiam called these concerns unfounded and said they were a reflection of how market conditions have become difficult for Credit Suisse and other European banks.Since he took over last summer as chief executive at Credit Suisse \u2014 which has large operations in New York and London \u2014 its stock has sunk by over 50 percent. Last week, it touched a new low of 11.8 Swiss francs, or about $12.25.Mr. Thiam has been forceful and blunt in describing how the bank\u2019s previous model of relying on riskier, capital-intensive trading and banking businesses needed to be revised. Instead, he has said, the focus should be on providing a range of financial services to wealthy clients in fast-growing emerging markets.But the chief executive\u2019s brusque manner and a perception among bankers that he is not subjecting himself to the same sacrifices that he is asking of them has created tension within the bank \u2014 made worse by the stock\u2019s continuing slump.In his memo, Mr. Thiam said that in the next month he would be embarking on a trip that would include stops in New York, London and Singapore, to meet with clients and investors to talk about his plans for the bank.In that vein, he met last week in Zurich with one of his largest investors, David Herro of Harris Associates, which owns nearly 10 percent of Credit Suisse.Mr. Herro said in an interview that he saw Mr. Thiam as part of a broader tour of the other companies that his mutual fund owns in Europe, but added that they did have a discussion about the new strategy, which Mr. Herro endorsed.\u201cI think he is absolutely right in what he is doing, and you don\u2019t alter it just because people are wailing,\u201d Mr. Herro said. \u201cIf a trader makes money, they get a bonus \u2014 if they lose, the shareholder bites it. These changes have been long overdue.\u201dAs he has done in meetings with investors and clients, Mr. Thiam has blamed upset investment bankers for a negative environment, and he has said repeatedly that he will not backtrack as a result of their complaints.In his memo, though, Mr. Thiam did strive to strike a positive tone in terms of the effort to turn around the global markets division. \u201cSignificant progress with the accelerated restructuring, not only in terms of de-risking and cost reduction but also in reinvigorating our client franchise,\u201d he wrote.Nevertheless, Mr. Herro did say that it is important for Mr. Thiam to do better in terms of getting his message across internally. \u201cIf change is going to happen, it has to be done with good communication and empathy toward employees,\u201d he said.Mr. Herro said in the interview that he saw no need for Credit Suisse to raise new funds. \u201cWith the cash generation they have now, their capital position is fine,\u201d he said.More than most investment banks, Credit Suisse relies on company stock to compensate employees.There are few analysts or investors who think that Mr. Thiam is mistaken in his strategy, which is in line with what other banks in Europe are doing.But even his biggest supporters have started to express some concern that he could be doing a better job communicating his message \u2014 unpleasant as it may be \u2014 to his employees.And while the board has recently said that it supports Mr. Thiam, directors have also been asked numerous questions by shareholders about Mr. Thiam\u2019s ability to push through difficult changes in light of his poor relationship with bankers in the global markets division.A recent report by Switzerland\u2019s central bank found that Credit Suisse and its larger rival, UBS, would each need to raise another 10 billion Swiss francs in capital to meet stringent new bank safety rules being put in place in Switzerland.Mr. Thiam has rejected speculation that the bank\u2019s losses are escalating and that the bank would need to go to investors once again for a fresh round of cash.Last fall, Mr. Thiam raised about $6 billion, or 6 billion Swiss francs, from the market at a price in the low $20s per share. Coming to investors again for cash, so soon after the first effort and with the stock trading at current levels, would be difficult for Mr. Thiam, analysts and investors say.Since hitting a low, the stock has recovered somewhat in recent days, and it closed trading on Monday at 12.83 Swiss francs.Advertisement"}

So Mr. Espirito Santo had to jump through even more hoops than the typical Manhattan renter.Even in a city where residents constantly come and go, most landlords rarely agree to leases of less than a year. This has become a problem for recent graduates who are having trouble landing permanent jobs and do not want to commit for 12 months.AdvertisementIn December, Mr. Caputo took Mr. Espirito Santo to see some studio apartments with six-month leases.

{"Headline": "Nearly All U.S. Banks Pass Fed\u2019s Stress Test", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byAll but one of the nation\u2019s largest banks earned an unconditional passing grade from federal regulators on their annual stress tests, which measure their preparedness to weather a financial crisis.The one American-based institution that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank that has been struggling to regain its footing after the financial crisis of 2008. Regulators raised concerns over the company\u2019s internal controls and processes.The Federal Reserve gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander, which both failed in previous years.The banking stress tests \u2014 which measure whether banks have enough capital and liquidity, management controls and other necessary safeguards to survive various worst-case situations \u2014 have been required of banks with more than $50 billion in assets since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which took effect in 2010.The passing grades mean that all of the big banks \u2014 even Morgan Stanley \u2014 will be able to pay dividends and buy back stock from shareholders.On Wednesday, a Fed official said that even with the concerns raised, the stress test results suggest that banks would be able to withstand an event like Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, which has rocked bank stocks over the last week.Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to create large capital barriers to cushion against losses from a recession or market shock. While the financial system has not encountered any problems close to the mortgage losses of 2008, banks have been able to withstand more recent challenges like the steep drop in oil prices and the turmoil in Europe.While tougher capital requirements may be helping to stabilize the banks, they are hampering profitability. The stock prices of many large banks have languished as investors question whether these companies can increase their profits substantially in such a stringent new regulatory environment.The stress test results announced Wednesday are no doubt a welcome relief, in particular, to Bank of America and Citigroup, which have had difficulty passing the test unconditionally in past years. Both banks have spent tens of millions of dollars and assigned some of their top executives to the task of ensuring that they gain the Fed\u2019s approval.Shortly after the results were made public, Citigroup announced that it would more than triple its dividend, to 16 cents from 5 cents, and buy back as much as $8.6 billion of stock. Bank of America said it would increase its dividend to 7.5 cents from 5 cents and purchase $5 billion in shares.The one American-based bank that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley. The Fed also gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank and Santander.Even Morgan Stanley came forward to say that it planned to raise its dividend to 20 cents from 15 cents and increase its share buyback program to $3.5 billion for the four quarters beginning July 1, from $2.5 billion in the previous period.The three banks that were called out by the Fed on Wednesday all had big enough financial buffers, the regulators said. Rather, the criticism was with more qualitative aspects of the way the three banks operate internally.At Morgan Stanley, the Fed said, the problems \u201cinclude shortcomings in the firm\u2019s scenario design practices, which do not adequately reflect risks and vulnerabilities specific to the firm, weaknesses in some aspects of the firm\u2019s modeling practices, and weaknesses in governance and controls around both scenario design and modeling practices.\u201dMorgan Stanley will be able to return money to shareholders, as planned, but it will need to improve its internal processes by the end of the year. If the bank does not make those improvements, the Fed could halt the bank\u2019s payouts.The results are an unhappy hiccup for Morgan Stanley, which has been struggling to raise its profits to the level of its competitors\u2019 and is in the middle of a significant cost-cutting campaign.In a statement, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, said, \u201cWe are committed to addressing the Fed\u2019s concerns about our capital planning process and fully expect to meet their requirements within the established time frame.\u201dFor Deutsche Bank and Santander, the failing grades raise bigger concerns about their ability to satisfy American regulators. The Deutsche Bank unit in the United States has failed twice in a row, and Santander three times.In this and previous years, the Fed has applied its tests only to parts of Santander and Deutsche Bank. These two banks, as well as other foreign banks, like Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse, have large operations in the United States that have not undergone stress tests. But that will soon change. The large foreign banks now have to organize their American operations into a single \u201cintermediate holding company.\u201dNext year, the Fed will do a trial test of these entities and keep the results private. But in 2018, these large holding companies will be subjected to full-fledged tests, and the results will be made public. Failing those stress tests would be much more of a blow to Deutsche Bank and Santander than the hit they took on Wednesday.A Fed official said on Wednesday that all the big banks had been making progress but that Deutsche Bank and Santander still needed to make significant improvements.In a statement, Scott Powell, the chief executive of Santander Holdings USA, said, \u201cWe are financially sound. These results do not affect our ability to serve our customers.\u201dDeutsche Bank also emphasized that even though its American unit had failed the test, it still had adequate capital.\u201cWe appreciate the Federal Reserve\u2019s recognition of our progress, and we will implement the lessons learned this year in order to strengthen our capital planning process,\u201d Bill Woodley, deputy chief executive of Deutsche Bank Americas said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Plan for the Financial World? Cross Your Fingers", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byAmong those who manage gobs of money, the possibility that Britain might actually disavow the European Union seemed until recently like a remote and even outlandish possibility.But about a week before voters go to the polls to determine their future, masters of finance are suddenly absorbing the prospect that Britain might really walk, unleashing anxiety and uncertainty throughout the global economy.Angst has seeped into the calculations. As investors digest the possibility that the largest marketplace on earth may be days away from a messy alteration, they have been yanking money out of riskier storehouses like stocks and putting it into safer instruments like bonds. The British pound and London stocks have been falling in frenzied trading.The conversation is now focused on managing the risks of Brexit. The trouble is that the worries are so diffuse and rife with unknowns that any attack plan amounts to an exercise in guesswork and hope. Executives, bankers and bureaucrats are grappling with something that could be minor or momentous and has never happened before.Maybe the Brexit \u2014 for British exit \u2014 would merely lop value from the pound before traders turned their attention to a more consequential plot twist elsewhere. Perhaps it would inspire separatist movements from Scotland to Spain, embolden anti-trade populists across the Continent and reinvigorate existential questions gnawing at the common euro currency. That could sow fear across world markets.A Brexit might spook investors into entrusting their money only to the safest repositories like American Treasuries. That could strengthen the American dollar and weaken American exports, while starving riskier emerging markets of investment.Whatever stories policy makers and businesspeople tell themselves, the only certainty is a surplus of uncertainty. Whatever provisional plans they sketch, they will find themselves mostly just wishing that nothing terrible happens.\u201cOn the financial markets, there is nothing they can do; it will just hit them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf my house is going to catch on fire, I can plan to have some water on hand, but there\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d\u201cThat kind of threw the cat among the pigeons and panicked everyone,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a London company that manages foreign exchange for multinationals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pickup in client hedging.\u201dA company that, say, imports goods from China to sell in Britain fears that the pound is about to drop, making those Chinese goods more expensive. So it buys contracts that essentially lock in today\u2019s exchange rate for the future.According to Laurence Wormald, head of research at FIS, which provides technology and market intelligence to financial services companies, British stocks would most likely fall 15 percent after a Brexit, with the pound dropping by a similar proportion.If a Brexit vote hurts the British economy, the central bank might feel compelled to lower rates to motivate businesses and households to borrow and spend. But the bank might well do the opposite, raising rates to stop a currency slide.The most nettlesome variable may be trade. Britain sells nearly half its exports within the European Union. Multinational corporations have set up headquarters in Britain, using those bases to serve customers across the Continent.Those campaigning for a Brexit assure that a vote to leave would change nothing right away. Britain would remain a fully fledged member of Europe\u2019s marketplace for two years as it negotiated a new arrangement with the 27 remaining members of the union.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut if Britain failed to secure a deal, commerce with Europe could be governed by the terms of the World Trade Organization, which gives member nations the authority to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports.The debate over the Brexit is full of references to sundry alternative models. Norway enjoys access to the European market although it remains outside the union. Switzerland has achieved similar status through a thicket of treaties. But in both cases, they must accept something supporters of Brexit want to eliminate \u2014 European rules that allow people to move liberally from country to country.Those urging a Brexit insist Britain can negotiate a tailor-made deal. Many economists describe that notion as somewhere between fanciful and delusional. Eager to discourage other members from considering an exit, Europe would seek to ensure that Britain paid a price.If Britain dumps Europe, \u201cthey are not going to say, \u2018Well, O.K., here\u2019s a good deal,\u2019\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London.Nowhere are preparations more intense than in finance. London has parlayed expertise in banking and inclusion in Europe to secure dominance over large areas of trading. As the referendum approaches, financiers are now consumed by a jigsaw puzzle of diabolical complexity: They are mapping out what assets they hold and where, seeking to anticipate what jurisdictions and rules might apply post-Brexit.\u201cInvestment banks and asset managers are pre-booking law firms, consulting firms and accounting firms for July,\u201d said William Wright, managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cIf we do vote to leave on June 23, no one is going to have the faintest idea what impact it will have.\u201dIf the sun rises on June 24 with Britain on its way out, such a shift could happen sooner rather than later. At a time of crippling uncertainty, banks would feel a compulsion to at least eliminate variables by quickly announcing their plans, moving people within the European Union \u2014 to Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris.In the end, contingency plans may be devised more as salves for frayed nerves than bona fide operational blueprints. Britain may be on the verge of refashioning the world map. If that happens, the vote will set off proceedings so complex that the only guaranteed winners are the lawyers.All plans will be subject to change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Fears Rising, Britain Hopes to Stay in E.U. Market", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Four days after a decisive vote to leave the European Union, Britain was consumed on Monday with questions of when and how the country\u2019s departure from the bloc would happen \u2014 and increasingly, of whether it would happen at all.The immediate outcome of Thursday\u2019s referendum was not the promised clarity but an epic political muddle and a policy vacuum that invited more confusion and turmoil throughout the day in Britain, on the Continent and in the financial markets.Leaders on both sides of the Channel said there was no viable option but to move gradually toward the withdrawal process. Yet the day\u2019s developments did little to dispel the possibility that the crisis could drag on for a long time, possibly generating enough economic and political damage to encourage negotiation of a new arrangement between Europe and Britain that would sidestep the need for a formal withdrawal or at least minimize its effects.Prime Minister David Cameron and leaders of the campaign to leave stuck to their positions that they would not move quickly to begin formal talks on withdrawal, even as European leaders turned up the pressure on Britain to get on with it.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany met in Berlin late Monday with her French and Italian counterparts. She signaled that any decision on how to negotiate a withdrawal would have to await a meeting of all 28 European Union countries on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels.The financial markets continued to pummel stocks and the value of the British pound, at one point sending the currency to its lowest level against the dollar in more than three decades. And Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency, downgraded Britain\u2019s credit rating, reflecting concern about the economic implications of the so-called Brexit vote.Mr. Cameron has announced that he will step down, and both his governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party were consumed by internal warfare on Monday, leaving the country lacking strong leadership as it confronted new demands for a referendum on independence for Scotland.Leaders of the Leave campaign, including Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who is now a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Cameron, notably modulated their tone and some positions on Europe, leaving unclear exactly what issues they want to address through a withdrawal.The state of chaotic paralysis highlighted two fundamental problems that have plagued the European Union for the last decade. One is its difficulty balancing democratic accountability against its institutional drive to further the cause of unity. The other is its inability to act quickly and decisively to address the crises that regularly undercut confidence among voters and in the markets.Monday\u2019s events spoke to the struggle on all sides to define a way forward and restore some sense of unity, both within Britain and throughout Europe.In the first meeting of Parliament since the referendum, Mr. Cameron said he considered the vote binding, though he reiterated that he would leave to his successor the decision to start the formal withdrawal process. \u201cThe decision must be accepted and the process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin,\u201d he said.About three-quarters of lawmakers had supported remaining in the European Union. A senior Conservative lawmaker, Kenneth Clarke, suggested that Parliament could override the referendum \u2014 which is not, in the end, legally binding on the government \u2014 while a Labour legislator, David Lammy, called for a second referendum.Mr. Cameron brushed such ideas aside, but he also made it clear that he would not be the one in charge of Britain\u2019s messy divorce from Europe.The man who might be, Mr. Johnson, sought to calm nerves and markets with his first extensive remarks on the way forward, setting out a position that seemed to de-emphasize elements of what the Leave campaign had promised.He suggested that Britain should take its time before entering separation proceedings with Brussels, and he gave no details about when he would want to start the process. And the vision he sketched out \u2014 of a Britain that is still in a trading bloc with Europe \u2014 seemed at best difficult to achieve, since the price of membership in the single market has always been the two things the Leave movement explicitly campaigned against: free movement of European citizens across borders and contributions to the bloc\u2019s operating budget.Mr. Johnson also played down the central issue of the campaign, immigration, saying it was not really what Britons were voting on, despite considerable evidence that it was.Mr. Cameron also suggested that the best outcome for Britain now would be a deal in which it retained access to the single market.But there were no signs that European leaders would let Britain off the hook so easily. Although Ms. Merkel has signaled a desire not to rush the process of negotiating British withdrawal, most European governments are eager to take a tough line, wanting to make clear to any other nation that might contemplate leaving that there is considerable cost to doing so.The few countries that have been given access to the European free-trade zone without joining the European Union \u2014 notably, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland \u2014 all contribute to the bloc\u2019s budget and accept its bedrock principle of free movement of workers, the very issues that angered so many of the Britons who voted to leave.Meeting in Berlin, Ms. Merkel, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said there would be no discussions, formal or informal, over Britain\u2019s withdrawal until it formally invokes Article 50, the provision in the bloc\u2019s governing treaty that sets out the process for a withdrawal.European leaders are troubled by the prospect of a drawn-out exit inducing deeper financial and economic turmoil, a concern increasingly prevalent in London as well. On Monday morning, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, tried to calm the markets, citing Britain\u2019s underlying economic strengths, the greater resilience of its financial system after the 2007-8 crisis, and the readiness of the Bank of England to step in.Markets plunged anyway.Alex Salmond, a member of Parliament and a former leader of the Scottish National Party, blamed the British government for the political vacuum, saying that neither Mr. Cameron nor Mr. Johnson had taken ownership of the mess. \u201cIf you break it, you own it,\u201d he said.Mr. Cameron summoned his cabinet and announced the creation of a policy unit of the \u201cbest and brightest\u201d civil servants \u2014 overseen by Oliver Letwin, a Conservative lawmaker \u2014 to orchestrate the withdrawal process. He also said he had spoken with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland to ensure that a British departure from the European Union, of which Ireland is a member, would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.A committee of rank-and-file Conservative lawmakers met on Monday and proposed a timetable to select two candidates for party leader. The party\u2019s roughly 150,000 members would choose between the two, with the goal of selecting a new leader \u2014 and therefore a new prime minister \u2014 by Sept. 2.A decision on the timetable is expected by Wednesday, amid increased speculation that Britain could have a general election this year, after giving the Conservatives a five-year term in May 2015.Mr. Johnson is seen as the front-runner to replace Mr. Cameron as leader of the Conservatives, but he has made many enemies. The home secretary, Theresa May, who is in charge of domestic security and who advocated remaining in the European Union, has emerged as perhaps the most credible alternative.Large numbers of voters in traditional Labour strongholds in Northeast England and Wales \u2014 many of which are economically depressed areas that receive large amounts of European Union aid \u2014 voted to leave the bloc.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s tepid approach to campaigning for the Remain campaign was cited as a reason many traditional Labour supporters threw in their lot with the nationalist, anti-European U.K. Independence Party.Secretary of State John Kerry, visiting Brussels and London to discuss the fallout from the referendum, counseled against harsh actions by either side.\u201cSo I think it is absolutely essential that we stay focused on how, in this transitional period, nobody loses their head, nobody goes off half-cocked, people don\u2019t start ginning up scatterbrained or revengeful premises, but we look for ways to maintain the strength that will serve the interests and the values that brought us together in the first place,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.An article on June 28 about the political muddle and rising economic fears that followed Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union referred incorrectly to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s communication with Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, meant to ensure that Britain\u2019s exit would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. Mr. Cameron spoke with Mr. Kenny; the two did not meet.Melissa Eddy and Alison Smale contributed reporting from Berlin, and James Kanter from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Watch for in Trading After Shock of \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byMarket TurmoilThe global financial system has in recent years managed to absorb rolling debt crises in Greece, military clashes in Ukraine, down-to-the-wire budget fights in Washington and a shock currency devaluation by China.But will it handle Britain\u2019s vote on Thursday to leave the European Union as well?The lesson of the financial crisis of 2008 is that problems in one country can spread around the world through the markets and the banking system. And so far on Friday, there have been some gut-wrenching moves in global markets.The British pound plunged to a level not seen in decades. The decline briefly meant that the British economy was smaller than France\u2019s, when measured in dollar terms.Italy\u2019s stock market was down more than 10 percent, and France\u2019s was off over 8 percent.The selling hit Japan, where stocks closed down nearly 8 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 459 points, or 2.55 percent, in late morning trading.Investors sought safety in government bonds. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped into negative territory. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)The yield on the United States 10-year note also sank, to 1.53 percent, after overnight trading that was eight times its normal volume, according to FTN Financial.The question now is how much more conditions could change in the next days and weeks. At times like this, it makes sense to focus on areas where the global financial system seems most vulnerable.In Europe, that means searching the markets for indications that investors are starting to bet that the European Union will fracture further.Worrying? Sure.Still, it\u2019s important to remember that the European Central Bank has in the past acted boldly to head off adverse movements in bond markets. And on Friday, it said in a news release that it would \u201ccontinue to fulfill its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.Europe\u2019s other weak point is its banking system. Much of the selling involved Britain\u2019s financial giants. Shares in Barclays, which has large trading operations, and which hoovered up much of Lehman Brothers after it crashed, had shed a fifth of its value on Friday. But Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, also plummeted \u2014 by 14 percent.At times like this, what really matters is whether banks can raise short-term money to finance their operations. The Bank of England said in a statement on Friday that it would make 250 billion pounds available to banks, and said it could provide \u201csubstantial liquidity in foreign currency.\u201dThe financial system overhauls introduced in the United States and Europe since the 2008 crisis, and the willingness to provide emergency support to the banks right now, will most likely stop the financial system from imploding.But a deeper test is whether the overhaul \u2014 which forced banks to have higher levels of capital and retain more liquid cash \u2014 has put the banks in a position in which they can continue lending to the real economy during this period of pervasive uncertainty. The Bank of England on Friday underscored that hope in its statement. \u201cThis substantial capital and huge liquidity gives banks the flexibility they need to continue to lend to U.K. businesses and households, even during challenging times,\u201d it said.One other thing to consider amid this selling and gloom: There is an optimistic scenario. Britain and Europe may work out a peaceful divorce, and Europe\u2019s policy makers may be able to stop the departure from deepening the Continent\u2019s economic problems. The economic pain in Britain may deter other countries from seeking to leave, or they may have votes and decide to stay.People who have bet on the world ending in recent years have lost a lot of money. But be very open to the notion that Brexit could be the event that finally makes them rich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libyan Fund Claims Goldman Sachs Exploited Its Financial Na\u00efvet\u00e9", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After years of international isolation under the rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya sought to emulate its Middle Eastern neighbors by creating a sovereign wealth fund in 2006 to invest the proceeds from its sale of oil.The North African nation soon turned to Goldman Sachs to help it invest some of the more than $35 billion in funds it had available in late 2007.That relationship soured after the Libyan Investment Authority said it was misled by the Wall Street bank in 2008 about a series of derivatives transactions and ultimately lost $1.2 billion when those contracts came to maturity in 2011.Goldman Sachs, by comparison, earned more than $200 million in \u201ceye-watering\u201d profit on the transactions, the sovereign fund asserted in a trial that began on Monday in London.The Libyan Investment Authority, unlike many sovereign wealth funds, said that it was an unsophisticated investor with a staff that had little experience with investment banking and that Goldman Sachs preyed on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of its staff to persuade the fund to invest in complex transactions that they didn\u2019t understand or desire.On Monday, Roger Masefield, a lawyer for the Libyan Investment Authority, argued that Goldman used training programs; gifts; trips to Dubai, London and Morocco; and an internship for the younger brother of the fund\u2019s deputy executive officer to win favor and convince the fund to engage in the investments.\u201cThis is a highly unusual case,\u201d Mr. Masefield said.The trial is being heard in the High Court in London before Justice Vivien Rose and is expected to last about seven weeks. The lawsuit was first filed in London two years ago.Goldman has disputed the claims and says that the Libyan Investment Authority had the financial sophistication to understand the disputed transactions and other similarly complicated transactions it engaged in.The dispute revolves around nine derivatives transactions tied to the stocks of Citigroup, the French utility EDF and other companies.The Libyan fund entered into the transactions in 2007 and in 2008 in the months before the financial crisis and ultimately lost its investment as the economic downturn weighed on the stock prices of the companies in the disputed transactions.At the time, Libya was looking to engage with the global markets after years of political isolation and stagnant development.The Libyan Investment Authority soon developed a close relationship with Goldman and by mid-2007 considered it not only a trusted adviser, but as \u201calmost an in-house bank,\u201d according to the Libyan Investment Authority\u2019s assertions.The Libyan Investment Authority, like the sovereign wealth funds of other developing countries, was seeking to purchase strategic stakes in global companies that could be partners for its future development, according to court filings. That included financial companies.In its filings, the Libyan Investment Authority argued that Goldman was aware of the financial na\u00efvet\u00e9 of its staff, citing emails in which one banker said the fund had \u201czero-level sophistication\u201d and another banker who said \u201cyou just delivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels.\u201dMuch of the fund\u2019s arguments centered on the actions of Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker.The Libyan Investment Authority said that Mr. Kabbaj wined and dined members of the fund\u2019s staff on \u201ctraining\u201d trips to London, which included accommodations in a stylish hotel and frequent expensive meals out at many of London\u2019s best-known restaurants.In one instance, his expenses for entertaining and hotels exceeded 22,000 pounds, or about $31,000, and he was reminded internally at Goldman that any expenses incurred with respect to the Libyan fund needed prior approval, according to court filings.Mr. Kabbaj also bought staff members of the fund presents and took them on vacation to Morocco, according to the court filings.Mr. Masefield argued that Mr. Kabbaj also worked on both sides of the derivatives transactions, \u201cghost writing\u201d documents for staff members of the fund to be used to convince its board of directors to invest and then separately making presentations to the fund on behalf of Goldman Sachs.The Libyan fund also argued that Goldman tried to win influence by providing an internship to Haitem Zarti, the younger brother of Mustafa Zarti, the fund\u2019s deputy executive officer.\u201cThis very internship has been, and may still be, the subject of investigation\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cand Goldman Sachs appears to be carrying out its own internal investigation into its hiring practices,\u201d the fund said in court filings.According to court filings, Mr. Kabbaj entertained Haitem Zarti in London on his Goldman Sachs expense account and took him on vacations to Morocco. The Libyan fund said that Goldman Sachs paid for Haitem Zarti\u2019s business class flights and 5-star accommodations on a trip to Dubai and Mr. Kabbaj arranged for a \u201cpair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening\u201d on that trip.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Optimistic, So What\u2019s Your Excuse?", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsHas the election made you anxious about the future of the United States? Do you feel as if your job is not secure in this lukewarm economy? Are you just generally in the dumps?If so, take a look at the stock market. After a couple of steep sell-offs since last summer, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen to within a whisker of the record high it hit in May 2015.The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 on Wednesday, putting that benchmark up 3 percent for the year.Still, when stocks have moved higher for several years, notching the second-longest bull run in Standard & Poor\u2019s records, the market\u2019s optimism should be taken seriously.The latest rally, which has lifted the market more than 16 percent from the low point it hit in February, suggests that investors do not believe that the bad jobs numbers are an early signal of a slowdown. They are also probably betting that the Federal Reserve will not be in such a hurry to raise interest rates.Investors may also be seeing less political risk in the United States. The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump favors combative trade policies that, if put into place, might disrupt global commerce, unsettle the markets and unnerve investors. A trade war could harm the earnings of American exporters if other countries retaliated. After watching a difficult few days in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, investors may have bought more stock this week in the belief that his chances of becoming president have weakened.But there is good reason to believe that investors have become too optimistic. This turbulent presidential campaign will no doubt disquiet investors in other ways.All politics aside, the stock market\u2019s rise has made stock prices look expensive when compared with corporate earnings. In aggregate, the companies in the S.&P. 500 were trading at 22 times their earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. That is considerably higher than the average of 16 times earnings for the five years through the end of 2015.Stocks are also expensive when their prices are compared against expected future earnings. The S.&P. 500 is trading at 18 times projected 2016 operating earnings, above the average of the last five years.That high level of optimism can also be seen in how much profit growth analysts are expecting. They project 14 percent this year, and a scorching 17 percent in 2017.Here\u2019s the problem: When investors are this sanguine, they are prone to dash for the exits at small signs of trouble. The impetus might come from a hawkish remark about interest rates from an influential Federal Reserve policy maker or a vote from Britain on June 23 to exit the European Union. Or something else that catches most investors by surprise.But this is not necessarily a reason to feel gloomy. When an expensive stock market sells off, it\u2019s not a given that the economy will also dive. In the last 10 months, stocks sold off heavily on two occasions. The United States economy kept chugging along.It\u2019s when the economy stops chugging that it will really be time to avoid the stock market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Policies Have Gotten It in a Tangle", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut the Fed faces difficult choices. A look at its own data suggests that its policies have led to financial imbalances that place it under pressure to raise rates, as it has repeatedly said it will do.One problem is that the purchases of trillions of dollars of bonds by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in a strategy known as quantitative easing have contributed to the extraordinarily low yields in much of the bond market.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s policies are largely responsible for creating a wealth cycle,\u201d said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein. \u201cIt\u2019s past time that the Fed took some action.\u201dYet the case for holding rates steady, and not touching the Fed funds rate (the central bank\u2019s crucial short-term rate) is easy to make, and the Fed made it on Wednesday. In a statement, it warned of risks facing the still fragile domestic economy. And in a news conference, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said that next Thursday\u2019s British referendum could \u201chave consequences\u201d for global markets. She said: \u201cIt could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy. \u201dPolls indicate it is quite possible that British voters will decide that their country should leave the European Union. The British pound, Britain\u2019s global trade, the status of the City of London as a world financial capital \u2014 all could be threatened, and so could the stability of the rest of the European Union. In merely two days, Monday and Tuesday, the VIX index, a measure of expected volatility in the stock market, leapt 20 percent. Yields of bonds of troubled countries on the eurozone periphery, like Greece and Spain, rose to levels not reached in months, as investors demanded more rewards for the risks of holding them.What\u2019s more, the yields of sovereign bonds in core countries like Germany and France plummeted as global investors sought a semblance of safety. This has produced some strange results: For the first time in history, the yield on the 10-year German bond moved into negative territory on Tuesday.Yields on numerous sovereign notes of shorter maturities of, say, five years have been negative for some time. The list includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. A saving grace, for investors in such bonds, is that if yields keep dropping, prices, which move in the opposite direction, will rise, and handsome profits can be made when the securities are sold.The United States Treasury is not selling bonds with negative interest rates, but yields on 10-year Treasuries have plummeted as well, dropping close to 1.5 percent on Thursday. Since 1981, such securities have yielded more than 6.3 percent, on average, a staggeringly large gap. The current ultralow Treasury yields make sense only when compared with the even lower yields available elsewhere around the world.While the Fed influences the entire fixed-income market, it directly controls only short-term yields through the Fed funds rate, which it raised to 0.25 percent, from nearly zero, in December. The Fed has repeatedly said it would increase that rate further, only to backpedal. On Wednesday, it did so again, forecasting that the rate would reach only 1.6 percent next year, down from a projection of 1.9 percent made in March; and only 2.4 percent in 2018, down from a March projection of 3 percent.While wage inflation appears to be on the increase, and the unemployment rate is quite low at 4.7 percent, some recent data on the labor market and on inflation has been disappointing, gross domestic product has been growing slowly, and the Fed has decided to be extremely cautious in setting rates.Yet from the perspective of household wealth and asset prices, the dangers of Fed inaction are readily apparent. By keeping interest rates low for so many years, the Fed has not merely reduced fixed-income yields. It has increased the value of other assets, to spectacular effect.Growth of household wealth has outstripped income, enriching those lucky enough to have houses and financial investments and leaving those who rely solely on wage income far behind. Asset prices may not be high enough to call them a bubble, but they are high enough for ordinary people to exercise caution. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2009, when the Fed embarked on its loose monetary policy, deliberately encouraging people to buy riskier assets.In Mr. Carson\u2019s view, it\u2019s past time to raise rates, both to stay ahead of inflation and rein in speculative excess.Higher interest rates would even have a stimulative effect for a while, he says, because people with savings would benefit from higher interest payments.Yet with the threat of disruptions abroad, and economic growth tepid at best in the United States, arguments for waiting longer prevail. Central banks are in a tough spot, dealing with economic problems for which quick remedies are not readily apparent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palantir Buyback Plan Shows Need for New Silicon Valley Pay System", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorPalantir Technologies\u2019 $225 million offer to repurchase its employees\u2019 privately held shares hints that Silicon Valley is starting to make some fundamental changes in the way it compensates its workers.Palantir, a data analytics firm, is one of the largest start-ups around, with a valuation reaching more than $20 billion last year. It is offering $7.40 a share to buy back up to 12.5 percent of an employee\u2019s shares (and in some cases, those of former employees), or $500,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower.The offer has some interesting characteristics, to say the least. Palantir\u2019s worth, measured by the price at which its stock trades in the private share market, has been deflated. The price Palantir is offering is above the private market price and the value assigned to the stock by some prominent mutual funds.Palantir\u2019s offer, though, is at least a cheap way to tell the market that Palantir thinks it is still worth a lot.Palantir has said the offer is intended to increase the morale of employees by offering them \u201cliquidity.\u201d Some employees have been with the company since its founding 11 years ago and are still waiting for that pinnacle event in the life of a hot tech start-up: the initial public offering of stock.Unlike them, the former employees can already sell their shares in the private market. They might take this offer because it is a higher amount. Palantir\u2019s motives for including them in the buyback are unclear. Palantir gets all of the benefits of the nondisclosure and other agreements, but any employee who takes the offer is not likely to be doing those things anyway. Perhaps Palantir is doing this out of the goodness of its heart.Whatever the reason, Palantir\u2019s offer comes at a time of great debate in Silicon Valley over employee compensation. Traditionally, workers received options on a four-year vesting schedule. When they left a company, they would have 90 days to exercise those options or forfeit them.Palantir did not impose restrictions on employees or stockholders selling shares in the private market. Perhaps as a way to get current and former employees to participate, Palantir\u2019s repurchase offer threatened to make it harder to resell the company\u2019s stock in the private market.Employees need to consider another headache \u2013 taxes. Not only must employees put up cash to exercise their options, they must pay taxes, which can be an extraordinary amount if the private company has a high valuation. But because the company is not public yet, one cannot even be sure that valuations will materialize, particularly in the era of the overvalued start-up. This was a problem in the day of the tech bubble. Employees exercised options worth millions of dollars but found that when taxes were due, their companies and stock were worthless.Mr. Kupor notes that extending the exercise time for former employees makes their options more valuable at the expense of employees and investors. (It does so because former employees have a longer time to exercise their options and dilute the other shareholders.) Mr. Kupor has no solution other than to allow companies to extend the time at their discretion. But as we see in the Palantir case, companies can pick and choose favorites, or even refuse to accommodate former employees.The Palantir repurchase and Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s ruminations highlight a more fundamental point: Compensation at venture-backed companies needs to be rethought in an age when many of these companies are staying private longer.In this new world, employees face sale restrictions that only their companies can lift. This forces these companies to provide periodic liquidity events. For instance, Airbnb, the short-term rental site, is making annual stock repurchases. In the public realm where companies are steadily profitable, stock buybacks are a familiar occurrence. More than half a trillion dollars was spent on stock buybacks in the public markets in 2015. But as the value of private, venture-backed companies deflates, they will struggle to give liquidity to their employees.There may be other ways to change compensation. Although options are the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, Palantir raised salaries 20 percent to stem employee attrition. But cash will not solve the problem, either.And so we await the great revamping. In the meantime, former employees of hot start-ups will be faced with choices like the one Palantir is offering: Take our money, whatever we offer, or be stuck.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Test to See if the Parts Are Worth More Than the Whole", "Date": "2011-01-19", "News": "Can one plus one equal more than two, or is this is yet another Wall Street fad?Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fascination with creating value by combining and breaking apart different businesses goes back 50 years. In the 1960s it was about conglomerates. The idea was that a diversified group of companies in differing businesses could offset one another in a down economy as well as gain economies of scale to lower borrowing and other costs. ITT was one of the largest of the conglomerates, buying more than 300 separate businesses in the 1960s.The conventional wisdom had changed: conglomerates were now destroying value. Management would do better to focus on a single business without distraction. Investors could also diversify by purchasing individual stocks of differing businesses rather than a single company with assorted businesses. This would allow investors to better pick their way to diversification.Tracking stocks were another fad that raised the same issues as conglomerates. During the technology bubble, many companies had Internet divisions that they wanted to monetize, but not sell. The tracking stock was promoted to solve this problem. A tracking stock supposedly allowed investors to invest in a stock that tracked the cash flow of a particular division. In 1999 and 2000, at least 16 tracking stock offerings were announced, including by Staples and AT&T.But the management conflicts of having two separate divisions and two separate stocks under one roof proved too great. The stock returns were poor, and tracking stocks, like conglomerates, are now largely extinct. Without a tracker stock or another tool to monetize diverse businesses under the same umbrella, the spinoff became the preferred solution for splitting up businesses deemed too diverse within one company.All the recently announced breakups are spinoffs. ITT is spinning off its military and water units, but keeping its industrial products business.Spinoffs can also be tax-free, so even if a company is salable, they are a good way to provide shareholders the proceeds of a significant breakup and prepare a business for a subsequent sale.The spinoff is back because of Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renewed fervor to break up companies. According to Dealogic, $27.8 billion of spinoffs have been announced so far in January, compared with $46.6 billion in all of 2010.But does this create value, or is it just moving pieces on the chess board?In the longer term, researchers found, spinoffs do not produce gains over and above other similar stocks. One explanation is that the short-term gain is more a result of the anticipation of the spinoff than the actual event.Looking at the last 50 years, the verdict on business breakups should raise caution. Wall Street loves them because of the fees they provide. They also can set up companies for a tax-efficient acquisition of the spun-off business. And if done carefully they can provide management focus to neglected businesses.But the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanagement\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument cuts both ways. There are reasons that companies may be together. It may be there are gains from management or efficiencies and cost savings.The current preferred form of breakup, the spinoff, has a number of hazards. It can saddle companies with the same poor management or too much debt. The parent company is free to go forward without such burdens. But this does not create value. This merely allows management to pick its winner.In other words, companies may do better simply to focus on fixing the practices that got them into their problem rather than on financial engineering and following the conventional wisdom on breakups.Investors need to be equally careful to discern the fad from the actual benefits spinoffs provide beyond financial alchemy.

The government needs to raise more than 93 billion euros over all this year.Spain used a syndicate for sales as recently as last year, and a debt management agency official said last week that the government was considering the option.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Limits Facebook Investment to Foreign Clients", "Date": "2011-01-17", "News": "8:55 p.m. | Updated Just more than a week after Goldman Sachs offered its most prized clients a chance to invest in Facebook, the firm on Monday withdrew the opportunity from clients in the United States because of worries that the deal could run afoul of securities regulations.The decision is a considered a serious embarrassment for Goldman, which had marketed the investment to its wealthiest clients, including corporate magnates and directors of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest companies.The offering was supposed to have been a triumph for the firm, which is trying to move past run-ins with regulators, including a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer over a complex mortgage investment. But the Facebook plan is now likely to raise new questions about whether Goldman tried to push regulatory boundaries once again.Goldman made its decision after the investment plan drew scrutiny. The S.E.C. had opened an inquiry into the structure of the offering and whether it violated the law because of widespread news coverage. Federal and state regulations prohibit what is known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgeneral solicitation and advertising\u00e2\u0080\u009d in private offerings. Firms like Goldman seeking to raise money cannot take action that resembles public promotion of the offering, like buying ads or communicating with news outlets.In a statement on Monday, the firm said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn light of this intense media coverage, Goldman Sachs has decided to proceed only with the offer to investors outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S. private placement under U.S. law.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGoldman had not been planning to initiate the offering that night, but it sped up the process after The Times called the firm seeking comment, according to an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak.That night, a Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Late that night, before the report was published, executives in Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private wealth-management unit e-mailed their clients about the offering, people who received the e-mail said.Goldman added in its statement on Monday that the decision was made on its own and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas not required or requested by any other party.\u00e2\u0080\u009dForeign investors will still be able to participate in the Goldman offering because they are not subject to the S.E.C. rules on solicitation in private offerings. However, all partners of Goldman, whether based in the United States or abroad, will not be allowed to invest, according to people briefed on the matter.It is unclear how much money Goldman will raise for Facebook. In a private memorandum to clients when it made the offering, it said it planned to raise as much as $1.5 billion. The minimum investment is $2 million. The overall deal pegged Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value at $50 billion.While the offering was oversubscribed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps by as much as three times \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with American clients now ineligible to participate, it is not clear whether Goldman or Facebook will lower the size of the offering. A majority of Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-net-worth clients are based in the United States, and these investors may be upset over being denied a potentially lucrative opportunity afforded to investors in Europe and Asia.For Goldman executives who manage money for wealthy families, so-called special investments have long been a major selling point in luring clients to the firm. The argument to prospective clients is that by placing their money with Goldman, they have access to the same investment opportunities as the firm, long considered one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smartest investors.The struggles of the offering may also deal a blow to Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Facebook and to the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects of leading the social network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-awaited initial public offering, expected in 2012.Over the last two weeks, the companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 relationship has grown increasingly tense, people involved in the offering said. Accusations about the news leak have flown back and forth, these people said.Goldman was brought in as a Facebook investor through its relationship with DST, a Russian investment firm led by Yuri Milner, which is a major Facebook shareholder and has invested in several other popular Internet companies, like Groupon.Within days of the news breaking about the offering, the S.E.C. began an inquiry, looking both at the news reports and the structure of the transaction.The deal itself was considered controversial because the S.E.C. requires companies to publicly disclose their financial results if they have more than 499 investors. But Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans, according to a Goldman offering memorandum, were to go public by April 2012, following the timeline set by the rule.Investors and analysts are likely to ask Goldman executives about the offering\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubles when the firm reports earnings on Wednesday.William Sjostrom, a securities law professor at the University of Arizona who has written about private placements, said he was not surprised by Goldman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move given how early news of the offering broke and the volume of publicity.\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoldman probably looked at the deal and figured it could complete the offering outside the U.S. anyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sjostrom said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.S. clients are probably frustrated that they now can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t participate, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferable than having a potential problem with regulators.\u00e2\u0080\u009dGoldman Sachs originally intended to conduct a private placement in the U.S. and offshore to investors interested in Facebook. The transaction generated intense media attention following the publication of an article on the evening of January 2, 2011, shortly after the launch of the transaction. In light of this intense media coverage, Goldman Sachs has decided to proceed only with the offer to investors outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S. private placement under U.S. law. The decision not to proceed in the U.S. was based on the sole judgment of Goldman Sachs and was not required or requested by any other party. We regret the consequences of this decision, but Goldman Sachs believes this is the most prudent path to take.Peter Lattman and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting to this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Banks Worry About Engaging World Markets After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAs global markets reel after an establishment-rattling vote by Britain to sever ties with Europe, investors are again expecting central banks to ride to the rescue.And that may be the problem.Or so believe a number of investors and economists who worry that another round of central bank intervention in the markets will compound the sense of alienation, frustration and anger at global elites that encouraged a majority of Britons to opt for leaving the European Union.Traditionally, market participants have tended to cheer central bank activism.In times of financial panic, wholesale bond buying, negative interest rates and disbursing cash directly to consumers (the yet-to-be-deployed weapon in the central banker\u2019s armory) have been seen as easy policy substitutes for governments unwilling or incapable of taking action themselves.But, as the world\u2019s leading central bankers finished a weekend of brainstorming in Basel, Switzerland, as to what their next move might be, some feared that this time around they might do more harm than good.\u201cPeople say that central bankers have not done enough, but they have done too much already,\u201d said Stephen Jen, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund in London.But the British referendum results and the sharp fall in the markets that followed brought an extra urgency to the two-day meeting.On Saturday, Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank and chairman of the bank\u2019s policy group that monitors the global financial system, said that committee members had \u201cendorsed the contingency measures put in place by the Bank of England and emphasized the preparedness of central banks to support the proper functioning of financial markets.\u201dAdding to global political tensions were parliamentary elections on Sunday in Spain, where the anti-austerity left-wing party Podemos was expected to continue its recent run of electoral success.While the sell-off in stocks on Friday was very sharp, market participants said over the weekend that they were heartened that major market makers were able to absorb the selling fairly well.Playing a central role were exchange-traded funds, which at one point on Friday accounted for close to 50 percent of overall trading volume in stocks. That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the funds were largely unknown a decade ago as an investment option for investors.The ability for investors to quickly and successfully buy and sell stocks and bonds, the crucial advantage that exchange-traded funds have over mutual funds, is seen by regulators as critical in times of acute financial stress.Part of the conundrum for central bankers is that the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like Lehman Brothers going bankrupt in September 2008, which provided authorities with an unassailable excuse to intervene. Lehman\u2019s failure caused markets to seize up and financial institutions to stop dealing with each other.But when the crises that rock global finance are social and political, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend any form of extraordinary intervention.And that is what worries analysts, who for some time now have been concerned that interventions by central banks were distorting markets by making them less liquid and creating anomalies such as what currently exists in Japan.There, the nation\u2019s central bank owns 34 percent of the country\u2019s government bonds and is one of the top 10 shareholders in 90 percent of the companies listed on the stock exchange, according to data from Bloomberg.\u201cCentral banks have done everything to jury-rig markets,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes. \u201cWhat makes you think they won\u2019t want to do more?\u201dMr. Jen, the hedge fund manager, scoffed at the notion that the extraordinary central bank interventions of recent years were designed to stamp out deflationary threats and spark an increase in prices and economic activity in stagnant economies in Europe and Japan.\u201cWe have plenty of inflation, it\u2019s just asset price inflation,\u201d he argued, referring to elevated equity, bond and housing markets that have been one consequence of these policies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t live in cities anymore, and they are grumpy about their jobs.\u201dInterestingly, one of the most vocal critics of central bank overreach has been the Bank for International Settlements itself.For years now, two senior economists at its research arm, Claudio Borio and Hyun Song Shin, have been arguing via speeches and papers that artificially low interest rates have created pernicious asset bubbles in equity and housing markets in the developed world and debt frenzies in emerging markets like China and Brazil.These views were highlighted again on Sunday in Basel with the presentation of the bank\u2019s annual report.In a speech, Jaime Caruana, the bank\u2019s managing director, said that extremely low interest rates were a threat to global financial stability as they \u201cdepress risk premia and stretch asset valuations.\u201dThe result, Mr. Caruana contended, was the threat of a \u201closs of confidence in policy making\u201d and \u201cunrealistic expectations about growth and the ability of present policies to lift global growth.\u201dWhile couched in platitudes, Mr. Caruana\u2019s message was clear enough. Persistent central bank interventions have not only created dangerous distortions, they have added to a sense of worldwide cynicism that these measures have not accomplished their central aims: lifting economic growth and increasing wages.But, Mr. Brigden said, central bankers will have a harder time justifying an intervention when the markets are going haywire because of an election upset somewhere.Of course, bashing central bankers is always a popular and easy pastime for politicians, economists and investors alike.It is also true that central bankers in Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States have consistently said that their actions have been forced by the unwillingness of politicians and governments to act themselves.\u201cMonetary policy cannot do it alone,\u201d said Daniel C. Dektar, a bond investor at Amundi Smith Breeden, a global asset manager. \u201cPeople have been left behind, which is creating anti-establishment sentiment in just about every democracy in the world. You would think that at some point governments would get the message.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Hits U.S. Stock Market Harder Than an Election", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byAftershockIn response to the British vote to leave the European Union, the American stock markets have moved more than they have in response to any presidential election over the past 60 years.In part, this reflects the fact that Thursday\u2019s referendum result was quite unexpected. Election-eve prediction markets had suggested around a one-in-six chance that Britain would leave.Even sharp and unexpected electoral shifts in the United States don\u2019t produce swings this large. Take the 2000 election, when markets rose and fell by only a percentage point or two, as the networks went back and forth on whether George W. Bush or Al Gore had the edge in Florida and in the Electoral College. Stocks moved by less than a percentage point in response to the subsequent Supreme Court decision certifying Mr. Bush as the winner.Likewise, stocks moved by only a percentage point or two on Election Day 2004, when early exit polls led many to believe that John Kerry had won the election, only to reverse course when it became clear the early numbers were wrong.Think of Friday morning\u2019s re-evaluation of the price of stocks as the market\u2019s judgment that the British referendum has more profound economic implications for the United States than the difference between a Democratic and Republican president. (Perhaps the contrast this November will prove to be larger.)Economists focus on stock market reactions because they provide a useful real-time barometer of a nation\u2019s broader economic prospects.After all, when traders buy a stock index, they\u2019re buying the future earnings of a broad swath of American corporations. The theory is that the price they\u2019re paying should be tied to expectations of future earnings. This morning\u2019s lower stock prices suggests they\u2019re much more pessimistic.While market reactions are surely neither as rational nor as carefully calibrated as the theory suggests, at least they provide a useful quantification of the conventional wisdom. And that conventional wisdom seems to be that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will lead to economic disruption that will echo across the Atlantic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IEX Group, Critical of Wall St., Gains Approval for Stock Exchange", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byAmerica is getting a new stock exchange from the most prominent critics of high-frequency trading.After months of delays and a brutal lobbying battle that divided Wall Street, the IEX Group won approval on Friday from the Securities and Exchange Commission to become the nation\u2019s 13th official stock exchange.IEX is run by the people at the center of the Michael Lewis book, \u201cFlash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\u201d which profiles the early efforts of the IEX team to create a trading exchange that would be somewhat shielded from high-frequency traders.Other exchanges and trading firms had urged the S.E.C. to reject the IEX application to become an exchange.Opponents of IEX, including the other stock exchanges, have argued that the structure of the new exchange will add unnecessary new complexities into an already complex stock market, and potentially end up hurting small investors.But the three S.E.C. commissioners all voted on Friday to approve the IEX exchange, with one commissioner, Michael S. Piwowar, a Republican, dissenting on a few points.\u201cToday\u2019s actions promote competition and innovation, which our equity markets depend on to continue to deliver robust, efficient service to both retail and institutional investors,\u201d Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. chairwoman, said in a statement.The most novel and controversial feature of the IEX exchange is a so-called speed bump that would slow down trading slightly to throw off traders that rely only on speed.The speed bump slows trades down by only 350 microseconds \u2014 or millionths of a second \u2014 but that is an eternity in a stock exchange universe in which computers can buy and sell stocks in nanoseconds \u2014 or billionths of a second.The Nasdaq, and other existing exchanges, have said that the IEX\u2019s speed bump will violate rules mandating that exchanges make their prices available to all parties at the same time.IEX\u2019s critics have also said that the speed bump could add new complications into a stock market infrastructure that is already criticized for its complexity.In a statement, the S.E.C. said that the commissioners \u201cdetermined that a small delay will not prevent investors from accessing stock prices in a fair and efficient manner.\u201dThe S.E.C. did say, though, that within two years it will do a study to examine whether the delays lead to problems in the markets.If nothing else, the approval of the exchange will provide an opportunity to test the many competing theories about what impact the IEX\u2019s speed bump will have on the pattern of trading.The IEX has been a flash point in the broader debate over technological changes that have altered the basic functioning of the American stock markets over the last two decades.IEX won support \u2014 and financial backing \u2014 from several large mutual fund companies, which said that the exchange would help them trade more cheaply and efficiently, as well as from hundreds of small investors, many of whom read \u201cFlash Boys\u201d and wrote in to the S.E.C.Brad Katsuyama, the chief executive of IEX, said on Friday night that the company was \u201cgrateful and humbled by the support we\u2019ve received from the investor community, without it, we may have faced a different result.\u201dIn addition to the speed bump, the IEX has said it will not offer the same fees or rebates that other exchanges do to attract traders, a common practice at other exchanges that has been criticized for distorting trading incentives. The IEX also offers fewer complicated ways to enter trades than other exchanges, in an effort to simplify trading.Mr. Katsuyama has argued throughout the application process that IEX would provide a market-based solution to the problems created by high-frequency trading rather than requiring the S.E.C. to change the rules governing the markets.The other exchanges have complained that the IEX was essentially asking to be exempt from rules that governed them.In a letter written in May, Nasdaq\u2019s lawyers suggested that the S.E.C. could face a lawsuit if it approved the IEX application. A spokesman for Nasdaq said on Friday that the exchange company had no comment on the S.E.C.\u2019s decision.Larry Tabb, a market analyst with the Tabb Group, said the IEX speed bump could end up benefiting more sophisticated traders, like high-frequency traders, who can find ways to take advantage of the small delays.\u201cIt hurts the broad middle who may not have access to the best tools,\u201d Mr. Tabb said.The hedge fund and trading firm Citadel has been one of the most outspoken critics of the IEX application. On Friday, a spokeswoman for Citadel said that the S.E.C.\u2019s decision \u201cwill test and potentially reverse the gains in fairness, efficiency and transparency that have been made to our markets over the last decade. We must be vigilant to identify unintended consequences.\u201dAnother relatively new American stock exchange company, BATS Global Markets, initially supported the IEX application, but earlier this year withdrew its support, pointing to \u201cgross omissions of fact\u201d by IEX. BATS wrote that the problems \u201ccall into question the applicant\u2019s professional judgment.\u201dOn Friday, a BATS spokesman, Randy Williams, said that the company \u201ccongratulates IEX and appreciates the significant changes they made to their application to address industry concerns.\u201dIEX has already been operating as a private trading pool and has recently been attracting about 1.6 percent of all daily trading volume.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hard-to-Sell Assets Complicate European Banks\u2019 \u2018Brexit\u2019 Risks", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byNow, as banks scramble to assess the impact of a British exit from the European Union, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays and others face increased pressure from investors.While they recovered some ground on Tuesday, the stock prices of these banks have fallen sharply after the British vote, on increased fears that they will be unable to sell the billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities that they so desperately need to get rid of.Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA, refers to what he calls the 5 C\u2019s in describing what ails the big European banks \u2014 a number of which he has worked for during his peripatetic career.These are costs, complexity, capital markets, currency risks and central banks, which engineered the superlow interest rates that are squeezing margins.\u201cThe pain is not going away anytime soon,\u201d he said.Britain\u2019s decision, however, also raises more existential questions about the futures of these entities, which over the decades became rooted in the notion that London was \u2014 and would always be \u2014 the financial locus of Europe.While it is not expected that European banks will immediately resettle their London-based bankers and traders in Zurich, Hong Kong, Frankfurt or New York, the vote \u2014 and its political consequences \u2014 certainly challenges the view that London will continue to be the spiritual and financial hub of these institutions.It was precisely this mind-set that led Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse to hire many thousands of investment bankers and traders to staff fast-growing London offices in the 20 years leading up to the financial crisis.The wisdom at the time was that destinies were being driven by high-risk, high-return trading businesses tapping into a global finance boom centered largely in London.During the heyday, in fact, all three banks were led by executives who rose through the ranks on the strength of their expertise in peddling bonds and derivatives to global investors.Anshu Jain of Deutsche Bank and Robert E. Diamond at Barclays were based in London, while Brady Dougan at Credit Suisse made constant trips to the firm\u2019s office there from New York and Zurich.As regulators forced banks worldwide to cut back on risky businesses in recent years, worried boardrooms unceremoniously replaced the old guard with new leaders who were ordered to exit chancy areas that consumed the cash needed to fund new strategies in areas like wealth management.By any measure, it has not been an easy job.In a global financial environment that is both risk-averse and lacking enough ready buyers and sellers, offloading billions of dollars of mortgage securities, interest rate derivatives and leveraged loans has been a herculean task.Making the job harder is that the traders and investment bankers at these large banks are highly compensated, have big egos and are generally resistant to change.Perhaps the best way to assess a bank\u2019s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which it is required to disclose regularly. Level 3 assets are securities that because they are so opaque and complex trade very rarely, if at all.So instead of seeing where a stock, bond or more complicated item is trading now, or even a few weeks ago, and then using this information to determine how much the investment is worth, valuing a Level 3 asset requires risk managers to, quite literally, make a guess.The process has come to be known on trading desks as \u201cmark to myth\u201d as opposed to the official vernacular of mark to model.According to their 2015 annual reports, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets: 36 billion pounds for Barclays, 32 billion euros for Deutsche Bank and 31.5 billion Swiss francs for Credit Suisse.At Credit Suisse, for example, Berenberg said that Level 3 assets were 133 percent of the firm\u2019s core capital cushion. The percentage for Deutsche Bank was 96 percent and for Barclays, 49 percent.The bank\u2019s advice to investors? Sell.Since then, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have fallen by 64 percent, Credit Suisse\u2019s by 65 percent and Barclays\u2019 by 53 percent. Reflecting concerns among investors with regard to the risky assets they own, the three banks trade at steep discounts to their book value; Deutsche Bank leads the way at 70 percent.And there are few signs that the selling will let up soon, as a growing number of hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.George Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, made a multimillion-dollar wager against Deutsche Bank after the British vote to leave the European Union.His Soros Fund Management took a short position of 0.51 percent of the bank\u2019s stock on Friday, when the referendum results were announced.Marshall Wace, a London-based hedge fund, took a similar position that day.Both moves were disclosed in regulatory filings in Germany, where investors are required to disclose their short positions once they hit a threshold.In an interview on Tuesday, one of the paper\u2019s three authors, Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen, argued that the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s future in Europe made these banks an even riskier bet, as it will be all the harder to get rid of these securities in such an environment.\u201cAll this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,\u201d Mr. Riepe said. \u201cAnd because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. It\u2019s very dangerous for the banks.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.I.A. Arms for Syrian Rebels Supplied Black Market, Officials Say", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Weapons shipped into Jordan by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia intended for Syrian rebels have been systematically stolen by Jordanian intelligence operatives and sold to arms merchants on the black market, according to American and Jordanian officials.The existence of the weapons theft, which ended only months ago after complaints by the American and Saudi governments, is being reported for the first time after a joint investigation by The New York Times and Al Jazeera. The theft, involving millions of dollars of weapons, highlights the messy, unplanned consequences of programs to arm and train rebels \u2014 the kind of program the C.I.A. and Pentagon have conducted for decades \u2014 even after the Obama administration had hoped to keep the training program in Jordan under tight control.The Jordanian officers who were part of the scheme reaped a windfall from the weapons sales, using the money to buy expensive SUVs, iPhones and other luxury items, Jordanian officials said.The theft and resale of the arms \u2014 including Kalashnikov assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades \u2014 have led to a flood of new weapons available on the black arms market. Investigators do not know what became of most of them, but a disparate collection of groups, including criminal networks and rural Jordanian tribes, use the arms bazaars to build their arsenals. Weapons smugglers also buy weapons in the arms bazaars to ship outside the country.The F.B.I. investigation into the Amman shooting, run by the bureau\u2019s Washington field office, is continuing. But American and Jordanian officials said the investigators believed that the weapons a Jordanian police captain, Anwar Abu Zaid, used to gun down two American contractors, two Jordanians and one South African had originally arrived in Jordan intended for the Syrian rebel-training program.The officials said this finding had come from tracing the serial numbers of the weapons.Mohammad H. al-Momani, Jordan\u2019s minister of state for media affairs, said allegations that Jordanian intelligence officers had been involved in any weapons thefts were \u201cabsolutely incorrect.\u201d\u201cWeapons of our security institutions are concretely tracked, with the highest discipline,\u201d he said. He called the powerful Jordanian intelligence service, known as the General Intelligence Directorate, or G.I.D., \u201ca world-class, reputable institution known for its professional conduct and high degree of cooperation among security agencies.\u201d In Jordan, the head of the G.I.D. is considered the second most important man after the king.Representatives of the C.I.A. and F.B.I. declined to comment.The State Department did not address the allegations directly, but a spokesman said America\u2019s relationship with Jordan remained solid.\u201cThe United States deeply values the long history of cooperation and friendship with Jordan,\u201d said John Kirby, the spokesman. \u201cWe are committed to the security of Jordan and to partnering closely with Jordan to meet common security challenges.\u201dThe existence of the program is classified, as are all details about its budget. American officials say that the C.I.A. has trained thousands of rebels in the past three years, and that the fighters made substantial advances on the battlefield against Syrian government forces until Russian military forces \u2014 launched last year in support of Mr. Assad \u2014 compelled them to retreat.The training program is based in Jordan because of the country\u2019s proximity to the Syrian battlefields. From the beginning, the C.I.A. and the Arab intelligence agencies relied on Jordanian security services to transport the weapons, many bought in bulk in the Balkans and elsewhere around Eastern Europe.Jordanian and American officials described the weapons theft and subsequent investigation on the condition of anonymity because the Syrian rebel training is classified in the United States and is a government secret in Jordan.News of the weapons theft and eventual crackdown has been circulating inside Jordan\u2019s government for several months. Husam Abdallat, a senior aide to several past Jordanian prime ministers, said he had heard about the scheme from current Jordanian officials. The G.I.D. has some corrupt officers in its ranks, Mr. Abdallat said, but added that the institution as a whole is not corrupt. \u201cThe majority of its officers are patriotic and proud Jordanians who are the country\u2019s first line of defense,\u201d he said.Jordanian officials who described the operation said it had been run by a group of G.I.D. logistics officers with direct access to the weapons once they reached Jordan. The officers regularly siphoned truckloads of the weapons from the stocks, before delivering the rest of the weapons to designated drop-off points.Then the officers sold the weapons at several large arms markets in Jordan. The main arms bazaars in Jordan are in Ma\u2019an, in the southern part of the country; in Sahab, outside Amman; and in the Jordan Valley.It is unclear whether the current head of the G.I.D., Gen. Faisal al-Shoubaki, had knowledge of the theft of the C.I.A. and Saudi weapons. But several Jordanian intelligence officials said senior officers inside the service had knowledge of the weapons scheme and provided cover for the lower-ranking officers.Word that the weapons intended for the rebels were being bought and sold on the black market leaked into Jordan government circles last year, when arms dealers began bragging to their customers that they had large stocks of American- and Saudi-provided weapons.Jordanian intelligence operatives monitoring the arms market \u2014 operatives not involved in the weapons-diversion scheme \u2014 began sending reports to headquarters about a proliferation of weapons in the market and of the boasts of the arms dealers.After the Americans and Saudis complained about the theft, investigators at the G.I.D. arrested several dozen officers involved in the scheme, among them a lieutenant colonel running the operation. They were ultimately released from detention and fired from the service, but were allowed to keep their pensions and money they gained from the scheme, according to Jordanian officials.Jordan\u2019s decision to host the C.I.A.-led training program is the latest episode in a long partnership.Beginning in the Eisenhower administration, the C.I.A. made large payments to King Hussein, who ruled Jordan from 1952 until his death in 1999, in exchange for permission to run numerous intelligence operations on Jordanian soil.C.I.A. money and expertise also helped the king establish the G.I.D. and put down internal and external threats to his government. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States has flooded Jordan with money for various counterterrorism programs. American and Jordanian spies have run a joint counterterrorism center outside Amman, and a secret prison in Jordan housed prisoners the C.I.A. captured in the region.In his 2006 book, \u201cState of Denial,\u201d the journalist Bob Woodward recounted a 2003 conversation in which George J. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, told Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, \u201cWe created the Jordanian intelligence service, and now we own it.\u201dIt is a relationship of mutual dependence, but Jordan has particular leverage because of its location in the heart of the Middle East and its general tolerance to be used as a base of American military and intelligence operations. Jordan\u2019s security services also have a long history of trying to infiltrate Islamic militant groups, efforts that have yielded both success and failure.Two recent heads of the service, also known as the Mukhabarat, have been sent to prison on charges including embezzlement, money laundering and bank fraud. One of them, Gen. Samih Battikhi, ran the G.I.D. from 1995 to 2000 and was convicted of being part of a scheme to obtain bank loans of around $600 million for fake government contracts and pocketing about $25 million. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, but the sentence was eventually reduced to four years that were served in his villa in the seaside town of Aqaba.Gen. Mohammad al-Dahabi, who ran the service from 2005 to 2008, was later convicted of stealing millions of dollars that G.I.D. officers had seized from Iraqi citizens crossing into Jordan in the years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. His trial showed that he had also arranged for money to be smuggled in private cars from Iraq into Jordan and had been involved in sellingJordanian citizenship to Iraqi businessmen. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison and fined tens of millions of dollars.President Obama authorized the covert arming program in April 2013, after more than a year of debate inside the administration about the wisdom of using the C.I.A. to train rebels trying to oust Mr. Assad.The decision was made in part to try to gain control of a chaotic situation in which Arab countries were funneling arms into Syria for various rebel groups with little coordination. The Qataris had paid to smuggle shipments of Chinese-made FN-6 shoulder-fired weapons over the border from Turkey, and Saudi Arabia sent thousands of Kalashnikovs and millions of rounds of ammunition it had bought, sometimes with the C.I.A.\u2019s help.By late 2013, the C.I.A. was working directly with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations to arm and train small groups of rebels and send them across the border into Syria.The specific motives behind the November shooting at the Amman police training facility remain uncertain, and it is unclear when the F.B.I. will officially conclude its investigation.This year, the widows of the Americans killed in the attack sued Twitter, alleging that it knowingly permitted the Islamic State to use its social media platform to spread the militant group\u2019s violent message, recruiting and raising funds.Captain Abu Zaid, the gunman, was killed almost immediately. His brother, Fadi Abu Zaid, said in an interview that he still believed his brother was innocent and that he had given no indications he was planning to carry out the shooting.The Jordanian government, he said, has denied him any answers about the shooting, and has refused to release his brother\u2019s autopsy report.Mark Mazzetti reported from Amman and Washington, and Ali Younes from Amman, Washington and Doha, Qatar.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Much Will \u2018Brexit\u2019 Stress Banks? Some Ways to Tell", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byMoment of TruthAmong all the anxieties that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has provoked, here\u2019s another one: Are big banks going to be in trouble?Taxpayers in Europe and the United State might want to know.The Brexit vote could very well be a test of whether governments have, since the financial crisis of 2008, limited the threat that large banks pose to the wider economy.In 2008, governments around the world decided to spend huge sums bailing out their nations\u2019 banks, underscoring that they were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Brexit will go a long way toward telling us whether they still are.Today, banks are stronger. They have more capital, meaning they borrow less money to finance their loans and trading. Lower borrowing makes them more stable. The banks also have higher reserves of liquid cash they can tap into if it becomes hard to borrow money in the markets.So, how are they doing? Here are some ways to assess the stress in the financial system.The valuations on bank stocks also look awful, particularly a yardstick called the price-to-book ratio. This effectively compares a bank\u2019s market value with its net worth as stated in its balance sheet. If that ratio is below one, it suggests investors are skeptical about the bank. Deutsche Bank is trading at around 30 percent of its net worth, a big discount. In the United States, Bank of America is trading at just under 60 percent of its book value, a ratio even lower than in 2009, when losses from the financial crisis were still piling up.But it can be a mistake to think that a bank is in dire trouble because its stock is slumping or its valuation looks sickly. The declines might reflect investors\u2019 belief that it will be harder for the banks to make profits in the future, particularly if Brexit leads to a recession. Or it may be a signal that the market believes the bank will have to break itself up, or sell operations, to become more streamlined. But this is something a bank can do without help from the taxpayer.Let\u2019s look at the swaps on UniCredit, a large Italian bank. An investor on one side of the credit default swap makes a payment to an investor on the other side of the swap. The investor making the payment stands to receive a big payout if UniCredit defaults. That probably won\u2019t happen, of course. But if the cost of that insurance against default rises because of fears stirred up by an event like the Brexit crisis, the investor who bought the insurance against default before the crisis, when it was cheaper, can now sell the swap for a profit.And what is this swaps market telling us now about the banks? The good news: The costs of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging.But if the Brexit crisis pushes European banks to use such loans, it may be hard to track how much they are borrowing. One of the ways in which Greek banks were helped last year during the country\u2019s debt crisis was through a loan facility called the emergency liquidity assistance. But the European Central Bank, and some national central banks, typically do not break out exactly how much each country is borrowing under that loan program, which added to the confusion last year.Why do these loans matter in assessing what the Brexit crisis tells us about too-big-to-fail?So far, those who contend that the post-recession banking overhaul has significantly strengthened the system are winning the debate. Further evidence for their position: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that all but one of the United States\u2019 largest banks had unconditionally passed annual stress tests, and were thus allowed to distribute money to their shareholders. But it\u2019s too early to see if the overhaul has succeeded. The real test would be whether a major European country that uses the euro \u2014 Britain does not \u2014 voted to follow Britain out of the European Union.It\u2019s a frightening prospect, but it might take that to really test whether the too-big-to-fail banks can fail.Advertisement"}
