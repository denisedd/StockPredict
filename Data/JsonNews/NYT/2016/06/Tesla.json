{"Headline": "Sungevity, a Solar Panel Provider, to Go Public in Merger", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported bySungevity, one of the leading national providers of rooftop solar panels, plans to merge with an asset management firm to become a publicly traded company, executives said Wednesday.The merger with Easterly Acquisition, which is expected to be approved later this year, would give Sungevity easier access to financing to help expand its business, with a goal of bringing solar panels to every house, said Andrew Birch, the solar company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.Since its founding in 2007, the company has rapidly expanded, but its market share has lagged behind publicly traded competitors like SolarCity and Sunrun, according to data compiled by GTM Research, which tracks the solar industry. The deal with Easterly, which is putting about $200 million into Sungevity, is intended to bring more mutual funds and global institutional investors into the mix.\u201cSolar\u2019s now an economic proposition for tens of millions of homes across the markets that we serve, so the challenge for the industry now is, how do we scale?\u201d Mr. Birch said. The Easterly plan, he added, \u201cgives us access to the public market, and it gives us access to investors who are looking for exposure to that adoption curve.\u201dBut Sungevity\u2019s business model is simpler, requires less capital and should prove more appealing, said Darrell Crate, chairman of Easterly, which, in a similar transaction, created a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, develops and manages government-leased properties.Sungevity \u2014 which operates in 13 states, Washington D.C. and Europe \u2014 focuses on using software to assess sites for solar and then to design, monitor and manage the systems and customer relationships. It relies on a network of partners to handle financing and installation, rather than using its own employees and equipment.\u201cPublic shareholders appreciate simplicity, transparency and clarity,\u201d Mr. Crate said. \u201cThe wisdom of making this a software-based, technology-enabled company allows them to scale and capture the revenue growth without having to grow head count at an equal rate.\u201dExecutives said they expected the merger to go through by the end of the year, when Mr. Birch said he anticipated his company would break even. On approval, Sungevity\u2019s outstanding equity and convertible debt will become shares of Easterly common stock, and Easterly will change its name to Sungevity Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of states in which the solar panel provider Sungevity operates. It is 13, not 12.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Testing the Clean-Energy Logic of a Tesla-SolarCity Merger", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byImagine a world in which every home and building is a miniature power plant, with solar panels on the roofs and electric vehicles and stationary battery banks in the garages.Meters and software would manage the flow of power, allowing homeowners and businesses to seamlessly buy and sell electricity at the best prices, simultaneously lowering their costs and raising the amount of green energy on the grid.That\u2019s the long-term vision behind the plan that Elon Musk described late Tuesday, explaining the rationale for Tesla to acquire SolarCity and create the \u201cworld\u2019s only vertically integrated energy company.\u2019\u2019And it may very well become reality, whether in years or decades, and whether Mr. Musk\u2019s version of the vision is one that proves viable.Still, if Mr. Musk and his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, can trounce the competition and surmount their financial woes \u2014 and those are very big ifs \u2014 the integrated company they are trying to assemble could be in a position to dominate.\u201cThis is an effort to build the Apple of clean energy,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat really is part of the new wave of companies that could make this decarbonization addressing climate change really work.\u201dWall Street, at least for the moment, is not on board.SolarCity\u2019s stock, which has been trading at roughly a quarter of its peak value in recent months, rose after the announcement. But Tesla\u2019s has tumbled. Several analysts and investors have questioned the wisdom of adding to both companies\u2019 financial pressures \u2014 between them the companies lost more than $1.6 billion last year \u2014 and potentially distracting Tesla from building its enormous battery factory in Nevada and bringing its first moderately priced car to market next year.Even some energy analysts say the proposed acquisition is at least as much about helping Mr. Musk\u2019s personal investments as furthering his green agenda. But, some energy experts and investors say, there is logic in combining Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, and SolarCity, where he is chairman.Describing Tesla automobiles as \u201cbatteries wrapped in a car,\u201d Shawn Kravetz, founder of the solar power investment company Esplanade Capital, said that the energy storage business was likely to become colossal. \u201cAnd so you can see,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018how the electricity to power those batteries can be an essential part of this.\u201dThe two companies have been moving toward a closer partnership for some time. SolarCity began installing Tesla batteries in pilot projects for residential and commercial customers about four years ago. Last year, Tesla announced its move to market rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that could mount to a home garage wall, as well as battery blocks large enough to power commercial and industrial customers and serve in utility-scale installations to smooth out fluctuations in the grid.At the same time, SolarCity, after years of challenging the utility industry to innovate or die, started acting more like a utility itself. It began a program aimed at cities, remote communities, campuses and military bases to design and operate small, independent power networks called microgrids. At the time, Peter Rive, one of the company\u2019s founders and its chief technical officer, called the system \u201ca template that can be scaled up to basically be the next-generation grid.\u201dAs the leading rooftop solar provider in the country, SolarCity is thought to have the largest collection of data on how solar customers use energy at every minute of the day. With that data \u2014 especially if combined with information from electric cars, chargers and stationary batteries \u2014 the combined company could be well suited to creating products and services based on customer needs.\u201cThey deeply understand what the customer\u2019s usage patterns are,\u201d said Swapnil Shah, chief executive of FirstFuel Software, which provides energy management services to buildings. He compared the potential to Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt and customize online shopping to buyer\u2019s behavior.\u201cThey\u2019re creating unique personalized profiles of your habits,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shah said, \u201cand they use that to identify what is the next click for the next product.\u201dAnd yet, while SolarCity was building the infrastructure for a new, decentralized approach to power production known as distributed generation, while earning a reputation for aggressive attacks on the old-school utility industry, Mr. Musk was turning Tesla into \u201cthe brand that everyone wants to buy,\u201d Mr. Kammen said. That brand burnishing is something that could benefit SolarCity, he said.But a big challenge for Tesla, said Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which focuses on clean energy industries, is that it is not the only company with such a grand vision. Utility industry stalwarts like Edison International and Con Edison are developing energy services and consulting divisions, while technology giants like General Electric, Oracle, Google and even Apple are getting into the business of providing or managing power.Of course, the merger plan may not go through, if other investors balk and because of the corporate governance and other issues arising from Mr. Musk\u2019s roles in both companies. He also owns more than 20 percent of each. But maybe a merger isn\u2019t necessary to achieve the larger goals.\u201cDo you have to own things in order to leverage or even to a certain extent control them?\u201d Mr. Kravetz of Esplanade Capital asked. \u201cI think the answer is no. You don\u2019t have to own the cow to get the milk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The grass died off in the heat of the past couple of months, and is now fueling fires.The Traditionalist Worker Party had a permit for the rally.

But shareholders in SolarCity pushed the company\u2019s stock up 19 percent in after-hours trading, to $25.26. Shares of Tesla, however, tumbled more than 13 percent, to $190.59.Both companies have been growing fast, but have also consumed enormous amounts of cash to pursue their goals.Of the two, SolarCity \u2014 where Mr. Musk is chairman and his cousin, the co-founder Lyndon Rive, is chief executive \u2014 has been the more troubled, buffeted by changes in the regulations on the solar energy industry. While an important federal tax credit was extended, local policies have cut into the savings that solar providers have promised.Mr. Musk said putting the two companies together made more sense after Tesla began introducing rechargeable batteries for home use that can store electricity and smooth out fluctuations in power grids. Other renewable energy companies have also focused on home storage products.Analysts have commented that Tesla\u2019s main business may be in batteries, particularly as it builds out its $5 billion \u201cGigafactory\u201d near Reno, Nev.\u201cThe world does not lack for automotive companies,\u201d Mr. Musk said in Tuesday\u2019s press call. \u201cThe world lacks for sustainable energy companies.\u201dYet some green energy companies have run aground. Both SunEdison and Abengoa, big renewable energy providers, have filed for bankruptcy.SolarCity\u2019s troubles have left the company with a crushing $2.6 billion in long-term debt and growing losses. Last year, interest payments on its debt equaled nearly a quarter of its sales.Shares of the energy company have fallen 63 percent over the last 12 months, closing on Tuesday at $21.19 \u2014 nearly a third of its 52-week high. The business ended Tuesday with a market value of just over $2 billion.Last year, SolarCity\u2019s operations used up $790 million of cash, and the company spent $1.8 billion on equipment. In total, then, SolarCity\u2019s free cash flow, obtained by adding those two numbers, was a negative $2.6 billion.Tesla has had a better run of news over the last year, including promising presale numbers for the coming Model 3 sedan.Still, Tesla shares, once a Wall Street darling, have fallen 16 percent over the last 12 months, valuing the company at $32.7 billion.Tesla may be able to help SolarCity generate more cash or reduce its cash consumption. But bolstering the business model of SolarCity would be difficult.And a struggling SolarCity could be a burden on Tesla, which is also using up cash fast. Tesla\u2019s free cash flow last year was a negative $2.2 billion. In theory, then, a combination of Tesla and SolarCity would have burned nearly $5 billion last year.Investors are willing to lend to, or buy the stock of, a high-growth company consuming a lot of cash if they believe it will eventually generate healthy cash flows.But if investors balk, the company has to rely on its cash reserves. Together, Tesla and SolarCity had $1.8 billion on hand at the end of the first quarter. That would soon get used up if a Tesla-SolarCity were still consuming nearly $5 billion of cash annually.Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Tesla Owner, Losing a Wheel Was Just the First Surprise", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byPete Cordaro was creeping down a dirt road in his 2013 Tesla Model S electric car, on a Sunday outing with his wife to hunt mushrooms in the Pennsylvania woods, when he encountered a pothole and then heard a loud crack.\u201cThe front of the car just dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cThe left front wheel just detached from the car.\u201dWhen Tesla picked up his car, Mr. Cordaro was at first told he would have to pay for the repairs because they were from normal wear. After pressing his case with a Tesla manager, he was told the company would pay part of the cost \u2014 as long as he signed a nondisclosure agreement.Neither the equipment breakdown nor the confidentiality demand turned out to be an isolated case. And now they have Tesla Motors on the defensive.The company acknowledged having had car owners sign such agreements, and said it did so to protect itself from potential lawsuits after performing a repair at a discount or at no charge.But the practice has raised concerns that it could prevent owners from reporting safety problems to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which called Tesla\u2019s use of such agreements \u201ctroublesome,\u201d and told the company not to use terms that dissuade people from reporting safety concerns to the agency.On Friday, a Tesla spokeswoman said in an email that \u201cto remove any doubt,\u201d the automaker would modify the language of the documents to make clear that the goal \u201cis to benefit customers, while not harming us for doing a good deed.\u201d She did not elaborate on how it would be changed.The safety agency said in a statement that the changes were satisfactory, without elaborating. It described its review of the Model S suspension as \u201ca routine data collection,\u201d adding that it had not found any safety issues so far and that Tesla was cooperating.In agreements like the one Mr. Cordaro signed, Tesla refers to the repairs as a \u201cgesture of good will,\u201d made without \u201cany admission of liability or wrongdoing or acceptance of any facts.\u201dThat statement alone is uncontroversial. It is standard legalese protecting Tesla from admitting any wrongdoing by way of making a repair, said David Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University and a former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.But he said two other provisions in the contract were problematic in that they seemed to muzzle consumers: asking car owners to waive the right to future legal action and to keep the entire incident confidential.\u201cYou agree to keep confidential our provision of the good will, the terms of this agreement and the incidents or claims leading or related to our provision of the good will,\u201d the Tesla document said.Tesla said it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d to suggest that it was trying to prevent owners from reporting safety problems to N.H.T.S.A. or any other government agency. But Mr. Vladeck said that distinction was unimportant. \u201cMost reasonable consumers would interpret this as a provision prohibiting them from talking to anyone, including government or lawyers or anybody else,\u201d he said.Tesla was founded in 2003 with the idea of establishing battery-powered cars as a viable emissions-free replacement for the internal combustion engine, and challenging many auto industry conventions. It sells cars directly to customers without franchised dealers, a practice that has led to legal battles in several states.The company is also building a gigantic battery factory in Nevada and often announces news in Twitter posts by Mr. Musk.The use of nondisclosure agreements with customers appears to be highly unusual in the auto industry. Ford, General Motors and Toyota all said they did not have customers sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for fixing cars that have broken down.Joan Claybrook, a former head of N.H.T.S.A., said requiring customers to keep quiet about repairs aroused suspicion. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019d do that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes it seem like they want to cover something up.\u201dNews of Mr. Cordaro\u2019s breakdown and the nondisclosure agreement he signed was trumpeted by auto bloggers tracking suspension problems in the Model S, a luxury sedan whose pricing starts at about $70,000.The N.H.T.S.A. website lists 33 complaints received since October about suspension failures in the car, Tesla\u2019s top-selling model.Mr. Cordaro, an auto enthusiast who used to make hot rod cars, said Friday that he did not think the agreement barred him from talking to the safety agency or anyone else about the breakdown his car suffered in late April. When he reviewed it, Mr. Cordaro concluded that \u201cit was basically toothless,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only keeps me from talking about the costs and filing a lawsuit.\u201dIn fact, he posted a short video on YouTube showing the broken ball joint from his car.Once his car was repaired and returned, he filed details of his suspension issue with the safety agency, and a few weeks later got the broken ball joint from Tesla and sent it on to N.H.T.S.A.But he was nevertheless upset with how Tesla has dealt with what he thinks could pose a serious safety concern. \u201cIf it had happened on the highway, it could have been catastrophic,\u201d Mr. Cordaro, 61, said by phone while driving his Model S.The owner of a vending machine company in Connellsville, Pa., about 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, he said he was a Tesla fan and had already put down deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when they come out in a year or so. \u201cI just want them to look into this and do the right thing,\u201d he said.Mr. Cordaro said he was further annoyed because Tesla, in its blog post about the Model S suspension and confidentiality agreements, suggested his breakdown had resulted from hard driving.The company said he lived on a long dirt road and noted that his car was \u201ccaked with mud\u201d when it was picked up \u2014 information that Mr. Cordaro called \u201ca fabrication.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t out four-wheeling in the car,\u201d he said. \u201cI live on an asphalt road and have maybe driven on dirt roads 10 times.\u201dA Tesla spokeswoman said the company was looking into the matter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Divide in Income and Politics", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 The image of Silicon Valley in most minds is one of technological invention, great wealth and even greater entitlement, a place where a bungalow costs $3 million and people go to work in smoked-windowed buses equipped with Wi-Fi plying U.S.-101 alongside Teslas, Lamborghinis and vintage English motorcycles.There is, however, a less glamorous Silicon Valley, inhabited by brainy young people whose long hours power the big companies and whose college debt is so heavy that some of them can\u2019t even qualify for a credit card.The Valley is divided, and in political terms that division is mirrored to a great extent in the way Democrats here feel about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as the two battle to the wire in the California primary.Technology has matured, and most of the industry\u2019s leaders seem to want what Wall Street and other titans want: lower taxes, favorable trade rules and, most of all, stability. This year, among richly compensated Democrats, one percenters on up, that tilts the scale toward Mrs. Clinton.The young techies are a different story. Many are feeling the Bern, and many have registered as \u201cN.P.P.\u201d (no party preference) voters, ready for a political revolution.Here is one such voter, Gina Brunelli, on the subject, before a Sanders rally in Palo Alto: \u201cWhat turns me off about Hillary is that she\u2019s a voice for big corporations and big business, where Bernie is a voice for people. The conversations he\u2019s started are worth it,\u201d she says, meaning conversations about income inequality and college debt.Ron Turiello, a founder of the Voter Genome Project, a political microtargeting outfit, and a progressive who has backed President Obama since his Senate campaign, says he, too, would vote for Mr. Sanders as more in tune with concerns about economic justice, whereas Mrs. Clinton seems more the pro-business, pro-status quo candidate. He fears that if she becomes president, Silicon Valley\u2019s heavy hitters \u2014 Big Tech \u2014 will draw the Democratic Party rightward on taxes, regulation and labor issues.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of philanthropy out here,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a sense of \u2018stay out of our way, and let us run our business.\u2019 There are strong labor unions out here, like for teachers \u2014 but not in technology.\u201dThe idea that Mrs. Clinton is less likely than Mr. Sanders to let government get in the way of the Valley\u2019s creativity and enterprise is one of her strongest selling points. Another is her pedigree as a Washington insider.Al Gore, Bill Clinton\u2019s vice president, was the White House\u2019s ambassador to the tech community and helped connect public schools to the internet. In the years since, battles over net neutrality, intellectual property and privacy have shown companies here the value of friends in Washington. This has helped raise millions for Mrs. Clinton, with more on the way.Michelle Kraus, managing partner of Technology & Politics, a global technology industry advisory firm, is a big Clinton fund-raiser and a fervent supporter. What worries her is that infighting \u2014 and the reluctance among many Sanders supporters to entertain compromise \u2014 could do lasting damage to the party. This contest, she says, has seen the factions within the Democratic Party \u201cspin themselves into whirling dervishes,\u201d with each faction choosing a small set of issues, as a kind of litmus test, to the exclusion of all others.\u201cDo we have to change the criminal justice system? Yes. Do we have to work on retraining the work force? You betcha. Do we have to end some of the outsourcing? Yeah. Do we have to work on race relations in this country? Oh yeah, big time. But there\u2019s enough room at the table to be heard.\u201dShould Mrs. Clinton win the presidency, she says, Mr. Sanders could be \u201ca beacon to enlarge the tent, to take us forward and backward, to the kinds of coalitions the party has always stood for. Working class. Immigrants. Diversity. With benefits for all.\u201dBut peace in the party is essential, she says.\u201cI\u2019m praying, hoping, wishing and dreaming that we, as my grandmother used to say, get ahold of ourselves. Because there is just too much at stake.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warriors, Tech\u2019s Team, Are Soaring Out of Reach", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 As soon as I got to Oracle Arena last week for the first game of the N.B.A. finals, I started scanning the floor for tech bigwigs.Now, in Oakland, the Golden State Warriors have \u2026 Eddy Cue.In other words, you can almost see the Warriors as a metaphor for the way the tech industry improves, but also unexpectedly risks ruining, pretty much everything it touches.\u201cOne of the tensions that exists with the Warriors now is the owners seem to have a feeling that, \u2018Oh, we bought this team, they got really good, but we do live in a market where there are people who are accustomed to paying ever-increasing prices for everything, so let\u2019s raise the prices for our tickets,\u2019\u201d said Josh Williams, a designer and basketball fanatic who holds Warriors season tickets. \u201cI do have a real concern that we might price out the quote-unquote real fans.\u201dMr. Williams is a recent convert to Warriors fandom. He moved to the Bay Area from Austin, Tex., a few years ago after selling his start-up, Gowalla, to Facebook. His seats, in the upper corner of the arena, cost about $50 a game, and are set to go up by about 40 percent next season.Prices have become a bigger issue in the last few weeks, as the Warriors landed in the finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. For the finals, the team sent prices through the roof.Given the prices and the team\u2019s connection with tech, I expected the crowd at Warriors games to resemble a venture capital firm\u2019s cocktail party \u2014 young, vaguely geeky, demure business types, mostly white, mostly men. I also felt a sense of embarrassment for jumping on the bandwagon. A couple of years ago, I barely knew the rules of basketball, but as the team kept defying odds and breaking records, I got a bad case of Warriors fever.Yet the crowd at the two games I attended this year, including the first finals game, was not a bunch of bandwagoners like myself. Warriors fandom is one of the few Bay Area experiences that still seems to cut across a wide swath of the population. The people who attend the games seem diverse in just about every way \u2014 by race, age, willingness to yell out and make a fool of oneself \u2014 except one: pretty much everyone wears a yellow Warriors T-shirt, and pretty much everyone looks overjoyed to be there.Katie Jansen, the chief marketing officer of a start-up called AppLovin, which owns a suite at the arena that it shares with employees and customers, echoed that idea.\u201cI\u2019ve met the owners of a suite a few suites down from us, and it\u2019s literally a bunch of Oakland natives, a group of men who\u2019ve been Warriors fans their whole lives, and they\u2019ve owned this box for 30 years,\u201d she said.Many of the techies who now flock to Oakland told me they love this vibe. \u201cThere is a real die-hard fan base there in Oakland, and there\u2019s something special happening in that arena right now,\u201d said Craig Butler, Spotify\u2019s newly hired vice president for engineering, who owns season tickets with a few of his buddies. \u201cThe energy level at Oracle right now is double what it is anywhere else \u2014 it\u2019s just the best show in town.\u201dAnd according to the team, the fan base isn\u2019t changing. Despite price increases, about 99.5 percent of season ticket holders decided to renew for next year \u2014 meaning only 23 people did not renew. The wait-list for season tickets is now over 30,000 names long. Many fans are likely gratified by the fact that their tickets are a good investment even at current prices.On average last year, Warriors tickets could be resold for 119 percent above face price, so a $100 ticket would fetch $219 on the secondary market, meaning that if you bought a season\u2019s pass and sold half your tickets, you would most likely recoup your investment.But how do you preserve the fan base as the entry price rises? The problem for the Warriors resembles, in broad strokes, the problem of housing in the Bay Area. There is a finite supply of tickets to the games, and in an industry that produces astonishing wealth, there will always be enough people with enough money to pay nearly any price for tickets.Basketball is a business, of course, and it is within the Warriors owners\u2019 rights to profit from the team\u2019s amazing success.\u201cMost people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on something, they want to get a return on their investment,\u201d Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who studies sports at Smith College, told me with some exasperation when I asked him if there was some way for the team to avoid raising prices and changing its fan culture now that it has found success.Another plan would be to increase ticket prices only on the wealthy. Mr. Williams, a lifelong fan of the Dallas Mavericks, pointed out that when Mark Cuban, another tech billionaire, purchased and revitalized that team, he went out of his way to keep ticket prices low.\u201cOne year my season tickets cost $24 a ticket, and I got my renewal package and they had dropped the price to $14,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt turned out what Mark was doing was jacking up the price on the lower bowl, where he knew the purchases were corporations, and reducing the price on the real fans upstairs.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Cuban confirmed that strategy.\u201cWe have decreased prices across the board multiple times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only tickets that have gone up marginally are our best seats.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t run the Mavs to maximize profits. We now make money. But it\u2019s more important to me that fans can always afford to come to games.\u201dWell, how\u2019s that for disruption?An earlier version of this column misstated the average percentage increase at which Warriors tickets could be resold last year. It was 119 percent above face price, not 119 percent of face price.Advertisement"}

The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cNobody is interested,\u201d said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his father-in-law\u2019s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1,500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer.Mr. Di Maria said that his father-in-law, who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford F-150 pickup.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to drive around in a big tank?\u201d Mr. Di Maria said. \u201cWhen people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?\u201dBuyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether.Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americans\u2019 views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology.When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325,000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M.I.T., was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in low-emission cars.\u201cAll my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,\u201d he said. \u201c I thought, this is great news.\u201dYears from now, he added, \u201cwe will look at this as a watershed moment.\u201dOthers who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car.When he gives speeches and is asked how the electric-car market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dSeconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation. At the time, he was on a flight from Newark to Los Angeles, and worried that he would miss out if the plane\u2019s Wi-Fi went down.He called the car a \u201cgame changer\u201d because it has everything he wants \u2014 it is cool, beautiful and powerful, he said, as well as being environmentally friendly.\u201cI could\u2019ve bought a Prius before,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would have if it looked like an Audi.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with a photograph of Angelo Di Maria and his father-in-law misidentified the men.

For example:\u25a0 At this valuation, Uber is worth $10 billion more than Ford, $20 billion more than General Motors, and twice as much as Tesla. It\u2019s worth more than three times as much as American Airlines, and four times as much as United Airlines. That sounds like a lot, provided Uber someday turns those make-believe values into real ones.\u25a0 Driving from San Francisco to San Jose, the span of the Silicon Valley, costs about $200 on Uber. For the price of its investment, Saudi Arabia could treat its entire population of 31 million to that ride, if folks didn\u2019t mind doubling up. Or one Saudi could just go across Midtown Manhattan 2 billion times. That\u2019s a lot.Admittedly, some of these comparisons are absurd. It is just not entirely clear which ones. If Uber is really changing both transportation and work worldwide, maybe Saudi Arabia just bought into something bigger than we can imagine.

He will be deeply missed by his sister, Peggy Thomson (Tim) of Germantown,\n                                        Tennessee; his brother, John Riley (Maryellen) of Arlington Heights, Illinois; and his six nieces and nephews. George was preceded in death by his parents, Dr. Frances Riley and Dr. George A. Riley, both physicians\n                                        in Memphis for many years. George was born on March 9, 1957, and grew up in Memphis. In 1975, he graduated from Whitehaven High School, where he was an active student leader for civil rights causes--a commitment\n                                        to justice and public service he maintained throughout his life. George attributed that commitment to his chance meeting, as a young boy, with civil rights activist James Meredith shortly before Meredith was shot\n                                        on June 6, 1966, while marching from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. In 1979, George graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and began working with consumer advocate Ralph Nader. During that time, George\n                                        and Carl J Mayer co-authored the book Public Domain, Private Dominion: A History of Public Mineral Policy in America, about land use regulation by the Department of the Interior. In 1983, George graduated cum laude\n                                        from Harvard Law School, where he was instrumental in establishing the Harvard Fellowship in Public Interest Law. After law school, George returned to Memphis to clerk for the Honorable Judge Bailey Brown (U.S.\n                                        Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit). In the mid-1980&aposs, George moved to San Francisco, where he became special assistant to the San Francisco City Attorney and handled many of the city&aposs most significant\n                                        cases, including an action to open a local social club&aposs membership to women and minorities. In 1993, George joined the San Francisco office of O&aposMelveny & Myers, an international law firm, becoming\n                                        a prominent partner and one of the country&aposs top intellectual property litigators. Known for his inexhaustible preparation and his eloquence in the courtroom, George was an invaluable global advisor to many\n                                        iconic companies, including Apple, Samsung and Tesla. He shared an extremely special bond with Apple founder Steve Jobs and his family. George&aposs high-profile clientele never diminished his commitment to the\n                                        less fortunate. He donated hundreds of hours working with the Mississippi Center for Justice to help individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina and others who faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. Throughout\n                                        his life, George&aposs love of running fueled his participation in countless long-distance races, creating many lasting friendships along the way. A cherished friend to so many, George always carved out time in\n                                        his demanding schedule to counsel them on personal matters and share his passions for classical and sacred music, literature and Civil War history. Despite traveling the world, George&aposs humility and Southern\n                                        grace never waned. He returned to Memphis every February to run his favorite race, the Mike Cody Four Mile Classic, benefiting Rhodes College. George&aposs premature passing is a tremendous loss to all who knew\n                                        him. He defined generosity in mind, body and soul.

A few months back, Airbnb highlighted those terms, and older users were compelled to show that they were aware of the rights they were losing by listing with Airbnb.What Airbnb did not do was disclose how many clients it had who did seem to be renting out large blocks of real estate for long periods of time. That would have been simple for such a data-driven outfit, but that detail occupied little of the debate.The class-action waiver is particularly important where discrimination is concerned. Class-actions are a strong tool in discrimination cases, as the significance of the number of participants reinforces the idea that a systemic ill is being promulgated. It is the kind of thing that has helped ease discrimination by hotels and real estate brokers \u2014 Airbnb\u2019s old-economy counterparts.For its part, Airbnb says it is committed to ending discrimination, noting that it has kicked off hosts who discriminated against an African-American and a transgendered woman.What it hasn\u2019t done, yet, is show a policy that is superior to existing legal remedies, though an outside adviser to Airbnb tells Ms. Benner that it doesn\u2019t need the kind of pressures older companies needed to do the right thing. Apparently the new breed of companies are simply better, and don\u2019t do that kind of thing.Maybe. But Airbnb is hardly alone among tech companies in curbing the rights of the public on which it relies.Employees at tech companies are frequently bound by nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements that may follow them for years after they leave these companies \u2014 so, frequently, are contractors and government officials who work with the tech companies. While some of that may be understandable, nondisclosures in tech have few parallels elsewhere in the private sector.Tech is an industry supposedly built on the idea that transparency and information sharing make a better world for us all.

A suspension breakdown can cause severe steering problems and make driving impossible, according to filings listed on the agency\u2019s website.A few of the complaints pertained to a requirement that owners sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for having their cars repaired. The suspension problems and the issue of the nondisclosure agreements have also been discussed on blogs for Tesla owners.The company reported that in 2015, it sold 25,200 Model S cars, which have a starting price of about $70,000.Tesla\u2019s first model, the two-seat Roadster, which was produced from 2008 to 2011, also had its problems.At Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last month, Elon Musk, the company\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that the Roadster had been plagued by a number of issues.\u201cThis car, even though it met all regulatory requirements, it was completely unsafe, broke down all the time and really didn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Musk said.Two years ago, the safety administration looked into two instances in which Model S cars caught fire. It determined that the fires were caused by road debris striking the vehicle\u2019s underside, and closed the matter after Tesla agreed to reinforce the shield that protects the battery.For most of its 13-year history, Tesla has tried to break away from many standard auto industry practices, a strategy that at times courts controversy. Its practice of selling its cars online without dealers has led to court battles in several states. The company is also building a gigantic battery factory in Nevada and often announces news via tweets by Mr. Musk.\u201cEverything they do, they try to do differently than the traditional auto company, but they all have to deal with the same rules,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the firm Autotrader.Ms. Krebs said she had never heard of a car company requiring customers to sign confidentiality agreements in exchange for repairs of potential safety defects. \u201cIt does raise eyebrows,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may have happened before. I\u2019ve just never seen it.\u201dIn its statement about the inquiry, the N.H.T.S.A. did not elaborate on the extent or details of Tesla\u2019s use of nondisclosure agreements. But according to accounts posted online, some customers who complained about suspension problems had their cars fixed on the condition that they agreed in writing not to talk about the issue or how the company dealt with it.The agreement posted on the blog released Tesla from any liability and barred the car owners from filing legal proceedings against the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Publisher in Exile Gets the Big Scoops on China\u2019s Elite", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBut Mr. Ho, a native of Mao Zedong\u2019s home province, Hunan, is not the least bit worried about meeting the same fate. Now 50, he has spent three decades cultivating close ties with Chinese officials, business executives and scholars, producing some spectacular scoops. And should he ever run afoul of the Communist Party, he has a sound strategy for staying out of the clutches of China\u2019s police: his address.Nassau County, Long Island.\u201cAmerica will not send me back to China,\u201d Mr. Ho said in an interview in Flushing, Queens, a favorite meeting spot of his not far from his office in Great Neck, N.Y.By the early 1980s, at 17, he was an editor at the provincial state radio broadcaster. By the time he was 21, he was the news director for a paper in the southern city Shenzhen.It was there that he started talking to some of the most powerful people in the country. Some leaders came through the subtropical city to escape the harsh Beijing winters. Others came to learn more about capitalism: Adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen was a special zone with the freest economy in the country.Those contacts paid off four years later, when Mr. Ho set off to Beijing, this time as a special correspondent for Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, to write about the Tiananmen Square protests. Every official, it seemed, was aghast that the government had declared martial law, and all of them wanted to talk to the young reporter from the south.\u201cThese officials provided me a lot of very special details,\u201d Mr. Ho recalled, speaking in Mandarin with a slight Hunanese accent.After the bloody crackdown on June 4, 1989, Mr. Ho became a wanted man, as the authorities sought to find out who had spoken to him. Warned by friends of his imminent arrest, he slipped across the border to Macau, then a Portuguese enclave, and later moved on to Canada, where he began his career in publishing.Mr. Ho was soon drawn to Long Island, where a Taiwan-based paper had an office. He has been in the United States for nearly a quarter-century now, but rarely speaks English.There\u2019s not much need in Flushing, one of the epicenters of a thriving Chinese \u00e9migr\u00e9 community that is making New York what Paris was to White Russians in the 1920s, with all the intrigue.Some of that intrigue centers on Mr. Ho, as scholars and publishers wonder how he manages to walk a fine line between China\u2019s contentious interest groups.\u201cUnlike his competition, Ho Pin has an impressive track record of accurately forecasting leadership successions and breaking important stories,\u201d said Prof. Minxin Pei, who studies Chinese elite politics at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cThe only concern I have is whether he is being used by his sources inside the Chinese regime. If he is, he could get into serious trouble because the rivals of his sources must not be very happy about what he has been doing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether they contributed to freedom of speech or if they spoiled it,\u201d Mr. Bao said of Mirror.But if Mr. Ho is an agent of his sources, it is hard to tell who they may be. On the one hand, he can be complimentary of China\u2019s politicians, saying, for example, that Mr. Xi still has the chance to become a great leader. He is also highly critical of people who say Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties are in grave danger from Beijing, arguing that many people in the former British colony exaggerate the threat. The greatest danger to liberty in Hong Kong lies with the tendency of Hong Kong\u2019s media toward self-censorship, he says.Mirror\u2019s flagship bookstore in Hong Kong, up one floor from a busy city street, is still in business, unlike so many of its competitors, which are falling victim to a relentless long-term campaign by the Communist Party to stifle the supply of and demand for publications critical of the country\u2019s leadership.But if Mr. Ho speaks of some leaders and policies with respect and circumspection, his critique of the Chinese Communist Party is scathing. He likens China today to a virus, saying it will increasingly use its financial power to undermine democracy around the world.Despite his critique, Mr. Ho has chosen not to become a United States citizen. By his reckoning, if he did, his well-placed sources in China would then think he was representing America.\u201cI have a country,\u201d he said. \u201cChina.\u201dKiki Zhao and Charlotte Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Kenneth Lerer, the venture capitalist who helped found The Huffington Post and is the chairman at BuzzFeed, and Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial, are being considered, according to people briefed on the discussions. Also on the list are Judith McHale, the former Discovery Communications chief, and Thomas J. May, the chairman of Eversource Energy utility company, these people said. It is unclear whether these people have formally accepted the positions. The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 board being illegitimate. There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed. If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws. Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in. Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash, but because it is so hard for banks to know the identity of the final customer, remittances companies and their agents are being categorized as high risk for money laundering.

Last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering and shut down its Banamex USA Unit. AmeriMex Communications, a company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, said Don Aldridge, AmeriMex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would not be a bad thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daniel L.

She was 68.The cause was pancreatic cancer, her brother, Douglas Jones Jr., said.Appointed in 1998 to a newly created post, Ms. Smith was the first person to head the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s agency for commercial space transportation.She oversaw the rule-making for human spaceflight in privately developed programs and for reusable launch vehicles, and she retained her office\u2019s jurisdiction over suborbital space travel, rather than ceding it to aviation officials who were more likely to impose stricter protocols.In an email, Elon Musk, the PayPal and Tesla entrepreneur who founded SpaceX, a company that has developed launch vehicles, wrote that Ms. Smith had \u201chelped lay the foundations for a new era in American spaceflight.\u201d\u201cWe are closer to becoming a multiplanet species because of her efforts,\u201d he added.Ms. Smith said it was important to build an unambiguous regulatory framework in which business could flourish.The agency\u2019s primary goal, Mr. Muncy said, was \u201cto protect the public, national security and foreign policy.\u201d But after that, he said, Ms. Smith\u2019s focus was on licensing, \u201cbiased toward allowing people to risk their own money and their own lives and a mandate to encourage, facilitate and promote the growth of the industry.\u201dAn English major in college, Ms. Smith might have seemed an unlikely pioneer in the rarefied, mostly male vanguard of private investors and scientists who would become captivated by the potential of space travel.But rocketry was table talk in her native Alabama. (The Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, site of the Marshall Space Flight Center, is a major employer in the state.) And it was a place where she learned to overcome limits imposed by others. She gained valuable experience, she said, as a young black woman immersed in Macon County\u2019s protracted legal struggle to integrate her all-white high school in the mid-1960s.In her public speaking, Ms. Smith was a proselytizer for space travel.\u201cWhat really gets me excited,\u201d she said, \u201cis thinking about the endgame: the opportunity to explore it, to one day inhabit it and create a civilization that includes all the lessons learned from living on Earth \u2014 to one day getting it right.\u201dPatricia Grace Jones was born in Tuskegee, Ala., on Nov. 10, 1947. Her father, Douglas Sr., managed the canteen at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tuskegee after retiring from the Air Force. Her mother, the former Wilhelmina Griffin, was a personnel clerk at the hospital.As a teenager Patricia, along with other black students, was barred from the all-white Tuskegee High School, prompting a 1963 lawsuit and wrangling between Gov. George C. Wallace and the federal government over integrating the school.Besides her brother, she is survived by her husband, John Clay Smith; three sons, Eugene, Michael and Stager; a daughter, Michelle Davis; 12 grandchildren; and a sister, Wilma Scott.Ms. Smith graduated from Tuskegee Institute with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1969 and worked in broadcasting. She started her government career with the Federal Communications Commission, working on satellite communications, before going to work for the Defense Communications Agency and the Department of Transportation, where she was chief of staff of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation when that office was transplanted to the aviation agency in 1995. Her title at the F.A.A. was associate administrator.She retired in 2008 and opened a consulting firm.\u201cShe had a vision, and she saw it much more clearly and earlier than other people did,\u201d said Bretton Alexander, director of business development and strategy for Blue Origin, the space transportation company owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com. \u201cAnd she plodded away to get there and never let the bureaucratic encumbrances of Washington stop that from happening.\u201dMs. Smith said she had been looking forward to traveling in space herself, once the price of a routine flight dropped. \u201cI am ready to go whenever I can,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Valvani was discovered by his wife in their brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, a police official said. He was face down on the bedroom floor with a cut to his neck and a knife near his body. He had left a note. He was 44 and is survived by two daughters. Mr. Valvani was charged last week with insider trading and his death brought the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case against him to a shocking end. He was accused of using confidential information from a former Food and Drug Administration official to reap $32 million in illegal gains. Barry H. Berke, a lawyer for Mr. Valvani, said the death was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca horrible tragedy that is difficult to comprehend.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLegal specialists said on Tuesday that they did not expect the death to cause prosecutors and Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, to back away from the case if they believed wrongdoing had occurred. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to lose sleep over it, because it comes with the territory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thomas A.

In a statement, Visium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founder, Jacob Gottlieb, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe mourn the tragic loss of Sanjay, a devoted father, husband and friend. Our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor the lucky few who get jobs at these firms, law school is a good investment. These young lawyers can earn more than $40,000 in one summer while they are still in law school and pay back their loans quickly. Many find that there are private firms willing to refinance their loans at rock-bottom interest rates. It is the fate of these graduates that drives the criticism of law school as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They dream of big jobs, but are often the lawyers who become solo practitioners, district attorneys, public defenders and other lower-paying jobs.

Koch said in an interview, that a \u201cpower elites group\u201d in the school ran \u201cthe asylum.\u201dThe school, which has 580 students, has many perks, including a physical therapist on staff, chef-prepared lunches, an equestrian club and a flight simulator. The debate team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars traveling to competitions nationwide, Mr. Koch said.\u201cWe are finding alarming things of how money was misspent,\u201d Mr. Koch said at his company\u2019s offices. \u201cIf people think they\u2019ve got a honey pot, there\u2019s going to be a lot of bears around it, trying to get it.\u201dA few years ago, students requested that the school establish a football team, an idea the administration embraced. But that was when the troubles took off. An athlete who read at a third-grade level was given a full scholarship, the football team had its own locker room and the coach earned more than $200,000 a year, according to tax records and interviews with former employees.The former head of school, Robert C. Parsons, whose official title was president and chief executive, is a former chief financial officer at the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Parsons started at Oxbridge in 2011 with a compensation package worth $1 million, tax records show, seven times his academy salary. Eventually, he made about $600,000 a year at the school.But in interviews, former employees questioned Mr. Koch\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Parsons in the first place, because he was suspended for five days after a 2009 Naval inspector general report accused him and his former boss of operating a \u201cslush fund\u201d to pay for tailgate parties.Mr. Koch said he did not think Mr. Parsons\u2019 record at the Naval Academy was a red flag because the government is \u201call screwed up.\u201dTheir experiences underscore the pitfalls that confront business leaders whose professional success does not always translate into the education field.Mr. Koch has discovered similar challenges, though he had a personal motivation for starting Oxbridge.He said he founded the school to give his own children a better academic experience than he had. By his account, he went from being an awkward ugly duckling who was flunking out of middle school in Kansas, to a military academy cadet who embraced a love of study. He longed for a place where students, not teachers\u2019 unions or principals, ruled.He completed a Ph.D. at M.I.T., but acknowledges that he still cannot spell very well. And he chokes up just talking about the troubled students who have made a turnaround at Oxbridge, which his children attend and from which his son has just graduated.\u201cMy biggest failing is I\u2019m too trusting of people,\u201d Mr. Koch said.Oxbridge was created in less than a year on a 45-acre campus that once held a Jewish community center.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people appreciate how much happened here in five years,\u201d said Bob Kaufmann, the chairman of the school\u2019s executive committee, who has been given the task of reducing spending. \u201cThis is a happy place for children.\u201dOxbridge graduates have been accepted this fall to nearly all of the Ivy League universities. One senior won a $100,000 Siemens scholarship for inventing a water-purification method.Mr. Bodnar, who had been on the admissions committee, said the committee\u2019s recommendations were often overruled by the football coaches.He said that there were so many academically struggling athletes that tutors were overwhelmed, and that the players had to be put in classes separate from the rest of the student body.John Klemme, the academic dean who will take over as head of school, said that some of the struggling students \u201cwould have been written off\u201d at other schools, but had found their way to a superior education because of their football prowess.\u201cThis is not to be a rich kids\u2019 school,\u201d Mr. Klemme said.Mr. Koch said that about 40 percent of students \u2014 including those who do not play football \u2014 received some kind of scholarship.Phillip Taylor, 17, a junior, said he loved the school and the opportunities he had been given, such as spring break study at Cambridge University in Britain. Still, he said he resented the double standard on admissions afforded to football players.\u201cMy experience was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned so much. But it does bother me.\u201dHis mother, Cheryl Taylor, also had a daughter in the school\u2019s freshman class in the school\u2019s inaugural year. She said parents like her who are impressed by the education the school offered were startled by its cultural shift.\u201cAt first, you had to be academically qualified, but that changed dramatically about two years in,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cFootball began to outshine everything else.\u201dThe problems at Oxbridge, where tuition is $31,500 a year, went beyond sports. In interviews, several former employees said Mr. Parsons had created a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment. Employee turnover was high and tens of thousands of dollars were spent on severance packages, tax records show.\u201cIf he likes somebody and she\u2019s a pretty girl, they got a signing bonus or a higher salary or a bonus,\u201d Ulle Sinisalu Boshko, the school\u2019s former controller, said of Mr. Parsons.Reached by a New York Times reporter on the phone for comment last week, Mr. Parsons hung up. Reached on Sunday, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d and hung up again.After inquiries from The Post, Mr. Koch hired a team of accountants, lawyers and a retired F.B.I. agent to look into the conduct of school officials, including whether employees were rigging bids with vendors and whether they had broken rules by housing students in their homes.Mr. Koch said he had not been able to verify any \u201csuper sexual harassment\u201d beyond what he called \u201cPG-13\u201d comments like \u201cGod, that girl\u2019s hot\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s got a great behind.\u201d But the investigation, he said, turned up information that led to the firing of Mr. Parsons and the forcing out of the athletic director and the coach.Mr. Koch said the investigators did not find any evidence of kickbacks to employees from vendors. He said that if any evidence of grade-changing emerged, the employees responsible would be fired. He said budget watchdogs would be hired to cut costs and pay closer attention to spending.\u201cThe attitude that was there at the school was that they had a rich guy backing it and they could do whatever they wanted,\u201d he said.He also wants to figure out how to get others to donate to the school, he said. That was one reason he did not name the school after himself.An earlier version of this article misstated the dateline. It is West Palm Beach, not Palm Beach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Tesla Was Involved in Fatal Crash, U.S. Says", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 The race by automakers and technology firms to develop self-driving cars has been fueled by the belief that computers can operate a vehicle more safely than human drivers.But that view is now in question after the revelation on Thursday that the driver of a Tesla Model S electric sedan was killed in an accident when the car was in self-driving mode.Federal regulators, who are in the early stages of setting guidelines for autonomous vehicles, have opened a formal investigation into the incident, which occurred on May 7 in Williston, Fla.In a statement, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said preliminary reports indicated that the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla, and the car failed to apply the brakes.It is the first known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself by means of sophisticated computer software, sensors, cameras and radar.The safety agency did not identify the Tesla driver who was killed. But the Florida Highway Patrol identified him as Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio.Mr. Brown posted videos of himself riding in autopilot mode. \u201cThe car\u2019s doing it all itself,\u2019\u2019 he said in one, smiling as he took his hands from the steering wheel.In another, he praised the system for saving his car from an accident.The death is a blow to Tesla at a time when the company is pushing to expand its product lineup from expensive electric vehicles to more mainstream models. The company on Thursday declined to say whether the technology or the driver or either were at fault in the accident.In its news release it said, \u201cNeither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\u201dThe crash also casts doubt on whether autonomous vehicles in general can consistently make split-second, life-or-death driving decisions on the highway.And other companies are increasing investments in self-driving technology. Google, for example, recently announced plans to adapt 100 Chrysler minivans for autonomous driving. Earlier this year, G.M. acquired the software firm Cruise Automation to accelerate its own self-driving applications.Even as the companies conduct many tests on autonomous vehicles at both private facilities and on public highways, there is skepticism that the technology has progressed far enough for the government to approve cars that totally drive themselves.The traffic safety agency said it was working with the Florida Highway Patrol in the inquiry into Mr. Brown\u2019s fatal accident. The agency cautioned that the opening of an investigation did not mean it thought there was a defect in the vehicle being examined.The federal traffic safety agency is nearing the release of a new set of guidelines and regulations regarding the testing of self-driving vehicles on public roads. They are expected to be released in July.At a recent technology conference in Novi, Mich., the agency\u2019s leader, Mark Rosekind, said self-driving cars should at least be twice as safe as human drivers to result in a significant reduction in roadway deaths. \u201cWe need to start with two times better,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rosekind said. \u201cWe need to set a higher bar if we expect safety to actually be a benefit here.\u201dKarl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book, said the accident served as a signal that the technology might not be as advanced and ready for the market as some proponents have suggested.\u201cThis is a bit of a wake-up call,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cPeople who were maybe too aggressive in taking the position that we\u2019re almost there, this technology is going to be in the market very soon, maybe need to reassess that.\u201dTesla said in its news release that it had informed the traffic safety agency about the accident \u201cimmediately after it occurred.\u201d But the company reported it publicly only on Thursday, after learning that the agency had begun to investigate.Ricky Hammer, a retired Navy master chief who worked with Mr. Brown at the development group, said Mr. Brown had strong computer skills and \u201cwas the equivalent of an electrical engineer even though he didn\u2019t have the degree.\u201dIn Iraq in 2006, he said, Mr. Brown played a crucial role in preparing captured explosive projectiles for shipment to the United States to support efforts to improve the armor on military vehicles.\u201cHe did it by being very aggressive,\u201d Mr. Hammer said, noting that Mr. Brown helped to collect the projectiles after raids on bomb-making shops and would X-ray them to determine their contents.But in its statement on Thursday, the company cautioned that it was still only a test feature and noted that its use \u2018\u2018requires explicit acknowledgment that the system is new technology.\u2019\u2019It noted that when a driver activated the system, an acknowledgment box popped up, explaining that the autopilot mode \u201cis an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of Williston, Fla. It is about 100 miles northwest of Orlando, not 100 miles northeast of it.

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Plan to Buy SolarCity Has Major Flaws", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe market hates the idea of Tesla Motors acquiring SolarCity.The reaction reflects two things.Solar City is a maker of solar energy products, basically home and business solar panels. Tesla is a maker of battery-powered cars, though some view the company\u2019s battery-making component as its bigger future.We would be the world\u2019s only vertically integrated energy company offering end-to-end clean energy products to our customers. This would start with the car that you drive and the energy that you use to charge it, and would extend to how everything else in your home or business is powered.In other words, the deal makes sense because people who buy Tesla\u2019s cars also want solar power. In a combined company, they can get it in the same place.The market is not buying it.To investors, it is as if the Walt Disney Company bought a birthing center business to offer \u201cend-to-end\u201d service for its parent customers. It\u2019s not clear that Tesla owners will really want to buy solar panels, or that if they did, it would be in sufficient number.And SolarCity is hardly a growth business these days. Both companies are burning cash. SolarCity went through $2.6 billion last year, while Tesla spent $2.2 billion. SolarCity\u2019s business model is struggling as cheap energy shakes up the solar market. So the acquisition is being viewed not so much as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d but as a bailout of SolarCity by Tesla, one that may sink both companies.The idea would be dismissed as yet another Silicon Valley lark (although who knows whether the visionary Mr. Musk is right), but there is a second problem with this deal. It\u2019s a bit of a corporate governance nightmare.Mr. Musk owns 21 percent of Tesla and 22 percent of SolarCity, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. His cousin, Lyndon Rive, is a founder and the chief executive of SolarCity.Given the troubles of SolarCity, the appearance is that Mr. Musk is bailing SolarCity out while profiting handsomely. He will be paid a premium by Tesla for a company in which he is the biggest shareholder, one that the market at least views as outside the business of Tesla.Tesla did announce some procedures to deal with this conflict. Mr. Musk recused himself from the deliberations at Tesla and Mr. Rive said the same thing at SolarCity. In addition, Tesla said that any deal would be subject to approval by a majority of its disinterested shareholders.This is part of the standard procedure in conflict situations. The general idea is that each company forms a committee of independent directors with its own advisers and legal counsel. This would ensure approval of the disinterested directors. Then any deal itself would be subject to approval of the disinterested shareholders. The State of Delaware, where a majority of American companies are incorporated, technically requires only that either the disinterested directors or disinterested shareholders approve the deal, but the standard practice is to do both.Even so, Tesla is not following this standard procedure. It does not appear that Tesla or SolarCity truly formed an independent committee or hired independent counsel, but instead opted for a recusal. (Another director on both boards, Antonio J. Gracias, also recused himself.)That is sufficient for Delaware law, but the optics are not great.Indeed, one of the actions Tesla took on Tuesday was to amend its bylaws to require all shareholder litigation to be filed in Delaware. It knows the lawsuits are coming.A bigger issue is the shareholder approval requirement. Because Mr. Musk has an interest in SolarCity, a vote is required under the stock exchange rules.Institutional shareholders, however, hold 63.57 percent of Tesla. It is hard to see them liking this deal. Tesla is also a darling of day traders. These short-term holders want the stock to go up, and voting no on the deal is a way to get the shares to rise.Given the reaction, it is hard to see how a deal like this can happen now.In the end, Tesla\u2019s offer appears destined to die as quickly as a fruit fly, in part because it does not make sense to the market, but also because the announcement and the structuring show a poor understanding of public relations.Indeed, it almost seems as if this is an offer intended to horrify institutional investors.Chalk it up to the sometimes stifling exuberance of Silicon Valley, where founders think they can do anything until they can\u2019t.An earlier version of this article misstated the stock market requirement for a shareholder vote on Tesla Motors\u2019 planned acquisition of SolarCity. A vote is required because Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, owns a stake in SolarCity; Tesla cannot avoid a vote on a technicality by issuing shares below the minimum set to require a vote.Advertisement"}
