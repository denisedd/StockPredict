{"Headline": "China\u2019s Foreign Minister Castigates Canadian Reporter for Rights Question", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported bySinosphereBEIJING \u2014 Canadians, apart perhaps from hockey players, seem to pride themselves on being affable people averse to confrontation. But China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, clearly decided that being in Canada was no reason to hold his temper. Especially when it comes to questions on his country\u2019s human rights record.Chinese officials often bristle at questions about human rights and other contentious subjects. But their reactions vary. Sometimes they stick, coolly but adamantly, to the government\u2019s stock response that China respects the rule of law and that the country\u2019s stability and economic growth have been a boon to citizens\u2019 rights.\u201cYou go everywhere to follow the big news, but the questions you ask are too simple, sometimes na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Jiang said. \u201cI feel the need to impart to you some real-life experience.\u201dQuestion: \u201cThere are no shortage of concerns about China\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, such as the Hong Kong booksellers and its detention of the Garratts, not to mention the destabilizing effects of its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. Given these concerns, why is Canada pursuing closer ties with China, how do you plan to use that relationship to improve human rights and security in the region, and did you specifically raise the case of the Garratts during your discussions with the foreign minister today?\u201dAnswer: \u201cI want to make a response to the questions that the journalist has just raised concerning China. Your question was full of prejudice against China and an arrogance that comes from I don\u2019t know where. This is totally unacceptable to me. Do you understand China? Have you been to China? Do you know that China has come from a poor and backward state and lifted more than 600 million people from poverty? Do you know that China is now the world\u2019s second biggest economy with $8,000 per capita? If we weren\u2019t able to properly protect human rights, would China have achieved such great development? Do you know that China has incorporated protecting human rights into its Constitution? I want to tell you that it\u2019s the Chinese people who most understand China\u2019s human rights record \u2014 not you, but the Chinese people themselves. You have no right to speak on this. The Chinese people have the right to speak. So please don\u2019t raise such irresponsible questions again. China welcomes all well-meaning suggestions, but we reject all groundless accusations.\u201dThe Canadian Press news agency reported that the offending question, which was asked by a reporter for iPolitics, a news website, was devised through an agreement by several different news outlets, including itself.Since becoming Canada\u2019s prime minister last October, Justin Trudeau has made soothing relations with China a priority. That has brought criticism from human rights advocates and some members of Canada\u2019s large population of Chinese immigrants. But others in the country have favorably compared the approach to the decision made by Pierre Trudeau, his father and a former Liberal prime minister, to formally recognize China and reestablish diplomatic relations in 1970.Mr. Wang\u2019s possible response to a demand for an apology can only be imagined.Ian Austen in Ottawa contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Why Conservative Intellectuals Hate Trump", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Every so often, a well-timed political manifesto comes out near the beginning of a presidency and functions as a kind of billboard for whatever new era the administration believes it is ushering in. One thinks of Stuart Chase\u2019s \u201cA New Deal\u201d (1932) for Franklin Roosevelt, or George Gilder\u2019s \u201cWealth and Poverty\u201d (1981) for Ronald Reagan, or Robert Reich\u2019s \u201cThe Work of Nations\u201d (1991) for Bill Clinton. Such books require not just the right election result, but also a big idea that could plausibly make a comfortable fit for one of the major political parties: They have to promise a significant, but not threatening, directional change, and not get too bogged down in specifics.Yuval Levin\u2019s \u201cThe Fractured \u00adRepublic\u201d could have been one of these books \u2014 but that would require not only that the \u00adRepublican Party recapture the White House this year, but also that it produce a different nominee than Donald J. Trump. Levin aims to rescue the country from the big-\u00adgovernment tendencies of the Clinton and Obama administrations; and \u00adalthough he doesn\u2019t say so explicitly, there is an unmistakable strain of disapproval for George W. Bush\u2019s presidency here too (for such grand gestures as the Iraq war, No Child Left Behind and the vastly expensive Medicare prescription drug benefit). Levin, whose previous book was in large part about Edmund Burke, wants us above all, in Burke\u2019s famous phrase, \u201cto love the \u00adlittle platoon we belong to in society.\u201d And his own little platoon is such \u2014 he is the very plugged-in editor of the journal \u00adNational Affairs and, as The New Republic put it in 2013, \u201cthe conservative movement\u2019s great intellectual hope\u201d \u2014 that his views would be sure to get a high-level hearing in a non-Trump Republican Washington.Levin believes that both parties, in their different ways, are caught up in the fundamental mistake of wanting to restore such features of post-World War II America as steadily rising incomes and low economic inequality, hegemony in the global economy, growing government, broad membership in the mainstream religions and a white-bread mass culture. Such goals, which are especially appealing to politicians of the baby boom generation who were young back then, are, Levin insists, nostalgic and unachievable. We need to accept that the country is now unalterably far more decentralized, and to devise political solutions around that reality.Conservatism comes in many varieties. Levin is not a libertarian, because he doesn\u2019t value personal freedom above all else. He is not a neoconservative, because he shows no interest in foreign policy and strongly objects to a powerful federal government, even if it is put to conservative ends. He is not a populist, because he wants ordinary people to revere authority figures, as long as they are local and not in government. Social issues seem to be closer to his heart than economic ones. His big idea is that during the first half of the 20th century, the United States created a set of large, powerful institutions that dominated national life, and then, in the second half of the century, the national culture moved away from these institutions and toward individualism.Levin understands this process as inherently neither liberal nor conservative \u2014 and for all his stated anti-nostalgia, the picture he offers of contemporary America is not a happy one. By embracing \u201ca view of society as consisting only of individuals and a state,\u201d we have \u201cset loose a scourge of loneliness and isolation\u201d on the one hand and, on the other, a federal government that \u201cengages in more direct intervention .\u2008.\u2008. in the daily lives of Americans than it ever has in peacetime.\u201d The only workable solution is an ethic of \u201csubsidiarity,\u201d which decentralizes political power and elevates local \u201cmiddle institutions\u201d like churches and neighborhood organizations.Toward the end of \u201cThe Fractured Republic,\u201d Levin calls on conservatives to \u201center into the details of public-policy debates, and not limit themselves to the level of abstraction.\u201d That is not a project he engages in here. He calls his book \u201can essay,\u201d and its main strength and main weakness are the same: It fits a vast range of material under the roof of one fairly short volume, but at the price of speaking primarily in general assertions unsupported by evidence. Levin is a master of the old debater\u2019s trick of setting up and knocking down a straw man: He almost never quotes an actual person advocating for a return to the 1950s, but he consistently presents himself as a lonely voice with the courage to envision something different. (Another debater\u2019s trick, which follows from this one, is his tendency to label ideas he disagrees with as \u201canachronistic,\u201d \u201cno longer plausible,\u201d \u201cstuck in the past\u201d and so on, rather than arguing against them on the merits.) Levin frequently maneuvers himself into range of specific policies \u2014 on social programs, on economic regulation, on immigration \u2014 and then leaves us to guess what he\u2019s actually for, as if he fears that by taking a position he would lose our attention or alienate potential converts.With this very broad style of argument, Levin runs the risk that what he says might not ring true, and this is especially a problem in his characterizations of liberalism, which is obviously not the world he inhabits. This shows up often in specific instances where he seems unaware of exactly what liberals have been up to. He refers to Lawrence Summers \u2014 the former Treasury secretary whose candidacy for the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve was sunk by the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party \u2014 as a former official \u201cfrom the left.\u201d He says the term \u201cthe establishment\u201d was \u201cborrowed .\u2008.\u2008. from the postwar radical counterculture,\u201d when in fact it was invented by the not-at-all-radical British journalist \u00adHenry Fairlie and popularized in the United States by the New Yorker writer Richard Rovere, a prominent defector from radicalism to mainstream liberalism. Levin doesn\u2019t mention liberal thinkers much at all, and so misses not just the nuances but the main outlines of their often ferocious debates during the period he covers. (Perhaps the most conspicuous absence is the Princeton historian Daniel T. Rodgers, whose \u201cAge of Fracture,\u201d published five years ago, covers much of the same ground as \u201cThe Fractured Republic\u201d; Levin repeatedly uses Rodgers\u2019s title phrase in his book.)More broadly, you would have no idea from reading Levin that the federal government has fewer employees today than it did half a century ago; that federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product is about where it was when Ronald Reagan left office; or that the United States has more than 13,000 school districts that control what is by far the developed world\u2019s most decentralized education system. Nor would you know that the last three Democratic presidents \u2014 Carter, Clinton and Obama \u2014 all defeated intraparty rivals who were far closer to the big-\u00adgovernment, big-labor politics that Levin says is the core conviction of the entire party.\u201cThe Fractured Republic\u201d is useful in helping us understand why conservative intellectuals have been so intensely opposed to Donald Trump, even though Levin doesn\u2019t mention him (the only active politician he seems to praise by name is Paul Ryan, who has provided a blurb for the book). Starting with its slogan \u2014 Make America Great Again! \u2014 Trump\u2019s campaign perfectly embodies the kind of nostalgia and grandiosity that Levin defines as our main problem. Trump is against free trade and other aspects of the unimpeded market; notably uncritical of the big federal social welfare programs; not visibly religious, personally restrained or engaged in community life; and in every other particular seems to be opposed to everything Levin is for. And he\u2019s a baby boomer, born in 1946 (the same year as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush; Hillary Clinton was born in 1947), who sees his own journey through life and the nation\u2019s decline as having run on parallel tracks. Trump\u2019s success this year also demonstrates that even among Republican primary voters, let alone the public at large, the ideas of conservative intellectuals in Washington may have a limited resonance. If there is a Trump White House, it\u2019s doubtful that \u201cThe Fractured \u00adRepublic\u201d will be its handbook.Nicholas Lemann is the Pulitzer-Moore professor of journalism at Columbia University and a staff writer for The New Yorker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time to End the Strikes in France", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialFrance, at the moment, is seemingly in chaos. Strikes are disrupting vital public services, including rail travel. Air France pilots say that they, too, will strike between June 11 and June 14, just in time for the European soccer championship which begins in France on Friday. Major unions have called for a national day of protest on Tuesday. All this threatens France\u2019s image, its economy and its security.But for what? The immediate cause is a labor reform bill backed by the government of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande that would ease some worker protections in the hope of encouraging job growth. The larger cause is a deep sense of betrayal on France\u2019s left, unhappy with what it sees as a rightward turn by Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist government.Outrage on the left forced Mr. Hollande to abandon a bill in March that would have stripped some French of their citizenship if convicted of terrorism. Many French see the labor-reform bill as a last straw. Since the Hollande government introduced the bill in March, hundreds of thousands of people have marched in protest across France, clashing violently with police at times.The Hollande government has already watered down some of the original provisions of the bill, which it regards as essential to reducing an unemployment rate stuck above 10 percent. But Prime Minister Manuel Valls made it clear in an interview last Friday that the government will not back down any further, saying: \u201cIf we were to give in to the C.G.T., we would never be able to reform France.\u201dIn these circumstances, it is sheer folly for the C.G.T. to continue to disrupt vital public services, and outrageous for Air France pilots, generally considered well paid, to strike over the first weekend of the tournament. As Mr. Hollande said on Tuesday, there comes a point when \u201cyou must realize it\u2019s time to stop striking.\u201d In France, where public opinion is turning against the strikes, that point is now.Advertisement"}

The poll found Mrs. Clinton drawing the support of 72 percent of minority voters and 57 percent of female voters. Mr. Trump holds more modest leads among men and white voters.Mrs. Clinton is also winning in swing states that were decided by less than seven points in 2012. In those 10 states, she is leading by an average margin of 47 percent to 39 percent.During the primary campaign, Republican voters saw Mr. Trump as the strongest candidate to handle the economy and terrorism. But when pitted against Mrs. Clinton, he lags in both categories.The poll comes as Mr. Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday, and it follows a response to the Orlando massacre this month that many viewed to be erratic. Mr. Trump doubled down on his call for ban on Muslim immigration, expanding the idea to include countries with a history of carrying out terrorist acts against the United States, and has said that he wished the people in the gay nightclub that was attacked were armed with guns.But 70 percent of Americans oppose Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed barring of Muslims from entering the country, according to the Monmouth poll, and 52 percent would like to see a ban on assault weapons such as the one used by the terrorist in Orlando.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Interest Rates Are Not as Low as They Look", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsInterest rates in Europe got a little crazier this week when the yield on the 10-year German government bond fell below zero.What this means is that investors buying the bond and holding it until it is repaid are guaranteed to lose money. This would seem to turn finance on its head. Lenders usually charge borrowers interest. Investors buying a bond with a negative yield are in effect paying the borrower. Not much in Germany\u2019s case, because the bond\u2019s yield was only minus 0.003 percent on Tuesday, but the benchmark bond crossed a historic line.Negative rates may not be as strange as they look. Indeed, interest rates may not be as low as they look.In economics, it is important to look at the value of something \u2014 gross domestic product, wages, the stock market \u2014 after it has been adjusted for inflation. The same can apply to interest rates. A company borrowing at 5 percent when inflation is 2 percent is paying a real interest rate of 3 percent. If the real borrowing cost goes up by a lot, companies will borrow less and the wider economy will suffer.Europe recently faced that danger, but for a reason that might not be obvious.At the start of 2015, the average corporate loan had a nominal interest rate of 2.44 percent, according to European Central Bank data, down from nearly 3 percent a year earlier. But in real terms, that 2.44 percent was actually 3 percent. That\u2019s because deflation \u2014 a decline in prices \u2014 was 0.6 percent in January 2015. Deflation, unlike inflation, makes loans cost more in real terms.In the last 18 months, the E.C.B. has introduced more measures that have helped bring down the average cost of a corporate loan. Nominally, its interest rate was 1.99 percent in April, but the real cost was 2.24 percent. However, this is still not particularly low. From 2003 till 2008, when interest rates were considered \u201cnormal,\u201d the real corporate borrowing rate was, on average, 2.1 percent.A caveat: A sharp decline in the real interest rate may not lead to more borrowing if other factors depress companies\u2019 appetite for debt. The real cost of borrowing declined below 1 percent in 2012, because interest rates were falling while inflation remained relatively high. But Europe was then gripped with fears of sovereign debt defaults; the economy stagnated; and investors and corporate managers feared deflation. Lending slumped in that period.Demand is high for German bonds in part because investors see them as safe investments. Nervousness about Britain\u2019s vote on leaving the European Union was probably behind the latest surge in demand for the bonds. Bond yields are also low in Europe because the E.C.B. has been buying a huge number of bonds in an attempt to stimulate the Continent\u2019s economy.Anyone holding bonds is probably doing pretty well right now (remember, the price of a bond rises as bond yields decline). Still, some investors contend that these negative yields are distorting markets and are doing little, if anything, for the economy..But there are now signs of life in Europe\u2019s credit sector. One way the E.C.B. can blow on those sparks is to keep buying bonds. This does crazy things like turning German bond yields negative. But it also pulls down borrowing costs for corporations \u2014 and as we have seen, when adjusting for inflation, companies are still not getting particularly cheap loans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pause That Distresses", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byShould this pause worry you? Yes. Because if it does turn into a recession, or even if it goes on for a long time, it\u2019s very hard to envision an effective policy response.But that won\u2019t \u2014 in fact, can\u2019t \u2014 happen this time. Short-term interest rates, which the Fed more or less controls, are still very low despite the small rate hike last December. We now know that it\u2019s possible for rates to go slightly below zero, but there still isn\u2019t much room for a rate cut.That said, there are other policies that could easily reverse an economic downturn. And if Hillary Clinton wins the election, the U.S. government will understand perfectly well what the options are. (The likely response of a Trump administration doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Maybe a series of insult Twitter posts aimed at China and Mexico?) The problem is politics.For the simplest, most effective answer to a downturn would be fiscal stimulus \u2014 preferably government spending on much-needed infrastructure, but maybe also temporary tax cuts for lower- and middle-income households, who would spend the money. Infrastructure spending makes especially good sense given the federal government\u2019s incredibly low borrowing costs: The interest rate on inflation-protected bonds is barely above zero.So the evidence of a U.S. slowdown should worry you. I don\u2019t see anything like the 2008 crisis on the horizon (he says with fingers crossed behind his back), but even a smaller negative shock could turn into very bad news, given our political gridlock.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 in America: A Warning Shot Against Globalization", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byWhen the mills that birthed the industrial revolution in cities like Manchester and Birmingham still powered the British economy of the mid-20th century, Robert Stevenson was a frequent visitor to the Midlands.Eastman Machine, the company his family helped start in upstate New York 128 years ago, had a big factory 100 miles north of London, and Britain accounted for roughly a fifth of the firm\u2019s sales.That was then. While Britain is still an important market for Eastman\u2019s sophisticated cutting tools, its workshop there was shuttered in the 1970s, and British customers are now served by Eastman\u2019s main factory in Buffalo and a smaller one in China.So when the British electorate stunned the world on Friday with the results of the vote to leave the European Union, it was a shock for Mr. Stevenson, but not because it poses an immediate threat to Eastman\u2019s bottom line or the job security of its heavily blue-collar, 120-strong work force in downtown Buffalo.What most concerns Mr. Stevenson and owners of businesses big and small is what the so-called Brexit says about the shape of economic things to come.\u201cYou never know if there will be a domino effect, and we worry about other countries securing their borders,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said. \u201cWe were certainly surprised.\u201dFor all the shock and awe on Wall Street and financial markets around the globe on Friday, the imminent danger to the underlying American economy is relatively small. What\u2019s far more worrisome is whether Britain\u2019s decision represents an end to the economic integration and opening markets that have helped propel sales at companies like Eastman over the last few decades.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, politics and economics have mostly moved in one direction, with the elites on both sides of the Atlantic favoring policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, the introduction of the European currency and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization. Business has applauded these moves, but voters are not necessarily on board as they once were.\u201cI think a lot of the market reaction is less about the financial impact and more about populism and what it means for the liberal economic order,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, a top economic official to President George W. Bush who now serves as dean of the Columbia Business School.The Brexit vote, he added, reflects a deep distrust of the benefits of the global economic system among a wide swath of voters in Europe and the United States, and a broadly held view that government institutions \u2014 whether in Washington or Brussels \u2014 are calcifying and don\u2019t work well.\u201cBoth of those forces have a lot of wind at their back,\u201d he said.\u201cIn the near term, you\u2019re seeing markets being roiled, and feedback effects for the Federal Reserve,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said. But for now, at least in the United States, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to raise recession probabilities.\u201dWhen it comes to commerce, Britain is not even among the United States\u2019 top five trading partners \u2014 it\u2019s currently the seventh largest, according to the United States Census Bureau, which tracks trade data. American exports to Britain last year totaled $56 billion, or just over 0.3 percentage point of gross domestic product.Partly that\u2019s a reflection of how the United States, despite leading the era of globalization, remains something of an economic island. Exports account for 13.4 percent of American economic output, according to the World Bank, compared with roughly 30 percent for Britain.The 2015 slowdown in the United States\u2019 biggest trading partner \u2014 China \u2014 may have blunted domestic growth in the last year, but even that hardly threw the American economy into a tailspin. Nor should Brexit, most experts say.Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who most recently served in the Obama administration and is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees minimal pain within American borders. \u201cIt won\u2019t be helpful for our economy,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said, but \u201cwe won\u2019t take anything like the direct hit that I expect will befall the economy.\u201dSeveral economists estimated that the fallout from the vote would probably end up decreasing growth in the American economy by about a quarter of a percentage point or less, while postponing any push by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, possibly through the end of 2016.\u201cThe flight to safety means lots of people are flocking to U.S. Treasury bonds, putting downward pressure on interest rates,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cOne possible outcome is that Fed\u2019s path to higher interest rates may become flatter as these events play out.\u201dBrexit\u2019s impact on the United States economy will mostly be felt through the falling value of the pound and the euro against the dollar, Mr. Bernstein said, which is \u201clikely to slow down inflation and exacerbate our trade deficit.\u201dA surging dollar would hurt American exporters facing weaker demand from customers in Europe and Asia. In fact, Mr. Stevenson\u2019s main worry on Friday was whether his British competitors might actually benefit in the short term.\u201cWith the pound dropping 10 or 15 percent, it may strengthen a couple of our competitors in the U.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they could be quite happy about it and gain market share.\u201dAs befits the owner of a company that survived World Wars I and II, outlasted the Great Depression and the Great Recession, and survived the collapse of the American textile industry \u2014 all without abandoning Buffalo \u2014 Mr. Stevenson has learned to adapt to potential shocks like Brexit.Increasingly, that\u2019s meant focusing on making high-tech, software-driven equipment to cut composites and carbon-based fabrics for the aerospace industry and automakers, rather than the woolens and cotton Eastman\u2019s equipment was once designed to slice.Many of Mr. Stevenson\u2019s current customers in Britain are in these sectors, he noted. The dressmakers and hosiers and other clothiers that once populated England\u2019s redbrick towns have long departed.\u201cOur focus has been to understand where the market is going,\u201d said Mr. Stevenson. Twenty years ago, 70 percent of Eastman\u2019s products were of traditional fabrics; the rest were space-age materials. Now, it is the reverse, which is among the reasons a fifth generation of Stevensons will have a company to take over.\u201cOur goal has been to maintain the company in Buffalo and as a family business,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said. \u201cMy son is 40, and I\u2019m 65, and he is focused on these new materials. This saved our butt.\u201dFor those exporters that have managed to hang on in the industrial heartland of Britain, the Brexit could actually be good news, simply because the pound\u2019s plunge against currencies like the euro and the dollar makes their goods more competitive.British exports like Rolls-Royce jet engines, high-end Jaguar automobiles and certain food products could get a lift. Last month, for example, Britain exported the largest cargo of wheat to the United States in more than two decades.So would British hotels and restaurants, eager to host American visitors looking for what could amount to a 10 to 20 percent-off sale.\u201cIf you wanted to buy a nice little house in Scotland, today\u2019s the day,\u201d said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Chief executives of major American companies are paid well to see around corners, and must adapt their businesses even to trends they oppose, or face the consequences in the form of falling stock prices and angry shareholders.That\u2019s among the reasons General Electric, which relies on foreign markets for more than half its revenue, has been preparing for the kind of political retreat from open markets that the British vote to leave the European Union represents.\u201cCompanies must navigate the world on their own,\u201d G.E.\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in the commencement speech last month at the N.Y.U. Stern School of Business.For G.E., he said that meant seeking to achieve \u201ca local capability inside a global footprint.\u201d Today, its 420 factories spread across the world give G.E. \u201ctremendous flexibility,\u201d Mr. Immelt said, with jet engines, power generators and rail locomotives increasingly manufactured at several sites to ensure market access.\u201cA localization strategy,\u201d Mr. Immelt said, \u201ccan\u2019t be shut down by protectionist politics.\u201dG.E. had prepared for the risk that Britain might vote to leave the E.U. by hedging in foreign currency markets. But beyond that immediate step, a G.E. spokeswoman said on Friday it was too early to discuss longer-term moves the company might make.Mr. Immelt, in a statement, said that G.E., America\u2019s largest manufacturer, which employs 22,000 people in Britain and 100,000 in Europe over all, remains \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to both Britain and Europe.While Brexit\u2019s impact on Britain\u2019s overall economy may be mixed, its London-based financial sector is likely to feel the full force of the coming storm. The City, as London\u2019s equivalent of Wall Street is known, has boomed in the last 20 years as a global financial capital, especially for Continental banks seeking a more market-friendly home than Frankfurt or Paris.With a recession in Britain now a distinct possibility, some experts worry that a government desperate to create and maintain jobs could seek to save the financial sector by making the City more attractive as an offshore haven.\u201cThis could lead to London becoming even more like the Cayman Islands and other British territories, skirting around regulations, in a race to the bottom for the financial sector,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThis potentially could leave pretty big holes in the financial safety net.\u201dHe pointed to the 2008 crisis involving the insurance giant American International Group, where a hedge-fund-like subsidiary operating in London and under less stringent rules nearly brought down the company and contributed to the financial crash.\u201cThey could get away with things in London that they couldn\u2019t get away with in New York,\u201d Mr. Posen said, \u201cSo imagine repeating that on a larger scale or a more frequent scale.\u201dOf course, dangers like those are the hardest to anticipate.\u201cRight now we\u2019re in one of those points in history,\u201d Mr. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute said, \u201cwhere there are lot of \u2018unknown unknowns,\u2019\u201d referring to the infamous comment by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the Iraq war.Consider two very different types of uncertainty, Mr. Hassett explained, citing a well-known economic metaphor. If you bet on a roulette wheel, you know all the possible outcomes and the attendant risks. But now imagine a game where you don\u2019t know all the places the roulette ball might land, or the chances of it falling into different slots or even the prizes if you are fortunate enough to bet correctly.\u201cIn those types of situations,\u201d he said, \u201canything can happen. And if you don\u2019t know what will happen, the optimal strategy might be to assume the worst.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hell Is Other Britons", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionALRESFORD, England \u2014 IN summer, the land around Alresford, the rural market town in the south of England where I grew up, blooms in a way that seems almost terrible.My parents\u2019 house stands in the middle of a 1980s housing development of suburban ugliness, all detached red-brick blocks and generously proportioned driveways. There is not supposed to be nature in the suburbs, but in Alresford (pronounced AWLS-fud) nature is still powerful \u2014 every year the grass at the top of the road will suddenly grow tall, and fill with wildflowers, hedgehogs, little birds of delirious and unusual colors. Every morning the birds wake you up at 4 with a chorus of hoots and trills.But no sooner has nature started to assert itself than the grass gets cut back and the mornings return to being silent and still. Alresford becomes human again. Human in a normal, provincial English way, in a place where people own homes, save for pensions and vote to leave the European Union \u2014 as 55 percent of the population of Hampshire county did on Thursday.Sometimes, in the summer, I walk up the hill and I look out over it, the housing development on one side and the Georgian town center at the bottom of the other, and I have this fantasy image of how it once was, before Alresford was founded in the Middle Ages, when all of this was untouched: just the wild, untamed nature that it keeps wanting to turn itself back into. And sometimes, I think: I wish that would happen. Because all that humans have ever done here is ruin things.Alresford is my personal hell.We are not used to thinking that a place like this \u2014 a pleasant town with a pretty center \u2014 might actually be hell. There is almost no poverty and only the occasional act of violence. There are good schools, a range of shops, a heritage railway. In fact, it\u2019s somewhere that a lot of people, apparently, actively want to live: Houses in the center easily sell for upward of a million pounds. (What they will cost once the vote to leave the European Union makes the economy crater remains to be seen.)But dig below the surface, and you will find the demons crawling. You can see them in the looks that residents give you when they pass; sneering snobs glaring down their noses with entitlement; small-minded townies, bullying you with eyes that you recognize from the primary school lunchroom; the old people, 80 and above, wearing blank stares. You can hear it in their bothered tutting at the bus stop (especially if they ever hear a visitor mispronouncing the name of the town), the shots that constantly ring out from across the countryside as they set about murdering as many of the local pheasants as they can.As with any hell, the thing that really makes it so is that you can never leave. For one thing, poor public transportation makes leaving impossible in a practical, everyday sense \u2014 at least if you can\u2019t drive. For another, the town thwarts any ambitions that stretch beyond its borders. From what I can tell, a young person from Alresford, forced to move back in with his parents after college, will typically find himself unable to get work that is not based in Alresford. As a result, it is full of people around my age, 27, stuck in dead-end jobs.And it is impossible to leave Alresford, because Alresford is not just a place: It is an ideology that infects your very soul. Let\u2019s call it \u201cAlresfordism.\u201d It is an ideology of smallness, of contraction, of wanting to curl up in our own personal, financially secure hole and will everything amusing or interesting or exciting in the world away.Since my late teens, every effort I have ever exerted has been with the intention of escaping Alresford. And yet, I am an early-career academic and so I am forced to move back, every summer, to live with my parents because I cannot afford to pay rent elsewhere after my temporary teaching contract ends. Then, sometimes, I think: What if I\u2019m actually secretly comfortable here? What if I have chosen the security of death in Alresford over the risks of life elsewhere? What if I am in fact fully in the clutches of Alresfordism?It was for psychological reasons, as much as anything else, that I didn\u2019t register to vote in Alresford. Registering to vote here would have felt like actually moving here. I registered in Essex, where I live during the academic year, for the recent local elections, so I just thought I\u2019d retain that registration for the Brexit referendum. I also don\u2019t like filling in forms, which is why I didn\u2019t register to vote by mail or look into how I\u2019d amend my registration.I admit that I was very complacent about all this. I didn\u2019t think one vote would make a difference. And besides, I wasn\u2019t particularly motivated to use my vote anyway. Brexit, supported by some very bad people, would definitely have some bad consequences, but on the other hand, who knows what positive effects it might have? I wasn\u2019t willing to endorse it, but, hey, I certainly bought the argument that it might be a worthwhile shake-up to the system.My complacency lasted until June 16, when Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament and a vocal defender of immigration, was killed; the man charged in her death, Thomas Mair, had ties to far-right groups and introduced himself in court by the name \u201cdeath to traitors.\u201d That shocked me into a realization that this referendum wasn\u2019t really a referendum about whether or not we should remain in the European Union. It was a referendum on immigration and on race \u2014 on whether to have our borders open or closed.In short: Do we open ourselves up to new things, even if they might be unfamiliar, risky, unexpected, sometimes even undesirable? Or do we close ourselves down: a small island, trapped in its own smallness? So I knew which way I had to vote. This was a referendum on Alresfordism.I SET out from Alresford on Thursday to register my protest against Alresfordism. Three hours on the train, through London, from Winchester to Wivenhoe, then back again, I thought. I was wrong.An electrical storm the night before had caused signal failures across southeast England. I managed to get to London, but when I tried to change for the train to Essex, I found that everything so far that day had been canceled. A convoluted series of changes on the Tube and on buses left me stranded in Romford, in outer London, where the train I had been told I could catch to Colchester had just been canceled. I tried my best, I thought, and I failed miserably. I went home.Even if I\u2019d managed to cast my vote, it would have been pointless. The Remain campaign didn\u2019t just lose by my vote, we lost by more than a million. Britons wanted to make our world smaller. They wanted to make it more like Alresford. As far as I can tell, they are going to get exactly what they wanted.As a result of this vote, Britain will withdraw rapidly. We will have fewer people coming here, enriching our culture and our lives. There will be fewer opportunities. We will have less of a chance to explore the world for ourselves.Brexit is the result of a deep nihilism among the British public. This nihilism has not just emerged recently; I\u2019ve lived alongside it my whole life. This is the nihilism of Alresfordism, a security-driven retraction toward death.A recession would not, in truth, matter much to the people of Alresford. It is a pretty affluent place, and if you are a true Alresfordian, you will always be happy in your small town. How much more will the effects of the Leave vote be felt by people who do not share their nihilism, people like my friends and colleagues who\u2019ve come here to live and work from the European Union.All I can do is look out at the nature from the window of my room in Alresford. I\u2019m from here, so I can\u2019t be sure whether or not this is just another type of nihilism, but I think: Well, if all this nature is bigger than us, then I want it be get even bigger. I want it to become so big that it will consume all of our smallnesses, invalidate them, smother them out. Not just Alresford. I want a demented, throbbing, fecund nature to overrun this whole country, to overturn the wretched consequences of the laws that we have, in our stupidity, set for ourselves.Tom Whyman is a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Essex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turbulence and Uncertainty for the Market After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 No one really knows what happens now. The collective imagination leads to dark places.Of most immediate consequence, Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe sent global markets on a wild descent. Investors gaped at this major refashioning of the global landscape and decided it looked perilous \u2014 or at least so pockmarked with uncertainty that they preferred to pull their money out of riskier corners like stock markets.But no one knows enough to rule that out, either. The world has never been here before.The pound plummeted, reaching depths not seen since 1985 \u2014 well below the value at the worst of the 2008 financial crisis. The euro dropped.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.From Tokyo to London to New York, stocks tumbled sharply on Friday, as markets digested the changing world order. American shares were down 3.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 611 points, its biggest drop since August.British stocks were off 3.2 percent, while broader European shares dropped 8.6 percent.Investors took refuge in the safest investments, bolstering the value of American government debt and the Japanese currency.Less than an hour after the markets opened in London, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, stood in front of television cameras to announce that the central bank had earmarked 250 billion pounds, about $344 billion, to unleash as needed for stability. Stock markets took some solace, paring back their losses for the day.Whatever happens, a long, confusing period now unfolding seems certain to yank Europe back into acute anxiety just as it seemed to be finally recovering from a punishing economic downturn, one that had thrust Greece and Spain into veritable depressions while erasing years of wealth across the Continent.The vote to leave, a so-called Brexit, raised the prospect of sustained anxiety in the global economy as investors struggle to surmise what is happening.China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind that of the United States, is slowing significantly, and the markets have little faith in the data provided by its Communist Party government. Brazil, once a darling among emerging markets, is in full-blown crisis. Europe and its common market, home to 500 million people, have been plunged into turmoil, their prospects difficult to divine.Markets crave known facts and fret about variables, seeing potential risks in all unknowns. An enormous portion of the map is now draped in uncertainty, effectively impervious to calculation.The vote appears likely to prompt multinational banks to shift significant numbers of jobs from Britain to competing financial centers in the European Union, led by Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. Many experts assume Brussels will move quickly to restrict trading of euro-denominated assets \u2014 a major business for Britain. Prominent banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned during the campaign that an exit would cause them to transfer some operations elsewhere.As investors pulled back in fear on Friday, entrusting their money only to the safest places like United States Treasuries, the moves appeared to foreshadow a tightening of credit for many. Emerging markets may find it difficult to secure investment, limiting economic growth. Borrowing costs are likely to rise in heavily indebted nations, including Greece, Italy and Portugal, as investors demand extra inducements to put their money in riskier locales.The Bank of England may have to raise interest rates to halt a plunge in the pound, the opposite from the usual playbook when an economy suffers a shock.Most broadly, the vote is likely to resonate as a sign that major democracies are increasingly vulnerable to the influence of populist political movements that curry favor by demonizing immigrants and external forces such as officials in Brussels and Washington, low-wage workers in China and Mexico.The noisy and acrimonious campaign over leaving the bloc played on inchoate fears in Europe and much of the developed world: dismay over globalization at a time of intensified competition for jobs, and angst over immigration as it refashions conceptions of national identity. Those sentiments will surely find additional avenues for expression, challenging trade arrangements, reinvigorating existential questions about the shared euro currency and sowing uncertainty throughout the financial realm.Economists and political analysts have been watching the campaign as a gauge of the potency of anti-immigrant sentiments far beyond Britain. The success of the movement to leave the bloc is likely to resonate in financial markets as cause to assume a higher probability that Donald J. Trump will be elected president of the United States, riding his pledges to bar Muslim immigrants and erect a wall along the Mexican border.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of renouncing trade agreements and renegotiating the terms of American debt, investors are likely to take rising odds of his election as impetus to limit their exposure to risk, eschewing stock markets and plowing funds into the safest forms of government debt.The vote in Britain was \u201cessentially against economic rationality and driven by identity concerns and unease about globalization and trade,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. \u201cIf such a vote can win in the U.K., that fosters among investors a sense of the likelihood that Trump can also win, and that will have an adverse effect on capital markets.\u201dNot least, the vote unleashes considerable forces of uncertainty.Though the vote changes nothing for at least two years, it kicks off what are certain to be complex and politically fraught negotiations between Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union over their future dealings.Central to these talks is the future of Europe\u2019s common market, which allows goods and services to be traded freely throughout its vast territory. Given that Britain sells almost half of its exports in the common market, and given that many multinational companies have forged bases in Britain as a means of serving customers across the Continent, any impediment is likely to be expensive.Disruption to trade was a major assumption in many academic studies released during the campaign that almost universally forecast substantial and potentially lasting damage to the British economy should Britain opt to leave Europe.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.During the campaign, those supporting an exit emphasized that Britain would remain in the common market during the negotiating period. They assured voters that Britain would strike a more beneficial trade deal.But prominent leaders \u2014 not least, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u2014 warned that a jilted European Union would be in no mood to extend Britain a rewarding deal, lest other malcontent members take encouragement to go for the exits.If no deal is struck, the rules of the World Trade Organization could apply. They give member nations the rights to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports, raising the possibility of a tit-for-tat trade skirmish between Britain and the Continent.In the meantime, the lack of clarity is likely to damage economic growth in Britain and beyond.\u201cYou get a rabbit-in-the-headlights phenomenon where businesses don\u2019t want to make new decisions, or new investments, because they are uncertain about the future,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe immediate effect will be a lowering of investment activity, a lowering of hiring. There will an immediate slowdown of growth.\u201dThe success of the campaign to leave deals a formidable blow to an already weakened European Union and heightens the likelihood that fresh separatist movements will emerge. Scotland will almost certainly seek to separate itself from Britain after a failed referendum two years ago. In the Netherlands, France, Hungary and Italy, the success of the campaign could increase the intensity of so-called euroskeptic parties.\u201cFor Europe, it raises the market\u2019s perception of breakup risk,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.If another euro crisis emerges, Europe may lack the political cohesion to address it. Further separatism could fragment the common market, bringing the demise of the six-decade-old project of European integration. Few now expect that to occur. But whatever the risks were before, Britain just increased them.\u201cAt some point, you wonder how many blows a body can take,\u201d Mr. Van Reenen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will happen, but there\u2019s this risk that everything will fall apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Countries Warn Britain on \u2018Brexit\u2019: You\u2019ll Pay if You Leave Us", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byIf Britons do vote in a referendum on Thursday to leave the European Union, they can expect a tough and unforgiving response, with capitals across the Continent intent on deterring other countries from following the British example, European officials and analysts said.In other words, Britain will be made to suffer for its choice.With other issues pressing, including Greek debt, the migrant crisis and terrorism, the largest and most powerful European nations will want clarity, and are not likely to tolerate a long period of post-referendum confusion.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, spoke apocalyptically about a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d to the German tabloid Bild. He said all members of the European Union would suffer, as would the postwar structure of Europe that had kept the peace.\u201cWhy is it so dangerous?\u201d Mr. Tusk asked. \u201cNo one can foresee what the long-term consequences would be. As a historian, I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the E.U., but also of Western political civilization.\u201dBritain would face at least seven years of limbo during painful negotiations about a new relationship with the bloc, Mr. Tusk said.Preparing for a British vote to withdraw, France and Germany are debating the immediate announcement of a joint initiative on European security, perhaps an operational command headquarters, to show, at least symbolically, that the European Union remains solid and will continue to progress without Britain.But Germany has rejected some ideas from the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy in Brussels, to respond by moving quickly toward more European political or fiscal integration, understanding that with Spanish elections this month and French and German elections next year, \u201cmore Europe\u201d is not what voters want.And no government wants treaty change, which would prompt more referendums at a time when populist, anti-Brussels sentiments are running strong across the Continent.Suggestions by British politicians favoring a departure that the rest of the European Union will give Britain more favorable terms in a new trading arrangement will be rejected out of hand by European leaders, who do not want to make further concessions to a country that has rejected them, officials said. This would ensure that the British example discouraged others tempted to seek a special deal for themselves.To that end, the main European Union nations are envisioning a two-stage negotiating process for a British exit, once the British government invokes Article 50 of the treaty governing membership in the bloc. Article 50 provides two years to haggle over the terms of a divorce from the bloc \u2014 something that has never happened.The European Union is expected to want to talk about a future trade agreement only after Britain and the other 27 nations in the bloc have made a decision about how to unwind British membership. That process would require resolving complex legal and financial issues and addressing all kinds of topics that would affect ordinary people \u2014 what happens to pensions and health coverage, as well as the immigration status of European citizens working and living in Britain, and that of British citizens in the bloc.Officials want to negotiate future trade and financial services arrangements with Britain as a nonmember; they do not want to allow Britain to use the status of European citizens in Britain and their rights as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations, which could take several years to conclude, beyond the two-year time limit for exit talks.Even then, Brussels would offer Britain one of the three existing models of varying closeness and mutual obligation \u2014 the bloc\u2019s arrangements with Norway, Canada and the World Trade Organization \u2014 rather than offer to negotiate something new, said Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a London research institution.France and Belgium, and probably Germany, are almost certain to reject any British proposal to remain within the European single market \u2014 even, or especially, for financial services \u2014 without at least an agreement that Britain continue to allow European citizens to live and work in Britain, analysts and officials said. In any case, such a trade-off, the so-called Norway model, is strongly opposed by British advocates of withdrawing from the bloc, in the name of controlling immigration.\u201cThere is no appetite to be nice on the day after,\u201d said Camille Grand, the director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. \u201cWhatever the British say or feel, there will be a price to pay, if only to prevent further attempts to exit the E.U.\u201dThe French message, Mr. Grand said, is like Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s: \u201cIf you leave, you leave. And we won\u2019t grant you the benefits of the single market. You won\u2019t move to an \u00e0 la carte membership.\u201dThe Germans and the Dutch, Mr. Grand said, \u201cmight be tempted to be more flexible, but in Paris, it\u2019s a divorce, and we must be tough with the British to prevent the Czechs or whomever from trying to make their own deals.\u201dBut it may be the political aspect of a British exit that worries Europeans the most, coupled with the expected financial shock, said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels.\u201cPopulists throughout Europe will celebrate this as a \u2018feast of democracy,\u2019 where finally the citizens get their say over the elites,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cPopulists all over Europe will gain in strength. And markets could react by saying, \u2018The first brick is out of the wall, and now let\u2019s bet on another brick.\u2019\u201dThe next brick, Mr. Wolff said, could be economically troubled Italy, and that \u201ccould set in motion a domino effect,\u201d with the euro dropping sharply in value along with the pound. So the European Central Bank would have to be prepared to prop up the banks and the euro against market pressure, just as the Bank of England would have to prop up the pound.No one in Germany thinks it would be good if the British left, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cIf the European Union is not able to prove that membership is worth having, and that in the end emotion wins over rational debates, this not only tells you something about public sentiment in Britain, but will have a contagion effect in other nations,\u201d she said.Added to European instability, Ms. Schwarzer said, the immediate economic shock could badly damage countries with high debt, like France, Italy and Greece.The effect on the bloc of a British departure would be threefold, Mr. Grant said.First, he said, a British withdrawal would be a big boost to nationalist, anti-European Union movements, with Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, already comparing a British exit to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the right will win power, but they\u2019ll feel they have history with them, and pro-European elites in government will be on the back foot and afraid of moves toward more integration,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cFederalism would be dead, and there would be no more referendums and treaty changes for generations, so it would be a new period of national power and not the federal future the European Commission wants.\u201dSecond, he said, without the counterweight of Britain, \u201cthe German problem becomes more acute.\u201d Rome, Paris and Warsaw fear that without Britain as a countervailing force in the bloc, Germany would become too powerful. The Germans themselves fear that an anti-German alliance would form.Third, he said, the European Union without Britain\u2019s free-market influence would be more French in its economic policy outlook and more protectionist, with little impetus for free-trade deals or for the extension of the single market to services.\u201cThe stakes are high, because what happens in Britain will set off a domino effect and possibly a cycle of disintegration,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe European Union would look like a broken project, a declining power.\u201dRadoslaw Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, said a British departure from the bloc might have some benefits for those who want the nations of Europe to continue drawing closer.\u201cEurope could forge ahead with a common security policy, which the British have vetoed repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the countries of the eurozone would probably insist on all euro trade being moved out of Britain,\u201d which could help efforts by Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg to establish themselves as more important financial centers relative to London.But over all, Mr. Sikorski said, \u201cthe European Union is much better with Britain in it, providing liberal politics, liberal economics and a center of democratic political consensus of a kind needed now in Europe.\u201dAlissa J.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY That new app that will make or break your company \u2014 it needs to get to market fast. Your customers are ready, and you can\u2019t miss your window. But increasing speed to market doesn\u2019t need to mean working with more resources. It\u2019s about working smarter. How can the business and IT sides of the house work together to make this happen?In a word: agility.No matter the industry, software increasingly drives every critical function, whether it's on the business or production side. When software is central to your customer\u2019s experience and business success, organizations require the right processes and tools. This allows cross-functional teams to work effectively in response to changing conditions, keep in direct communication with each other across organizations and allow each team member to contribute his or her best efforts to the success of all.Agile practices are increasingly on the rise. And no wonder. Agility enables companies to grow faster and generate more revenue, according to research by Accenture, which found that high-performing companies are six times more likely to use agile practices than companies that don\u2019t perform as well. Moreover, agile employees outperform those who merely work hard on their own by nearly 20 percent, according to the Corporate Executive Board.ROOTS IN RUGBY In rugby \u2014 a fast-paced team sport similar to American football \u2014 a player can only pass the ball to a teammate behind him or her. This requires players to continually update each other on their whereabouts and their ability in any given moment to receive the ball. That makes communication while in the heat of play vital for success.Like a rugby team that uses the unique talents and positioning of each of its players to move the ball toward the end of the field, cross-functional development teams bridge departmental lines to bring the focus of a wide range of expertise to bear on specific projects. Given the similarities, it should come as no surprise that agile development borrows some of its terminology from rugby.Princeton University head women\u2019s rugby coach Chris Ryan says good communication helps players correctly read the ebbs and flows of game play in order to anticipate where other players will be \u2014 and when \u2014 so that they can grab the ball or make a tackle. \u201cA lot of people communicate, but they communicate too late and expect things to happen,\u201d says Ryan. Social interactions off the field that bring players closer together, he says, help teammates find better chemistry during games.Adam Long, chief technology officer at Melbourne-based qualitative data analysis software maker QSR International, says that the transparency enabled by good communication makes everyone more effective. Long and his team began their agile journey in 2014 with help from agile development specialist Rally Software, now a part of CA Technologies. Before implementing agile processes, says Long, his company was focused on big, make-or-break updates to its NVivo software that might or might not optimally address the needs of customers by the time they launched.But now, thanks to agile, says Long, \u201cWe\u2019re all looking at the same information, everyone contributing to it.\u201d Among the benefits of sharing information is enhanced cooperation, with team members routinely offering to help solve each other\u2019s challenges, and better transparency to meet the evolving needs of its customer base in the qualitative research community.RACING TO VICTORYWhen members of the Trek-Segafredo cycling team are pedaling their way to victory, they\u2019re not alone. Not only are eight to nine team riders all heading for the finish line, they are also shadowed by a sport director. Riding in a pace car, he keeps the big picture of the race top of mind for the cyclists, providing crucial updates via earpiece. It\u2019s these updates that allow the team to adapt to ever-changing race conditions, giving them the knowledge they need to cross the finish line first.In agile, just as on the Trek-Segafredo cycling team, a product owner helps the teams adjust the game plan on the fly in response to the latest information, including customer feedback and evolving business priorities.The most visible activity of the cycling team \u2014 competing in a race \u2014 is just one part of a much larger process. Not only is there extensive planning for each of the 19 events around the world in which the team competes, there is also the business side, which includes the development of their cycling products that must be constantly improved based on feedback from the team.Helping to keep all these moving parts in sync is Trek-Segafredo\u2019s own agile-powered management process. For example, to aid in the bike development, the process relies on CA Flowdock from CA Technologies that helps engineers quickly adapt their designs in response to real-time feedback from riders, wherever they are in the world. \u201cThe quicker that we can get feedback from the riders and make those changes to the development of a product,\u201d says Freddie Stouffer, Operations Manager, Trek-Segafredo of the benefit provided by Flowdock, \u201cthen the quicker that we can get the finished product underneath the riders and then, ultimately, get the finished product to market.\u201d You provide guidance to the team, which is otherwise self directing.

When Moravian College women\u2019s basketball head coach Mary Beth Spirk leads her team into a game, she keeps her instructions from the sidelines to a minimum. \u201cI want the players to be in charge,\u201d says Spirk. For her, pregame and even preseason preparation is all about collaborating with a team to let them direct themselves during gameplay. \u201cIf you have a good team, they should know what should be done,\u201d she says.Training up a team and then letting them do their thing is what Code for America is all about. The San Francisco-based nonprofit acts as a kind of Peace Corps for agile software development. Its mission is to help local government agencies across the country develop the applications they need to best serve members of the public who use their services. \u201cWhat we really are happiest about is when the people in a city feel like government is truly working for them,\u201d says founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka.Talented software developers join Code for America for one-year stints as fellows, who are loaned out to government agencies that need help with their digital initiatives. Given the time limit, the fellows need to work fast to build teams that can collaborate effectively after they leave. The nonprofit\u2019s agile-powered process fosters efficiency. \u201cInstead of really long planning processes and big procurements, we do things in an agile, iterative, data-driven and, most importantly, a very user-centered way,\u201d explains Pahlka.One of the basics of collaboration that coach Spirk focuses on with her team is making good passes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make a good pass,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s a turnover. Every time you have a turnover, you don\u2019t get a chance to shoot and score and you give the other team a chance to score.\u201d Simply put, \u201cif you\u2019re turning the ball over, you\u2019re not going to be successful.\u201dMaking those passes depends on teammates working well together, and that can\u2019t happen smoothly with Spirk riding her team from the sidelines. It\u2019s one of the most important lessons she\u2019s learned in her 29 years on the job, and it\u2019s helped her lead teams to nearly 550 wins. \u201cIt\u2019s a changing world,\u201d says Spirk. \u201cYou can\u2019t be that dictator, perhaps that I was when I first started coaching.\u201dCollaboration \u2014 with those closest to the game making key decisions \u2014 wins the day both on the court and in agile-powered development. Simply put, agile empowers Code for America fellows and the teams they work with to excel, meeting the digital needs of the public as never before.Countless organizations and businesses that are driving the application economy use agile processes and tools to communicate with maximum efficiency to quickly adapt to changing conditions and collaborate like well-trained sports teams. The results are clear. Research by CA Technologies that gathered data from 50,000 agile teams and more than 160,000 projects found that agile can help high-performing teams double productivity, cut time to market in half and improve quality by 250 percent.Artwork by : Leandro CastelaoThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "The Fed Is Learning Just How Hard the Exit From Easy Money Will Be", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBalancing ActThis is the buzz saw that Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, walked into as she addressed the news media \u2014 and by extension, every trading floor on earth \u2014 Wednesday afternoon.The Fed\u2019s official mission is to take care of the American economy, and the economy is doing pretty well. The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, its lowest in nine years and around the level Federal Reserve officials think is sustainable in the long run. Wages are rising steadily. After a soft first quarter, economic growth is accelerating.But global financial markets aren\u2019t having it. If you take bond and currency markets at face value, the underlying path of growth in the United States is too weak and global deflationary forces too powerful; the Fed will need to raise interest rates much slower than its officials say they expect.If markets could talk, they would be saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019ll raise interest rates as much as you say, and if you do it anyway you\u2019ll probably regret it.\u201dAll 17 top officials of the Fed expect an interest rate increase to happen this year, according to projections they released Wednesday. Yet financial futures markets price in only about a 40 percent chance that it will happen. Fed officials envision a 2.4 percent interest rate target at the end of 2018, versus 0.6 percent that is priced into the markets. Fed officials see inflation rising to its target of 2 percent by 2018 and staying there; the price of inflation-protected bonds implies it will be much lower.There are technical factors that distort those market signals, as Ms. Yellen noted in her news conference. For example, aggressive bond-buying by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may be sending money flooding across borders into higher-yielding American bonds, making American rates lower than the economic fundamentals would justify.But even with those distortions, Ms. Yellen and the Fed face danger if they ignore these market signals entirely. A pattern has repeated for years: Markets expect slower growth, lower inflation and a slower path of rate increases than Fed officials themselves; markets turn out to be right.Two years ago, for example, the median projection among Fed officials was that its interest rate target would be 2.5 percent at the end of 2016. A year ago it was 1.68 percent at the end of 2016. Now both look like pipe dreams. Fed leaders expect a 0.9 percent rate at the end of the year, and markets expect 0.4 percent.Ms. Yellen and the Fed have been grappling with which set of signals to listen to, and the tone that pervaded her news conference Wednesday was one of uncertainty.\u201cWe\u2019re quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of us believe as a base case it\u2019s reasonable to assume those rates will move up over time, but we aren\u2019t certain about that. There could be revisions in either direction.\u201dUltimately, by holding off on a June rate increase and marking down rate forecasts for the months ahead, the Fed nudged its views toward market views.As Fed officials make their decisions at their remaining four meetings of 2016, the issue that hangs over them is as complex as ever. It is not merely about evaluating how the United States economy is doing and whether it remains solidly on track \u2014 and given the flaws in economic data, that job is hard enough.Fed officials must also weigh whether the global force of low inflation is so powerful as to continue dragging down prices in the United States even after the domestic economy has healed. They have to figure out whether the feedback loops between economic weakness and easy money in other countries create unconventional risks to the United States by raising rates too quickly.The 2008 financial crisis was a profound test of the Fed\u2019s ability to prevent economic collapse; from 2009 to 2012, the central bank made crucial decisions to keep pushing the United States economy toward recovery.This year is showing just how intricate the exit from this era of easy money will truly be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Olympics Near, Brazil and Rio Let the Bad Times Roll", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessAre the Olympics responsible for those problems? Of course not. But they\u2019ve highlighted them. Whereas winning the Olympics in 2009 seemed to symbolize Brazil\u2019s new place on the world stage, the Olympics have since come to represent something else: \u201cthe hubris that existed during the boom years under Lula,\u201d said Alex Cuadros, the author of \u201cBrazillionaires,\u201d a book about Brazil due out in July. And at this point, Rio\u2019s problems and the Olympics\u2019 problems seem intertwined.In April, a top state official, Leonardo Espindola, publicly acknowledged that Brazil\u2019s problems could affect the Olympics and damage the country\u2019s image. \u201cWe are nearing a social collapse in our state,\u201d he said.Cities that hold Olympics rarely, if ever, break even on the Games. In Rio\u2019s case, it won\u2019t even be close. Brazil originally budgeted more than $14 billion to hold the Olympics, money that would be spent on infrastructure \u2014 stadiums, transportation improvements, the Olympic Village and so on \u2014 as well as on security and other logistical requirements.That number is now estimated at about $20 billion. But Rio is only likely to reap, at most, $4.5 billion in revenue, said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College whose recent book, \u201cCircus Maximus,\u201d examines the economic consequences of the Olympics and the World Cup.Instead, what cities promote when they bid for the Olympics are two things. The first is tourism: The Olympic Games, carried on television all over the world, offer a city publicity like almost nothing else. Barcelona and Sydney are great examples of cities that became much more prominent as tourist destinations after they held the Summer Games, in 1992 and 2000.Second, cities claim that the infrastructure and improvements that are made to accommodate the Games will improve residents\u2019 lives long after the athletes have left. As part of its bid, Brazilian officials promised to clean up the notoriously polluted Guanabara Bay in central Rio, where the sailing competition will be held. They would build stadiums, yes, but also infrastructure that would ease Rio\u2019s congested traffic. Officials also said that the Olympics would improve tax revenue and economic growth \u2014 not only in the years before the Games, but for years afterward.Perhaps the best example of the problem with Rio\u2019s Olympic-mandated infrastructure is a new 10-mile rail line that will connect the hotels of Ipanema and Copacabana to the western suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where the Olympic Park has been built. It will cut the travel time from over an hour by car \u2014 on a good day \u2014 to less than 30 minutes. But after many delays, the rail line is now expected to open just four days before the opening ceremony. The cost has risen to $2.8 billion after an initial estimate of $1.6 billion. There are serious questions about whether there will be enough time to properly test the new line before putting it into use.There is also a question about how useful this new line will be after the Games. Barra da Tijuca is a relatively wealthy area, and the most urgent transportation needs are in poorer areas of Rio. \u201cThe building of the new subway line is problematic,\u201d said Christopher Gaffney, a professor at the University of Zurich who studies large-scale sports events like the Olympics. \u201cExtending that line meant they couldn\u2019t afford to extend any other line where it was really needed. It is a poorly conceived, poorly executed project.\u201dLast week, the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a state of \u201cpublic calamity\u201d \u2014 a declaration usually associated with a natural disaster \u2014 essentially acknowledging that the state was bankrupt and would be unable to honor its commitment to the Olympics without help. The federal government stepped in with an emergency $850 million loan, some of which will be used to complete the new rail line.The Games will go on, of course, and for those of us watching on television, it will be a splendid spectacle. Most of the Olympics will take place in a kind of bubble, divorced from the city\u2019s problems. But after the Games end on Aug. 21, almost three weeks after they begin, most of us will move on. The people of Rio will be left to pick up the pieces.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lord of the Lies", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEarlier this month, the world\u2019s most battle-scarred cable news network did something extraordinary in this year of vaporous political contrails. While Donald Trump was delivering one of his easily debunked lies, CNN fact-checked him \u2014 in near real time at the bottom of the screen.\u201cTrump: I never said Japan should have nukes (he did).\u201d Thus read the chyron that shook the television world \u2014 maybe.Given the scale of Trump\u2019s mendacity and the stakes for the free world, it\u2019s time that we go into the fall debates with a new rule \u2014 an instant fact-check on statements made by the candidates onstage. The Presidential Debate Commission should do what any first-grader with Google access can do, and call out lies before the words hit the floor.Setting up a truth referee is not difficult. And while doing such a thing is unlikely to ensure that the debates would be substantive, it could at least guarantee a reality foundation at a time when fact-free speech is the language of the political class.How can we discuss the economy when Trump suggests that the unemployment rate, just under 5 percent, is actually 42 percent? Or debate the Paris climate accord, when Trump falsely claims it \u201cgives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land\u201d? Or deal with terrorism, after Trump said he knows \u201cmore about ISIS than the generals.\u201d The debates are meaningless without a neutral party screening the garbage.The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker has dinged Trump with 30 of its Four Pinocchio ratings \u2014 lying 70 percent of the time. Trump cares so little about the truth that when the Fact Checker reaches out to him for an explanation, he never responds, the paper noted.Trump got his start on the national political stage as a liar, playing to the birther fantasies of Barack Obama\u2019s worst haters. One of the questions he might be asked in the three fall debates is what, exactly, he discovered when he claimed his investigators \u201ccannot believe what they\u2019re finding\u201d in Hawaii five years ago.With Trump University, he created a business model built on a house of lies. An executive called it \u201ca total lie,\u201d and a sales manager said it was a \u201cfraudulent scheme\u201d designed to bilk vulnerable clients, according to court testimony. It was that class-action lawsuit that got Trump into his present caldron of lies \u2014 calling the Indiana-born judge in the case a \u201cMexican.\u201d By that standard, Trump is a German, with a grandfather from Kallstadt.For a while, I tried to chart the days of his lies, and just got overwhelmed. He said the suicide of the former Clinton aide Vince Foster was \u201cvery fishy,\u201d when five separate investigations found it to be a sad self-killing and nothing more. He could have looked at the United States Drought Monitor before saying \u201cthere is no drought\u201d at the very California site that is now in its fifth year of an epic arid spell.He even lies about his lies. He claimed he wanted to keep a personal donation to veterans private, when in fact he\u2019d boasted in January of a $1 million gift, which wasn\u2019t sent out until the press began questioning him on it months later.Sadly, a lot of voters don\u2019t care if a candidate is a pathological liar. But most of us should. It\u2019s up to the debate commission, as they set the rules for the fall, to ensure that truth has a place on the stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ballot Is Expected to Offer Stark Choice on Economy", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byLetter From WashingtonThe contempt that Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump express for each other will continue to play out in vitriolic sound bites. But their profound differences on what to do about the economy and the struggling middle class are far more important.\u201cThis election will be won by whichever candidate convinces middle-class voters they are better for their jobs and future prospects,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Mr. Trump.Gene B. Sperling, a leading economic official under President Bill Clinton and President Obama, and an adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said, \u201cThis is about whether economic forces hollow out the middle class or whether those forces strengthen the middle class, creating jobs and higher wages.\u201dAs the economy has recovered from the 2008 crisis, the unemployment rate has shrunk to less than half of what it was eight years ago and wages have started to rise. But median average family income, in real dollars, is less than it was 10 years ago.On the issue voters say is their top concern, the two presumptive nominees offer radically different remedies. Mrs. Clinton goes out of her way to show that most of her initiatives are paid for.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s agenda includes calls for a higher minimum wage, 12 weeks\u2019 paid leave for chronically ill workers and parents with a newborn, more funds for job training and education, especially higher education, and a $275 billion infrastructure plan.These increases will be offset, however, by a subsequent middle-class tax cut.But the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals for job creation involves getting tough on trade by renegotiating previous treaties and imposing heavy duties on imports, particularly from China or Mexico. Although international laws and the need for congressional approval could inhibit such actions, a president does have flexibility to impose some trade sanctions.In the coming months, each candidate will be pressed to provide more specifics; Mr. Trump has been especially vague.He has delegated two advocates of supply-side tax cuts to revise his plan to make it less costly. One of them, Mr. Moore of the Heritage Foundation, says the objective is to cut the projected deficit by at least two-thirds, to around $3 trillion over a decade. This, he says, would be achieved primarily by limiting deductions for upper-income taxpayers.Mr. Sperling suggests that a middle-class tax cut, higher education and a larger infrastructure plan \u201care candidates for expansion\u201d by Mrs. Clinton.Until more specifics are forthcoming, it is difficult to gauge the economic impact of either candidate\u2019s plans. Several economic analyses, including those by Moody\u2019s Analytics and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have estimated that Mr. Trump\u2019s plans, primarily because they rely on protectionism, deportation of undocumented workers and debt, would throw the economy into a recession. Mr. Trump rejects that contention and says that he would create growth of 6 percent a year, a level last achieved in 1983.Advertisement"}

Badly. They had an argument so big they did not speak to one another for days, Ms. Driscoll said. Shortly afterward, her husband went off in a huff to see friends up north, in Derby.With only days to go until the referendum on membership in the bloc on Thursday, polls suggest that the country is deeply split along socioeconomic and regional lines, with many older and working-class voters in England favoring leaving, and younger and better-educated Britons, and a majority of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland, favoring staying.As the consequences of the choice come into focus for voters, tensions are bubbling. In the case of the Driscoll family, they are boiling over.\u201cI completely disagree with her,\u201d Louise said on a recent afternoon, looking her mother squarely in the face as they sat in a cafe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be leaving, like, an organization that has helped us more than we could ever help ourselves if we were to go it alone.\u201dLouise is the only one in her family who wants Britain to remain. Her parents and her 80-year-old grandfather want out.\u201cThis is a little island,\u201d her mother said matter-of-factly, lighting up a cigarette and letting the ash fall on her glittery sneakers. \u201cWe should look after our own first. Charity begins at home.\u201d\u201cBut we are all people!\u201d Louise said. \u201cWe should help each other.\u201d\u201cIt don\u2019t work that way, darling,\u201d her mother replied, shaking her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re born here, you pass as English. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re black, white, green or blue, or purple with pink spots on \u2014 you\u2019re English.\u201dThose born abroad, Ms. Driscoll said, \u201chave got their own governments, their own parliaments, whatever.\u201dUp and down the country, the debate is pitting husband against wife, children against parents, sisters against brothers. The divisions are unlikely to heal easily after the referendum is decided.Even the family of Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the most prominent face of the campaign for leaving the bloc, has not been immune to disputes: His father, Stanley; sister, Rachel; and brother Jo, who is a member of Parliament and who worked closely with Prime Minister David Cameron, favor remaining in the union. Boris Johnson\u2019s mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, wants to leave. (Rachel Johnson reportedly tried, without success, to dissuade the former mayor from backing a British exit over a soggy game of tennis.)In Islington, the neighborhood in London where members of the Driscoll family have lived for eight generations, residents are increasingly going public with their voting intentions, which is a rarity in Britain.Rows of houses on some streets have \u201cRemain\u201d posters in their windows. On a thoroughfare filled with butchers, bakeries and fish-and-chip-shops, tradespeople nodded their head vigorously when asked if they were planning to vote out.The clash over Britain\u2019s continued membership in Europe has touched on issues as varied as immigration, terrorism, the economy, London\u2019s housing shortage and the fate of the National Health Service.Some of these issues, like immigration, are directly related to the European Union. Others, like the shortage of affordable housing, have little to do with it.Yet those distinctions are blurring. For many, the referendum is as much a chance to register displeasure with the country\u2019s direction as it is an opportunity to reject or embrace Europe. The stance of some voters is being shaped by personal experience and anecdote.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThere is, for example, a widespread perception that European citizens are flocking to Britain, especially from Eastern Europe, to take advantage of its social welfare system.But Britain\u2019s welfare system is not as generous as those of many other European nations, and fewer than 7 percent of immigrants receive benefits.In Ms. Driscoll\u2019s case, she remembers her grandfather pawning and re-pawning his suit to get by. That memory was revived, she said, with the discovery a few years ago that a newly arrived Polish family in her neighborhood had received money to buy a car and move into a four-bedroom house.\u201cYears ago, we never had social security or anything like that,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cYou sold your own.\u201dHer grandmother would get her \u201cgranddad\u2019s suit out of pawn when he got paid on Friday, put it back in pawn on Monday,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cThat\u2019s how they lived.\u201dHaving different cultures and communities is \u201cfantastic,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what I don\u2019t like is the fact that, through having that, we\u2019ve now left ourselves open. I feel like a second-class citizen in my own country.\u201dMs. Driscoll is proudly English (not, in her mind, British \u2014 she crossed out the word on her passport and replaced it with \u201cEnglish\u201d). Her father fought in World War II, and her grandfather in World War I. She has lived all her life in this area of London.Louise grew up in the same area but in a more prosperous, multicultural Britain than earlier generations had experienced. In school, she was one of only two white students. Her friends are Eritrean, Nigerian and South African.Louise voted for the Green Party in last year\u2019s general election and was appalled that her mother, traditionally a Labour voter, had opted for the anti-Europe, anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party. (\u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m a bit antiquated \u2014 can\u2019t help it, love,\u201d Ms. Driscoll replied, somewhat sheepishly, after Louise uttered an expletive.)Louise said she understood the pressures that immigration placed on schools and hospitals. But leaving the European Union worried her, she said, because it risked wrecking the economy and making it hard for young people to secure employment.It took her eight months to find work as a barista, she said.\u201cIf I wanted to work abroad, it would be a lot easier if England was in the E.U.,\u201d Louise said.Her mother suggested that Louise move to New York, possibly unaware of the paradox that this would make her an immigrant herself.Almost inevitably, the debate over immigration veered into an argument about terrorism. Britain\u2019s porous borders were letting terrorists slip through, Ms. Driscoll said, repeating a message the camp to leave the European Union has relentlessly pushed on voters.Louise asked why she wanted to shut immigrants out of England.\u201cIt ain\u2019t the nice ones I\u2019m worried about,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cIt\u2019s the nasty ones.\u201d\u201cTo have opened the floodgates, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Come, and come and kill us,\u2019 \u201d she said, adding that members of the Irish Republican Army had at least notified the public before setting off bombs across Britain during the 1970s and 1980s.\u201cWe can get on a bus tomorrow with a bloke with a backpack, and bye-bye, boom,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cYeah? Nothing to do with what they call their beliefs.\u201dLouise rolled her eyes. In what sounded like a final plea, she said: \u201cAt the end of the day, the E.U. is going to affect my generation more than it will affect your generation. So shouldn\u2019t it be down to us to decide whether or not to stay?\u201dHer mother fell silent and was thoughtful.\u201cI am 55 years of age,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI know \u2014 I appreciate that in 50 years\u2019 time, you\u2019ll be here and I won\u2019t, and you\u2019ll have to put up with whatever\u2019s happened.\u201dShe paused.\u201cBut I still want out,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elaborate Suicide Attack Hits Christian Village in Lebanon", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Eight suicide bombers launched two waves of attacks on the Christian town of Al Qaa in northeastern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least five people and raising fears that violence from the civil war in neighboring Syria will further destabilize Lebanon, its fragile neighbor.Four attackers blew themselves up in the town before dawn, killing five people and wounding a dozen others, according to local officials. Four more attacks took place at night as residents prepared for funerals to be held on Tuesday morning, wounding 11 more people, according to the state-run National News Agency.Lebanon has so far managed to avoid large-scale violence, but the country has extensive political and sectarian ties with Syria and has struggled to insulate itself from the civil war. Some Lebanese have joined the fight across the border. Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite militia, is backing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and some Sunni Muslims have joined the rebels seeking to topple him.The country has also taken in about 1.5 million Syrian refugees, whose presence has stressed government services and put pressure on the economy.While bombings have hit Beirut and elsewhere during the Syrian war, such elaborate attacks have been rare near Al Qaa, a small Christian town a few miles from the Syrian border in northeastern Lebanon. Hezbollah is the area\u2019s primary military force and has played a vital role in pushing Syrian rebels away from the border.Residents of Al Qaa reached on Monday night said they had been pinned down in their homes without power as the Lebanese Army searched the area.\u201cPeople are stuck in their houses, not daring to go out and fearing more suicide bombers,\u201d the Rev. Elian Nasrallah, the priest of the town\u2019s Mar Elias Church, said by telephone.He had been in his home at night, preparing his message for the funerals of those killed that morning, when he heard an explosion and saw a ball of fire erupt outside the church.\u201cWe\u2019re living in terror in this town,\u201d he said.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. Both the Nusra Front, which is affiliated with Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State are active on the Syrian side of the border. Nor was it clear why the town had been targeted, as Lebanon\u2019s Christians have not played a role in Syria\u2019s civil war.Towns in eastern Lebanon have absorbed large numbers of Syrian refugees, sometimes doubling or tripling their population, and Monday\u2019s attacks threatened to further inflame tensions between them and the Lebanese. After the attacks, a number of towns near Al Qaa announced curfews for Syrian refugees out of fear that militants could hide among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Britain Is Edging Toward \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byQuestion of IdentityIt may now be time to seriously consider what would happen if Britain left the European Union.Just as it would be a mistake to read much into a few polls, the recent move toward Brexit should not be dismissed out of hand.First off, the polls may be more accurate than their critics give them credit for.Sometimes, just one issue can have a big influence on an election. Immigration may turn out to be that issue for the Brexit vote.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe big question now is whether concerns about immigration will be strong enough for the \u201cout\u201d camp to win.Immigration may have more pull as an issue of sovereignty. Those who support Brexit believe that the European Union has taken too many powers from the British government. Britain must now abide by European Union rules that allow the union\u2019s citizens freedom of movement across the region. This generally prevents Britain from placing restrictions on legal immigration from nations in the European Union.By coming out of the union, it would regain that power. And taking that back might seem particularly important to those voters who fear that Britain will have to take in large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa who have fled to Europe.That is hardly the most reassuring prediction for those who want Britain to stay in the European Union. But it may be all they have to cling to in the next two and a half weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Psychological Impact of Britain\u2019s Vote", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsBritain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is an unwelcome blow to an already-fragile world economy. The real impact, however, is psychological. Companies and investors now have to reconsider other once-unthinkable risks.Most of the economic costs of untangling four decades of integration will fall on Britain. Still, this is a shock the rest of the world did not need. Morgan Stanley economists estimate that the decision to exit, known as Brexit, could knock 0.3 percentage points off global growth in 2017. A soaring dollar puts renewed strain on emerging-market borrowers whose debts are denominated in the American currency \u2014 and may prompt the Federal Reserve to delay its next increase in interest rates. The Japanese yen also rose, undermining the economic revival plans of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe.Despite the gyrations, though, it would be surprising if the departure led to financial calamity. After the truly global crisis of 2008, central banks have swap lines and other tools to minimize market disruptions. Should action be necessary, policy makers convening in the Swiss town of Basel this weekend are well placed to coordinate it.The lasting damage may be to old ways of thinking. Until a few weeks ago, it seemed hard to believe that the majority of voters in Britain would overrule the country\u2019s political and financial establishment. The repercussions of that decision will affect trade and capital flows as companies and investors rethink Britain\u2019s long-term stability.The reverberations will be felt elsewhere, too. The decision to leave will embolden populist parties across Europe, raising other previously ignored fears. Marine Le Pen\u2019s chance of winning the French presidency next year, for example, suddenly seems less remote. A victory for the far right in France would, in turn, have profound consequences for the future of the European Union and the single currency.Then there\u2019s Donald Trump. According to the online gambling site Betfair, the presumptive Republican nominee has a less than 25 percent chance of winning the presidential election in November. But those are about the odds that the same site attached to a \u201cLeave\u201d vote in Britain\u2019s referendum a few days ago. Britain\u2019s upheaval is a reminder that other shocks are also possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u2018Stairway to Heaven\u2019 to Be Scrutinized in Court in Copyright Case", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byThe trial, set to start on June 14 with Mr. Page and Mr. Plant expected to be in attendance, may prove fascinating legal theater for fans. But it will also be closely watched by a music business that is grappling with a series of recent copyright decisions.\u201cIt used to be that melody and lyrics were the basis of all infringement claims, but now that\u2019s fuzzier,\u201d said Jay Rosenthal, a music industry lawyer and the former general counsel of the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association. \u201c\u2018Blurred Lines\u2019 has opened the door and made rhythm and beats and \u2018feel\u2019 perhaps proprietary, where before it was not the case.\u201dThe Led Zeppelin case was filed two years ago by a trustee representing the songs of Randy Wolfe, also known as Randy California, one of Spirit\u2019s main songwriters, who died in 1997. But the dispute has echoes of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d and is being watched as a test of the limits of copyright.The case focuses on the famous opening of \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d in which an acoustic guitar plays arpeggiated chords in a descending pattern. That part, the suit contends, copied Spirit\u2019s \u201cTaurus,\u201d released in 1968. In the suit\u2019s complaint, Francis Malofiy, the lead lawyer representing the plaintiff, said that Led Zeppelin\u2019s members heard Spirit\u2019s song when the bands crossed paths on the road early in their careers.The suit, filed on behalf of Michael Skidmore, the trustee, accused Led Zeppelin of copyright infringement and the novel claim (duly struck down by the judge) of \u201cfalsification of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll history.\u201d Mr. Malofiy has said that he is seeking as much as $40 million in damages.Mr. Wolfe never pursued a lawsuit during his lifetime. But Mr. Skidmore, a customs consultant and former music journalist who has controlled Mr. Wolfe\u2019s trust since 2009, filed the case in 2014, shortly after a Supreme Court ruling that said that copyright infringement cases could proceed even after long delays.Mr. Page and Mr. Plant deny ever having heard \u201cTaurus\u201d before the case came to light and say that \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d was written independently. Yet over the years, the band has settled numerous challenges of plagiarism by adding other songwriters\u2019 credits to its albums. In 2012, for example, the band settled a suit by Jake Holmes over \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d and subsequent releases of the song on Led Zeppelin\u2019s albums list it as being written by Mr. Page and \u201cinspired by Jake Holmes.\u201dWhatever happens with the Led Zeppelin trial, the industry is still trying to understand the effects of the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d case, which is under appeal.Matt Pincus, the chief executive of Songs Music Publishing, an independent publisher that works with current pop and hip-hop acts like the Weeknd and Desiigner, said his company was seeing far more claims of infringement now \u2014 most made privately, outside of court \u2014 than ever before. But the reasons were not clear, he said.\u201cIt could be opportunism, because lawyers are smelling blood,\u201d Mr. Pincus said. \u201cBut it could also be because we have moved to a real collaboration economy now, where pop records have multiple collaborators in a way that they didn\u2019t five or six years ago.\u201d Those collaborators may dispute credits or royalties after the fact.\u201cThe fact that maybe some people are being caught now that wouldn\u2019t be, or are being pursued now that wouldn\u2019t be, is not a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Busch said. \u201cBut the idea that \u2018Blurred Lines\u2019 has opened up the floodgates is absurd, and I would suspect that those who are claiming this may have an agenda to take that position.\u201dDonald S. Passman, a top music lawyer who wrote the book \u201cAll You Need to Know About the Music Business,\u201d called the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d case \u201caberrational\u201d and suggested that its long-term impact may be minimal.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like you\u2019re driving along the highway at 65 miles an hour at night,\u201d Mr. Passman said. \u201cYou see an accident, slow down, and 15 minutes later, you\u2019re back at full speed. It\u2019s more like that.\u201dThe judge in the Led Zeppelin case, R. Gary Klausner of United States District Court, has ruled that the band\u2019s past problems with copyright cannot be presented at trial, and Mr. Malofiy, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, may face other challenges as well.Since the case focuses on songwriting, rather than on the recording of the song, the jury must base its decision on the written version of \u201cTaurus\u201d that was used to register its copyright. As in the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d trial, the jury may hear versions of the two songs as presented by music experts retained by both sides.In a sideshow to the trial itself, the lawyers have been battling in public and through filings with the court. In the most recent volley, Mr. Malofiy accused Mr. Page and Mr. Plant of \u201crefusing to appear\u201d at the trial. But in a filing, Led Zeppelin\u2019s lawyers, Peter J. Anderson and Helene Freeman, called Mr. Malofiy\u2019s claims \u201ca P.R. stunt in the hope of tainting the jury pool,\u201d and said that Mr. Page and Mr. Plant would be present.Mr. Anderson and Ms. Freeman declined to comment. But in a brief interview, Mr. Malofiy called their most recent filing \u201c100 percent bluster.\u201dLed Zeppelin also argues that the commonalities between the songs are generic elements in musical composition that go back decades, and the core of the pieces in question are little more than a basic chord progression.But in denying the band\u2019s request for summary judgment, Judge Klausner found that there was enough similarity to warrant a test at trial, in a phrase that could almost be an excerpt from a musicology textbook: \u201cWhile it is true that a descending chromatic four-chord progression is a common convention that abounds in the music industry, the similarities here transcend the core structure.\u201dA jury will decide just how similar they are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Birthplace of a Graft Scandal, Brazil\u2019s Crisis Is on Full Display", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The mercantile thrum at the Posto da Torre begins at daybreak with a rush of motorcycle deliverymen and taxi drivers who come to fill their tanks with gas, and their bellies with warm puffs of cheesy bread.Later, civil servants come to refuel their pampered cars, college graduates buy cigarettes and sun-creased panhandlers collect coins for their next beer buzz.Posto da Torre, a gritty pit stop in the heart of Brazil\u2019s antiseptic capital, is indistinguishable from the countless other 24-hour gas stations that fleck the nation\u2019s cities and highways.But hidden behind the gas station\u2019s row of storefronts was an illegal money transfer business run by its owner, Carlos Habib Chater, and an associate, Alberto Yousseff, officials discovered during a 2013 drug investigation that led the federal police to the operation.In the months that followed, Mr. Yousseff, encouraged by the promise of a plea deal, told prosecutors about his role as the moneyman who helped funnel billions of dollars skimmed from Brazil\u2019s state oil company, and payoffs from construction companies, to some of the country\u2019s most powerful politicians.Here at Posto da Torre, named for a nearby television tower that provides visitors with panoramic views of the capital, most customers seem unaware of the gas station\u2019s notorious past. Few, though, have escaped the deprivations of an economic recession that has left 11 million Brazilians unemployed and millions of others struggling to survive.Soaring gas prices, high taxes and rising inflation have pushed many working-class Brazilians to the brink of poverty. Petty corruption and an onerous bureaucracy frustrate the aspirations of young entrepreneurs.The birthplace of a national scandal, Posto da Torre is also a stage where the cruelties of Brazil\u2019s economic crisis and political paralysis are on full display.Consider T\u00e2nia Ara\u00fajo Ribeiro, 32, who serves sugar cane juice and manioc flour crepes at the gas station\u2019s snack bar. Until last year, Ms. Ribeiro and her husband, Gleiciano, 32, were newly inducted members of the Brazilian middle class. They bought their first car, took frequent vacations and did not think twice about dining out.Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.All that changed after Mr. Ribeiro lost his construction job. Now the couple hesitate before buying meat, and they have postponed plans to have a second child. \u201cI\u2019m very afraid,\u201d Ms. Ribeiro said one recent morning. \u201cI can\u2019t have other children if I can\u2019t provide for them.\u201dLike most of the police officers, landscapers and street cleaners who help maintain the modernist capital, a utopian-inspired creation of the architect Oscar Niemeyer, the Ribeiros live in a satellite city a 40-minute bus ride away. Unplanned and plagued by poor infrastructure and rampant crime, the cities are home to more than two million migrants who flocked to the region in the 1960s and 1970s seeking jobs but could not afford the capital\u2019s daunting housing prices.Under Ms. Rousseff and her predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian economy roared, buoyed by global demand for commodities like soybeans and iron ore that vaulted millions of the working poor into the ranks of the middle class. Slowing growth in China helped bring the good times to an abrupt end, but critics say Ms. Rousseff\u2019s flawed economic policies compounded the misery.The past two years of recession and scandal have left Brazilians like Ms. Ribeiro angry and embittered. \u201cWe pay so many taxes and practically all of it gets thrown to the garbage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get nothing, and everything goes into their pockets.\u201dOutside the gas station, F\u00e1bio Rodrigues Lima, 32, was filling up the tank of his motorcycle.Told about Posto da Torre\u2019s ignominious role in the scandal, he reacted with indignation and then fumed about the everyday corruption that complicates life in Brazil. A migrant from the coastal state of Bahia, he used to work at an upscale restaurant here but quit after the owners refused to give him his share of the 10 percent service fee they charged diners. With a 7-year-old son to support, he makes deliveries for a drugstore chain using a motorcycle he borrowed from his mother.\u201cWhat I can\u2019t bear, and what everyone else can\u2019t bear, is all this corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see politicians, I feel disgusted.\u201dPosto da Torre\u2019s employees have been instructed not to speak to the media about the scandal, but several welcomed the opportunity to unload. Claudenice Cristiana Rodrigues, 37, an attendant at the gas station\u2019s laundromat, is raising four daughters on the $700 she earns each month. \u201cAmong all the laundries, this one offers the best salary,\u201d she said.Still, rising prices have forced her to cut back on nonessentials like cable television and the home internet that gave her daughters a leg up on school assignments. Having never completed high school, she dreams of continuing her education, and perhaps one day buying a motorcycle.But despite the hardships, Ms. Rodrigues is rarity among Brazilians: She is among the 11 percent who still support Ms. Rousseff, the embattled president. \u201cDilma made many mistakes, but I didn\u2019t want to see her suspended,\u201d she said.Ms. Rodrigues is a migrant from Maranh\u00e3o, an impoverished state in Brazil\u2019s northeast. She and her family were beneficiaries of past government programs that distributed free land, part of an effort to encourage people to move to what was then a forbidding expanse of savanna. She turns wistful recalling the first night they camped out on their land, sleeping under the stars. \u201cIt was only us and the sky,\u201d she said.In the right hands, government can be a force for good, she said, noting the many relatives who received housing and other benefits during the administrations of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff, both of them from the country\u2019s left-leaning Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cIf there was an election tomorrow I\u2019d vote for Lula,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. da Silva.Ms. Ribeiro, the snack bar employee, was not as sanguine. As far as she is concerned, Brazilian politicians are primarily interested in lining their own pockets.\u201cWe could have more equality if the politicians wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope things get better, but I don\u2019t have much hope. Even when good people get to power, the money corrodes them and they end up forgetting the Brazilian people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Monday, global stock markets rallied and the British pound strengthened against the dollar.Still, Edward Sankey, the co-head of equity capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Deutsche Bank, said he expected little activity in new stocks for a while.British citizens will vote on whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. While a vote to leave would give Britain more autonomy, it could also create great economic uncertainty.\u201cIf there is an exit, a number of issuers will take time to figure out the market reaction before deciding to press ahead,\u201d he said.Bankers here say that several companies that had privately planned to go public have delayed their plans to list until after the outcome of the referendum, to avoid the uncertainty that can lead to wild swings in the financial markets and stock prices.Although the London market has had relative success \u2014 Jimmy Choo, WorldPay and Pets at Home are among its most notable listings in recent years \u2014 it has already been a challenging year for initial public offerings globally.Turbulent markets in the first quarter, driven in part by uncertainty about the Chinese economy, have weighed on I.P.O.s in Europe and around the world.\u201cBetween now and end of July, the pipeline is not huge,\u201d Tom Johnson, the co-head of Barclays\u2019 equity capital markets business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. \u201cThere will be quite a few in the second half potentially. I think the second half will be materially larger.\u201dThe number of new listings in Europe this year is at its lowest level since 2013. There were 77 initial public offerings that generated $15.7 billion in proceeds in Europe through June 17, according to data from Thomson Reuters.That compared with 113 offerings that generated $32.7 billion in proceeds in Europe in the period last year and 113 offerings that generated $33.1 billion in proceeds in the region through June 17 in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters.London accounted for 34 percent of all listings and has been home to two of the top 10 biggest deals in Europe this year, in terms of proceeds.The five largest offerings this year, however, have all come in Continental Europe.The biggest listing this year, by far, was Dong Energy, the Danish utility and the world\u2019s largest offshore wind power operator.It generated about $2.6 billion in proceeds as the signature transaction in what has been a down year for initial public offerings in Europe and could stand as the biggest listing in the region this year.The offering on Nasdaq in Copenhagen valued Dong Energy at about $15 billion.The next three largest deals, in terms of proceeds, were the Dutch government\u2019s sale of a stake in the insurer ASR Nederland, the sale of the lighting business of the Dutch electronics giant Philips and GE Capital\u2019s sale of Moneta Money Bank, its former banking business in the Czech Republic.Moneta listed in Prague, while ASR and Philips Lighting had their offerings in Amsterdam.The biggest deal in Britain this year has been the spinoff of National Australia Bank\u2019s British unit, Clydesdale Bank. That transaction generated about $570 million in proceeds.Globally, the I.P.O. market remains well above the level where it was during the financial crisis as private equity firms exit investments they made in the years before the crisis.And privatizations by European governments and companies seeking to separate noncore businesses are expected to drive initial public offerings this year, but an uptick in activity might not come until the fall, no matter how Britain votes, financial industry experts say.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Should Shut Down Zombie Businesses to Help the Economy", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialChina knows that it has to shut down steel mills, coal mines and other industrial units that are producing much more of just about everything than the world needs, depressing prices and hurting businesses and workers everywhere. But the government has been reluctant to act for fear of throwing millions out of work and damaging Chinese banks that have lent money to what are essentially zombie businesses kept alive by government policies.In 2008, China began pumping tens of billions of dollars into its economy and encouraged banks to embark on a lending spree to offset the effect of the financial crisis. As a result, the country continued to grow quickly, even as other countries slid into recession. The government intervention came at a high cost as businesses, many of them owned by provincial and local governments, borrowed excessively to invest in projects based on unrealistic assumptions about global demand.The result is that China now faces a debt problem and an overcapacity problem. Goldman Sachs estimates that the amount of debt in the Chinese economy jumped to 235 percent of gross domestic product in 2015, from 130 percent in 2008. At its current trajectory, Goldman analysts say that number could rise to 344 percent of G.D.P. by 2020.The bills for that debt and investment binge are now coming due, including human costs that merit a compassionate response. Reducing industrial production could force five million to 10 million workers from their jobs, says Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Banks and other investors may have to write off or restructure tens of billions of dollars in loans and bonds.To help affected workers, China needs a stronger social safety net \u2014 retraining people for jobs in the service sector, providing generous pensions to workers close to retirement age and relocating workers in hard-hit areas to cities and towns where jobs are more plentiful. Increased spending on health and education would improve social services and create jobs. Over all, these policies should make it easier for provincial and local governments to shut down unprofitable enterprises.On the financial side, China needs a more effective process for companies to restructure debts, merge with other businesses or liquidate their assets. The current bankruptcy system is so inefficient that many smaller businesses that fail simply disappear without settling their debts. State-owned banks keep ailing companies, some government owned, alive by rolling over their loans simply because managers do not want to acknowledge losses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb and the Battle of Suitcase Alley", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byBig CityEarly this year, Mike Quinn, a lawyer in the art world, moved from the West Village to the East Village, into an apartment in an eight-unit building on Third Street between First and Second Avenues. The twin plagues of chain commerce and luxury residential towers have eradicated much of what distinguished the two neighborhoods historically, but Mr. Quinn noticed one big difference right away \u2014 all over the East Village, and where he lived in particular, people were hauling luggage around all the time. He began referring to his block as Suitcase Alley. Airbnb guests from around the world remain always in view.The company doesn\u2019t dispute the figure; it instead seeks to have the legislation modified, so that a costume designer living in Chelsea, for instance, could sublet her rental apartment for the four or five days a month she worked in Los Angeles with no worries that she was engaging in an illegitimate transaction.As one city alderman described the new era to The Chicago Tribune: \u201cThis is \u2018The Jetsons.\u2019 We\u2019re not going back to \u2018The Flintstones.\u2019\u201dIn New York and other cities with exorbitant housing costs, one longstanding objection to Airbnb has been that certain listings effectively remove units from the residential housing market, suppressing supply and theoretically driving up rents.According to a report to be released by a consortium of housing activists, 16 percent of Airbnb listings in New York City, or approximately 8,000 units, should be considered \u201cimpact listings,\u201d meaning that they are booked several times per month and listed for at least three months per year by someone who advertises multiple apartments on Airbnb, and not just the single apartment in which he or she lives. These are the commercial profiteers.Validating Mr. Quinn\u2019s Suitcase Alley observation, the report found that impact listings predominated in the East Village. The report goes further to state that the number of vacant and available apartments in New York City would increase by 10 percent if those listings were returned to the rental market.One potential if unlikely road to legislative compromise would be for Airbnb itself to ban those listings, effectively returning livable apartments to the housing market. This might encourage state and local government to loosen the restrictions over what the costume designer and the retired school principal might do with the apartments they rent on occasional out-of-town weekends. With the city\u2019s population aging rapidly, home sharing is an obvious means to extending income beyond age 70 or 80.Governing Airbnb has consumed a great deal more of the political conversation than have other measures that might be taken to alleviate the city\u2019s housing problems. To the best of my knowledge, no one is clamoring to ban the conversion of multiple-unit brownstones into single-family homes, for instance. These conversions dominate the landscape in parts of Brooklyn. On one block in Brooklyn Heights, a developer is turning a building formerly containing seven rental units into a 7,750-square-foot single-family townhouse that will go on the market for $18 million. Many people find this distasteful, but few are taking to the barricades to suggest it should be against the law.\u201cIf you have a bad neighbor they are there for a year or forever; if you have a bad Airbnb neighbor they are there for two days,\u201d he said. \u201cHas it corrupted the neighborhood? I think the high rents already there corrupted the neighborhood.\u201dEMAIL: bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Mexico", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate18 PhotosA CONTEMPORARY APARTMENT IN MEXICO CITY FACING CHAPULTEPEC PARK$2.875 MILLIONThis five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment, in a high-rise 1997 development named Del Bosque designed by Cesar Pelli, is in Polanco, one of Mexico City\u2019s most exclusive neighborhoods. It sits across from Chapultepec Park and two blocks from Avenida Presidente Masaryk, known as Mexico City\u2019s Rodeo Drive, said Vivian Bardavid, a Mexico City-based agent with Guadalajara Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing. Between five and 20 minutes\u2019 walking distance are museums and other cultural sites, restaurants, hotels and embassies. The international airport is about 10 miles away.The apartment, which is about 5,480 square feet, is one of two on the fourth floor. Past the front door and a small foyer, a hallway leads to three bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, an office and a half-bath. The master suite, in the left corner, has a large bathroom with a glass-enclosed shower and a double sink, and a deep walk-in closet.Down the main hallway in the opposite direction from the bedrooms, the living room, family room and dining room are in the center of the apartment. Most of the flooring is hardwood imported from Norway, Ms. Bardavid said. The custom-designed furniture throughout the apartment is available through separate negotiation, she said. The art is not for sale. The family room, tucked next to the living room, can be separated with sliding doors from the rest of the home.On the right side of the apartment are the kitchen, two staff bedrooms, a staff bathroom and laundry facilities. The kitchen appliances are by Wolf. The apartment has air-conditioning and ample storage, in the form of multiple closets in the main hallway.The building\u2019s amenities, including a tennis court, an indoor pool, a children\u2019s play area, valet parking and a gym, are included in the monthly fee. The fee also covers security, concierge service and maintenance. Residents can use a heliport and party and meeting rooms for a fee.MARKET OVERVIEWMexico City\u2019s real estate market is performing very strongly this year, agents said. There are many new developments, and prices across the board have increased. This is partly because of a strengthening Mexican economy, and partly because sellers have adjusted to a new tax on capital gains that temporarily made them hesitant to put their homes on the market, agents said.Carmella Peters Romero, an owner and broker at Peters & Romero Bienes Raices, an agency in Mexico City, said owners typically will not sell unless they get an offer very close to their asking price. Homes tend to stay on the market around six months, she said.The volatility of the peso, which has lost about 35 percent against the dollar since 2011 and around 16 percent against the dollar since last June, had an effect on the real estate market last year, with lowered rents and more negotiation on sales, Ms. Peters Romero said. But prices are now rising, as they have yearly for the last six years, since she began working in this market, she said.Prices in Polanco are around $5,000 per square meter, or around $465 a square foot, compared with around $4,000 a square meter, or around $372 a square foot, last year, Ms. Peters Romero said. For the most expensive properties in the city, prices can reach $11,000 per square meter, or around $1,023 a square foot.Karen Boda, an owner of URP Properties, a boutique real estate brokerage in Mexico City, estimated that prices have risen at least 10 percent for both residential properties and offices since January.In Polanco, luxury apartments cost $2.5 million to $10 million, she said. In nearby Lomas de Chapultepec, an area with older, traditional homes, the better luxury properties begin at $3 million, she said. People there tend to tear down homes and rebuild. Less expensive luxury homes are available at Bosque de las Lomas, just to the west, where quality homes are available for $800,000 and the top prices run around $3 million.The city\u2019s most expensive homes are priced at $10 million to $15 million, Ms. Boda said. They tend to be in Lomas de Chapultepec in the north and in El Pedregal and Coyoac\u00e1n in the south. Location, finishes, whether or not a property has a garden, and whether or not it\u2019s on a more desirable gated or restricted street affect prices, she added.Ms. Boda also noted two trends. One is that people are increasingly choosing to live near their jobs because of the city\u2019s traffic. Second, because there\u2019s no room to develop in certain desirable neighborhoods, new areas are becoming trendy, including Colonia Roma, west of the city center, and New Polanco, next to Polanco.Transactions can be done in dollars or pesos, but the deed must be recorded in pesos, she added.WHO BUYS IN MEXICO CITYMs. Boda said most buyers of luxury properties are Mexican. Foreigners who move to the city for work tend to stay in rentals. But Ms. Boda has worked with buyers from the United States, France, Italy and Spain.Both in Mexico City and throughout the country, it is becoming more common for people to buy homes as investments or as vacation properties, Ms. Peters Romero said. Usually, those people purchase smaller condos, starting at 150 square meters, or about 1,600 square feet, in high-end areas of the city, she said.BUYING BASICSOnly Mexican citizens can buy land without restriction in Mexico, said Jonathan Pikoff, the founder of Pikoff Attorneys, which specializes in real estate and has offices in Mexico and the United States. If a foreigner buys residential property within 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, from the coastline or 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, from the border, it must be done by using an existing trust through a Mexican bank or creating one, he said.Transactions are handled by notaries. Mr. Pikoff recommended that foreign buyers also hire a lawyer.Closing costs, which are paid exclusively by the seller, include the notary fee, a 16 percent value-added tax on the notary fee, an appraisal, a zoning certificate and a land transfer tax. For a $1 million property, those taxes and fees add up to approximately $57,000.LANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish: Mexican peso (1 peso = $0.054)TAXES AND FEESMonthly maintenance is 21,300 pesos, or about $1,135.

{"Headline": "Gov. Christie\u2019s Toxic School Plan", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byEditorialGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is using the worst kind of demagogy to distract attention from his sagging poll numbers and burnish his reputation as a Trump-style Republican. That\u2019s the only way to view his deeply irresponsible proposal for stripping New Jersey\u2019s poorest communities of desperately needed education aid to fund property tax cuts for well-heeled suburbanites.This toxic plan does nothing less than pit rich against poor, black against white and city dwellers against suburbanites, and it could well poison state politics for years to come, even if Democrats succeed in fending it off.While it sounds reasonable, a flat amount would make it impossible for poor communities to provide a sound education for disadvantaged children who need classrooms with more resources. The state is required by law to send more money to those communities because they simply don\u2019t have the tax base or property values to raise additional revenues on their own.The New Jersey Supreme Court mandated this approach in Abbott v. Burke, a case named for Raymond Abbott, a student in Camden who received no services for a learning disability and was barely literate at the age of 15. The court ruled in 1990, and in many rulings since, that New Jersey was bound by the State Constitution to fund districts at a level that allows all children to receive an education that enables them to participate in the economy and a democratic society.No one in education policy could credibly defend a flat formula, because children in different communities have different needs. The state\u2019s current funding formula, adopted by the Legislature in 2008, begins by determining the cost of educating a typical student, and then adds amounts for educating English language learners, poor children and so on. The 31 New Jersey school districts formerly known as \u201cAbbott Districts\u201d educate nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s students, more than 40 percent of its poor children and 56 percent of its English language learners.Mr. Christie has repeatedly thumbed his nose at equity in public education. He now proposes to get around the court orders by persuading voters to amend the Constitution. Influential Republican lawmakers support this disastrous proposal. But the Democrats who control the Legislature need to make sure it dies a swift death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Abe to Delay Putting Japan\u2019s Sales Tax Increase Into Effect", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan announced on Wednesday that he would delay an unpopular increase in the national sales tax, in what amounted to an acknowledgment that the country\u2019s economy remained worryingly fragile.Mr. Abe\u2019s handling of the economy remains a contentious issue. Despite more than three years of sustained stimulus, the robust increase in wages and prices that he promised has failed to materialize. The governing Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller ally, Komeito, face an election for the upper house of Parliament next month, adding to the pressure.Mr. Abe defended his economic record on Wednesday, saying that although it was still \u201ca work in progress,\u201d certain areas, like the unemployment rate and the frequency of corporate bankruptcies, had improved substantially. He blamed a weaker global economy \u2014 in particular the slowdown in China \u2014 for what he said was a growing threat to Japan.\u201cAt worst, there\u2019s a risk that we could return to the long tunnel of deflation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to take action to guard against risks.\u201dMr. Abe said he would delay the planned increase of two percentage points in the sales tax, known in Japan as a consumption tax, by two and a half more years, to October 2019.Higher taxes have never been a natural fit for Mr. Abe, whose economic agenda has focused more on encouraging growth than fighting deficits. The plan for a higher sales tax was passed into law by a previous government, and the prime minister has struggled with how to put it into effect.Japan\u2019s giant government debt is equal to nearly two and a half years\u2019 worth of the country\u2019s economic output. But Mr. Abe and his supporters say that trying to close deficits by increasing tax rates or cutting government spending risks damaging the economy.The approach Mr. Abe has offered instead, commonly known as Abenomics, has centered on more government spending and, especially, vigorous stimulus by the Bank of Japan.The consumption tax plan that Mr. Abe inherited called for the tax to rise in two stages.The first, which he allowed to go ahead as scheduled in April 2014, brought the tax to 8 percent, from 5 percent. The second increase is supposed to take it to 10 percent. That is still low by the standards of many developed countries, especially in Europe, where value-added taxes are often twice that or higher.Opponents of the increase say Japan would be better off simply borrowing more money from bond markets. Its debt may be large, but it is almost entirely funded by domestic savers, making a crisis like the one in Greece much less likely. And rock-bottom interest rates in Japan mean the government is spending less to service its borrowing than more lightly indebted countries like Germany or the United States are.Mr. Abe said he remained committed to an official goal of closing the government\u2019s spending gap by the end of the decade. If the economy can stay out of recession and the tax increase is not delayed again, the government says, it can balance the budget, minus interest payments on the debt, by 2020. Many private-sector economists doubt that can be done, however.\u201cThe remaining question is how to make Abe\u2019s decision to delay the consumption tax hike consistent with the fiscal consolidation objective,\u201d Masaaki Kanno, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a research note this week.News reports suggest that the tax is widely disliked, and that delaying the increase again could earn votes in the coming election. The Liberal Democrats are already ahead in the polls. Mr. Abe has confirmed that the vote will be held on July 10.When Mr. Abe delayed the tax increase the first time, he pledged to uphold the new timetable unless an economic crisis on the scale of the global financial meltdown in 2008 occurred. He acknowledged on Wednesday that the risks facing Japan today \u201care not at all on that level.\u201d But he appeared to be gambling that tax-averse voters would approve of his decision anyway.\u201cI am prepared for criticism that I broke my promise,\u201d he said. \u201cLetting voters judge is democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a lengthy dissent from the bench, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. criticized his colleagues and defined the university\u2019s practices as \u201caffirmative action gone berserk.\u201dJustice Elena Kagan did not vote in the case after recusing herself because of her previous work on the case.What does the ruling mean?The decision means that the university can still consider factors like race and ethnicity when evaluating other prospective students.What was the case?The case concerned President Obama\u2019s attempt to shield unauthorized immigrants who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents from deportation while providing them with work permits. When Mr. Obama introduced the plan in 2014, he virtually dared the Republican-controlled Congress to fight him on the issue, defending the series of executive actions as being within his authority.A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, disagreed and challenged the plan, arguing that it ignored procedures for rule changes and abused the power of the president\u2019s office. A federal judge shut down the program pending its legal case in early 2015, an action that was later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.What did the Supreme Court decide?What does the stalemate mean?A closer look at those affected by the court\u2019s decision.There are three cases remaining to be decided by the court this month.\u2022 Perhaps the most keenly anticipated is a major abortion case that could affect millions of American women.The case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, challenges a Texas law that imposes severe restrictions on abortion clinics \u2014 requiring, for example, that doctors have admitting privileges at hospitals nearby \u2014 ostensibly to protect women\u2019s health. Critics have argued that the law would force most of the state\u2019s clinics to close.In that case, McDonnell v. United States, the justices seem prepared to side with Mr. McDonnell, who has argued that prosecutors went too far in interpreting routine political favors as corruption, Mr. Liptak reported. Mr. McDonnell faces two years in prison.\u2022 The third decision to come centers on a case involving domestic violence.President Obama said in a news conference Thursday that the court\u2019s action on immigration further set back the United States from being the kind of country that \u201cwe aspire to be.\u201d Mr. Obama said the deadlock was \u201cfrustrating\u201d to those who sought to grow the economy and bring rationality to the immigration system, as well as to those who wished to \u201ccome out of the shadows\u201d and lift this \u201cperpetual cloud on them.\u201dHe called the justices\u2019 inability to come to a decision a \u201cvery clear reminder\u201d of why it was so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench, emphasizing the importance of lawmakers\u2019 acting on his nominee for the open spot, Merrick B. Garland.Mr. Obama said existing immigration programs would continue, adding, \u201cI promise you this: Sooner or later, immigration reform will get done.\u201dMr. Obama also asked whether Americans would continue to tolerate the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of having people \u201cmake our beds\u201d or \u201cpick our fruit\u201d without allowing them to have a chance to \u201cget right with the law,\u201d or whether the country would take actions that would divide families.

This has led to a campaign season driven by fear, resentment and pessimism. And it will lead to worse policy-making down the road, since prosperity means building on things we do well, not obsessing over the things that we\u2019ve lost.The person chiefly responsible for this all-warts view of America is, of course, Donald Trump.Trump has focused his campaign on the struggling white neighborhoods in the industrial Midwest. The prototypical Trump voter is an upscale man from a downscale place.There are two kinds of places that are getting it right. The first we might call Richard Florida cities, after the writer who champions them. These are dense, highly educated, highly communal places with plenty of hipsters. These cities, like Austin, Seattle and San Francisco, have lots of innovation, lots of cultural amenities, but high housing prices and lots of inequality.We should be having a debate between the Kotkin model and the Florida model, between two successful ways to create prosperity, each with strengths and weaknesses. That would be a forward-looking debate between groups who are open, confident and innovative. That would be a debate that, while it might divide by cultural values and aesthetics, wouldn\u2019t divide along ugly racial lines.We should be focusing on the growing, dynamic places and figuring out how to use those models to nurture inclusive opportunity and rejuvenate the places that aren\u2019t.

{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Investors Are Gripped by a Panic Last Seen in 2008", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 First came the shock. Then fear seized world markets. As frenzied selling accelerated in Tokyo, Hong Kong and London, unfathomable amounts of wealth vanished in a matter of hours.As economists pored over the rout like accident investigators dispatched to the scene of a crash, most offered assurances that a Lehman-style financial panic was not unfolding. In that debacle, investors indiscriminately fled all assets connected to the disastrous American housing bubble. Mortgages had been carved into exotic investments and peddled around the globe, meaning they lurked everywhere. Distrust spread like a virus.This time, the source of the trouble is both identifiable and relatively confined. Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union face significant uncertainty in their economic and financial dealings as they embark on complex divorce proceedings.Fears that drawn-out negotiations could disrupt trade prompted investors to push their money toward safety. As night fell in London, the British pound was down more than 7 percent. Stock markets plummeted around the globe; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 3.6 percent in New York. London closed down a similar margin, and Tokyo surrendered more than 4 percent. Investors poured money into government bonds, seeking refuge.\u201cAs of now, this doesn\u2019t look like an end-of-the-world event,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research organization. \u201cIt looks bad, but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic game-changer similar to Lehman.\u201d Then he paused. \u201cYet.\u201dIn the best case, the plunge in markets represents an abrupt adjustment to the changing geography of global commerce. Britain has been diminished as a place for banking and business, and so the pound has lost some luster.In the worst case, investors have begun a fearful march away from risk, potentially starving emerging markets and stripping European countries of needed capital. It could last as long as the uncertainties dogging Europe \u2014 perhaps years.If recent traumas have clarified anything, it is the tendency for trouble to emerge unexpectedly. The global financial system is so intertwined that links can remain opaque.One key factor undergirds confidence that the so-called Brexit will not deliver Lehman-like troubles. In 2008, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic failed to recognize the mounting disaster. They failed to prepare adequate relief. While people may argue over the degree to which regulators have tamed the speculative excesses of finance, few dispute that improvements have been delivered.\u201cThe financial systems in the U.S. and Europe, including the U.K., are far more capitalized and less leveraged than they were in 2008,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThe proclivity to panic in ways that create financial instability are much more limited.\u201dThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank have tools they can wield to defuse threats to banks. They can simply print money and lend it out as needed.Less than an hour after markets opened in London on Friday, Britain\u2019s central bank governor, Mark J. Carney, stood before television cameras and struck a resolute pose as he promised to do what it took to stabilize markets. He announced that he was prepared to unleash another \u00a3250 billion (about $370 billion) in pursuit of financial tranquillity.\u201cWe expect institutions to draw on this funding if and when appropriate,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cThe bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses.\u201dThose words appeared to assuage fears, as the pound and stock prices both pared their losses.In recent years, the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have subjected financial institutions to so-called stress tests. They regularly scrutinize banks\u2019 portfolios and the money they hold in reserve to make sure they can hold up in various outbreaks of trouble.Yet, these are academic exercises.\u201cThis is the real stress test,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.The immediate run on stocks and currencies might yet grow into something worse, shaking consumer confidence and prompting households to limit their spending. As businesses lose profit opportunities, they are likely to put off investing and hiring.If that happens, it could create a spiral ending in recession, both in Britain and across Europe, adding to pressure on banks. The markets seemed to be warning of this possibility as they savaged the value of banking stocks on Friday.The greater the odds that the European Union will splinter, the more investors are likely to demand extra payouts for fresh loans to debt-saturated countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. That could squeeze businesses there, making it harder for them to borrow, further crimping their economies.\u201cThat could then spread to the banks and go global, and that could smell like a Lehman,\u201d said Markus Schomer, chief economist for PineBridge Investments, a global asset management firm. He put very low odds on this \u201creferendum contagion\u201d case.If history is a guide, hedge funds, private equity and other realms of finance will also suffer. There, aggressive players borrow enormous sums of money to place outsize bets. Crises have previously revealed those taking on outsize risk. Long Term Capital Management, which borrowed heavily, appeared robust before losses in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s brought it to the verge of a collapse that threatened the broader financial system and required a private bailout.As the prominent investor Warren E. Buffett once put it, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201dThose who had been paying attention to the American housing crisis were hardly surprised when Lehman\u2019s afflictions burst into public view. Lenders had been writing mortgages to seemingly anyone in possession of a signature. Lehman had been repackaging these loans and selling them for vast profits.The surprise was that Lehman actually went bankrupt, exposing its trading partners to losses. By contrast, polls had suggested that Britain might really walk. This is a source of hope, given that central banks, governments and investors had more time to prepare.\u201cLehman came out of the blue,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThis is like a train wreck where you can see the trains coming together for a long distance and you\u2019re hoping the trains will swerve away.\u201dBut any comfort in that is sapped by the fact that Britain, one of the oldest democracies on earth, put itself in this spot through an exercise of free will. Now, the world waits to see how far the pain spreads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roads to Nowhere and Anywhere, With Kelly Reichardt and Wim Wenders", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOn DVDThe characters in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s movies are often lost in space, their lives on earth notwithstanding. The unmoored loners who populate her movies are isolated even in groups or pairs. It\u2019s an existential condition evident as early as her first feature, \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d (1994), restored and out on disc from Oscilloscope.While all of Ms. Reichardt\u2019s features through \u201cNight Moves\u201d could be named after the Talking Heads song \u201cRoad to Nowhere,\u201d \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d is the most provocatively negative of the lot. It\u2019s an action movie about things that don\u2019t really happen, centered on a character, a lonely Florida stay-at-home mom, Cozy (Lisa Bowman), who leaves everything behind and winds up in the same place. In one of the movie\u2019s understated jokes, a purloined police revolver that motivates the plot is randomly returned to the exact spot where it was first found.When \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d was shown at Sundance in 1994, Ms. Reichardt and her associates described it as \u201ca love story without the love, a murder mystery without the murder, a road movie that never gets on the road.\u201d Back then, \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d was overshadowed by the festival\u2019s two great crowd-pleasers, Rose Troche\u2019s lesbian romance \u201cGo Fish\u201d and Kevin Smith\u2019s slacker comedy \u201cClerks.\u201d Today those films feel dated, while \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d seems a small classic.Drifting out of her domestic routine, Cozy meets Lee in a low-rent cocktail lounge and accepts his invitation to go pool hopping. A befuddled homeowner appears; the gun goes off. Panicked, the newly established outlaw couple take it on the lam, holing up in a ratty motel until their money runs out and they are reduced to sleeping in their car.That\u2019s pretty much that. Excitement is generated by Ms. Reichardt\u2019s comic lack of affect as well as her feel for landscape and underlying formalism. The compositions are deliberate and often symmetrical; camera movement is minimal.\u201cRiver of Grass\u201d has a deadpan quality suggestive of Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise\u201d (1984) \u2014 which also featured Florida locations. But where Mr. Jarmusch is a connoisseur of bleakness, Ms. Reichardt makes her artfully banal terrain of laundromats, convenience stores and cloverleaf highways seem brain-numbingly oppressive.Whether she loved or loathed her native territory, Ms. Reichardt never again used Florida as a location. Regional with a vengeance, \u201cRiver of Grass\u201d is both an introduction and a kiss-off.Mr. Wenders has made substantial films since then, but these three low-budget movies \u2014 produced in rapid succession before he turned 31 \u2014 would confirm his reputation as a major European filmmaker. All three are characterized by a mood of free-floating homesickness, as well as the interplay of German anomie and American popular culture; all of them star the craggy, bemused R\u00fcdiger Vogler, feature Mr. Wenders\u2019s wife at the time, Lisa Kreuzer (sometimes billed as Elisabeth Kreuzer), and show a remarkable eye for landscape.The beginning of \u201cAlice in the Cities,\u201d shot partly in the United States, suggests a homage to the photographer Robert Frank\u2019s collection \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Mr. Vogler plays a West German journalist navigating a world of gas stations, roadside snack bars and seedy motel rooms before returning to an even less welcoming Germany in the company of a 9-year-old girl left behind in America by her mother (Ms. Kreuzer). In \u201cWrong Move,\u201d an updated version of Goethe\u2019s \u201cWilhelm Meister\u2019s Apprenticeship\u201d written by Peter Handke, Mr. Vogler plays a petulant would-be poet whose search for a utopian unity of poetry and politics telescopes, even as it satirizes, two centuries of German Romanticism.\u201cKings of the Road,\u201d which runs nearly three hours, depicts an empty, imprisoning West Germany. The land seems as vast and sparsely populated as North Dakota, and the movie, which Mr. Wenders originally wanted to title \u201cAs Time Goes By,\u201d is a sort of western. Here Mr. Vogler plays an itinerant mechanic, traveling from town to town repairing movie projectors \u2014 a conceit that allows the film to mourn the end of movies as a mass medium while dramatizing one character\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe Yanks colonized our subconscious.\u201d It is Mr. Wenders\u2019s definitive statement and arguably his masterpiece.The Criterion set comes with a handsome booklet; extras include interviews, outtakes and, most interesting, two of Mr. Wenders\u2019s student films, \u201cSame Player Shoots Again\u201d (1967) and \u201cSilver City Revisited\u201d (1968).NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Illicit Perks of the M.D. Club", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byOpinionONE of my patients recently had her request for a relatively common medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Vyvanse, denied by her insurance provider. I tried to appeal the decision, but her father \u2014 the chief executive of a health care company who purchased insurance for hundreds of employees \u2014 had better luck. He called up the head of the insurance company and got the drug approved.Last year, my 5-year-old fractured her ankle. The bill for the 12-minute orthopedist\u2019s appointment was $1,125, and about half of it was covered by insurance. I wrote the doctor a letter \u2014 please revise this bill, as it is clearly erroneous \u2014 and included my \u201cM.D.\u201d Instead, the doctor left me a message saying he was waiving the bill entirely as a professional courtesy.Stories like these reveal an uncomfortable truth. Our health insurance system is so broken that pulling strings \u2014 or rank \u2014 is sometimes the only way to get the coverage you think you\u2019ve paid for.Since 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, the major insurance companies have seen their stock prices soar. Though the act expanded coverage to millions, a report last year by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation revealed that 41 percent of health plans sold on the government exchanges had physician networks described as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cextra-small,\u201d covering less than 25 percent and 10 percent of local doctors, respectively. Individuals may have to change doctors or choose out-of-network services, incurring extra costs.Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive turned whistle-blower and a co-author of the recent book \u201cNation on the Take,\u201d says that \u201cinsurance companies profit by introducing hurdles in the coverage and claims process.\u201d These hurdles lead some patients to simply give up and pay or forego treatment altogether. He calls this the companies\u2019 business model.This strategy has given rise to a new business. After his son was born with cerebral palsy, Scott Leshin, then an associate at Goldman Sachs, made it his business to read the fine print of his health insurance policy so that he could fight for the services his son needed.His son started walking only this year, at age 10. And yet, \u201cI still have to prove to UnitedHealthcare that he has C.P. every six months,\u201d Mr. Leshin told me. His success in getting services covered led him to found his business, SJ Health Insurance Advocates, which now has a staff of 19. He works on a contingency basis \u2014 his customers pay only when his team succeeds.But the best way to advocate for yourself is simply to be a doctor. When my son was born eight years ago, a series of errors left my wife unmedicated for 18 hours following a C-section. Furious, I fastened my medical school faculty badge to my collar, hoping to send the message: I\u2019m watching you. We got an apology and a private room.These workarounds are necessary because the health care system doesn\u2019t follow any rational rules of economics, where the customer should be king.Economies of scale are supposed to bring costs down. But in health care, large hospitals are often more expensive than smaller ones because they can demand higher payments from insurance companies, which are then passed down to patients.In most realms, those with the least ability to pay should receive the biggest discounts. In health care, it is often the uninsured and indigent who receive bills with the full \u201cchargemaster\u201d fee \u2014 the wildly inflated prices that nobody really pays \u2014 while large insurance companies get the biggest breaks.And why is it that I can shop for a mechanic in minutes from my phone but doctors\u2019 fees are a mystery? In a battle of dueling bureaucracies, the Supreme Court recently dealt a blow to price transparency in Vermont, where the state wished to publish a database of fees and other information. An insurance company, Liberty Mutual, objected to turning over the data on what it paid doctors and hospitals, and the Supreme Court agreed. The justices argued that, according to the A.C.A., only the Department of Labor, and not individual states, had the right to collect this data. The ruling affects almost a dozen states that are pursuing similar initiatives.Finally, our insurance system drives up costs for everyone. Between 1998 and 2015, the cost of cosmetic surgery for top procedures, which is paid by the consumer and not covered by insurance, rose at about half the rate of inflation, while overall health care rose at around double the rate of inflation \u2014 more than a threefold difference.It\u2019s no surprise that people with connections, like the chief executive, resort to any means they can to navigate this system. It\u2019s more worrisome when doctors do the same. As a medical student I would never have dreamed of accepting special favors just because I was part of the exclusive M.D. club. When I was living in New York City, friends encouraged me to obtain the prestigious \u201cM.D.\u201d license plates, which came with special parking privileges \u2014 quite a perk in Manhattan. But I was never on call at a hospital that required expedient parking, so I didn\u2019t get the plates. This didn\u2019t stop many others, however.Nepotism occurs in many fields; friends and family of New York City police officers often carry Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association cards, which may confer special treatment in a traffic stop. It\u2019s human nature for a group to look out for its own (especially groups like physicians that originally consisted only of white men). Bonds forged in sleep-deprived situations involving life and death create a special kinship. Physicians originally provided free care to their own to keep doctors from trying to treat themselves, but the tradition is also an acknowledgment of mutual respect.But when everyone is feeling the pain of decreased access and increased costs, physicians currying favors will only foster resentment. Shouldn\u2019t we be advocating for reform, rather than finding our own shortcuts?Talk is cheap. Last year, another instance of M.D. favoritism was presented to me in a time of need, and I grabbed it without flinching.I had a herniated lumbar disk, and was in pain for weeks on end. Finally, my orthopedist suggested an M.R.I. The day before the study, the radiology office said that my insurer, Aetna, had denied the test and I would have to pay $1,000. In pain, I told them that I would keep my appointment. The next morning, I called Aetna.I was patched through to a third party, Evicore, which evaluates requests for imaging. (This company is basically one of the hurdles described by Mr. Potter, intended to reduce costs for the insurer.) I was told the test had been denied because I had not yet had six weeks of unrelenting symptoms. This was not true \u2014 I had been counting the days, and it had been six and a half long weeks.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but the only way to reverse the denial is for your doctor to call our doctor.\u201d Indignant, I declared myself a physician and said that my pain was interfering with my ability to see patients.The representative asked what type of physician I was.\u201cA psychiatrist,\u201d I replied.Was I licensed?\u201cIn two states.\u201dThe call was scheduled with a radiologist, whose number came up with a Nashville area code. The icebreaker was easy: I trained at Vanderbilt, I told him. \u201cHow\u2019s Nashville these days? Isn\u2019t real estate booming?\u201dThen he got down to business: \u201cO.K., tell me about this patient. I mean, about you \u2026\u201d I went through my clinical history. Less than three minutes later, he approved my M.R.I.Was this wrong? I told myself I was using my status to fight a small injustice, not to get special treatment \u2014 though in our faulty system the two are often inseparable.Aetna, however, got the last laugh. The $1,000 M.R.I. was discounted to $525, which was within my \u201cimaging\u201d deductible, making my Gold plan feel more like a Bronze.Welcome to American health care, I thought. I\u2019d succeeded in persuading my insurance company to cover the procedure \u2014 but I still had to pay for it.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump has long vowed to compete in traditionally Democratic-leaning Midwestern states, viewing the Rust Belt as the cornerstone of his electoral map.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s dismal standing with Latino voters, his prospects look tenuous in traditional swing states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada. That means his most realistic path to victory runs not only through Ohio, a perennial battleground, but also through states like Michigan and Pennsylvania that have not voted Republican in a generation. If Mrs. Clinton can fortify her support in these areas, Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral map may disintegrate.During the Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton spoke often about economic fairness and tried to reassure liberal voters anxious about rising inequality. She now has an opening to communicate in more concrete terms how she would bring about broad prosperity \u2014 and to attack some of Mr. Trump\u2019s more controversial proposals, like his offhand suggestion that the United States print more money to pay its debts.The hope among Clinton allies is that she can bring reticent liberals on board with a sharp message of contrast with Mr. Trump, rather than an explicit campaign to placate the pro-Sanders left. Sanders supporters, however, say they hope to hear new talk from Mrs. Clinton about the issues at the core of his campaign, like raising the minimum wage and ridding the political system of big money.Advertisement"}

McCaw, the director of the government affairs department at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.Muslims make up about 1 percent of the United States population. A study conducted by the Institute for Social and Policy Understanding, a nonpartisan think tank, found that only 60 percent of citizens who are Muslim were registered voters, compared with at least 86 percent of Jews, Protestants and Roman Catholics.\u201cA lot of Muslims didn\u2019t participate in elections because they didn\u2019t see a lot of difference between the parties,\u201d said Emir Sundiata Alrashid of the Lighthouse Mosque in Oakland, where a voter-registration drive was held last month. The mosque sits in a residential neighborhood near a freeway overpass.About a dozen mosques serve Oakland\u2019s diverse population. On the streets near the larger mosques and Islamic centers, women in hijabs and burqas duck into shops for halal meats, dates and honey.Rodolfo de La Garza, a professor of public policy at Columbia University who studies minority voting and election participation, said he believed Muslim voter registration efforts would be easier than those in African-American and Latino communities, where residents were long disenfranchised.\u201cIf you think the state is always against you, why would you engage it?\u201d he said. \u201cOnly recently have Muslims not trusted the state. It should be a lot easier to get them to register to vote.\u201dRepresentative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota and one of two Muslims in the House of Representatives, said he had seen anti-Muslim speech \u201cevery election cycle.\u201dBut this year, the bigotry has reached a new level, he said.\u201cThe average Muslim is a little desensitized to politicians\u2019 making negative comments about us,\u201d said Corey Saylor, the director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThis time it\u2019s so pervasive and mainstream and, frankly, threatening that a lot of people feel the need to do whatever they can.\u201dJehan Hakim, California president of the American Association of Yemeni Students and Professionals, said, \u201cSo many family and community members are really, really scared.\u201d Ms. Hakim, who organized mosque voter registration drives in Oakland, said her four children wanted to move to Canada. Along with signing up new voters, Ms. Hakim also participates in \u201cMeet a Muslim,\u201d a Bay Area gathering for non-Muslims to learn about their neighbors.The change in tone has been gradual. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, \u201cthe conversation in the mainstream media was that American Muslims are part of America \u2014 we\u2019re in this trouble together,\u201d said Mr. Baig of the Islamic Circle of North America.But after the San Bernardino shootings, Mr. Trump called for closing mosques and barring Muslims. (He recently amended his statement, saying it was \u201cjust a suggestion.\u201d)\u201cPeople coming to his rallies are cheering what he says,\u201d Mr. Baig said. \u201cWe are beyond a state of shock.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.Emir Alrashid of the Lighthouse Mosque said he saw parallels with a once-targeted group. \u201cWe\u2019re going through the same struggles the Japanese did about their loyalty to the country after Pearl Harbor,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because you share an ethnic group or religion, you shouldn\u2019t have to pass a loyalty oath to be considered a loyal American.\u201dThe Lighthouse Mosque draws followers who are African-American, South Asian, Yemeni and Caucasian.In interviews, many Muslims volunteered that they felt as if they were an \u201cother\u201d in their own country. \u201cPeople might be born in America, but they feel like a lot of times they\u2019re looked at like \u2018other,\u2019 \u201d Emir Alrashid said, adding that he sometimes felt that way, too. He was born in the United States and served six years in the Marine Corps.\u201cPeople see a Muslim sister at a grocery store, and they don\u2019t think she\u2019s an American citizen. They automatically seem to think she\u2019s \u2018one of those Muslims,\u2019 even here in the Bay Area,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only imagine how it is in Utah or Mississippi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Okinawa Murder Case Heightens Outcry Over U.S. Military\u2019s Presence", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byOKINAWA, Japan \u2014 Memorial Day weekend is normally party time on Gate Street, a seedy strip of bars and clubs outside a giant United States Air Force base here.During this year\u2019s holiday, though, Gate Street was all but deserted, its customers \u2014 young Americans from the military installations that blanket much of this southern Japanese island \u2014 barred by their superiors from partying in public.The reason: a recent murder that has angered Okinawans and damaged relations between Tokyo and Washington.The unusual rebuke over a criminal case by another head of state marred a visit that was otherwise carefully choreographed to celebrate friendly relations and included Mr. Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima. Mr. Abe, at a joint news conference, professed \u201cshock\u201d over the murder and asked Mr. Obama \u201cto understand the feelings of the Japanese people\u201d and strengthen military discipline.Mr. Shinzato has not yet been formally charged, a decision that can take weeks in Japan. His lawyer has declined to comment.Okinawans have complained for years about violence, noise and other problems associated with American bases. But this murder case is threatening to ratchet up opposition to the United States\u2019 large military presence, which dates to the end of World War II.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard apologies and promises of prevention hundreds of times, for decades, but it hasn\u2019t had any effect,\u201d said Okinawa\u2019s governor, Takeshi Onaga. Okinawans still bitterly remember a 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl involving two Marines and a Navy sailor, which led to protests, as well as more recent episodes.Mr. Onaga was once the leader of the local chapter of Mr. Abe\u2019s right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, but he has broken with the prime minister over the issue of America\u2019s military footprint, which he wants greatly reduced. Half of the 50,000 American military personnel in Japan are stationed here, and United States facilities take up one-fifth of Okinawan land.Anger is increasingly reflected in the politics of Okinawa, where local elections are being held on Sunday. Late last month, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly passed a resolution demanding that all United States Marines be removed from the island, its strongest censure of the American military to date. Local elections are being held on Sunday.The spot where the woman\u2019s body was found, in woods beside a golf course, has been covered with hundreds of offerings of flowers, food and drink.The furor is erupting at a sensitive time for Okinawa, and for Japan, and the growing wealth and power of China has sharpened the debate about the island\u2019s future.Mr. Abe is seeking to reinforce its position as a military outpost by building a new but widely contested base for the Marines and expanding Japan\u2019s own military assets. Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces began operating a sophisticated new radar station this year on the tiny island of Yonaguni, part of Okinawa Prefecture, to monitor Chinese naval activity in the East China Sea.But at the same time, Asia\u2019s new prosperity is opening up other possibilities.These were on display 40 minutes south of Gate Street in Naha, Okinawa\u2019s capital, where tourists from Taiwan, China and South Korea thronged the city\u2019s shopping streets and hotels. Foreign tourism was up 70 percent last year. Airlines are adding new international flights to the semitropical island, while more Asian cruise lines are docking at Naha\u2019s port.\u201cOkinawa used to be an object of pity in Japan, but now it\u2019s a brand,\u201d said Hiroshi Meguro, a former research fellow at the Institute of Okinawan Studies at Hosei University in Tokyo.The bases never made Okinawans rich: The prefecture has the lowest per-capita income in Japan, one-third below the national average. Now, dependence on them is in decline, Mr. Meguro said, and with it Okinawans\u2019 tolerance for the problems they bring.Some in Okinawa would like to follow the example of the Philippines, which pushed out the American military in the early 1990s and redeveloped a major Navy base, at Subic Bay, into a lucrative resort destination.\u201cWhen it comes to the economy and tourism, it\u2019s \u2018Welcome, China,\u2019\u201d Mr. Meguro said. \u201cOf course, it glosses over the fact that the Philippines has started to invite American forces back because it\u2019s being menaced by China.\u201dHiroji Yamashiro, a retired local civil servant, said that he wanted Okinawa to become a tourist center, but that the bases stood in the way. He spends most days protesting outside the gates of Camp Schwab, a Marine armory and firing range in the north that the Japanese and American governments want to radically expand by filling in a bay and building a pair of aircraft runways.The plan illustrates the complexities facing Japanese and American policy makers. The expanded base is intended to replace another facility to the south, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which sits in the middle of a crowded city and has been the object of some of the most vigorous complaints by Okinawans. A Marine helicopter crashed just outside its walls in 2004, damaging a university.Tokyo and Washington agreed two decades ago to shift much of Futenma\u2019s equipment and personnel to Schwab. But local opposition has blocked the move, and work on the project was frozen before it really began.On a boat ride around the bay, Mr. Yamashiro pointed to nearly uninterrupted beaches surrounding Camp Schwab. A couple of young men with military haircuts and snorkels had a small island inside its perimeter to themselves. Mr. Yamashiro said they should be replaced by far larger numbers of Chinese and Taiwanese tourists.\u201cThe future is opening up in front of us, but the Japanese government is blocking it,\u201d Mr. Yamashiro said.Successive Japanese and American governments have struggled to find a satisfactory solution to the Futenma issue. Deadlines to start construction at Schwab have come and gone, holding up a broader reorganization of United States forces in Japan that would move some troops off Okinawa to Guam. But critics of the long-stalled plan, including Mr. Onaga, the governor, are holding out for a more drastic drawdown.\u201cOkinawa is isolated, physically and in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Susumu Inamine, the mayor of Nago, where Camp Schwab is situated.He does not want the base expanded, and has rebuffed offers of subsidies from the government in Tokyo that are contingent on his accepting the plan. \u201cFor the government, it\u2019s a faraway place where what happens doesn\u2019t impose any pain on the mainland,\u201d he said.The local authorities have little say over base policy. But they can hold up projects with tactics like withholding construction permits. The prefectural government recently fought Tokyo to a standstill in court over the expansion plan. A judge persuaded both sides to return to the negotiating table in March, but neither has shown signs of retreating.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep delaying until 2020, then 2030,\u201d Mr. Inamine said. \u201cThe question is, can the U.S. wait that long before looking for another option?\u201dMany Americans in Okinawa feel the military has been unfairly demonized. They point to crime statistics that show United States personnel are arrested at lower rates than locals. Still, some sympathize with Okinawans\u2019 sense that the United States occupation of their island, which formally concluded in 1972, has never truly ended.Part of the problem is that the American military\u2019s presence extends across the whole island, said a retired member of the Air Force who has lived in Japan for three decades and was stationed at various bases across Japan. Today, he manages several businesses in Okinawa, including one that does contract work for the military, and like other Americans with base connections, he requested anonymity to speak.Michio Sakima, the owner of the Sakima Art Museum next to the Futenma base, said Okinawans\u2019 anger over the recent killing reflected pent-up political frustration as much as the brutal nature of the crime.His museum shares a fence with the base, and Futenma\u2019s closing would relieve Mr. Sakima of the noise of jets and helicopters. But he opposes moving the Marines to Camp Schwab, he said, on the grounds that it would entrench the military presence on the island.\u201cWe are still a colony,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a serious crime happens, that\u2019s when our real feelings come out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It O.K. to Take a Gender-Non-Conforming Child to North Carolina?", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe EthicistFor the past 10 years, my husband\u2019s family has convened for an annual summer reunion at a beach house in North Carolina. It\u2019s great fun for the many young cousins who attend, and our two children spend the year looking forward to it.Our 6-year-old child, J.G., is gender-nonconforming. We had been in denial about this fact until several months ago, when J.G. articulated to us how scary and demeaning this felt. We are now out in the open about our child\u2019s gender nonconformity, and J.G. has blossomed from a moody, secretive child into a rambunctious and irrepressible little soul. We live in a liberal area in a liberal state, and J.G. has been accepted with love and generosity in our community. My husband\u2019s large Southern family has also surprised us in recent months with their unconditional love and acceptance.What you need to get across \u2014 and you may have had to do this already \u2014 is that, just as you once failed to understand who J.G. was, new people may also not be fully accepting. But you\u2019ll be at a beach house, surrounded by supportive family and friends. According to recent surveys, a large percentage of people in North Carolina oppose HB2. In fact, because of the news coverage of the law and the moving resistance to it by so many people in the state, you may encounter more expressions of support than you\u2019d expect. Your husband\u2019s large Southern family could be more representative of the region than the state politicians who voted for the bill.My 5-month-old\u2019s caretaker lives 40 minutes away by train. She commutes daily. We loved her when we met her, but we expressed our concern over her commute. We were not expecting to pay for travel time and were ready to hire a local caretaker. She explained that she wasn\u2019t looking to be paid for her travel time. Her previous job in the city hadn\u2019t, either.We recently asked her to stay late on Friday after working the full day. We paid her overtime after 4 p.m., plus $50 for staying the night, to spare her a late commute. I took my son into our room as soon as we got home, and she was off the clock. It was our first night out since he was born, and the peace of mind was worth the expenditure. But, looking forward, we would like to hire a local sitter who won\u2019t need overtime or to spend the night. The expense is just too great for us. When I explained this to her, she offered to work the job anyway and not be paid overtime. But I\u2019m not an economist. I\u2019m a moral philosopher. And there\u2019s more going on here than economic arrangements. You and your infant son have a relationship with this woman. It isn\u2019t an arm\u2019s-length transaction, governed by self-interest alone. As it happens, Adam Smith, one of the first great modern economists, was also a great moral philosopher. He wrote \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d in which he explained economic transactions as fundamentally governed by self-interest, and \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments,\u201d which explored the role of sympathy in our dealings with others. So let\u2019s enlist both sides of Smith. One question sympathy might lead you to ask is why she\u2019s willing to accept a job with no overtime. The answer, I suspect, is that you and she are operating in an economy in which people doing the kind of domestic work she does often don\u2019t get overtime, even when they\u2019re entitled to it. And you have to decide whether the circumstances of her choice are just.If the background conditions in a labor market are seriously unjust \u2014 as they are in much of the world \u2014 people\u2019s willingness to work for a particular wage isn\u2019t enough to make that wage fair. We exploit people when we take advantage of their vulnerabilities. That\u2019s why many think that American companies can\u2019t defend the wages they pay in Bangladesh by saying that the workers there are willing to accept them. You\u2019re concerned that you\u2019d be taking advantage of her by accepting the terms she\u2019s offering, and there\u2019s good reason for that.Adam Smith lectured on legal theory as well. So he would have pointed out that you also have legal constraints here. Because people in her situation tend to be in a weak bargaining position, federal and a few state statutes create widely applicable overtime provisions. But the costs of commuting are generally covered by the employee, and the time spent doing it is not paid time. From that point of view, if she stays overnight on Friday and is not working, you are, in effect, allowing her to avoid the cost and the inconvenience of a long commute late Friday, followed by an early commute back, if she\u2019s to work on Saturday morning. Giving up the discretionary payment of $50 would seem reasonable on her part, in view of the elements of convenience to her.There\u2019s one more factor that\u2019s ethically relevant. Simply ignoring her own judgments about what options are best for her would be less than respectful. It seems to me that you can discuss all this with her and come to a judgment together about what terms you both think are fair. That might still be somewhat more than what you would pay to a new caretaker, because you recognize, out of sympathy, the burden of her long commute; and because there\u2019s a final argument of self-interest here: You know this woman and you trust her alone in your house with your son. That peace of mind has a value, too.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Are Financial Markets Too Complacent About the Global Economy?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThe latest polling suggests the British are inclined to drop out of the European Union, throwing the future of the world\u2019s largest trading bloc into doubt.The United States in November may elect a president who promises to abandon many norms of governance, and a horrendous terrorist attack has opened up new talk in the presidential race of upending the nation\u2019s longstanding economic and diplomatic relationships with the rest of the world.Oh, and last month the United States experienced its weakest job growth in six years.If there was a good time for financial markets to show signs of fear for global economic and political stability, this would seem to be it.In the last several days there has been some evidence, if you look carefully enough, of the risk that some big, disruptive events will become priced into markets. The British pound has fallen steeply on currency markets, reflecting the risk of \u201cBrexit,\u201d and government bond prices in advanced nations have soared (and their yields have fallen) as investors have plowed money into safe assets.But many other financial market conditions are more consistent with what you expect to see when everything is basically going fine \u2014 not indicative of a major risk of financial, economic or geopolitical upheaval.The American stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, is hovering just below record highs. A measure of expected market volatility, the Vix, has spiked in the last few days but remains well below its level of just a few months ago. Oil prices have been rising steadily since February and haven\u2019t moved much in the last week, let alone shown the drop you might expect if a collapse in global demand seemed imminent.There are two possibilities of what is going on. At best, the markets are telling us something important that excitable journalists and pundits aren\u2019t. Call this the markets-are-smart theory.At worst, markets are complacent, and deep-seated flaws in how financial markets work mean that current stock and commodity prices aren\u2019t reflecting the major risks that lie ahead.And even if any of those forecasts turns out to be wrong, the consequences for the economy and corporate profits won\u2019t be as severe as fearful headlines suggest. The British economy will remain basically sound as the nation renegotiates its trade relationships; Mr. Trump will govern more like a conventional president than his words now suggest; and any economic slump in the United States will be short and mild.In this story, stock, bond and currency traders have the wisdom to look past the noise that the aforementioned excitable journalists and pundits don\u2019t.The other argument is scarier.Markets are very good at incorporating news into asset prices when it\u2019s clear and straightforward how one should affect the other. When a company releases an earnings report, analysts can quickly figure out what it should mean for the stock price, and the stock moves accordingly. When data comes out that makes a Federal Reserve rate increase 10 percent more likely, it\u2019s fairly straightforward to translate that into the proper pricing of Treasury bonds and the dollar. A disruption to an oil pipeline has a relatively clear-cut impact on the price of crude.So traders are efficient at pricing in pieces of news that affect asset prices in predictable ways over the short and medium term. They\u2019re a lot worse at predicting which major threats to the global economy will spiral out of control and which will turn out to hardly matter.Consider two examples from recent years.In the summer and fall of 2011, investors were panicked that the eurozone would unravel because of the fiscal crisis that started in Greece. Global stock markets, commodities and risky forms of debt plummeted; volatility skyrocketed.But things turned out to be more or less fine. More aggressive action by the European Central Bank and European political leaders starting late that year helped calm everyone. And while the European economy is not in great shape, the Continent experienced no epic financial crisis. If you had the nerve to buy eurozone stocks in September 2011, you have enjoyed a 51 percent return on your money.Other times, instead of being too fearful of cataclysmic events, financial markets are too complacent. What we now call the global financial crisis got its start in mid-2007, as losses on mortgage-related securities mounted and global money markets froze up.But after some initial efforts by the Federal Reserve and other government officials to contain the damage, financial markets rallied 11 percent from mid-August through mid-October, pushing the stock market to new highs and suggesting all was well. Of course, as it turned out, a severe recession and catastrophic financial crisis were just around the corner. People who bought into any risky assets, whether stocks or mortgage-backed securities, at the October highs lost their shirts.Even if that\u2019s so, the next few months will be a great test of just how much markets really know about the future. And given the precarious headlines of the last few months, anyone who wants to make sure they don\u2019t lose their shirts again should hope that they\u2019ve got it right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Compete Better, States Are Trying to Curb Noncompete Pacts", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byIn today\u2019s on-your-own economy, workers are urged to be entrepreneurial job hoppers, constantly adapting and searching for the next opportunity.But an estimated 30 million Americans \u2014 nearly one fifth of the nation\u2019s work force \u2014 are hobbled by so-called noncompete agreements, fine print in their employment contracts that keeps them from working for corporate rivals in their next job.Now a number of states are looking to untangle workers from these agreements. The Massachusetts House of Representatives is scheduled to vote this week on a noncompete reform bill. The state is also the location of a union organizing campaign on the noncompete practices of the EMC Corporation, a large technology company based in Hopkinton, Mass., that is known for its aggressive application of these employment contracts.Other states are also taking steps as noncompete agreements have spread to summer interns and sandwich shop employees. Hawaii banned noncompete agreements for technology jobs last year, while New Mexico passed a law prohibiting noncompetes for health care workers. And Oregon and Utah have limited the duration of noncompete arrangements.The issue hits Massachusetts with particular force because of its technology heritage and failure to keep up with Silicon Valley. In the early 1980s, the Route 128 corridor outside Boston, birthplace of the minicomputer industry and long-gone tech giants like the Digital Equipment Corporation, was seen as the Silicon Valley of the East.Noncompete pacts were only one ingredient in the recipe that worked against Massachusetts and to the advantage of Silicon Valley, where employees can depart and start their own companies mostly without fear of a lawsuit. But they mattered. In California, companies are generally prohibited from enforcing noncompete agreements because of a worker-friendly statute from the 19th century.\u201cIt\u2019s hurt our economy in the past, and it\u2019s a statement of values about entrepreneurship and mobility that Massachusetts has noncompetes and California does not,\u201d said Stephen Kraus, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and president of the New England Venture Capital Association.Noncompete arrangements, proponents say, can protect valuable trade secrets and motivate employers to invest in worker training because employees are less likely to leave.But recent research underlines the effects of noncompete agreements on engineers and scientists in technology businesses, where more than one-third of the employees are covered by them. Technical workers in Massachusetts would be paid about 7 percent more if the state\u2019s noncompete practices mirrored California\u2019s, said Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the lawsuit, but about the far larger chilling effect,\u201d said Matthew Marx, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.In 2008, Brian Connolly, an engineer with years of experience writing software for medical devices, joined a start-up developing diagnostic technology to identify biohazards, First Light Biosciences. After the financial crisis hit, the start-up laid off 12 of its 14 employees, including Mr. Connolly.Shortly after meeting with a new company, Mr. Connolly got a call from his previous employer, telling him the noncompete prohibited him from joining any company in diagnostic devices, even if the application and the technology were different.\u201cI understood noncompetes were common practice, but I didn\u2019t think they would enforce it, and that broadly, after a layoff,\u201d he said.While the one-year noncompete was in force, Mr. Connolly worked for a consultant, doing software quality testing.Today, two jobs later, Mr. Connolly says he is finally getting back to his previous income level. He signed a noncompete with his current employer, and he understands they have their uses. But he says he thinks they should give workers more freedom and companies less control.\u201cThey should allow the engineer or scientist to stay current in the field,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. \u201cThat\u2019s so important in technology.\u201dKevin Johnson holds a graduate degree in engineering and a Harvard M.B.A. He is veteran of big tech companies and start-ups, and he\u2019s an ardent opponent of noncompete contracts.He spotted an opportunity to go after the noncompetes at EMC, an aggressive practitioner, because it is being acquired by another old-line computer company, Dell. The buyout, Mr. Johnson said, promises to create turmoil and cuts in the work force.The goal, Mr. Johnson said, is to create a \u201cpop-up union\u201d that would force EMC to abandon the use of most noncompete pacts.In a statement, Paul Dacier, EMC\u2019s general counsel, said, \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, EMC has not been contacted by anyone representing this group.\u201dMr. Johnson said he sent an email to an EMC executive and to a lawyer representing Denali Holding, Dell\u2019s parent company, both in mid-May, informing them of the organizing effort.In Massachusetts, noncompete reform bills were introduced as far back as 2009. But previous legislative efforts stalled in the face of strong opposition from EMC and other companies in the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group.This time, a bill has emerged from a House committee, and the Massachusetts speaker, Robert A. DeLeo, has pledged to bring reform legislation to a vote soon.Lori A. Ehrlich, a Massachusetts representative who has sought to curb noncompete agreements, said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to balance a situation where workers have so much less power than the corporations that employ them.\u201dIf a bill passes the House, approval in the State Senate is likely. Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, is taking a wait-and-see stance.This year, EMC and the trade group have said they are willing to compromise. To a point.The House bill, as it emerged from the legislative committee, would require companies to explain noncompete agreements clearly and limit them to one year. It would also prohibit noncompetes for certain categories of employees like hourly workers, summer interns and college students. And it would require companies to pay former employees 50 percent of their salary during the period of the noncompete contract. If both sides agree, they could negotiate higher or lower rates.Christopher P. Geehern, an executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said his group would support legislation but only if the compensation provision was removed.But the compensation requirement, proponents say, is what gives companies a market incentive to prune their noncompete practices. It was one of the principal recommendations in the Treasury Department report this year.The compensation requirement is the linchpin in the legislation for the EMC union organizing campaign and for venture capitalists.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial because it will stop most noncompetes from being enforced,\u201d said Rich Miner, a general partner for Google Ventures in Cambridge, Mass.Advertisement"}

Their offerings attracted 4.5 million people, a third of whom attended free events. And those ticket buyers from outside the city who said in surveys that visiting Lincoln Center was a \u201cvery important reason\u201d for their trips spent an estimated $669 million elsewhere in New York.Those were among the findings of a report that Lincoln Center released on Monday outlining its economic contributions to New York City as a cultural complex, major employer and tourist attraction. The report was shared with city officials as Lincoln Center prepared to seek some city funding for its coming renovation of David Geffen Hall, home of the New York Philharmonic, which is expected to cost about a half-billion dollars.Some findings, based on extensive surveys, may interest anyone who has ever stood at the fountain trying to figure out where everyone else was from: City residents bought 51 percent of tickets; people from the metropolitan area bought 24 percent; visitors from elsewhere in the United States purchased 16 percent; and tourists from abroad, 9 percent.The report also has policy ramifications. The de Blasio administration\u2019s support for smaller cultural institutions in all five boroughs, and its emphasis on making art accessible to all, have been eyed warily by some larger Manhattan institutions, including those, like Lincoln Center, that receive some city support. So the new report noted that 1.48 million people came to free events there last year and that 1,500 school and other groups attended offerings.The report got a warm reception from city officials, some of whom will be part of the discussion of the extent to which taxpayers should help revamp Geffen Hall. Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said in a statement that Lincoln Center \u201cboosts tourism, helps define the city\u2019s cultural life and inspires our young people.\u201dCity Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens Democrat who is chairman of the council\u2019s committee on cultural affairs, said in an interview that he was impressed by the report\u2019s findings. \u201cI am a firm believer that we have to invest in all of our cultural institutions and organizations, large and small, in all five boroughs, in every neighborhood,\u201d he said.\u201cIf an organization is driving so much in terms of what is good about the City of New York, is actively engaged in the work of making this city all that it can be, and is equally committed to making sure that every child in every neighborhood has access to world-class performances and facilities, then that organization is worthy of consideration for support from the City of New York,\u201d he continued. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Text of Statement by George Osborne, Chancellor of Exchequer, on \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byToday I want to reassure the British people, and the global community, that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength.That is because in the last six years the government and the British people have worked hard to rebuild the British economy.We have worked systematically through a plan that today means Britain has the strongest major advanced economy in the world.Growth has been robust.The employment rate is at a record high.The capital requirements for banks are 10 times what they were.And the budget deficit has been brought down from 11 percent of national income, and was forecast to be below 3 percent this year.I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held.Thank goodness we did.As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.That challenge is clear.On Thursday, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.That is not the outcome that I wanted or that I threw everything into campaigning for.But Parliament agreed that there are issues of such constitutional significance that they cannot solely be left to politicians and must be determined by the people in a referendum.Now the people have spoken and we, in this democracy, must all accept that result and deliver on their instructions.I don\u2019t resile from any of the concerns I expressed during the campaign, but I fully accept the result of the referendum and will do everything I can to make it work for Britain.It is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.In the analysis that the Treasury and other independent organizations produced, three particular challenges were identified \u2014 and I want to say how we meet all three.First, there is the volatility we have seen and are likely to continue to see in financial markets.Those markets may not have been expecting the referendum result \u2014 but the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have spent the last few months putting in place robust contingency plans for the immediate financial aftermath in the event of this result.Swap lines were arranged in advance so the Bank of England is now able to lend in foreign currency if needed. As part of those plans, the bank and we agreed that there would be an immediate statement on Friday morning from the governor, Mark Carney.As Mark made clear, the Bank of England stands ready to provide 250 billion pounds of funds, through its normal facilities, to continue to support banks and the smooth functioning of markets.And we discussed our coordinated response with other major economies in calls on Friday with the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7.The governor and I have been in regular touch with each other over the weekend \u2014 and I can say this this morning: We have further well-thought-through contingency plans if they are needed.In the last 72 hours, I have been in contact with fellow European finance ministers, central bank governors, the managing director of the I.M.F., the U.S. Treasury secretary and the speaker of Congress, and the C.E.O.s of some of our major financial institutions so that collectively we keep a close eye on developments.It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.But let me be clear. You should not underestimate our resolve.We were prepared for the unexpected.We are equipped for whatever happens.And we are determined that, unlike eight years ago, Britain\u2019s financial system will help our country deal with any shocks and dampen them \u2014 not contribute to those shocks or make them worse.The second challenge our analysis identified in advance was the uncertainty that a vote to leave would bring in the coming months and beyond as Britain worked with its European allies to create a new relationship.The prime minister has given us time as a country to decide what that relationship should be by delaying the decision to trigger the Article 50 procedure until there is a new prime minister in place for the autumn.In the meantime, and during the negotiations that will follow, there will be no change to people\u2019s rights to travel and work, and to the way our goods and services are traded, or to the way our economy and financial system is regulated.However, it is already evident that as a result of Thursday\u2019s decision, some firms are continuing to pause their decisions to invest, or to hire people.As I said before the referendum, this will have an impact on the economy and the public finances \u2014 and there will need to be action to address that.But no one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country. To all companies large and small, I would say this: The British economy is fundamentally strong, we are highly competitive and we are open for business.The third and final challenge I spoke of was that of ensuring that Britain was able to agree a long-term economic relationship with the rest of Europe that provided for the best possible terms of trade in goods and services.Together, my colleagues in the government, the Conservative Party and in Parliament will have to determine what those terms should be \u2014 and we\u2019ll have to negotiate with our European friends to agree them.I intend to play an active part in that debate \u2014 for I want this great trading nation of ours to put in place the strongest possible economic links with our European neighbors, with our close friends in North America and the Commonwealth, and our important partners like China and India.I do not want Britain to turn its back on Europe or the rest of the world.We must bring unity of spirit and purpose, and condemn hatred and division wherever we see it.Britain is an open and tolerant country, and I will fight with everything I have to keep it so.Today I am completely focused on the task in hand as chancellor of the Exchequer to bring stability and reassurance.In conclusion, the British people have given us their instructions.There is much to do to make it work.We start from a position of hard-won strength.And whatever the undoubted challenges, my colleagues and I are determined to do the best for Britain.Advertisement"}

Practically any government or business document in the country has required some sort of official seal or endorsement.All that stamping and paper-shuffling helped make life in Croatia a Kafkaesque morass, though, so the government has decided it\u2019s time to stamp out the stamp before it suffocates an already weak economy.Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic recently ordered official rubber stamps out of nearly every aspect of Croatian life. But the new rules will be phased in over the course of the year \u2014 and to put them into effect, some documents will probably have to be stamped.It will surely take a while for the government and ordinary citizens alike to shed the deeply rooted clah-thunking habit. The country\u2019s National Archives contains more than 1,000 official seals, some dating to feudal times, that were used by titled nobles, elected politicians and every functionary in between to bash their imprimatur in wax and ink. Croatia\u2019s national seal even had its own dedicated guard until 2000.Ivana Sucic of the Croatian Chamber of Economy, which pushed for the new rules, said the legal framework for going stampless was in place long before the country joined the European Union in 2013. Yet to this day, nearly every Croatian entrepreneur\u2019s first purchase is a rubber stamp, to pound haphazardly onto documents just as a precaution.\u201cIt\u2019s more psychological\u201d than practical, Ms. Sucic said, an instinct born of worries about being tripped up by incomprehensible red tape. And no wonder: \u201cThe entropy in the regulatory system is constantly growing, instead of falling,\u201d she said.Lucija Popov, the president of the Croatian Chamber of Notaries, said she\u2019ll gladly ditch the caricature of a desk jockey robotically stamping documents.\u201cIn the beginning, it was understandable to be perceived as stamp-pounders,\u201d she said. But it doesn\u2019t fit as well these days, when much of the work of notaries is done digitally. Still, \u201cour job always ended with a stamp,\u201d Ms. Lucic added. \u201cIt\u2019ll take some time to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.A.A. Issues Commercial Drone Rules", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government on Tuesday made it much easier for companies to use drones for a variety of tasks, including aerial photography and emergency response.The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s new commercial drone rules allow a broad range of businesses to use drones under 55 pounds, but with several restrictions: The drones must be operated by a pilot who has passed a written test and is at least 16 years old. And drones can be flown only below 400 feet, during the day and at least five miles away from airports.The new F.A.A. rules do not necessarily preclude a hodgepodge of state and local drone regulations that have popped up in recent years. The administration sent a letter to states and cities saying they recommend everyone follow their lead. But it is only a recommendation.Still, the action brings the drone delivery vision one step closer to reality. And experts predict that in time federal regulators will get comfortable with the notion.\u201cWithin months you will see the incredible impact of these rules with commercial drones becoming commonplace in a variety of uses,\u201d said Michael Drobac, a lawyer at Akin Gump who represents drone efforts at companies like Amazon and Google. \u201cThis will show the technology is reliable and then it becomes harder to argue against broader uses \u2014 like for delivery.\u201dDrone makers and tech companies have been lobbying for the rules for five years. But the Obama administration, while trying to accommodate the potential economic benefits of the technology, has struggled to safely integrate the popular, remote-controlled flying vehicles into airspace.Pilots and privacy groups that pushed hard for greater safety provisions and strong surveillance rules expressed fear that clearing the way for more of the flying machines posed new dangers and few protections from spying. The F.A.A. rules prohibit drones from flying above people and faster than 100 miles per hour.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.\u201cThe F.A.A. continues to ignore the top concern of Americans about the deployment of commercial drones in the United States \u2014 the need for strong privacy safeguards,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of Electronic Privacy Information Center.In February 2015, the F.A.A. created its first rules for recreational drone users, and more than 450,000 hobbyists registered last winter in the government\u2019s user database.Previously, companies had to apply for special permission from the F.A.A. to operate drones. The government has issued more than 6,000 approvals and about 7,000 companies are on a waiting list for approval. When the new rules go into effect in 60 days, companies will no longer have to gain that special exemption.\u201cWith this new rule, we are taking a careful and deliberate approach that balances the need to deploy this new technology with the F.A.A.\u2019s mission to protect public safety,\u201d said Michael Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator. \u201cBut this is just our first step. We\u2019re already working on additional rules that will expand the range of operations.\u201dIn a fact sheet released by the White House, the government cited economic estimates that commercial drones could generate more than $82 billion in the next decade.Drones \u201crepresent a potentially powerful innovation that could have a positive impact on our economy,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The new rules are \u201cjust the beginning of the process.\u201dAmazon has hired several lobbyists just to focus on drone rules. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, expects drone delivery to be available within the next few years and has begun testing its own devices.\u201cWe are extremely pleased the rule establishes a risk-based, federal approach for operating drones nationwide, and thank the F.A.A. for engaging industry throughout the process,\u201d said Kara Calvert, director of a coalition of drone manufacturers including the Chinese company DJI and GoPro.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Vows to Fight Racism, but Its Users Can\u2019t Sue to Prompt Fairness", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Brian Chesky, chief executive of Airbnb, made a vow this month to root out bigotry from his business.But even as Mr. Chesky promised to stamp out racism from Airbnb, the company\u2019s class-action litigation policy makes it tough \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for customers to push the start-up to make any substantive changes on the issue. Airbnb requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.The waiver clause can be broadly applied to many issues, not just accusations of discrimination. But class-action lawsuits have been particularly effective legal tools to press companies on their discrimination policies over the years, civil rights lawyers said, which would give Airbnb more cause to wield it as it grapples with the issue. In the past, such suits against Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Coca-Cola pushed those companies to change hiring and workplace practices.\u201cClass-action cases have been the only effective way to prove and remedy systemic discrimination because you can\u2019t prove a pattern of behavior with individually filed cases,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of New York Law School\u2019s Center for Justice and Democracy, who specializes in civil justice issues.The waiver clause and Airbnb\u2019s more prominent placement of it allows it to shield itself now from outside pressure around the discrimination issue and to handle the matter at its own pace and on its own terms.\u201cAirbnb can say it doesn\u2019t condone racism and even has an anti-discrimination policy, but right now that policy doesn\u2019t have teeth if the company is legally insulated from having to comply with the same anti-discrimination laws that real estate brokers must comply with,\u201d said Jamila Jefferson-Jones, an associate professor of law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City.A spokesman for Airbnb said that the company was open about its dispute resolution policies, including the waiver clause, and that \u201cthese provisions are common and we believe ours is balanced and protects consumers.\u201dAirbnb this month also hired Laura Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington legislative office, as an outside adviser to look at the issue. Ms. Murphy said Airbnb was examining its internal structures and technology, and its processes for identifying and handling discrimination incidents, and building relationships with organizations like fair housing, human rights and travel groups.Airbnb aims to have announcements in the next 10 days about preliminary actions it is taking on discrimination, and it plans to have a full report with proposed remedies in September, she said. Eventually, the company wants to have a division to handle and resolve discrimination complaints, Ms. Murphy added.\u201cLitigation is always an option, but we think it\u2019s better to take the time and effort to resolve problems if we can,\u201d she said in an interview.\u201cAirbnb is willing and eager to use the class-action waiver and arbitration clause,\u201d said Jeffrey Norton, the lawyer who filed that suit in February.Airbnb may soon test the waiver clause directly in a class-action discrimination suit, which was filed in May in the United States District Court in Washington. The chief plaintiff, Gregory Selden, who is African-American, claimed Airbnb violated civil rights laws that forbid housing discrimination when a host on the service denied him accommodation last year because of his race. Airbnb\u2019s response to the lawsuit is due by July 13.Ikechukwu Emejuru, the lawyer representing Mr. Selden, said, \u201cThe sharing economy has grown exponentially, and Mr. Selden\u2019s experiences of not being accommodated by Airbnb because of his race put in motion this country\u2019s most iconic civil rights laws.\u201d He declined to comment further and said Mr. Selden was unavailable to comment.Airbnb\u2019s expansion depends partly on whether people of different nationalities and ethnicities feel welcomed to the platform in the same nondiscriminatory way that they are welcomed at international hotel chains. Two rival room-sharing services, Innclusive and Noirbnb, are now marketing themselves as services that provide inclusive and safe short-term rentals for people of any race or ethnicity.Ms. Murphy, the Airbnb adviser, said the company recognized that eliminating discrimination was in its best interests. She said Airbnb\u2019s relative youth \u2014 the company was founded in 2008 \u2014 meant it could deal with the issue in a more agile way than companies with entrenched cultures that may have needed the pressure of litigation to do the right thing.\u201cAirbnb is part of a new area of commerce, and the conditions for transactions are still developing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get it right.\u201dAn article on Monday about allegations of conflict between Airbnb\u2019s vow to eliminate bias in bookings and its policy of barring class actions by customers misidentified, in some editions, the university at which Jamila Jefferson-Jones, a law professor who commented on the issue, teaches. It is the University of Missouri, Kansas City \u2014 not Barry University School of Law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Brexit Vote, a Choice for Europe: Move Forward, or Fall Back", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs \u201cEurope\u201d finished?But even if the pro-European Remain cause pulls out a victory, the popular hostility against the decades-long process of European integration \u2014 evident not only in Britain but across the Continent \u2014 underscores a defining weakness. Europe itself lacks a firm democratic foundation.Europe\u2019s leaders face a clear-cut choice: For their integration agenda to succeed \u2014 preserving the free movement of people within the bloc, forging ahead with the euro and the single market, keeping doors open to outsiders \u2014 the E.U. must figure out how to overcome the narrow national interests and mistrust that tie it up in knots every time a collective response is needed.That will require democracy on a European scale. If Europe\u2019s national governments remain unwilling to cede political power to regional institutions that have democratic legitimacy, the European Union will slide backward.\u201cWe need pan-E.U. politics,\u201d argued Mary Kaldor, professor of global governance at the London School of Economics. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we get there.\u201dBritish citizens will vote on whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. While a vote to leave would give Britain more autonomy, it could also create great economic uncertainty.\u201cPopular discontent with globalization in its many forms has been building up in the West for many years now,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Rourke, an economic historian at the University of Oxford. \u201cWe are seeing its effects everywhere.\u201dStill, the European Union\u2019s hapless response to its current social and economic challenges has made it an easy target. With no real European institutions of democratic accountability \u2014 the European Parliament serves little more than a decorative function \u2014 the only way voters can express their dissatisfaction is by pushing to leave and by supporting extremist political movements.\u201cIn many countries the perception is that national governments are powerless and that there is nothing at the European level to address problems,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, a former Belgian member of Parliament now at the London School of Economics. \u201cBoth Europe and national governments lose legitimacy.\u201dWhat could the E.U. have done better? Things would be a lot easier if most of Europe were growing at more than a snail\u2019s pace. The inability of countries in the euro area \u2014 which does not include Britain \u2014 to stop the slow-motion implosion of Greece and other deeply indebted countries gives integration a bad name. The two are related.Germany\u2019s resistance to share in the costs of a collective solution to seriously write down the debts that Greece and other Southern European nations will never be able to pay off \u2014 insisting instead that the indebted countries and their beleaguered citizens bear nearly all the cost \u2014 has prolonged and deepened Europe\u2019s stagnation.\u201cBritons contemplate the crisis of the euro as a little bit of proof that they were right not to join,\u201d said Giancarlo Corsetti, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge.Immigration, however, can easily be deployed as an argument to leave the rest of Europe. More than half the 333,000 immigrants who arrived in Britain last year were E.U. citizens, free to be there as a matter of right under European law.\u201cThe Leave campaign made an argument that the only way to reduce this part of immigration is to leave the E.U.,\u201d noted Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an expert on immigration at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAnd they struck a chord with the electorate.\u201dDealing with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war will never be easy. But Europe\u2019s reaction was notoriously unproductive. The E.U.\u2019s institutions again appeared irrelevant, as governments retrenched into their corners and failed to devise a collective, burden-sharing approach.How much integration do Europeans need? Dani Rodrik at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government notes that the E.U.\u2019s initial major goal \u2014 preventing France and Germany from drawing the world into another war \u2014 has been achieved. It also served as a democratic, capitalistic anchor for Eastern European countries to hang onto after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut today Europe\u2019s integration effort has lost sight of its political and social dimensions, he argues, narrowing into a raw effort to reduce market barriers. That\u2019s not enough to inspire popular support.There might be areas where collective action at the European level could make a difference \u2014 as a counterweight to colossal multinational companies that can challenge the authority of individual nations, or to prevent capital from effortlessly zipping across borders in an effort to avoid taxes. Indeed, the E.U. has taken a leading role confronting the world\u2019s most daunting collective action problem: climate change.The critical question is whether Europe will be able to achieve the kind of integrated decision-making needed to address these challenges. So far, it hasn\u2019t shown it can rise to the occasion. \u201cThere is not much appetite for further political integration,\u201d Mr. Corsetti said. Solutions to Europe\u2019s challenges must navigate around this constraint.The free movement of people inside the E.U. might be the first to go into reverse. \u201cRestricting the free movement of labor is not a taboo,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard told me. \u201cAnother way freedom of movement will be restricted is you will see more and more restrictions placed on the ability of citizens from other E.U. countries to claim welfare benefits.\u201dMaybe the European Union\u2019s future is more \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d \u2014 a set of coalitions of the willing, as it were. Rather than insisting on all or nothing, said Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, it might be better to consider \u201ca Europe that is not one size fits all, where the balance between national governments and Brussels is more flexible.\u201dThis may come as a disappointment to Europe\u2019s current leaders. But one way or another, the project\u2019s governance must come into line with what its people want. That\u2019s called democracy.\u201cEurope must either roll back the economic integration or roll ahead the political integration,\u201d Mr. Haass said, \u201cso people feel they have a say over the politicians who are driving changes that affect their lives.\u201dThe Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about challenges facing the European Union whether or not Britain elects to withdraw, gave an outdated academic affiliation in some copies for Kevin O\u2019Rourke, who commented on the issue.

Let\u2019s really, really hope this is wrong.It\u2019s true that measured unemployment is low by historical standards. But that\u2019s a number depressed by low labor force participation; nobody really knows how far we are from full employment. Meanwhile, wage increases have risen but are still nowhere near worrying inflationary levels; actual inflation is below 2 percent, and both inflation expectations from surveys and implied market inflation predictions are low and falling.Oh, and job growth has slowed, along with the economy. Why would we expect an inflationary surge anytime soon, if ever?The behavior of long-term interest rates is, I think, especially telling. Such rates reflect a combination of inflation expectations and expectations about future economic strength \u2014 and they\u2019ve been plunging, and are once again below 1.7 percent:So the market doesn\u2019t see a near or even medium-term future in which the Fed would have good reasons to raise rates. Are people at the Fed at all sure that they know better?On top of all this is the asymmetry of risks, which I and many others have been arguing for again and again. If the Fed waits to raise rates, and inflation overshoots its target, that\u2019s not a deep problem \u2014 it can always raise rates, slow the economy, and get inflation down. If it raises rates and this turns out to have been premature, with the economy losing momentum and inflation falling, that\u2019s a mistake that\u2019s very hard to reverse when rates are still not much above zero.So even if the data suggested that a rate hike was appropriate if you abstract from uncertainty \u2014 which they don\u2019t! \u2014 it would still make sense to wait.With everything else going on in the world, the really really last thing we need is an unforced error by the Fed.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The improvement, however, was clearly too little to raise Americans\u2019 spirits: The new survey, which was conducted in late 2015 and released last week, also shows that optimism about the future has tempered.The Fed policy committee should take the survey to heart when it meets this month to decide whether to raise interest rates. Higher rates are a way to slow an economy that is at risk of overheating \u2014 a far-fetched proposition when tens of millions of Americans are barely hanging in there.Congress and other economic policy makers, as well as the presidential candidates, could also use the survey to get some insight into Americans\u2019 real economic problems. Among them is deep insecurity. Nearly 70 percent of adults said they were \u201cliving comfortably\u201d or \u201cdoing O.K.\u201d \u2014 up a bit from previous years \u2014 but nearly half of all respondents said they could not cover an unexpected expense of $400, or could do so only by selling something or borrowing money.Americans seeking a path upward through education are staggering under a load of debt. The median debt load for someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree was $19,162. For a master\u2019s, it was $36,000, and for a professional degree, $100,000. Many students with debt use deferments or other plans to delay or extend repayments, but in most cases that increases the balance they owe. For those making payments, the average monthly bill was $533.By all indications, however, they are the relatively lucky ones. Americans who had attended college accounted for most of the improvement reported in the survey. Financial stress was more prevalent among less-educated people who responded to the survey, as well as racial and ethnic minorities and adults making less than $40,000 a year.Over all, the survey depicts an economy in which many Americans face daily hardship, while even the college educated \u2014 the presumed winners in the economy \u2014 still face big obstacles. The findings argue for continued low interest rates; for government policies and federal spending to help create good jobs at good pay; for affordable education that starts at preschool, thus fostering college-ready students; and for a safety net that can withstand today\u2019s potent economic forces.Advertisement"}

As a line of Confederate troops marches across a field into Union rifle and artillery fire, a haze of myth starts to gather over the action, a mist of sentiment about the tragedy of the Civil War and the symmetrical valor of the soldiers on both sides of it. But this is a sly piece of misdirection: The rest of the movie will be devoted to blowing that fog away, using the tools of Hollywood spectacle to restore a measure of clarity to our understanding of the war and its aftermath.The hero of this tale is Newton Knight, a poor farmer from Jones County, Miss., who led a guerrilla army of white deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy during the war. Afterward, he tried to hold this coalition together as a political force in the face of Ku Klux Klan terror. As played by Matthew McConaughey, Newton is an ordinary man radicalized by circumstances. His hollow cheeks and wild whiskers suggest a zealous temperament, but the kindness in his eyes conveys the decency and compassion that lie at the heart of his moral commitment.It\u2019s a western of sorts, and a romantic rebel movie of sorts \u2014 there are hints of \u201cViva Zapata!\u201d and \u201cShane\u201d and a half-dozen other underdog classics \u2014 but with an unusually clear ideological focus. After fleeing the army, where he had served as a battlefield nurse, and witnessing Confederate authorities confiscating his neighbors\u2019 livestock and grain, Newton takes refuge in a swamp with a small group of slaves who have run away from a nearby plantation, including a man named Moses (Mahershala Ali), who becomes his friend and confidant. Through his conversations with Moses and with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a domestic slave who brings the fugitives news and supplies from the plantation house, Newton comes to believe that the slaves share a common enemy and a common interest with poor white farmers like himself.\u201cFree State of Jones\u201d is careful not to suggest that the conditions endured by disenfranchised white and enslaved black Mississippians were identical. The system may be rigged against both, but in different ways. Especially after the war, the alliance proves fragile, as white supremacy reasserts itself with renewed brutality. Its persistence is emphasized by a subplot that takes place 85 years after the war in a Mississippi courtroom, where Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin), a descendant of Newton\u2019s, is on trial for breaking the state\u2019s law against interracial marriage.The question of Davis\u2019s racial identity turns on whether he is descended from Rachel or Serena (Keri Russell), Newton\u2019s wife at the beginning of the movie. The romance between a white man and an enslaved black woman is, to say the least, a delicate issue for a movie like this to deal with, but Mr. Ross handles this and other fraught matters with impressive tact and sensitivity. The film does not minimize the violence of slavery, including the sexual violence that was the daily experience of women like Rachel, but it also refrains from turning cruelty into spectacle. Mr. Ross has an old-fashioned faith in the power of editing, and in the ability of the audience to imagine what he refrains from showing explicitly.Which is not to say that \u201cFree State of Jones\u201d is a subtle movie. Why should it be? There is nothing wrong with a story that has clear heroes and villains, especially when such roles have been misconceived for so long. The wily and charismatic Newton Knight is a revisionist archetype, a white Southern rebel fighting against the mythology that such figures usually embody. He takes down the Stars and Bars and raises Old Glory above his territory; this movie holds no truck with magnolia-scented nonsense about a genteel Southern way of life menaced by Yankee aggression.It is obvious to Newton, and certainly to Moses, that the Glorious Cause of the Confederacy was a rapacious and exploitative cotton-based capitalist economy, and that the resistance to Reconstruction was intended to restore that system. This view reflects the current scholarly consensus, but much of American popular culture, like much of American politics, remains besotted by the old mythology. Freedom is a long struggle.\u201cFree State of Jones\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gory wartime violence and less explicit but equally upsetting postwar brutality. Running time: 2 hours 19 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Message: Yes, the Economy Is Messed Up. But I Can Fix It.", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceIt has been a year dominated by populist rage, embodied in Bernie Sanders\u2019s calls for a political revolution and Donald J. Trump\u2019s angry assertions that the United States, and its workers, are losing badly in the global economy.In an economic policy speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton gave this message: I alone am the candidate who knows how to turn those underlying frustrations into actual policies that might make things better. She offered herself as someone who would not merely vent voters\u2019 anger, but respond to that anger by pulling the levers of the federal bureaucracy and creating legislation that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and just maybe pass a Senate committee.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave,\u201d Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said before exuberant supporters in Raleigh, N.C., a day after a speech blasting Mr. Trump\u2019s business record, ethics and often-erratic policy positions. \u201cIt takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan. It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.\u201dUnlike her primary opponent, Mr. Sanders, she did not promise to provide free college tuition or to break up major banks; she instead said she would make sure students could graduate without a debt hangover, and clamp down on banks in ways that would probably lead them to shrink.Unlike her Republican opponent, Mr. Trump, she did not propose ripping up trade deals and risking trade wars with the likes of China and Mexico. But she did say her administration would use the tax code to punish companies that outsource jobs.Notably, she also did not proclaim the greatness of the Obama-era economy and pledge continuity. That was a contrast with two other modern-era candidates who ran to succeed a two-term president from their party amid a strong economy, Al Gore in 2000 and George H.W. Bush in 1988.This carefully rolled-out speech suggests she seeks to run not by boasting of what has gone right in the economy under President Obama, but as a fixer who can more successfully deal with the things that are still broken.The Obama administration has stressed that private-sector job growth has been strong for the last several years and that the unemployment rate is now down to 4.7 percent. But in her speech, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the longer-term divergence between worker productivity and wages, the tendency of companies to view employee compensation as a cost to be minimized. And she spoke of the struggles of the long-term unemployed, people who can find only part-time work, and those who are out of the labor force entirely.In effect, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the underlying economic discontent that has fueled the rise of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, while presenting herself as the person best qualified to address it.\u201cThe bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers\u2019 rights.\u201dMrs. Clinton thus emphasized policies that have potential for deal making even in a polarized Congress, or that could be executed through administrative action.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.In the first category, she mentioned large-scale investment in public infrastructure, funding long-term investments in the nation\u2019s future with a mix of public and private resources. Business interests and many elected Republicans support ideas in this vein, at least in theory.She also mentioned immigration reform as a tool for economic improvement, another idea that businesspeople and many Republicans support. (Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio, who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton\u2019s general-election opponent, was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago.)In the category of administrative action, Mrs. Clinton was vague but clear about her intention to use the machinery of government to nudge things in workers\u2019 favor. She said she would \u201ccontinue to crack down on wage theft\u201d and abuse of overtime rules, suggesting that she would, if anything, seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for time-and-a-half pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees.The policy steps she described had mostly been put forward by her campaign already, so it is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left, in hopes of corralling Sanders voters, or to the center, in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general electorate. Rather, the speech framed her place in the race as being the candidate who understands the populist discontent but will react to it with practicality. That carries risks, too.After all, President Obama has spent his entire second term following the same basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul, while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law. As the election advances, Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the same things as Mr. Obama has, but with the hope of getting better results for American workers.Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s message on Wednesday was that she will campaign and govern with a five-point plan, drawn up by subject-area experts, incorporating the full range of potential legislative and administrative tools available to the next president.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s emotional.American teenagers are in psychological trouble. For the first time, college students today are facing more stress than their parents, according to a recent report by the American Psychological Association.The evidence is all around us. American teenagers attempt suicide more often than youths in most other countries, and they are among the world leaders in violence, binge drinking, marijuana use, obesity and unhappiness, according to a Temple University professor, Laurence Steinberg.A survey of more than 123,000 students at 153 colleges by the American College Health Association in 2013 found that more than half experienced overwhelming anxiety and about a third felt deep depression during the academic year.How can they learn and thrive if they do not have the skills to handle their emotions or feel safe and supported enough to talk about them?This is, or should be, worrisome to educators and policy makers, not only because of the suffering that results but also because a large and growing body of research demonstrates that the way people manage their emotions \u2014 that is, their emotional intelligence \u2014 matters for personal growth and to the success of the broader society and economy.Emotions drive learning, decision-making, creativity, relationships and health. Mastering the skills of emotional intelligence paves the way for greater well-being, better relationships and overall effectiveness \u2014 for college students, for students from kindergarten through high school and for the adults who surround them, including educators and parents. The Nobel laureate James J. Heckman has written that teaching \u201cnoncognitive\u201d skills, including recognizing and regulating emotions, would be a cost-effective way to increase work force productivity and quality.Teaching emotional intelligence \u2014 or what\u2019s more broadly referred to as social and emotional learning \u2014 to children and adults has proven effective\u2014-and sorely needed.Given that, it\u2019s frustrating that policies to mandate and finance evidence-based approaches to social and emotional learning are slow to come. A few states, including Illinois and Alaska, have acted on their own.

But has terrorism achieved its other goal, of intimidating Americans?The question itself is not simple. Americans have their individual answers. A sampling of data shows that by many measures, people say they are very concerned. But they are not acting like it.Polls suggest Americans are more concerned about terrorism than they have been in years. Soon after the San Bernardino attack, a Gallup survey found that 16 percent of respondents said terrorism was the most important problem facing the country.No other problem scored higher \u2014 and it was the highest such number for terrorism in 10 years.

{"Headline": "A Steel Mill Lives Again, in a Setback for China", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byTANGSHAN, China \u2014 The hulking, white-and-brown buildings of the Songting Iron & Steel Company stood silent one chilly February afternoon. The only signs of life came from the handful of guards at the compound\u2019s gate, and from the disheveled middle-aged man who emerged to shout to the plant\u2019s visitors, \u201cGet lost!\u201dOnce one of the largest steel mills in this dreary industrial city, Songting had ceased production, a victim of China\u2019s slowing economy. Its workers \u2014 many unpaid for months and worried about their future \u2014 were let go to fend for themselves, and steel works that can churn out five million metric tons a year had gone quiet.Three months later, the silence was broken. Trucks trundled between Songting\u2019s buildings. Rows of cars were parked outside. Around the corner, smoke billowed from a tall chimney.Songting has risen from the dead \u2014 and that is bad news for China and the global economy.The mill\u2019s story illustrates the challenge Beijing faces in overhauling the slowing Chinese economy. China desperately needs to eliminate unnecessary, unprofitable factories in many industries to shift the economy toward more productive businesses.The national government has repeatedly pledged to tackle the problem. In the steel industry alone, Chinese leaders announced plans this year to reduce the country\u2019s steelmaking capacity by as much as 150 million metric tons by 2020 \u2013 an amount larger than the entire industry in Japan.But as Songting shows, closing even the most troubled plants can prove problematic.At a local level, Communist Party cadres and businessmen sometimes keep unwanted steel mills and other factories operating to preserve financial and social stability. Steel mills are large employers, and closings can cause widespread layoffs. China\u2019s plan would throw an estimated 500,000 steelworkers out their jobs.Beijing hopes that the workers laid off from excess steel mills and other bloated factories will find new employment in healthier sectors of the economy, especially in services. But several Songting workers \u2014 who spoke on the condition that their names not be revealed because they hoped to be rehired \u2014 complained that they could find few jobs in a region dominated by stumbling heavy industry. Many quickly fell on hard times, and some even resorted to public protests \u2014 exactly the social instability Chinese officials fear most.Concerns about labor unrest, combined with worries that closing factories will saddle China\u2019s big banks with bad debt, have slowed factory closures. By one estimate, China permanently shut less than 2 percent of its total steelmaking capacity last year, a period when roughly one-third of that capacity went unused.\u201cThere is no concrete policy or plan that can resolve these problems in the near term,\u201d says Laura Zhai, a director at rating agency Fitch in Hong Kong. \u201cThe capacity elimination is not going to happen right away.\u201dStubborn steel capacity is also causing friction with Washington. Both the United States and the European Union are up in arms over a flood of cheap steel pouring into global markets from excess Chinese factories. In response, Washington has slapped steep tariffs on some Chinese steel imports.\u201cImplementing policies to substantially reduce production in a range of sectors suffering from overcapacity, including steel and aluminum, is critical to the function and stability of international markets,\u201d the United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, said during a Beijing visit this week.Songting \u2014 which employed about 6,000 workers, according to the local government\u2019s website \u2014 was among the larger, privately owned mills in town. But with construction of new homes and infrastructure in the doldrums, prices of steel plunged, and Songting, along with the entire industry, began to suffer. Workers say they stopped receiving regular paychecks in early 2015. A section of the plant was idled for part of the year, and management began laying off staff.One of the unfortunate was C. F. Shi, 45, who worked in Songting\u2019s factory for 21 years and asked that her full name not be used. One morning last September, she arrived at the plant to find her boss dropping folded slips of paper into a box. As the box was passed around the room, each worker had to draw a slip, and only those who selected one with a mark on the inside could stay on the job.Ms. Shi lost out in the lottery and got sent home, without five months of unpaid wages or severance. She was distraught. \u201cI even thought of trying to hang myself,\u201d she said.On the morning of Nov. 14, as the workers assembled at their posts as usual, managers informed them that the factory was shutting down indefinitely. According to a December report from HSBC, the money-losing mill was forced to suspend production after it was unable to pay a fee owed to the local power supply bureau.Some employees began demanding their paychecks, according to workers who were there. By that point, Songting owed them about six months of wages. Fifteen workers climbed to the roof of one company building and threatened to jump as hundreds of horrified staff looked on below, said one worker.In desperation, hundreds of Songting workers held a protest in November outside a local government office demanding their unpaid salaries, workers said, but to no avail. With few local job options, some of the laid-off employees quickly tumbled into destitution.Ms. Shi and her husband, who had also lost his job at Songting, were unable to find steady work, leaving her scrimping to support her two young children in a drafty concrete house not far from Songting\u2019s plant. She and her husband sometimes had nothing to eat but cabbage.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the basic requirements for life,\u201d Ms. Shi said.Starting in late February, some workers began getting calls from their former managers asking them to return. Part of the plant, they were told, was going to start production again.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Maintaining jobs is a major consideration as well, said Xu Xiangchun, chief information officer at Chinese research firm Mysteel. \u201cThe employment problem is the biggest problem for the government and the enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the companies adopt various measures to activate capital and to give workers jobs.\u201dThe industry\u2019s woes are far from over. Fitch, the bond-rating firm, estimates that the industry may be saddled with as much as $600 billion in debt. That burden, combined with low prices and sagging demand, has moved the steel sector into the red. The China Iron and Steel Association said that its members lost a combined $9.8 billion last year, compared with a combined profit of $3.4 billion in 2014.\u201cEven if there is no government push, the market conditions will drive out more capacity,\u201d said Rachel Zhang, a steel analyst at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt is just a matter of time.\u201dBecause Songting is a private company, it does not disclose financial details. The company declined requests for comment.Its workers are simply happy to have their jobs back. Ms. Shi returned to her old job in late April, just as the mill started operating again, though at a reduced salary. She still worries about what might come, but for now, she hopes her fortunes will revive with Songting\u2019s. \u201cAt least the living standard of my two kids has improved,\u201d she said.Zhang Tiantian in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

When the population overwhelmingly votes \u201coui,\u201d hora dancing erupts in the Place de la R\u00e9publique, and a TV anchorwoman tells the nation, \u201cShalom, mes fr\u00e8res!\u201dYvan Attal, the French movie star who co-wrote, directed and starred in the film, said he made it \u201cin response to a malaise I feel, as a Jew, in my country.\u201dThis malaise is based, in part, on some terrible events: the four people murdered inside a kosher supermarket in Paris last year; the 2014 shooting by a Frenchman at a Jewish museum in Brussels; the 2012 attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse; the roughly 800 anti-Semitic incidents reported annually in France recently.In the film, Mr. Attal plays an urbane, secular Jewish actor named \u201cYvan\u201d whose wife thinks he\u2019s overly concerned about anti-Semitism. His therapist asks: \u201cYou know the number of Jews in every country in the world? And you\u2019re telling me that your wife said you\u2019re obsessed?\u201d\u201cYvan\u201d frets that he doesn\u2019t know what being Jewish means, let alone why someone would despise him for it.A series of sketches play on the absurdity of this. In one, the husband of a far-right politician discovers on the eve of elections that his maternal grandmother was Jewish. Examining his nose in a bathroom mirror, he spits at his reflection, and calls himself a \u201cvermin.\u201d In another, an unemployed man living in public housing declares to his elderly parents that they can\u2019t possibly be Jewish, because they\u2019re not rich.Mr. Attal was born in Israel to Algerian-\u00e9migr\u00e9 parents who moved to France when he was an infant. He grew up in a housing project in Cr\u00e9teil, a suburb of Paris, where his Jewish education consisted mostly of eating couscous with his family on Friday nights. \u201cMy parents always repeated to me that our Judaism was a private and intimate story,\u201d Mr. Attal said. In public, you were supposed to integrate and act \u201cFrench.\u201dNow 51, Mr. Attal says that \u2014 worryingly, and without his consent \u2014 other people have started pointing out his Jewishness, or seeing it as central to his identity. Journalists have lately described him as Franco-Israeli, \u201c because they can\u2019t say I\u2019m a Jew,\u201d he tells me.It\u2019s a very French concern. Here, pointing out someone\u2019s religion or ethnicity can come across as questioning whether they\u2019re fully French. Jews are especially sensitive to this; they remember that \u201cJuif\u201d was stamped across people\u2019s passports during World War II, a first step before they were deported and killed. (The movie\u2019s French title, \u201cIls sont partout\u201d \u2014 they are everywhere \u2014 is a reference to the collaborationist newspaper Je Suis Partout.)One of the few places anti-Semitism really thrives in France is among some Muslims. In one French poll, 44 percent said there was a \u201cglobal Zionist conspiracy,\u201d and 67 percent said that Jews had too much economic power. Still, 85 percent of Muslims said that when they discover that someone is Jewish, \u201cI do not care.\u201d Most Muslims have bigger problems: They are themselves one of France\u2019s least accepted minority groups.Nevertheless, Jewish stereotypes can have tragic consequences. Members of the gang that kidnapped, brutally tortured and murdered 23-year-old Ilan Halimi in 2006 were surprised to find out that Mr. Halimi\u2019s family, though Jewish, wasn\u2019t wealthy. Their leader, the son of immigrants from the Ivory Coast, demanded a ransom from a French rabbi instead.There\u2019s a paradox here: French Jews fret that they are not considered fully French. But some French Muslims resent them for being exceptionally integrated and powerful.That\u2019s an old resentment. Like Mr. Attal\u2019s parents, many French Jews and Muslims have roots in Algeria, which was under French rule until 1962. France granted citizenship, with all its privileges, to Algeria\u2019s Jews, but not to most of its Muslims. The attackers in Toulouse and at the Jewish museum in Brussels were both the French-born children of Algerian immigrants.On a daily basis, one of the main effects of anti-Semitism is to make Jews feel uncomfortably visible. Armed soldiers patrol Jewish schools and synagogues. Some Jews, like Mr. Attal, worry that the French majority isn\u2019t sufficiently concerned.In the film, Mossad agents conspire to stamp out the root of anti-Semitism: the accusation that Jews killed Jesus. They send a handsome agent back in time to kill Jesus as a baby, before he can preach. (Spoiler alert: The agent ends up falling in love with Mary, and being crucified himself.)At the end, Mr. Attal\u2019s character says he wants the freedom to be a person, full stop. Can\u2019t everyone just start from scratch? \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, I apologize, excuse me, there, mea culpa,\u201d he says. Then a missile lands on newly Jewish France.Pamela Druckerman is the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Until last year, he had struggled to find any kind of a job in his native Portugal. But when he arrived in London, he was able to work almost right away.So were the young women from Hungary, France and Albania who cheerfully tended the cash registers. And the staff from Poland, Spain and Italy cleaning tables and preparing sandwiches for the lunch crowd. Only one thing seemed to bother them: the prospect that Britain might actually leave the European Union.\u201cI don\u2019t think the U.K. will vote for a Brexit, but if they do, it would be bad,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was working to help finance his studies for a computer science degree.\u201cLook around,\u201d he added, gesturing to colleagues who hailed from 10 nations across Europe. \u201cEveryone here is from another country.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dStep into nearly any London restaurant, hotel or retail shop and chances are that most people serving your meal, checking you in or ringing up your sale are not British. Peer inside a construction site, and a hive of nationalities is busy building. Even the British farm vegetables on your plate were probably harvested by European immigrants.For decades, the hospitality, retail, food and construction industries in particular have taken advantage of the bloc\u2019s rules allowing freedom of movement, meaning Europeans like Mr. Graca can work legally in any of the 28 countries that are members. Non-Europeans must obtain work visas under immigration rules that require graduate-level skills and a minimum annual salary of 20,800 pounds.While European nationals working in Britain make up just 5 percent of the 31.5 million-strong work force, compared to 11 percent from overseas, they have become a visible flash point in the overall debate about whether and what type of immigration really works for Britain.British businesses have faced criticism for hiring them. Greencore, Britain\u2019s biggest sandwich maker, drew fire for seeking hundreds of Hungarian employees for a new sandwich factory in Northampton, an hour north of London. Pret A Manger, whose stores dot street corners across Britain, has been faulted for employing relatively few British workers. (A spokesman for Pret A Manger declined to comment.)But for many Europeans grateful to have a job, what is considered a low wage in the eyes of some British is better than what they would get back home. \u201cThere are no jobs in Portugal,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was hoping to be promoted to barista, which pays \u00a39.20 an hour, more than Pret\u2019s base pay of \u00a38.50 and higher than the \u00a37.20 rate considered a living wage. \u201cI\u2019m here to work and earn money,\u201d he said.Any \u201cout\u201d vote would not force Europeans to leave Britain, at least not right away. For the next two years, the British government would negotiate new treaties with the European Union over labor movement and other matters.Still, with the referendum looming, thousands of workers across the city are bracing for a potentially murky future. Employers are grappling with uncertainty about whether they will be able to hire Europeans as easily as before.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what is going to be the status of those people going forward,\u201d said Keith Howells, the chief executive of Mott MacDonald, a major construction services firm with projects in Britain and worldwide. Around 20 percent of his workers in Britain are from elsewhere in the European Union.\u201cWill they be welcome or not? Will they be subject to quotas or won\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially hugely destabilizing.\u201dThat\u2019s especially true for London\u2019s restaurants, bars and hotels, since Europeans make up most employees.A British departure from the bloc \u201cwould impact the industry big time, and those who work here,\u201d said Filippo Castellana, an Italian who manages the French restaurant Le Garrick in Covent Garden. On a recent day, patrons were served steak frites and onion soup by staff members from Poland, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania and France.\u201cWe depend on European workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be insane for Britain to leave.\u201dAround the corner at Suvlaki, a Greek restaurant specializing in grilled meat skewers and stuffed pitas, the owner, Yannis Theodorakakos, was preparing to tally the impact if he needed to obtain work visas for the 13 European citizens working on his staff.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world,\u201d Mr. Theodorakakos said. A former banker, he expects that an independent Britain would start operating like Switzerland, whose relationship with the European Union is framed by bilateral treaties giving it greater control over immigration. \u201cBut if I had to use visas in the future to hire from the E.U., it would cost us money as employers,\u201d he said.That argument riles backers of the \u201cleave\u201d lobby, who argue that European citizens distort the labor market in part because they are able to come into Britain with virtually no checks and start looking for a job.Recently, Britain\u2019s popular curry houses aligned themselves with pro-Brexit campaigners, complaining that skilled chefs from places like Bangladesh must get expensive, time-consuming visas while Europeans with little restaurant expertise can work right away. A Brexit would even an unfair playing field, they say.But to those who claim their business could be crippled without European labor, such talk is a feeble diversion from the elephant in the room in the Brexit debate.\u201cThe fact is we\u2019re doing jobs that most British people don\u2019t want to do,\u201d said Anna Pawelec, the manager of Pillars of Hercules, a 150-year-old pub on Greek Street near Soho that has British owners but is run almost entirely by Poles.\u201cMost of them wouldn\u2019t get out of bed for the money we earn,\u201d added Ms. Pawelec, standing behind a row of beer taps as the song \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d blared from loudspeakers.\u201cForeign people work hard,\u201d she added. \u201cWe contribute hugely to this country. So everyone is thinking the same thing: Don\u2019t tell me to leave.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bank Stress Tests May Also Test Stockholders", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsBank stress exams may test investor patience.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to report how 33 financial institutions fared in a simulated bad economic downturn. Countercyclical factors included this year could mean that even those banks that ace the tests will have to hang on to additional profit rather than return more money to shareholders.As lenders have become better at passing the exams, their payouts have improved. In 2015, for example, every American bank was cleared to declare a dividend. After failing twice, Citigroup last year was able to increase its own to 5 cents a share from a penny.The national economy is also healthier. Unemployment has halved since May 2009, when the first exam results were released. Then, the jobless figure was 9.4 percent. When stress-test outcomes were reported last year, unemployment was at 5.5 percent. It is now 4.7 percent.Even as conditions improve, however, the Fed is raising the bar. This year included situations worse than what the United States experienced during the 2008 crisis. That includes an even faster rise in unemployment, to 10 percent, and negative interest rates for short-term Treasury bonds.That might require more capital for a passing grade. As a group, banks had a common equity capital ratio of 8.4 percent, the Fed reported last week, exceeding the minimum requirement of 4.5 percent and last year\u2019s level of 7.6 percent. In this year\u2019s dire imagined situations, Citigroup\u2019s common Tier 1 equity ratio would fall to 9.2 percent and Goldman Sachs\u2019s to 8.4 percent. Considered another way, if JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital ratio tumbled to the 6.5 percent of last year\u2019s stress test, it would still have $90 billion.Most banks probably will be able to make payouts again this year, but not as much as might be suggested by the improved economic conditions. Britain\u2019s looming exit from the European Union adds another layer of caution. Bank shareholders may be expected to wait longer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mitsubishi Predicts $1.39 Billion Loss After Fuel Economy Fraud", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Mitsubishi Motors said Wednesday that it expected to incur a loss of 145 billion yen, or $1.39 billion, this year as it faces the fallout from a scandal over falsified fuel-economy ratings.The net loss, forecast for the fiscal year to March, would be Mitsubishi\u2019s first in eight years. The scandal prompted Mitsubishi to seek a $2.2 billion rescue from its fellow Japanese automaker Nissan Motor last month as it struggled with falling sales and the rising cost of compensating customers.The episode has already cost Mitsubishi a significant amount of independence. The carmaker gave up about one-third of the company in return for its financial lifeline, becoming part of a global automotive group centered on Nissan and Renault of France.In April, Mitsubishi admitted using unapproved mileage tests on cars it sells in Japan, which exaggerated the vehicles\u2019 stated fuel performance. The company said that it had been cheating on its mileage tests for a quarter-century and that all models in its domestic lineup were affected. Its chief executive has since stepped down.Mitsubishi said it planned to book \u00a5150 billion in one-time charges related to the manipulated fuel tests. The amount includes \u00a5100 billion in payments to Nissan, which sold the most affected models, a line of ultralight minicars, under its own brand in a joint venture with Mitsubishi.Mitsubishi will also compensate buyers directly and absorb the cost of lost tax breaks that its cars previously enjoyed because of their advertised fuel efficiency.Mitsubishi\u2019s admission was part of a series of cheating revelations in the automobile industry. Carmakers\u2019 reporting of fuel economy and pollution ratings is under especially close scrutiny after Volkswagen admitted last year that it had installed software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.Mitsubishi\u2019s cheating centered on the way engineers calculate what is known as running resistance, or the effect that tire friction and other factors have on fuel consumption under various driving conditions. Mitsubishi used test parameters that were not approved in Japan and that tended to flatter the cars\u2019 fuel-consumption ratings, in the most extreme cases by as much as 15 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump May Be Republican, but He\u2019s No Fiscal Hawk", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaAmong the many peculiarities of the 2016 election, this one ranks high: The presumptive Republican nominee has signaled that he would spend more, and make the deficit larger, than President Obama.You read that correctly.Republicans have devoted years to attacking Mr. Obama as a debt-expanding spendthrift, even as the deficit has declined by more than two-thirds as a share of the economy since 2009. Yet primary voters sidetracked those concerns in backing Donald J. Trump as their candidate to succeed him.The combined effect that Mr. Trump\u2019s spending and tax-cut commitments would have on the size of government and the volume of red ink confounds veterans of Republican policy debates.Mr. Trump has made cultural conservatism, not fiscal restraint, the leading edge of his campaign from the beginning.Yet Mr. Trump also relishes the opportunity to break the party\u2019s ideological mold, calling himself \u201cdifferent from most Republicans.\u201dThe outlines of his agenda \u2014 he has provided few specifics \u2014 prove it.Republicans typically try to offset Pentagon increases with proposed cuts elsewhere. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, for instance, calls curbing Medicare and Social Security expenditures vital to restoring fiscal responsibility.Even Mr. Obama has conceded the need for some curbs on benefits as part of a bipartisan \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on the budget.Not Mr. Trump. He opposes restricting benefits for Medicare and Social Security, which together represent roughly 40 percent of the budget.Mr. Trump also breaks with other Republicans by embracing large-scale spending on infrastructure, to create jobs and drive growth by modernizing roads, bridges and airports.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of major spending proposals isn\u2019t new. In 2009, he praised the economic stimulus bill that congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama enacted over fierce Republican opposition.Later, assailed by primary rivals for failing to provide details, he posted some familiar Republican health policy proposals on his website.And instead of tax increases, Mr. Trump proposes a gigantic cut in personal and business tax rates, which he maintains would stimulate so much economic growth that it wouldn\u2019t increase the deficit at all.In turn, higher deficits would increase spending for interest on the debt \u2014 the same debt Mr. Trump says he wants to reduce.All this flummoxes policy analysts long committed to reducing debt and deficits.As for Mr. Trump, she said, \u201cthe good thing that he\u2019s done is acknowledge the debt.\u201dAt the same time, \u201che\u2019s laid out policies that would push us in the wrong direction, make the situation worse,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas added. \u201cMuch, much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Macri took office six months ago after a period of market isolation under the previous administration. Argentina had been cut off from global markets after a $100 billion debt default in 2001 and a long legal battle with hedge fund creditors that was resolved this year.Argentina\u2019s government returned to global bond markets in April, after a 15-year hiatus, with an issuance of $16.5 billion. Several of the nation\u2019s provinces have been raising money on these bond markets in recent weeks.Havanna, which makes alfajores, a sweet biscuit snack, and runs more than 300 coffee shops in Argentina and across Latin America, sold 4.27 million shares \u2014 10 percent of the company \u2014 at 37 pesos per share, valuing it at around $114.7 million.Demand doubled the number of shares offered, so they were priced at the top of the marketed range.\u201cThere was so much demand for this stock,\u201d said Emilio Ilac, chief executive of Puente, a brokerage firm in Buenos Aires that managed Havanna\u2019s sale. \u201cThis is very encouraging not only for Havanna, but for other companies who want to go public.\u201dDespite the small size of the offering, 17 percent of orders came from abroad, Mr. Ilac said.While initial price offerings from Argentina have been sporadic in recent years, Havanna is predicted to lead a fresh wave in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.Already, Grupo Supervielle \u2014 the holding company for Banco Supervielle, a bank \u2014 raised $280 million last month in an initial public offering in both New York and Buenos Aires. But Havanna\u2019s offering was the first entirely local equity offering since the oil company Petrolera Pampa\u2019s in 2013.Mr. Macri\u2019s government is dealing with an overhaul of the economy, including efforts to bolster growth, rein in inflation and narrow the fiscal deficit. But if policy makers face serious setbacks, analysts say, this would suppress investor demand in Argentina.\u201cSustaining this incipient interest in Argentine assets from financial markets depends on how the macro-economy evolves,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, an economist at a consulting firm in Buenos Aires.An article on Tuesday about the initial public offering of Havanna, an Argentine confectioner and coffee shop chain, misstated the number of years ago that the last local initial public offering came to market in Argentina. It was nearly six years ago, not three. The error was repeated in the headline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Coming Independence Day", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCLACTON, England \u2014 It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. The original plan of Prime Minister David Cameron was to call a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, renegotiate new terms with the powers that be in Brussels and then use the machinery of government to persuade people to vote to remain.A source in Downing Street tells me that Mr. Cameron\u2019s circle was expecting the Remain campaign to be comfortably ahead by now. Yet, little more than a week before the referendum, the polls show that the two camps are neck and neck. Although the Leave campaign \u2014 of which I am a founding member \u2014 is still the underdog, there is a real chance that Britain will vote for independence from the European Union on June 23.What is going on? There is an honorable, decent case for Britain to stay in the union. The problem for the Remain camp is that no one has been making it.Throughout the campaign, the Remainers have highlighted \u201cexperts\u201d from bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Bank of England, which all think that Britain should stay. They talk of being \u201cshut out\u201d of the room where decisions are made in Brussels.These warnings sound like the neuroses of career politicians, not the concerns of the public, who see things very differently. Ordinary voters are weighing what is best for National Health Service hospitals and public services. By making the case from a political elite\u2019s perspective, the Remain campaign has alienated, even antagonized, voters.Instead of advancing arguments, Remainers have resorted to a campaign of exaggeration and intimidation. Vote to leave, they suggest, and food prices will rise. Farming will fold, science will suffer, financiers will flee. Trade will tumble, there will be a global recession. And World War III, apparently.Far from persuading people, these confected claims come across as hectoring and supercilious. The TV debates reflect this. The more audiences tune in and hear these threats, the more they come to think that the alternative \u2014 of democratic self-government \u2014 is not so bad, after all. The shift visible in audiences during these debates is a microcosm of what is happening nationwide.The success of the Leave campaign lies with its sunny optimism. No one better personifies this morning-in-Britain outlook than the member of Parliament and former mayor of London Boris Johnson. Euroskeptics were supposed to be out-of-date, reactionary nativists. Instead, with our proposal for an immigration system that ends discrimination against non-Europeans and our insistence on more global trade, we are the forward-looking internationalists.It is the Remain team that has ended up looking reactionary. The European Commission, which the Remainers defend, is the only European Union body that can propose laws, and it is unelected \u2014 an arrangement George III might have admired.The Remain campaign promotes an obsolete European project, a throwback to the 1950s when big regional trade blocs looked like the future, and size and scale seemed paramount in economics. In a world of globalized trade and localized power, the European Union \u2014 the world\u2019s only declining trading group \u2014 is being left behind. All its supporters can muster in its defense is the fear of change.As much as Mr. Obama is respected here, the British people know that no American president, Democrat or Republican, would ever agree to the United States\u2019 joining a political union that made Congress subservient to a Pan-American parliament in Bogota, or the Supreme Court secondary to a judiciary in Haiti. So why should we tolerate the equivalent?There is a way to go in this campaign, but America should prepare itself for the possibility that Britain could vote to leave the European Union. If we Britons do so, far from retreating into isolationism, we will be looking for greater links with the rest of the world and even closer ties with our oldest allies.Let\u2019s recognize this referendum for what it is. We\u2019re voting for reclaiming the principles of democratic self-determination on which the United States was founded. America celebrates its independence on July 4. In years to come, Britons may celebrate ours on June 23.Douglas Carswell is a member of Parliament for the U.K. Independence Party.Advertisement"}

But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.

It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis. It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund.

{"Headline": "Obama Fracking Rule Is Struck Down by Court", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byJudge Scott W. Skavdahl of Federal District Court in Wyoming ruled that the Interior Department lacked the authority from Congress to issue the regulation, and also noted that fracking was already subject to other regulations under state and federal law.The blocked rule would not have affected most fracking operations in the United States, since it would have applied only to fracking on federal lands. The vast majority of fracking in the United States \u2014 almost 90 percent \u2014 is done on state and private land and is governed by state and local regulations. The rule was unlikely to have stopped most new fracking on public lands, although oil and gas companies complained that it could have slowed operations by creating burdensome paperwork.And Judge Skavdahl\u2019s ruling is not the final word. While the regulation will be temporarily halted, the federal Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is also reviewing the rule. Obama administration officials characterized Judge Skavdahl\u2019s ruling as a delay, and said they were waiting for the decision by the appeals court.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that implementation of the rule continues to be delayed, because it prevents regulators from using 21st century standards to ensure that oil and gas operations are conducted safely and responsibly on public and tribal lands,\u201d the Interior Department said in a statement from the agency\u2019s spokeswoman, Jessica Kershaw.Nonetheless, the oil and gas industry and Republicans who have opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental regulations claimed a victory.\u201cToday\u2019s decision demonstrates B.L.M.\u2019s efforts are not needed and that states are \u2013 and have for over 60 years been \u2013 in the best position to safely regulate hydraulic fracturing,\u201d said Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which had sued the administration over the rule.The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said in a statement: \u201cHydraulic fracturing is one of the keys that has unlocked our nation\u2019s energy resurgence in oil and natural gas, making the United States the largest energy producer in the world, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and lowering energy prices for consumers. Yet the Obama administration has sought to regulate it out of existence. This is not only harmful for the economy and consumers, it\u2019s unlawful \u2014 as the court has just ruled.\u201dMr. Ryan added: \u201cOnly Congress can write laws. Agencies acting without authority from Congress is simply illegal.\u201dEnvironmentalists say they held out hope that the rule would be upheld by an appeals court.\u201cOur hope remains that the full 10th Circuit will continue its review of the case and uphold this rule,\u201d said Lena Moffitt, the director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign.\u201cWhile there is no way to ever make fracking safe, the oil and gas industry has repeatedly proven that it needs more standards to keep the public safe from the dangers of fossil fuels, not less,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Market Forecast: A Hazy Summer", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The art world traditionally descends on Europe in June, first for Art Basel, widely regarded as the essential fair for collectors, then on to London for the summer auctions.Here is a look at some of the events that are driving the art market this summer.For many serious collectors, particularly in a year without a Biennale in Venice, Art Basel and its various satellite fairs and events remain the main draw. The economics of art fairs are hard to quantify \u2014 Art Basel publishes attendance figures, but not sales results \u2014 but this year\u2019s edition, featuring 286 galleries from 33 countries, which previews on Tuesday, should give some sense of how dealers are being affected by the changed mood in the market. Year-on-year totals at last month\u2019s Impressionist and contemporary sales in New York were down by as much as 64 percent.\u201cThe previews I\u2019ve received from galleries have been different this year,\u201d said Heather Flow, an art adviser in New York. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing more historical material and very little by young artists.\u201dBut Ms. Flow and other art advisers said they saw little evidence that galleries were lowering prices for new works.\u201cThere\u2019s a growing rift between price and value,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, gallery prices are higher than the levels at which similar works are being flipped,\u201d meaning resales at auction.But a select group of living artists still remain hot. The New York dealer Jack Shainman, exhibiting in the main Art Basel area for the first time, will be showing a small 2016 painting by Kerry James Marshall of a male figure, \u201cUntitled (Looking Man)\u201d priced at $350,000. That number might seem imposing, but a larger 1992 work by Mr. Marshall \u2014 currently the subject of a solo show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago \u2014 sold for $2.2 million last month at Christie\u2019s.Another trend is an emphasis on artists\u2019 estates. The New York dealer James Cohan, one of 32 galleries in the Feature section, devoted to curated projects, is presenting a solo booth of 1960s works from the estate of the American conceptual artist Robert Smithson. These range in price from $45,000 for drawings to $750,000 for the 1965 mirror sculpture, \u201cFour-Sided Vortex.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s art world is confused about the canon,\u201d Mr. Cohan said, explaining the attraction of artists\u2019 estates. \u201cAn estate allows a collector to look at an artist\u2019s reputation and sees how it stacks up in the face of art history. It\u2019s not speculative, it\u2019s fresh to the market and leads to artists being reassessed.\u201d\u201cThe ups and downs of the market are event-driven by fairs,\u201d said Mr. Cohan. \u201cBut the environment is different now. Works need to be exceptional to gain the interest of the collector.\u201d\u201cIt was a factor, but it wasn\u2019t the whole story,\u201d said Jay Vincze, the head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie\u2019s in London, whose June 22 evening sale contains 36 lots with a total low estimate of 38.3 million pounds, about $56 million. The equivalent event last June raised \u00a371.5 million from 50 works.\u201cPotential currency fluctuation was a worry for overseas consignors,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people took a view that it just wasn\u2019t a good time to sell in the middle of this year.\u201dThe Christie\u2019s sale does contain a group of seven works by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky from a Swiss private collection, carrying a total minimum estimate of \u00a39 million.But such was the shortage of big-name lots that Christie\u2019s has included the 1991 canvas \u201cLes clowns musiciens, le saxophoniste\u201d by Bernard Buffet \u2014 an artist some dismiss as kitsch \u2014 valued at \u00a3700,000 to \u00a31.2 million.Sotheby\u2019s Impressionist and Modern sale on June 21 is even smaller, with just 28 lots. Nonetheless, the sale does include Picasso\u2019s \u201cFemme Assise,\u201d a museum quality 1909 early Cubist head-and-shoulders study of his lover Fernande Olivier, which had been bought by its anonymous seller in 1973.A Picasso Cubist painting of this importance hasn\u2019t appeared on the auction market for almost 20 years. With an estimate of \u00a330 million, and no guaranteed minimum price, both Sotheby\u2019s and the seller are clearly confident it will achieve a trophy price, regardless of wider uncertainties.The seller of Modigliani\u2019s languid 1919 three-quarter length portrait \u201cJeanne Hebuterne (au foulard),\u201d back on the market after being bought at auction in 1986, was rather less confident of success, and accepted a minimum price from Sotheby\u2019s of at least \u00a328 million.Christie\u2019s has, however, diverted some major contemporary works, such as Francis Bacon\u2019s 1968 \u201cVersion No. 2 of Lying Figure With Hypodermic Syringe,\u201d valued at \u00a320 million, into a sale on June 30, \u201cDefining British Art,\u201d to celebrate the auction house\u2019s 250th anniversary.By then, depending on what effect the referendum result has on the pound, international buyers could view British art like the Bacon as the best or the worst value in Europe.With art not quite the force it was in the market, luxury goods are becoming a growth area for international auction houses.\u201cLucara and Sotheby\u2019s have been very clever in this sale by offering the stone rough to the public,\u201d said Guy Burton, a director at the London jewelers Hancocks, who said that large uncut diamonds have hitherto been privately auctioned to the trade.\u201cNow there is the option to offer the stone as the largest diamond on earth,\u201d Mr. Burton said. \u201cThis could drive competition between experienced cutters and traders against collectors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money, Jobs and Sovereignty: Myth vs. Reality Ahead of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 British voters will go to the polls this month to decide whether their country should remain in the European Union. As the date, June 23, approaches, the \u201cleave\u201d and \u201cremain\u201d campaigns are dialing up the volume, with claims and counterclaims flying, many with only a tenuous relationship to facts.According to those who favor leaving the bloc, Britain is the victim of faceless, highly compensated bureaucrats in Brussels who meet in secret and churn out off-the-wall regulations costing businesses billions of pounds a year. They say British citizens are subjected to taxes and other measures by a supposedly unaccountable European Parliament, while Britain as a whole sends far more money each year to Brussels than it gets back. Above all, perhaps, they say Britain is virtually powerless to stop the influx of migrants \u2014 more than 300,000 arrived last year.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThose who support remaining in the bloc play down those issues, focusing on what a seemingly inexhaustible supply of government officials, economists, bankers and business executives call the dire consequences of leaving: a weakened currency, job losses, slower growth, depressed trade, the end of London\u2019s status as a world financial capital and a loss of influence in European affairs. Immigrants, just over half from European Union member states, give the economy energy, youth and creativity, they say, contributing to the economic vitality that makes multicultural London the envy of the world.Here are a few of the claims, and some judgments about their veracity: The \u201cLeave\u201d side says: Britain sends 350 million pounds a week to the European Union.That\u2019s about \u00a3190 million a week, a little more than half of what Vote Leave claims. It is roughly 0.5 percent of British gross domestic product and around 1.3 percent of the current British budget of about \u00a3770 billion._____The \u201cRemain\u201d side says: Three million jobs in Britain depend on membership in the European Union._____\u201cLeave\u201d says: Britain has lost 75 percent of the 131 cases brought against it before the European Court of Justice, and thus has lost a crucial element of sovereignty._____\u201cRemain\u201d says: A British exit would cost each household \u00a34,300 a year by 2030.It depends on your assumptions, but some loss of national income is inevitable.The figure cited represents an annual loss of gross domestic product per household after 15 years, estimating 6.2 percent lower growth nationally by 2030. But this does not translate to cash, and it is based on numerous assumptions.Still, every alternative the Treasury examined would reduce G.D.P., a position accepted by most economists._____\u201cLeave\u201d says: \u201cUncontrolled migration\u201d imposes \u201chuge unfunded pressures on the N.H.S. and on other public services,\u201d said Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, referring to the National Health Service.Pressures, absolutely. Unfunded, not exactly.An estimated 85 percent of non-British European Union citizens in Britain are economically active, contributing a net \u00a322 billion to the Treasury.But is immigration \u201cuncontrolled\u201d?Britons migrate to other European Union countries, too, especially retirees who can live more cheaply elsewhere and still get free medical benefits. About 300,000 Britons left the country last year \u2014 more than the 184,000 European Union citizens who moved to Britain. About one million Britons live in Spain, about 255,000 in Ireland and about 175,000 in FranceRapid population increases in some cities and towns across Britain have put pressure on hospitals, housing, schools and policing. Since the 2000s, the East Midlands and Northern England have experienced the biggest percentage increases in non-British-born populations.But immigrants also contribute substantially to the National Health Service, which relies on them to function._____\u201cRemain\u201d says: A British exit from the bloc would throw the country into recession and result in a loss of 500,000 jobs, lower wages and lower house prices. The cost of vacations would also go up by an average of \u00a3230, Prime Minister David Cameron says.Economists from both sides of the membership debate agree that there would be a short-term economic shock and slower growth. But estimates of how much vary, and the Treasury\u2019s numbers are considered a bit pessimistic, but generally correct.As for more-expensive vacations, Mr. Cameron points to the likelihood of a weaker pound, coupled with increased airfares and higher cellphone roaming charges. By 2018, he says, the cost for four people to take a nine-night vacation in Spain would be \u00a3225 more. For two weeks in the United States, it would be \u00a3620 more.Again, there are many assumptions. But those who favor remaining in the European Union hope that voters will take note of the specific figures, even if based on unprovable estimates and judgments about the future._____\u201cLeave\u201d says: The British economy is choking on a mass of regulations from Brussels._____ \u201cLeave\u201d says: Not only does the European Union rule on the curvature of bananas, it will not allow them to be sold in bunches larger than three, Mr. Johnson said.There is no rule on how, or how many, bananas may be sold.Mr. Johnson has also said that after leaving the union, \u201cU.K. asparagus will be just as sprouting, just as delicious, in fact even better!\u201dAdvertisement"}

There may be special meaning for Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, after 156 years of rule from London.Yet, could a shrunken economy and greater political isolation, possible outcomes if Britain withdrew from the European Union, also cause Britain\u2019s voice in Hong Kong affairs to slip?In the Joint Declaration, China agreed that Hong Kong would retain a high degree of autonomy and its capitalist financial and legal systems for 50 years. \u201cThe current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the lifestyle,\u201d the Joint Declaration says.\u201cBecause of the Joint Declaration, the British government has a legitimate interest in Hong Kong; for example, in its democratic development,\u201d Mr. Chan said.The Joint Declaration was the basis of the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-Constitution, which promised Hong Kong \u201cgradual and orderly progress\u201d toward greater democracy, though in vague terms.So while China can \u2014 and does \u2014 tell the United States not to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s internal affairs, a common Chinese complaint against nations that press for greater human rights in China, \u201cit cannot tell the British,\u201d Mr. Chan said.\u201cMuch depends on how committed is the U.K. to upholding the Joint Declaration, and how fast it can move and hard it can work to pressurize Beijing,\u201d Mr. Ho said in an interview.\u201cNow I don\u2019t think the U.K. has in the past been working very hard, in the sense that it would be very strongly committed to upholding the Joint Declaration, even at the expense of its relationship with China,\u201d he said.\u201cI always think the British always put its economic interest with China above its obligation\u201d to Hong Kong, he said.\u201cThe Chinese-British \u2018Golden Age\u2019 won\u2019t change because of Britain leaving the European Union,\u201d the commentary said, referring to the close ties that Prime Minister David Cameron has built with China, but it warned: \u201cAt the same time, the voices defaming Chinese-British relations are stirring, ready to make trouble.\u201dEither way, Mr. Ho doubts Britain\u2019s commitment to protecting Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.\u201cAfter all, they are just making comments in the Parliament,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cNothing more, no actual measures, including exercising diplomatic pressure on China.\u201d\u201cWhereas the U.S. can always flex its muscles in readjusting the trade relationship with Hong Kong,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cthe U.K. has no such instrument nor is it committed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, David Cameron Faces Problem of His Own Making", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 David Cameron, the British prime minister, has no one to blame but himself.In 2013, besieged by the increasingly assertive anti-European Union wing of his own Conservative Party, Mr. Cameron made a promise intended to keep a short-term peace among the Tories before the 2015 general election: If re-elected, he would hold an in-or-out referendum on continued British membership in the bloc.But what seemed then like a relatively low-risk ploy to deal with a short-term political problem has metastasized into an issue that could badly damage Britain\u2019s economy, influence the country\u2019s direction for generations \u2014 and determine Mr. Cameron\u2019s political fate.As the nation prepares to vote on Thursday, the betting markets are signaling that Britain will choose to remain in Europe, but polls suggest that the outcome is still too close to call.On Tuesday, speaking in front of No. 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron warned that a decision to leave would be an \u201cirreversible\u201d choice. Appealing to older voters, many of whom tend to favor leaving Europe, Mr. Cameron urged them to think about what they would bequeath to the next generation.\u201cAbove all it is about our economy,\u201d he said.The bluff, ruddy Mr. Cameron is famously lucky, having pulled out last-minute victories in numerous other scrapes. But in this case, many analysts say, he will be damaged goods even if he wins, with rivals circling to succeed him and Conservatives more divided than ever.If he loses, he will come under pressure to resign, and even if he hangs on for some portion of the four years left in his government\u2019s term, whatever substantive legacy he might have built will be lost to what many consider to be a wholly unnecessary roll of the dice.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut if the Scottish referendum turned nasty, and kept the United Kingdom together, this one has become poisonous, with Mr. Cameron\u2019s own cabinet colleagues and supposed friends saying that he has eroded trust in politics, portraying him as a liar and acting like a government in waiting. It has been a campaign punctuated by numerous claims that have little relationship to the facts, with sharp tones of xenophobia, racism, nativism and Islamophobia. And it was marked tragically last Thursday by the assassination of a young Labour member of Parliament, Jo Cox, who fiercely supported remaining in the union.On Tuesday evening, some of that bitterness surfaced in a fiery television debate in which London\u2019s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, who wants Britain to remain in the bloc, said that the campaign of his opponents \u201chasn\u2019t been project fear, it\u2019s been project hate as far as immigration is concerned.\u201dThe prime minister presumably thought it would be an easy win for the \u201cRemain\u201d forces, Mr. Fielding added. \u201cBut it\u2019s far tighter than anyone thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand rather than a salve on the Tory party, it\u2019s made the fever worse.\u201dIf the Remain campaign loses, \u201cthe chances of him staying on are pretty remote,\u201d Professor Bale said. \u201cHe will go down as the person who miscalculated, taking us out of Europe almost by mistake, and then shuffled off the stage\u201d in \u201ca pretty ignominious exit.\u201dEven if Britain votes to stay in the bloc, Mr. Bale said, given Mr. Cameron\u2019s small parliamentary majority, \u201cthe number of hard-line euroskeptics and Cameron-haters, he\u2019ll be subject to defeats and blackmail until he steps down.\u201dThere are those who support the contention that Mr. Cameron had to call this referendum in the face of Tory division and the rise of the U.K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage. UKIP was cutting into the Conservative vote by arguing, as the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign does now, that Britain could limit immigration and control its own borders only by leaving the European Union.Even before the election, some, like Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House and a supporter of the Remain movement, argued that a referendum would come at some point, and that it would be more easily won under Mr. Cameron and the Tories.Charles Lewington, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, said there had to be a referendum. By 2013, he said, \u201cthere was tremendous pressure for an in-out referendum and not just from the old guard.\u201dMr. Lewington cited growing concern from Conservative members of Parliament that they were at risk of losing their seats in districts where UKIP was strong. Given the panic in the party, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he could have avoided making an in-out manifesto commitment.\u201dNicholas Soames, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, a friend of Mr. Cameron\u2019s and a Tory legislator, was more scathing about the failure of several Conservative leaders to confront, rather than appease, the hard-line Tory euroskeptics.\u201cSuccessive prime ministers, and it\u2019s not the present prime minister alone, have never understood that they have to take these people on,\u201d Mr. Soames said.If the Remain side loses, both Mr. Cameron and his deputy, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, are likely to be gone within months, Mr. Lewington said.While all denying any ambition to replace Mr. Cameron, the sharks are in the water, led by Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a prominent campaigner for leaving the European Union. But the winner of such contests in the Tory party is rarely the one who wields the knife, and while Mr. Johnson would seem to lead the race, his success is far from assured.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Economic Sickness, Five Diagnoses", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewEconomists, like physicians, sometimes confront a patient with an obvious problem but no obvious diagnosis. That is precisely the situation we face right now.Let\u2019s start with the problem.There is no simple way to gauge an economy\u2019s health. But if you had to choose just one statistic, it would be gross domestic product. Real G.D.P. measures the total income produced within an economy, adjusted for the overall level of prices.Here is the sad fact: Over the last decade, the growth rate of real G.D.P. per person has averaged just 0.44 percent per year, compared with the historical norm of 2.0 percent. At a rate of 2.0 percent, incomes double every 35 years. At a rate of 0.44 percent, it takes about 160 years to double.It may be tempting to blame the Great Recession of 2008-9 for the paltry 10-year growth rate. Indeed, this recession was a deep one.Yet the explanation for the poor long-run performance is not that simple. The recession of 1982 was also a deep one. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 percent in 1982, compared with a peak of 10 percent in 2009. But by the first quarter of 1989, as Ronald Reagan was leaving the White House, the 10-year growth rate was up to 2.1 percent.The difference: The 1982 recession was followed by a robust recovery, whereas the recession of 2008-9 has been followed by a meager one.So what\u2019s wrong with the economy? No one knows for sure. But numerous theories are being bandied about. Here are five of them:During the recent crisis, many feared another Great Depression would follow. We averted that catastrophe, but the anxiety may linger, causing businesses to be reluctant to borrow to finance risky investments and banks reluctant to finance them. The good news is that hangovers eventually dissipate, but patience is required.His solution? More government spending on infrastructure, like roads, bridges and airports. If the government takes advantage of lower interest rates to make the right investments in public capital \u2014 admittedly a big if \u2014 the policy would promote employment in the short run as projects are being built and make the economy more productive when they are put into use.This theory is the most pessimistic. If he\u2019s right, we may have little choice but to get used to slower growth.So there they are. One sickness, five diagnoses. Unfortunately, I have no idea which one is right. The truth may well involve a bit of each.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}

Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued strongly that trade agreements have been unfairly tilted against American workers.In March, the United States put a tariff of 266 percent on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost. And last month, in separate actions, the Commerce Department announced duties of 450 percent and 522 percent on some imports of Chinese steel.Referring to the excess capacity, Mr. Lew said on Sunday, \u201cChina\u2019s capacity to address that is central to China\u2019s economy, to the global economy and to the U.S.-China relationship.\u201dIn recent months, he noted, China has sometimes acted to strengthen the value of the renminbi, making imports into China more attractive, rather than weakening the currency. More recently, the yuan has weakened against the dollar to levels not seen in five years.The strategic dialogue began nearly 10 years ago in George W. Bush\u2019s administration as an effort for the United States and China to set an agenda for the most important issues and find a path to solving them. In 2009, it grew from an economic focus to include security issues. The meeting has evolved into a set of talks involving hundreds of officials meeting over several days to discuss issues as diverse as civilian aviation and the protection of elephants, as well as the big economic and security matters.But with Mr. Xi concentrating more power in his own hands, the usefulness of such a wide-ranging exercise may have outrun itself, some Americans said. Mr. Xi opened the dialogue with a speech, and his closest economic adviser, Liu He, met with Mr. Lew on Sunday.With the Obama administration in its final lap and a leadership transition looming in China next year, it is unlikely that this year\u2019s dialogue will result in any breakthroughs, said Eswar S. Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\u201cWhile the dialogue will include many top-level Chinese technocrats, there is a widespread perception that their influence on economic policies and reforms has been circumscribed by the rising concentration of power in the hands of President Xi and a close circle of his aides,\u201d he said.The new American president \u2014 whether Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 would be unlikely to continue the annual talks in such a broad manner, Professor Prasad said. Top officials on both sides probably view the dialogue this year \u201cas their last waltz together,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the participation of the Chinese delegation in the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing this week.

Trump barware is made in Slovenia, instead of Toledo.\u201dLiving up to her newfound reputation as Trump slayer-in-chief, Ms. Warren roused the crowd with stinging criticism of the Manhattan businessman. But she also appeared cautious not to overshadow her party\u2019s presumptive nominee, looking back at Mrs. Clinton occasionally as she spoke, as if in deference to an elder.\u201cDonald Trump says he\u2019ll make America great again,\u201d Ms. Warren said, calling his slogan \u201cgoofy,\u201d a take on Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite insult for the Massachusetts senator. \u201cI ask, for who exactly? For families that don\u2019t fly to Scotland to play golf?\u201dIn response, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign called Ms. Warren a \u201csellout\u201d for supporting Mrs. Clinton, pointing to the presumptive Democratic nominee\u2019s Wall Street donors. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Trump called Ms. Warren a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201ca total fraud.\u201dMany in the crowd viewed the joint event as a practice run for what could transpire should Mrs. Clinton select Ms. Warren as her running mate.While an all-female ticket is unlikely, James Hamilton, the Washington lawyer leading Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential search, has begun vetting Ms. Warren and other candidates. Ever since she endorsed Mrs. Clinton this month, Ms. Warren has been a powerful surrogate, attacking Mr. Trump in spades and visiting the Clinton campaign\u2019s headquarters in Brooklyn to encourage young staff members with a simple message: \u201cDon\u2019t screw this up!\u201dIf Ms. Warren\u2019s liberal policy positions could make it difficult for her to get a place on a ticket, on Monday she and Mrs. Clinton seemed to have little daylight between them as they each vowed to restructure the American economy to help the middle class.In an address that spoke to the \u201cfrustration, the fear, the anxiety and, yes, the anger\u201d over an economy in which the wealthiest Americans have thrived as middle-class wages have remained virtually stagnant, Mrs. Clinton hit the same themes that elevated Ms. Warren in the Senate and fueled the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the hard-fought Democratic nominating contest.In a season defined by anger over globalization and economic inequality, Mrs. Clinton firmly declared that \u201cthis is not a time for half measures\u201d as she laid out her wide-ranging plan to lift wages and create jobs.In Ohio, a battleground state, Mrs. Clinton delivered a promise to strengthen labor unions, close loopholes that give tax breaks to corporations for moving jobs overseas, raise the minimum wage and make college affordable.\u201cWhy do the richest Americans and biggest corporations get away with manipulating the tax code so they pay lower rates than you do?\u201d Mrs. Clinton asked to boos from the crowd.With Mr. Sanders not yet ready to campaign for his primary opponent (while acknowledging he would vote for her to defeat Mr. Trump), Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rally with Ms. Warren could help her continue to win over the liberal voters who had flocked to Mr. Sanders\u2019s message.Some 45 percent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters now have a positive view of Mrs. Clinton, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll.Both Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Warren seemed to relish criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s response to Britain\u2019s momentous decision on Thursday to leave the European Union, which has jolted global financial markets and caused the British pound to tumble to its lowest level since 1985.On a trip to visit his Turnberry golf course in Scotland last week, Mr. Trump declared Thursday\u2019s vote \u201ca great thing\u201d and drew parallels between the rise of populist anger in Britain and voters\u2019 sentiments in the United States. \u201cBasically, they took their country back,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that a cheaper British pound would help his golf course business.\u201cDonald Trump cheered on Britain\u2019s current crisis, which has sucked millions of dollars out of your retirement accounts, because, he said, it might bring more rich people to his new golf course,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Look Ahead at the Next Recession", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhat did we learn from the Great Recession? With economic growth creeping ahead at a glacial pace and another cyclical downturn looming not far in the future, questions about how to stimulate growth and protect the most vulnerable loom large on the list of priorities.The question is not just about how to reignite growth after the next downturn. Another very important question is about how to protect the most vulnerable when the next recession hits. The experience of the last one suggests our social safety net needs some redesigning. Too many disenfranchised people were left without assistance. The programs that we have missed too many.One of the most profound mistakes, I think, was Congress shifting toward austerity and producing a set of manufactured crises that hurt the economy. If you look at the combination of sequestration and the government shutdown, you are looking at likely over a million jobs lost as a result.At a time where the politics to do what we did in the aftermath of the Great Recession are arguably even harder, the automatic stabilization that can be provided in the safety net is even more important.The odds are better than 50-50 that we will have a recession within the next few years. What does the Fed normally do when that happens? The Fed normally cuts real interest rates by five percentage points. Is it conceivable that there is going to be room to do that, even maybe allowing for Q.E. [quantitative easing], even recognizing that maybe rates could become negative 50 basis points? I submit that it\u2019s not.So, changes in the fiscal monetary mix are essential. They are the only tools available when the next recession comes, and I would submit that they are desirable right now.What are the crucial elements of changing the fiscal monetary mix? One is a substantial increase in public investment. It is insane that federal investment in infrastructure is now net negative at a moment when interest rates have never been lower. And precious little is happening at the state and local level, either.Second, strong support for social insurance. When Keynes came to the United States in 1942, he pointed out that an important virtue of Social Security was that it could absorb the excess savings that would potentially hold back U.S. economic growth after the Second World War. Those considerations were not relevant in the succeeding 60 years, but they potentially are relevant in our current period of secular stagnation. Note that an expansion of pay-as-you-go Social Security does not raise the annual budget deficit, but in every economic model contributes to raising aggregate demand by enabling households to look forward to more secure retirements.Third, there is a strong case for doing what we can to promote housing investment. We are managing the cycle in the worst way possible from the point of view of housing. We got all of the lower-middle-income and poor people into their own houses when the price was going up and was a bubble. Then when the price plummeted, they all sold to private equity firms who rented the houses out at a 10 percent yield and earned tremendous capital gains. This is exactly the wrong moment for support for housing to be at a minimum rather than a maximum.Fourth, related to my first point, this is the moment to be maintaining the infrastructure we have. The one thing we know \u2014 if you look at airports, if you look at highways, if you look at the water system of Flint, Michigan \u2014 it is much more costly to defer maintenance than it is to do maintenance promptly. It is every bit as much a burden on my children\u2019s generation to defer maintenance as it is to issue paper debt, and I promise you that the costs compound far more rapidly with deferred maintenance than they do with the 13 basis points that represent the real interest costs of current long-term federal debt.The most important determinant of our long-term fiscal picture is how successful we are at accelerating the economy\u2019s growth rate in the next three to five years, not the austerity measures that we implement. People concerned with our long-term fiscal health should be redoubling their focus on the currently inadequate growth rate.I believe passionately in more infrastructure investment, but the concerns that government doesn\u2019t do it so well are not stupid concerns. There is a bridge right outside my office. It connects Harvard Square with Boston. The bridge is 232 feet long. It has been under repair, with traffic blocked, for four and one-half years. It took 11 months to build the bridge the first time.You\u2019re not going to get a commitment to a public sector-led fiscal policy strategy without also having a strategy that is about private sector activity and private sector investment.The basic truth is that giving people benefits does influence their behavior. There are a large number of people in our society \u2014 little children, people who are 75 years old, people who are disabled \u2014 who aren\u2019t going to work no matter what. Then there is what you can prudently afford to give to people where there are going to be large incentive effects. So there are a variety of incremental reforms that would broaden eligibility for various existing programs that I would support, but the universal basic income is one of those ideas that the longer you look at it, the less enthusiastic you become.Literally over decades you are seeing improvements of a third to a half in lifetime earnings from things like housing vouchers or others. If you think of the costs of someone not working, if you think of all the attendant health care, criminal justice and other impacts, the truth is that these investments may actually pay for themselves multiple times over.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Connecticut Tribe Fights for Recognition, and a Piece of the Casino Industry", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byIn Connecticut, two Indian tribes, the Mohegans and the Mashantucket Pequots, years ago built shiny monuments to American capitalism in the form of their casinos, which have made them extraordinarily wealthy.Then there are the Schaghticokes. They would also like a piece of the lucrative casino industry. Instead, the tribe owns three modest houses on 400 acres of tribal land that almost cannot be built upon because it slopes so steeply, along the state\u2019s western edge.The contrast in the tribes\u2019 fortunes underscores a phenomenon in the world of contemporary Native American politics: the sharp divisions that prevail between the tribes that have grasped the brass ring of federal recognition and the resulting largess, and those, like the Schaghticokes, that have fallen short.Richard L. Velky, the chief of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, likes to point out that \u201cConnecticut\u201d means \u201clong tribal river.\u201d The name, he says, is both apt and ironic \u2014 apt because of the prolonged, relentless campaign the tribe has waged for federal recognition; ironic because the state, which recognized the tribe in 1736, has thwarted that effort at every turn.Now Connecticut is exploring the possibility of opening a third casino, to compete with one planned across the border in Springfield, Mass. And once again, the state is working to keep the Schaghticokes (pronounced SCAT-uh-cokes) out of the action, granting only the Mohegans and Pequots the right to pursue another casino \u2014 even though this one, in the Hartford area, would not be on an Indian reservation.\u201cWe\u2019ve been here 300 years,\u201d Mr. Velky said in an interview at the tribal offices in Derby, Conn. \u201cWhether Connecticut likes it or not, we are one of the state\u2019s first families, and we will continue to be.\u201dThe Schaghticoke tribe\u2019s plight dates back to the early 1800s, when the state began selling off its land to pay for the members\u2019 health care; the original 2,500 acres soon fell by half. But the current travails extend back to the 1980s, when Connecticut embraced casino gambling as a way to rejuvenate its economy.By the time the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation finally won federal recognition in 2004, Connecticut officials had decided that two casinos were enough. The state appealed the federal recognition, with M. Jodi Rell, the governor at the time, and Richard Blumenthal, then the state attorney general, urging the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reconsider. They argued that the Schaghticokes\u2019 application did not show high enough intra-tribal marriage rates in the 1800s to prove social and political continuity.On Capitol Hill, congressional hearings were convened. Finally, on Columbus Day in 2005 \u2014 a bitter coincidence for Mr. Velky \u2014 the Bureau of Indian Affairs rescinded the tribe\u2019s recognition.Nevertheless, the next year, Aurene Martin, the former acting assistant secretary of Indian Affairs, vouched for the Schaghticoke application under oath.The tribe\u2019s recognition petition was \u201camong the best and most thoroughly researched petitions ever reviewed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,\u201d she said, in a declaration that the Schaghticokes used in a lawsuit challenging the revocation.One of the state officials who was intent on thwarting the Schaghticokes was Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic and Independent senator. Today his law firm is representing the tribe in its continuing quest for recognition and an entryway into the gambling business.In an interview, Mr. Lieberman explained that in the mid-2000s there was growing resistance to casino gambling and that officials thought a third casino could cannibalize the existing two.\u201cThere was a popular response also that Connecticut was changing as a result of the two casinos and the brakes should be put on before other tribes were recognized and new casinos established,\u201d he said.The town of Kent, where the tribe has its 400 acres, was particularly anxious, given that the tribal lands overlapped with the Kent School, an exclusive private boarding school; Connecticut Light & Power; and the Preston Mountain Club.Federal recognition would allow the Schaghticokes to bring land claims against the private property owners. In recent years, the tribe has tried to reclaim its land in court, but to no avail.Now that the climate for casinos has changed, Mr. Lieberman believes that continued opposition to the Schaghticokes is unfair.\u201cWe are at a very different time,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, Connecticut is not worried about more casinos in the state. The concern is about competition for the two existing casinos from the new casino\u201d in western Massachusetts.Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Velky are especially angry about a special act passed by the General Assembly, designating the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans as the sole authorized parties to pursue a third casino. The tribe has filed a lawsuit challenging the legislation, arguing that since a third casino would be strictly commercial in nature \u2014 since it would be off tribal land \u2014 then any commercial entity should be granted the right to bid.Mr. Lieberman called the favoritism shown to the Mohegans and Pequots \u201cunfair and unjust in general, but particularly to the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, as a Native American tribe recognized by the State of Connecticut for centuries.\u201dDenise Merrill, the Connecticut secretary of state, said the application had been accepted in error. In an interview with a local television station, she said \u201c99.99 percent of the time, our only job is to say, yes, you have a name, address and an agent for process, you\u2019re a business.\u201dBut, in an analogy that made the tribe bristle, Ms. Merrill added: \u201cWe do not record anything about the purpose of that business. To give you an example, if someone said we\u2019re in the business of robbing banks, we wouldn\u2019t have even recorded that.\u201dState officials point out that the special act did not provide approval of a third casino, but simply gave the two tribes the right to propose a project. The tribes say they are zeroing in on a location for a casino, which would need final approval from the legislature and the governor\u2019s office.The Schaghticokes\u2019 fortunes appeared to improve last year, after the Bureau of Indian Affairs set out to streamline the process of federal recognition, which would have allowed the tribe to reapply and, many believed, succeed. But after another vociferous campaign by state officials, including most forcefully by Mr. Blumenthal, now a Democratic United States Senator, the bureau, in the end, inserted language saying that any tribe that had previously been denied recognition could not reapply.\u201cThe Schaghticoke Tribal Nation was already denied federal recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and should not have two bites at the apple,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an email.Asked about the Schaghticokes, a spokeswoman for Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said simply, \u201cWe oppose recognition and we\u2019re confident they do not meet the criteria for recognition.\u201dComplicating matters for the Schaghticokes is the fact that a smaller splinter group, the Schaghticoke Indian Tribe, submitted its own application for federal recognition. Because this is the first time the tribe is applying, it is not subject to the same restrictions as the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation.Beginning in the 1600s, European settlers first described the Schaghticoke tribe as inhabiting lands in northwestern Connecticut. The tribe, then with 500 to 600 members, moved with the seasons across the Housatonic Valley, setting up villages and smaller camps where they hunted, fished and made brooms and tin crafts.After the Schaghticoke reservation was established by the state in the early 1700s, however, the tribe began to struggle. In the 19th century, after the state had appointed a series of overseers, much of the tribe\u2019s land was sold off. From 1925 to 1972, Connecticut intensified a \u201cpolicy of detribalization and termination, making it extremely difficult\u201d for members to live and gather on the reservation, according to the tribe\u2019s website. Today, the tribe\u2019s remaining 300 members are scattered across a few counties.Whether or not Connecticut eventually gives its blessing to a third casino, the Schaghticokes will keep pushing for recognition.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad when you say you have to prove your existence,\u201d Mr. Velky said. \u201cWe had to go back 300 years to prove our first encounter with Europeans. It\u2019s not easy when you have an overseer, who is the state, who is overseeing you and fighting against you at the same time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spirit Airlines Wants to Stay Cheap but Not So Tawdry", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byItinerariesIt\u2019s the airline that had unabashedly advertised its product as a \u201ccheap seat for a cheap-ass.\u201dBut now, under new leadership and in the face of increased competition from larger, more mature airlines, Spirit Airlines is ready to shake off its bad-boy streak and grow up a little.Spirit, based in South Florida, has been known for its cheap flights and no-frills passenger experience, as well as its unconventional, and often sexually provocative, marketing campaigns over the last few years.You get what you pay for, was the Spirit spirit. And for everything else, you pay extra. The airline led the way in charging travelers extra fees to check a bag or even carry on a bag, or to do much of anything besides sitting in the cramped cheap seats. Spirit has also become a pacesetter in other traveler-unfriendly categories, routinely achieving the industry\u2019s highest rate of consumer complaints and worst on-time performance.But the new chief executive, Robert Fornaro, six months into his job, says he is ready to put a new face on Spirit and a new emphasis on customer service. The makeover also includes toning down the frat-boy image, cleaning up the cabins and maybe even getting more of the planes to arrive on time.Last week Mr. Fornaro was in New York trying to sell his strategy to investors, analysts and reporters.\u201cThere is a big change in terms of focusing on our operations,\u201d Mr. Fornaro said in an interview. \u201cThis is how we want to be viewed: on time, friendly, clean and efficient.\u201dThe question is whether Mr. Fornaro, a longtime industry executive, can improve the airline\u2019s operations and reputation while maintaining the ultralow fares.The growth came despite the array of extra fees beyond the basic ticket price.Need to store a carry-on in the overhead compartment? That\u2019ll be $35 upfront when you book your flight, or $100 if you wait until you\u2019re lined up at the gate.When the beverage cart rolls down the aisle, a can of soda will set you back $3.Spirit flies from all but three of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States \u2014 Sacramento, Charlotte and St. Louis \u2014 and plans to announce service in additional, still undisclosed, midsize markets later this year. It also flies to locations in the Caribbean and Central America, including the Dominican Republic, the United States Virgin Islands, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.Only about 2 percent of domestic passengers flew on Spirit planes last year \u2014 compared with 17 percent on Delta, 13 percent on American Airlines and 10 percent on United, according to the Department of Transportation. But it costs the larger carriers at least 14 cents to fly each passenger one mile, while Spirit\u2019s costs are only half that passenger-mile rate.\u201cThat basic economy fare can be competitive with the ultra low-cost guys,\u201d said Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cAs a leisure customer, if I can fly Delta for the same price as Spirit, and Delta has the better on-time ratings, why wouldn\u2019t I fly Delta?\u201dThe answer might depend on where a traveler is trying to go.Based on fares recently offered on Spirit\u2019s website for a long weekend in Chicago, flying from New York\u2019s La Guardia Airport on Friday evening, July 15, and returning the following Monday morning, a flier would pay $211. But add a carry-on bag, and the price goes up to $281. The comparable United ticket, which includes a carry-on at no extra charge, is not significantly higher: $314 on the United website.But flying that same weekend from La Guardia to Myrtle Beach, S.C., and back would make Spirit look like a much better bet. The ticket would be $161, or $231 with a carry-on. The next cheapest round-trip fare to Myrtle Beach is offered by American Airlines, and it costs a lot more \u2014 $432 \u2014 and includes a layover in Charlotte, according to American\u2019s website.Mr. Fornaro, who led the budget carrier AirTran Airlines until its merger with Southwest Airlines in 2010, argues that he can improve on-time and complaint ratings without incurring higher costs.By paying to improve operations, he said, the airline would cut down on expenses in other areas, like fees it incurs when it has to reimburse passengers for canceled flights. It would also cut down on overtime needed to pay staff who work longer hours because of delays.\u201cIf we run a better operation, we\u2019ll have lower recovery costs,\u201d Mr. Fornaro said.His predecessor, Mr. Baldanza, who led the company for a decade, was so focused on costs that he resorted to what he called \u201cshock marketing.\u201dThe email and web campaigns were cheap to produce but attracted major media attention for their unconventional, sometimes raunchy tone.In 2013, for example, Spirit announced a \u201cWeiner sale\u201d during reports that Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York had engaged in lewd online behavior. The campaign, featured on Spirit\u2019s website and in emails, contained a photo of a hot dog and offered $9 fares \u201ctoo HARD to resist.\u201d\u201cThose days are gone,\u201d Mr. Fornaro said. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to see a lot of quirky, edgy advertising, but I don\u2019t see any benefit of poking the customer in the eye.\u201cMr. Fornaro also said the key to decreasing customer complaints would be to reduce surprises for first-time Spirit fliers.About two-thirds of Spirit\u2019s passengers book their tickets directly through the company\u2019s website, so they tend to already be aware of the various extra fees, he said. It\u2019s the other one-third of customers, who book their flights through third-party sites, who are often surprised when they arrive at the airport to find that they\u2019ll be charged for extras.Spirit has started sending emails to some of its third-party customers to explain the fee structure and offer 24 hours to cancel. That kind of outreach could become even more important as the company expands to more markets this year.\u201cThey have a big problem: Many people try Spirit because they\u2019re attracted to the low fare, but then they don\u2019t come back,\u201d said Julie Yates, an airline analyst at Credit Suisse. \u201cBob is softening the overall approach to be more friendly. Over time, that should help them retain more customers.\u201dUntil then, let the flier beware.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Macroeconomics of Brexit: Motivated Reasoning?", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still on vacation, but had some time to catch up today, and felt an urge to scratch an itch I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been feeling. You see, much of the discussion of Brexit and its impacts bothers me. I believe that Brexit is a tragic development, which will do substantial long-run economic harm. But what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing overwhelmingly from economists is the claim that it will also have severe short-run adverse impacts. And that claim seems dubious.Or maybe more to the point, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a claim that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow in any clear way from standard macroeconomics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being presented as if it does. And I worry that what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is a case of motivated reasoning, which could end up damaging economists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 credibility.OK, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start at the beginning. Brexit will almost certainly have an adverse effect on British trade; even if the UK ends up with a Norway-type agreement with the EU, the loss of guaranteed access to the EU market will affect firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions about investments, and inhibit trade flows.This reduction in trade relative to what would otherwise happen will, in turn, make the British economy less productive and poorer than it would otherwise have been. It takes fairly heroic assumptions to make this into a specific number, but 2-3 percent lower income in perpetuity seems plausible.So far, so good, or rather so bad: this is standard economics, basically Ricardo with a dash of new trade theory. But what about warnings that Brexit will precipitate a British recession, or at least a drastic slowdown in the short run? Where are those coming from?The trade arguments are about the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply side: less trade means lower productivity and hence lower productive capacity. But the kind of recession we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about here is a demand-side phenomenon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a slump brought on by inadequate spending. And why, exactly, is that supposed to happen?As best I can tell, the case for a UK recession or at least slowdown rests on two not entirely distinct propositions: the idea that uncertainty will deter investment and possibly consumption, and the idea that an increase in perceived risks will worsen financial conditions. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take these on in turn.But in that case we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying that bad things will happen because firms will perceive an increased probability of bad things happening. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either circular reasoning, assuming one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion, or both.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also note that any major policy change creates uncertainty, because nobody knows how it will work out. So why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we hear recession warnings when countries are contemplating major trade liberalization, or privatization schemes, or labor market reforms? The \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty depresses investment\u00e2\u0080\u009d argument seems to be rolled out selectively, only deployed against policies economists dislike for other reasons.Meanwhile, what about the argument that Brexit will worsen financial conditions, increasing risk spreads? Well, this seems to me to be another circular argument \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claiming that bad things will happen because investors will expect bad things to happen.In other words, the arguments for big short-run damage from Brexit look quite weak. An economist who tried to make similar arguments for or against most policies would face a lot of criticism. But in this case we have a near-consensus accepting these weak arguments. Why?My suspicion is that the same thing is happening here. Economists have very good reasons to believe that Brexit will do bad things in the long run, but are strongly tempted to sex up their arguments by making very dubious claims about the short run. And the fact that so many respectable people are making these dubious claims makes them seem well-reasoned when they aren\u2019t.Unfortunately, that sort of thing, aside from being inherently a bad practice, can all too easily backfire. Indeed, the rebound in British stocks, which are now above pre-Brexit levels, is already causing some backlash against conventional economists and their Chicken Little warnings.Sorry, people, sloppy thinking is always a vice, no matter what cause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used for.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Will Markets Recover From \u2018Brexit\u2019? Clues From Past Crises", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byStrategiesOne day, perhaps three or four months from now, they are likely to look even better, until the next crisis comes.Those statements are not based on visions of the future. I subscribe to the view that while history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, it rhymes.And in this case, history provides some limited reassurance. Barring a severe global recession, which doesn\u2019t seem imminent, stock market drops of this magnitude generally reverse themselves within three or four months. That\u2019s because big, quick declines embody reflexive panic \u2014 urgent desires to cut losses before the larger meaning of a market shock has been digested. Sometimes there are quick recoveries \u2014 as we saw after the initial declines after the so-called Brexit vote \u2014 which are followed by further losses until the markets find equilibrium.In the United States, on Aug. 1, 2011, when Congress could not reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 3 percent, partly rebounded, then fell 14 percent by Oct. 3. It recovered within three months.Finally, on March 27, 2012, the European debt crisis forced Spain into budget austerity, setting off labor strikes and driving the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 3 percent in one day, and a total of 11 percent. The recovery time? Again, a mere three months.\u201cIt is important for long-term investors to note that in each of these instances, stocks rebounded to their pre-shock level in three or four months,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said, \u201ceven when a recession took place.\u201dThat said, neither Japan nor Europe nor the United States is in wonderful economic shape right now. Japan and Europe have endured severe market and economic downturns after these market shocks. The United States economy has grown very slowly and could be threatened by the shock waves emanating from Europe.It is also worth noting that the post-2009 period is too brief to conclude much about the long-term performance of the markets. There has been a tenacious bull market in stocks in the United States since then, fueled in part by central bank policy that has engineered ultralow interest rates. The market has been running out of steam.That is why a deeper dive provides a useful perspective.First, from a market standpoint, the Brexit crisis so far hasn\u2019t caused much damage. In the history of the S.&P. 500, for example, the decline on June 24, which came to 3.6 percent, was inconsequential when measured as a percentage of the index\u2019s total value. Using that measure, the decline ranked as only the 180th-largest since 1928, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.What distinguished the early phase of this crisis, statistically, is that the markets were so poorly positioned in advance of the British vote. It was almost as though they were moving full speed in one direction and had to turn around and sprint the other way.Paul T. Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, brought this to my attention. Using a technical indicator \u2014 the 50-day moving average of the S.&P. 500 \u2014 he found that stocks were \u201coverbought\u201d before the vote, meaning that traders had pushed prices well above recent levels. That would probably have been fine if a majority of voters had called for Britain to stay in the European Union.But that upward momentum before the Brexit vote set up a nasty market downturn. The combination of an overbought market immediately before an extremely oversold one was so unusual, he said, that \u201cextraordinary may be an understatement. Using that overbought-oversold measure, the two-day price reversal was the biggest since 1928.\u201dOnly two episodes came close.One was in October 1989, when the failure of a leveraged buyout of United Airlines devastated the junk bond market. The S.&P. 500 fell 6.5 percent over two days. (That compares with a 5.3 percent decline in the two days after the Brexit vote.) There was a partial recovery and another downturn, but in less than three months the market returned to its old level.That example is comforting; the second is not: It occurred during World War II, when Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands and began to overrun France. On May 10, 1940, Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister of Britain, and Winston Churchill replaced him.Worldwide markets were grossly unprepared for what came next. Over two days, the S.&P. 500 in the United States declined 8.3 percent. And over the next two years, the war deepened, millions died and as an incidental casualty, the stock market declined another 33 percent. It took more than three years for the S.&P. 500 to return to its former level.In early 1940, historical stock data would not have helped much in forecasting market returns for the rest of the year. Much bigger factors than 50-day moving averages determined the course of events.If only by comparison, today\u2019s problems seem manageable and easily understood. Events in Europe are still unfolding. But the preponderance of data strongly suggests that the markets will settle down in days, weeks or months, not years.Other crises are sure to follow in this election year. We don\u2019t know what lurks beneath the surface of moving events and won\u2019t find out until the smoke clears.

{"Headline": "Venezuela Casts a Long Shadow on Elections in Spain", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byMemo From SpainMADRID \u2014 Europe is facing a migration crisis, the threat of Islamic terrorism and the prospect that Britain will exit the European Union. But the big foreign policy issue before Spain\u2019s national elections next Sunday? Venezuela, of course.Candidates have visited Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to grandstand. Spain\u2019s governing conservative party has met in Madrid with opponents of Venezuela\u2019s leftist government. There have been charges of a virtual Venezuelan infiltration of Spain\u2019s politics.The shadow cast by Venezuela has been so long that its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, recently invited Spain\u2019s politicians to hold their election debate in Caracas \u201cso that I can also participate, and perhaps I will win the elections in Spain.\u201dThe leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, fired back in a televised debate that his opponents were ignoring the issues that could really affect Spain, starting with a possible British exit from the European Union.Podemos may be poised to do just that. After recently forming an alliance with a radical party, United Left, it could now leapfrog over the Socialists into second place, behind the conservative Popular Party of the caretaker prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, according to recent opinion polls. Such an outcome would overturn the two-party political order that has prevailed since Spain\u2019s return to democracy in the late 1970s.Given the troubles in Greece, which is negotiating yet another international bailout, opponents of Podemos have made much of the connection to Syriza. But it is the link to the former Ch\u00e1vez government that has been a special focus.A handful of Podemos leaders \u2014 including Mr. Iglesias, Juan Carlos Monedero and I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n \u2014 once used their academic credentials as political scientists to work as advisers to the government of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013. They also did advisory work in Bolivia and Ecuador, while studying how far-left politics could reshape Latin American nations.Opponents of Podemos have attacked the party over its finances and possible links to foreign governments, particularly Venezuela. Such accusations have been rejected by Podemos, which has instead built part of its campaign on denouncing the corruption of established parties financed by construction kickbacks.Before Podemos entered the Spanish political scene, Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Errej\u00f3n sat on the board of a Spanish research institute financed by the Venezuelan government.In April 2015, Mr. Monedero resigned from the leadership of Podemos amid ideological differences, but also after he had to pay 200,000 euros (about $227,000 under the current exchange rate) in back taxes and fines for receiving \u20ac425,000 as payment for consulting with the Ch\u00e1vez government in 2010 to develop plans for a new regional currency.Mr. Monedero and other Podemos leaders were never charged with wrongdoing. However, during the recent televised debate, Mr. Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, repeated previous allegations that Podemos had relied on Venezuela\u2019s money.\u201cIt is immoral that a foreign regime finances a party,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. A visibly angry Mr. Iglesias responded that it was a \u201cvery serious\u201d offense to accuse his party of illegal financing, particularly since it was an issue that had been already cleared by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court.Mr. Rivera has recently issued the strongest statements over Venezuela during the Spanish election campaign, taking over from Mr. Rajoy, who last month convened his security council to review the safety of the 200,000 Spaniards living under the state of emergency in Venezuela.With the help of Spain\u2019s conservative establishment, the Venezuelan opposition has also made its presence felt in Spain, led by Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a Venezuelan politician who was jailed in February 2014.This month, Ms. Tintori, a former television presenter, gave public speeches in Salamanca and Madrid, hosted by the Popular Party as well as a conservative newspaper, La Raz\u00f3n.\u201cTwo years and three months ago, we came to Spain and other countries and nobody paid attention to us,\u201d she said before an audience that included three ministers from Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, as well as Mr. Rivera.Even as Podemos has distanced itself from Venezuela, it has not joined other parties in condemning Mr. Maduro\u2019s policies. This month, the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the release of Mr. L\u00f3pez and other political prisoners in Venezuela.The lawmakers of Podemos abstained, while those of its ally, the United Left party, voted against the resolution, arguing that it was designed to further destabilize Venezuela.Podemos is making \u201ceconomic proposals clearly similar to those of Venezuela,\u201d Francisco de la Torre D\u00edaz, an economic adviser to Ciudadanos, said.Among those proposals, he said, is \u201cthe idea that it would be worth getting out of the euro.\u201d He also mentioned that Podemos advocates a \u201cmassive increase in public spending,\u201d as well as a plan to nationalize some strategic corporations.Mr. Iglesias has denied having any plan to drop the euro, dismissing warnings by Mr. Rivera and others as fallacious scaremongering.Podemos has gradually watered down its demands for an economic overhaul. Its latest party program seeks an increase in public spending of \u20ac60 billion, less than its previous proposal of \u20ac96 billion.Despite this, some conservative associations have recently been formed to help prevent Podemos from turning Spain into the next Venezuela.\u201cWe want to denounce the situation in Venezuela and warn about what could happen in Spain,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Redondo, the president of an association called Let Us Save Democracy, which was formed in Madrid last year.\u201cWe want Venezuelans to share their experience with Spaniards,\u201d he said, \u201cso as to make voters here, particularly the young, wake up and realize that all the terrible things happening there are now happening here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is perhaps best known for its monthly oil market reports that are eagerly awaited by traders.Mr. Birol, an economist, argues that pressing concerns about climate change and the emergence of countries like China and India as major energy consumers and polluters mean that the agency needs to shift its strategy.\u201cTo stay relevant,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday, we \u201cneed to work much closer with new emerging energy economies.\u201dMr. Birol has been working to build bridges with China in particular, which energy experts say is crucial to the success of global efforts to reduce emissions.\u201cTo solve today\u2019s biggest energy problems, the I.E.A. needs to have the world\u2019s most important energy players as part of it,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Environmental issues, Mr. Birol said, are very important to emerging economies like India and China, whose cities are often plagued by choking smog.Helping these countries solve problems through increasing energy efficiency or filtering out pollutants can make progress on climate change goals. We need to make these countries \u201cunderstand that their problems are our problems,\u201d Mr. Birol said.Mr. Birol appears to be well-suited to this approach. Born in Turkey, he obtained his doctorate in energy economics in Vienna and began his career as an analyst at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil producers\u2019 group, often seen as having an agenda rivaling the agency\u2019s.Mr. Birol said that through relatively low-cost actions, like adopting more ambitious clean air standards and more effective policies for monitoring and enforcement, countries could make major strides in reducing pollution over the next quarter-century.China, for instance, needs to retire polluting coal-fired power plants and to establish stricter standards for motor vehicles.Such changes could produce big benefits. In India, the proportion of the population exposed to a high concentration of fine particles, a type of pollution, would fall to below 20 percent in 2040, from 60 percent today. In China, it would drop to below one quarter, from well over one half.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regardless of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Experts Say, E.U. Must Rethink Status Quo", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Among the well-heeled bureaucrats of the European Union, it is an article of faith that the bloc always emerges stronger from a crisis. The idealistic founders who six decades ago dreamed of stitching warring nations into a peaceful whole knew the path would be bumpy. But always, the union wobbled forward.Now the dream of an integrated and ever-stronger Europe could sink into the English Channel on Thursday, when British voters decide whether to abandon the bloc. To the pro-Europe establishment, this latest crisis is considered a peculiarly British affair, in which the villains are opportunistic politicians steering voters toward a delusional, self-inflicted mistake.That may be. But if Britain does leave, the European Union can also blame its own handling of the crises of the past decade \u2014 the tribulations of the euro, the debt standoff with Greece and a flawed approach to migration. Each time, the bloc rammed through ugly, short-term fixes that only inflamed the angry nationalism now spreading across the Continent and Britain.The result was almost a decade of ad hoc crisis management that even many admirers agree has left the European Union badly wounded and its reputation badly damaged. Idealism has given way to disillusionment. The bloc\u2019s elite technocrats are often perceived as out of touch, while European institutions are not fully equipped to address problems like unemployment and economic stagnation. Political solidarity is dissolving into regional divisions of east and west, north and south.The economic implications of a British exit, the so-called Brexit, are potentially staggering, but many experts agree that regardless of how the British vote, politics across Europe must change. The structure of the euro currency zone is still considered fragile. The bloc\u2019s German-dominated economic policy has meant nearly a decade lost in much of debt-ridden southern Europe, which is still struggling to recover from its economic crisis.\u201cWe cannot continue with the status quo,\u201d said Enrico Letta, a former Italian prime minister. \u201cWe have to move forward.\u201d\u201cIt is not very easy being English at the moment,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London. \u201cGrim stuff.\u201dMr. Tilford falls into an interesting camp: He has long been an outspoken critic of the European Union\u2019s handling of its currency woes, yet he strongly supports Britain\u2019s remaining in the bloc. The benefits far outweigh the disadvantages, he argues, even as he realizes that policy failures by the European Union have helped legitimize the arguments of some who want to leave.\u201cIt has made it easier for them to portray the E.U. as a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people have become euroskeptics in Britain because they are so angry at what has happened in the eurozone in recent years.\u201dDuring the 1990s, Britain was already a member of the European Union and was considering whether to drop its currency, the pound, and join the zone of countries adopting the bloc\u2019s new currency, the euro. (Today, 19 of the 28 countries in the European Union share the euro.)But a crisis in the financial markets in 1992 effectively settled the matter as Britain decided not to join other countries changing to the euro.Those skeptical of using a common currency to drive closer integration in Europe have always argued that joining the euro system would limit policy flexibility, such as the ability to devalue the national currency during economic downturns or use deficit spending to encourage growth. And they said problems would inevitably arise because of the stark economic differences among the countries sharing the currency.Each proved true. The economic crisis in 2007-2008 plunged the bloc into a cycle of crises from which it still has not recovered. The disparities among eurozone countries were exposed, and to save the currency, northern countries led by Germany bailed out their desperate southern counterparts.The eurozone became divided between debtors and creditors rather than equal partners.The German-led solution of austerity economics inflicted heavy punishment on countries like Greece. And Britain, outside the euro, recovered more quickly from the 2008 crisis than did most members of the currency group.The politics also shifted: Germany, the bloc\u2019s economic powerhouse, steadily accrued more political power inside European Union institutions. Resentment gradually followed, especially in Greece, the weakest and most indebted member of the eurozone.Populist anger erupted in January 2015 when Greek voters swept aside the country\u2019s political establishment and elected as prime minister a radical leftist, Alexis Tsipras.Mr. Tsipras promised to end austerity, write down Greek debt and change Europe by leading a clash of ideas against the German-led consensus.It was political theater, and the Greeks would badly misplay their hand. But what followed was a clash of cultures, not ideas: Union officials refused to budge on Greece\u2019s debt obligations, and after months of negotiation and brinkmanship, Greece nearly collapsed into bankruptcy before acceding to demands from Brussels.The Greek standoff was a demonstration not just of European Union power politics, but also of the bloc\u2019s penchant for muddling through. The bloc agreed on a new bailout package for Greece that most analysts regard as a stopgap solution. Greece\u2019s debt is now higher than before, and analysts warn that another euro crisis could still occur.\u201cThere is a lot of criticism of the German way of handling the eurozone,\u201d said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe Program for the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cThat bleeds into the perception that the European Union is not functioning properly.\u201dIt is this perceived ineffectiveness of mainstream political parties at the European and national levels that has emboldened populist or anti-establishment parties from the left and the right.Last year, far-right parties seized on the migration crisis \u2014 with its images of hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring through Europe \u2014 to provoke public anxiety. Led by Hungary, some countries began erecting fences to block migrants despite the European Union system of open borders.European leaders struggled to mount a coherent response, and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s popularity plummeted after she opened Germany to Syrian refugees. She has since tightened restrictions and championed a controversial deal with Turkey that has sharply reduced the migrant flow into the Continent.In the British referendum, anti-immigrant forces have sought to drive support for the campaign to leave the union by depicting the Continent as being under invasion from migrants.A campaign poster unveiled last week by Nigel Farage, the U.K. Independence Party leader, showed a parade of brown-skinned migrants. It was pilloried as blatant xenophobia. But it is little different from the propaganda of far-right politicians in Hungary or Poland.Should it remain in the bloc, Britain could emerge as a powerful force, with more clout to force the changes that most analysts believe are necessary.Even among top officials, there is a growing recognition that Europe\u2019s political mainstream has misjudged the public appetite for rapid European integration.\u201cThe specter of a breakup is haunting Europe,\u201d warned Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of the bloc\u2019s members. \u201cWe need to understand the necessity of the historical moment.\u201dIt is easy to forget that the European Union is an audacious political experiment to wash away the antagonisms of World War II and build a new Europe. Unity required putting aside the ancient rivalry between France and Germany, and binding together countries with different languages, cultures and economies.Generations growing up between the 1980s and the 2000s saw how an expanding Europe brought tangible benefits \u2014 borderless travel, job and educational mobility within the bloc, rising prosperity. Poorly governed countries came under pressure from Brussels to improve. But as the bloc expanded, decision-making also became more unwieldy. Frictions inevitably arose, and old resentments between member states were never fully scrubbed away. Tensions also increased between European institutions and national governments over sovereignty.This has meant little political space for the deep reforms \u2014 and possible further integration of political powers \u2014 that some advocates say are needed in Brussels. Many analysts say that even if Britain remains in the bloc, the likelihood of the union\u2019s undertaking significant political reforms is slim until after the national elections in France and Germany in 2017. Doing something bold in Brussels before then could spur an electoral backlash.So the European Union will wait to see what Britain does, and then, possibly, wait some more.He added, \u201cWhat has happened to you, Europe, the mother of peoples and nations, the mother of great men and women who upheld, and even sacrificed their lives for, the dignity of their brothers and sisters?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Britain would \u201ctake back control\u201d of immigration, reducing the number of arrivals. And it would be able to spend about 350 million pounds, or about $470 million, a week more on health care instead of sending the money to Brussels.Before Thursday\u2019s referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the 28-nation bloc, campaigners for British withdrawal, known as Brexit, tossed out promises of a better future while dismissing concerns raised by a host of scholars and experts as \u201cProject Fear.\u201dBut that was before they won.Promises to quickly reduce immigration levels are also being played down. Migration was the cornerstone of the Leave campaign, which objected to the European Union\u2019s insistence on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. Since 2004, when 10 more countries joined the European Union, large numbers of eastern and southern Europeans have moved to Britain for work.Mr. Johnson argued that it was impossible for the government to reduce immigration while in the European Union. His ally Michael Gove, the justice secretary, said a leave vote would \u201cbring down the numbers\u201d by 2020. Experts have long said that would be very hard to pull off. The European Union has demanded from nonmember states \u2014 Norway, for example \u2014 free movement of workers in exchange for access to the bloc\u2019s single market.On Friday, the day after the referendum, Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament and one of the most knowledgeable advocates of Brexit, stunned some viewers of the BBC by saying: \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E.U., they are going to be disappointed.\u201dHaving now ousted Prime Minister David Cameron, they face a political vacuum, with their base demanding that promises be kept. Mr. Johnson, the front-runner to replace Mr. Cameron, has not made any further pronouncements since a subdued statement on Friday that was restricted to generalities.

{"Headline": "Drawing Lessons From the Scottish Referendum as E.U. Vote Nears", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 The Scottish referendum of September 2014 was notable for its bitterness and nastiness, especially on social media.Douglas Alexander was one of the victims of this massive swing. A national figure as the Labour Party\u2019s shadow foreign secretary and the manager of Ed Miliband\u2019s doomed campaign for prime minister, Mr. Alexander lost his seat in his hometown, Paisley, to the youngest person elected to Parliament in centuries, Mhairi Black, then 20.And he has some lessons from the Scottish experience to impart.So it will be vital to manage the news cycle in the last 10 days, to shape the anxieties and aspirations of voters. In Scotland, opponents of independence focused on the economic risks and the inability of the \u201cyes\u201d side to answer crucial questions about currency and the sustainability of the oil-based economy.\u201cCost versus control,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.But \u201cyou also need a movement, not just an argument,\u201d since for voters, \u201cemotion matters as much as facts,\u201d he said.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe Remain side must speak to British patriotism and the benefits of the European Union, not just spout statistics. It is quite possible, as he understood at some point during the Scottish campaign, \u201cto win the argument but lose the audience.\u201d\u201cIt needs to be a conversation within the country about the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a conversation on the Eurostar. You need to give people emotional permission to accept the evidence,\u201d so sincerity matters more than any choice of words.While social media can be ugly and even painful, it is vital \u201cto get people to voluntarily share information with their contacts and friends.\u201d Information garnered that way is \u201cmore credible,\u201d because it comes from someone a voter has already decided to follow and trust.In the Scottish vote, Mr. Alexander said, \u201csocial media and Facebook mattered more than the print media.\u201dLastly, Mr. Alexander warns that anger and bitterness last long after the vote.\u201cReferendums have an afterlife,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will not settle it for a generation,\u201d contrary to what Prime Minister David Cameron has said, any more than the Scottish referendum has settled the issue of independence.Voters politicized on such a vital issue don\u2019t go back to sleep, much as newlyweds buy bridal magazines a year after the wedding, Mr. Alexander noted.\u201cThe experience remains in the mind and in the memory,\u201d he said.For this referendum, unlike in Scotland, has been driven by a decades-long split in the Conservative Party; underneath, it is also a battle for party leadership and ultimately for 10 Downing Street.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toxic Fish in Vietnam Idle a Local Industry and Challenge the State", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byNHAN TRACH, Vietnam \u2014 Since a devastating fish kill blighted the waters along 120 miles of coastline in central Vietnam, hundreds of people are believed to have fallen ill from eating poisoned fish.Here in the fishing village of Nhan Trach, the squid that sustain the local economy have virtually disappeared. And a fishing ban has left hundreds of traps sitting unused on the beach and dozens of small fishing boats idle.\u201cWe are so angry,\u201d said Pham Thi Phi, 65, who operates a fishing boat in Nhan Trach with her husband and three grown sons. \u201cIf we knew who put the poison in the ocean, we would like to kill them. We really need to have an answer from the government on whether the ocean is totally clean and the fish are safe to eat.\u201dBut two months after the fish started washing up on beaches here, the government has yet to announce the cause of the disaster or identify the toxin that killed marine life and poisoned coastal residents.The government\u2019s failure to respond and its previous support for the Taiwan-owned steel plant at the heart of the crisis have fueled widespread suspicion of corruption and the hidden influence of foreign interests at the expense of Vietnamese livelihoods, a potent mix that challenges the legitimacy of Communist Party rule.\u201cQuite simply, in Vietnam, human life is less important than the political life of the government and government institutions,\u201d said Nguyen Thi Bich Nga, an activist in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cIn this way, we can explain all that is unusual in this country.\u201dThe government has said little about the marine die-off while cracking down on the protests, which have been called every Sunday since May 1, when thousands of people took to the streets of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and other cities. More than 500 people have been arrested, and demonstrators have been beaten by the police.\u201cThe response by the government has been one of ineptitude,\u201d said Carlyle Thayer, a Vietnam analyst at the Australian Defense Force Academy. He said the fish kill was the most serious environmental issue to confront the government in several years and reflected poorly on the government of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who took office in April.But the protests have continued.On Sunday, more than 1,000 people turned out in a coastal district of Nghe An Province, north of the steel plant, to demonstrate. Many wore T-shirts bearing a fish skeleton. Some carried signs reading, \u201cFish need clean water, citizens need transparency.\u201d\u201cIt seems the government tries to cover up for the culprit,\u201d the Rev. Anthony Nam, a Catholic priest and protest leader in Nghe An, said by telephone. \u201cWe will protest until the government says what caused the spill.\u201dIn Nhan Trach, about 40 miles south of the steel factory, the dead and dying fish first appeared in early April, floating in the surf and washing up on the beach. Initially, it seemed like a windfall, and many people here ate and sold them. The fish kept coming, tons of them, day after day for more than a month, residents said.\u201cSome of the fish were dead; some were dying,\u201d said Ho Huu Sia, 67, who buys and dries fish for a living. \u201cWe ate the fish that were still alive. We ate the fish for two weeks.\u201dHis daughter, Ho Thi Dao, 32, said she became ill, experiencing vomiting, diarrhea and dizziness. She went to the local clinic and received intravenous fluids. She said she met others there who also suffered poisoning.Belatedly, the government announced that aquatic life had been poisoned along the coastline of four provinces. The authorities warned people not to eat fish and ordered a halt to fishing.As compensation, officials distributed bags of rice and gave fishermen 50,000 dong, or about $2.20.\u201cWe are just sitting with tears running down our cheeks looking out at the ocean,\u201d said Ms. Phi, who has been fishing from Nhan Trach all her life. \u201cWhat can we do with 50,000 dong?\u201dCoastal residents and journalists quickly accused the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel plant, which opened in December, of being the culprit.According to news reports, the fish kill happened after the factory washed unspecified cleaning chemicals through its wastewater pipeline. A company representative seemed to confirm the suspicions in April when he said it would not be surprising if the factory\u2019s wastewater harmed marine life.\u201cYou have to decide whether to catch fish and shrimp or to build a modern steel industry,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cEven if you are the prime minister, you cannot choose both.\u201dHis comments incited a flurry of criticism on social media and spawned a popular hashtag on social media, #ichoosefish.The company later argued that it met Vietnam\u2019s environmental standards and said that the spokesman had been fired.Company officials did not respond to requests for comment.The government has been just as reticent.At first, it suggested a toxic algae bloom was responsible. In mid-May, Pham Cong Tac, deputy science and technology minister, told Vietnamese news outlets that the ministry had a \u201cconvincing scientific basis\u201d to explain the fish deaths, but he did not disclose what it was.Last week, Mai Tien Dung, minister and head of the government office, said that the authorities had identified the cause but indicated that they could not tell the public because an investigation was continuing.The lack of information has only fueled the protesters\u2019 anger.Villagers say the authorities collected water samples immediately after the episode, and foreign experts say test results should have been known within days.Nguyen Hoang Anh, a university professor in Hanoi, said the government should have immediately revealed the toxin, especially to the poisoning victims and their doctors.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not ethical. It\u2019s a crime.\u201dShe said the cover-up had the potential to make the fish kill Vietnam\u2019s Chernobyl, the 1986 nuclear disaster that contributed to the unraveling of the Soviet Union.That is what the government most fears, analysts say, and it is why it acts quickly and at times brutally to suppress protests before they ignite a popular uprising.But critics say the government has another motive. The government has supported the steel plant, giving the company a sweetheart deal, including tax incentives and a bargain price for the property, to build on the coast.Two years ago, while the factory was under construction, it became a prime target of the riots over China\u2019s placement of an oil rig in waters off Vietnam in the South China Sea. More than 200 factories owned by Chinese and other foreign companies were looted and set ablaze around the country.But the worst rioting occurred at Formosa, where four people were killed. The company is based in Taiwan, but thousands of laborers from mainland China were building the factory. Protesters stopped buses, pulled off Chinese passengers and beat them.The authorities have been more careful not to let the current protests get out of hand. But even if they can be quelled, the economic costs have continued to mount.On a recent morning, more than a dozen fish traders gathered at a drink shop across from the beach here. A few played board games. There was nothing to do but kill time, one said.Around the corner, Phan Dinh Son, 49, sat in his all-too-quiet open-air shop. He used to sell hundreds of blocks of ice a day. Now he sells about 20, he said. A separate business buying and trading shellfish has been suspended because no one wants to eat local fish.\u201cThe fish market is empty,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope the government and the party would come up with a solution and give a clear answer so we can do our business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharp Fall in U.S. Hiring Saps Chance of Fed Rate Increase in June", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byThe latest snapshot suggested that the economic recovery might have stalled this spring, at least temporarily.Despite the anemic job gains, the official unemployment rate, (which is based on a separate survey of households), fell to 4.7 percent, its lowest point in nearly a decade. But the decline was primarily a result of Americans dropping out of the labor force rather than finding new jobs.\u201cBoy, this is ugly,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. \u201cThe losses were deeper and more broad-based than we expected, and with the downward revision to previous months, it puts the Fed back on pause.\u201d\u201cThe only good news is that wages held,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. Average hourly earnings rose again, 0.2 percent for the month, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the last 12 months, an encouraging sign that many more working Americans are finally beginning to enjoy some benefits from a tighter labor market.In close presidential races, the economy\u2019s direction in the months leading to the November election has often played an important role in influencing voters, with credit or blame going to the party that occupies the White House. This is hardly a typical presidential race, though, and Friday\u2019s report is only one indicator of the economy.Still, after revving up over the last two years, the nation\u2019s job engine appears to have sputtered, with the Labor Department shrinking its initial estimates of March and April\u2019s employment totals by 59,000. The average monthly gain for the last three months was 116,000 jobs.While subject to further revision as well, May\u2019s figures were the lowest monthly growth since September 2010.Even apart from that distortion, the average monthly job gains so far in 2016 have fallen far shy of the nearly 240,000 average of the last two years, a pace that has helped buoy the economy and cut the jobless figure in half since the depths of the recession.Given the uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve is now likely to put off any decision to raise interest rates at its next meeting in mid-June and probably avoid lifting rates at its July meeting as well.Ms. Brainard said the weak job growth was a reminder that the strength of the recovery should not be taken for granted, and she said she did not see clear evidence the economy had rebounded from a weak winter.\u201cRecent economic developments have been mixed, and important downside risks remain,\u201d Ms. Brainard, who has pushed for the Fed to move slowly in raising interest rates, said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. \u201cIn this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a benefit to waiting for additional data.\u201dAfter the Friday report, investors wrote off the chances of a June rate increase. The probability, as suggested by asset prices, fell to 6 percent from 21 percent in early trading, according to the CME Group. The probability of a rate rise by September fell from about two-thirds, but it remained about 50/50 either way.Since the recession, the case for college seems as if it has changed considerably. But has it?Unless there are further signs of fresh economic weakness, however, most economists expect at least one rate increase before the end of the year. The unemployment rate, which the Fed regards as an important indicator, has finally dropped to where it was before the recession began in late 2007. And first-time claims for unemployment insurance have remained at low levels not seen since the 1970s.On the other side of the ledger, the labor force participation rate declined for the second consecutive month, to 62.6 percent, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons rose sharply.\u201cTo be clear, there is no evidence the economy is slowing into recession,\u201d said Steve Blitz, chief economist of M Science, a research firm.\u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance that the degree of a candidate\u2019s personal unfavorability could be more important than the economy.\u201dAs for the economy\u2019s impact, Mr. Mann said changes in personal income, which are on the rise, tend to sway voters at the margins more than the jobless rate or the pace of job creation.Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, has closely aligned herself with President Obama\u2019s economic policies and record-long streak of job gains. Worries about the economy are a more common refrain among supporters of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, as well as among those who are backing Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s last-ditch bid to lead the Democratic ticket.Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, acknowledged that the jobs report was disappointing. But he said: \u201cThe closer you get to the summit of full employment, the more trade-offs there will be between somewhat slower job growth and rising wages, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re beginning to see here in this recovery.\u201dHe, too, continues to be disturbed by the persistently low labor participation rate.Retiring baby boomers would be expected to bring down the proportion of the population in the labor market. But Patrick O\u2019Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, pointed to the significant decline among those in their prime working ages as well. Because so many discouraged job seekers have dropped out of the work force, he said, the relatively low official jobless rate is not capturing the true magnitude of the economy\u2019s underlying weakness.\u201cIn policy making, the Fed continues to focus on a measure that is maladjusted,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Keefe said.A broader measure of unemployment that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one stayed steady at 9.7 percent.The heaviest job losses in May were in the construction, manufacturing and mining industries.Not everyone has seen a softening. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago recruiter, said: \u201cIn a weak economy, what usually gets cut first and usually gets put on hold first are jobs at the manager to director level \u2014 those earning between $75,000 and $125,000 \u2014 and I haven\u2019t seen that yet. \u201dPayroll growth was disappointing, said Jeremy Schwartz, an associate in global strategy and economics at Credit Suisse, but it was also consistent with a tightening labor market.

{"Headline": "The Indelible Stain of Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byThe Republican Party\u2019s politically lethal embrace of Donald J. Trump is very nearly complete.In endorsing Mr. Trump earlier this month, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, stipulated that while he and Mr. Trump have their differences, \u201cwe have more common ground than disagreement.\u201d A President Trump, he argued, will help turn the agenda of the Republican House of Representatives into laws.In a recent interview, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said that whether or not Mr. Trump believes in limited government, \u201che\u2019s not going to change the Republican Party,\u201d adding that \u201che\u2019s not going to change the basic philosophy of the party.\u201dBoth Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell are capable and impressive; Donald Trump is just about the last person they were hoping would be their party\u2019s presidential nominee. But he is, and Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell are expressing the hope of Republicans who have been wary of Mr. Trump: that somehow, deep down, he embraces the principles of the pre-Trump Republican Party. Or that even if he doesn\u2019t, he can be cajoled or pressured into adopting them. Either way, the damage that Mr. Trump threatens to do to the Republican Party can be contained. The argument is that even if you don\u2019t particularly like or trust Mr. Trump, he will not redefine the Republican Party.But he already has. Donald Trump, the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, is waging an open attack on what have long been the party\u2019s core views.For at least three decades Republican politics have been defined by the centrality of conservatism in the party\u2019s governing philosophy. Modern conservatism has three elements: a commitment to limited government and economic liberty that enables prosperity; moral traditionalism that conserves our capacity for liberty by producing responsible citizens; and a belief that America, confidently and carefully engaged in international affairs, can be a force for good in the world.Mr. Trump rejects all three.Over the course of his nearly 70 years, and this primary campaign is no exception, Mr. Trump has shown no real desire to limit the size, cost or reach of the federal government. He has no interest in economic liberty as it has been understood since Adam Smith. He wants an economy in which trade and immigration are tightly restricted and the government makes mercantilist deals on behalf of large domestic producers.Mr. Trump is the very embodiment of the culture of narcissism and decadence that moral traditionalism exists to counteract. Republicans used to argue that character mattered in our political leaders. But apparently that applied only to Democrats like Bill Clinton. Today, we\u2019re told such considerations are irrelevant, inapposite, quaint. We\u2019re electing a president rather than a pope, after all, so there\u2019s no problem wrapping Republican arms around a moral wreck. At least he\u2019s our moral wreck.The hypocrisy isn\u2019t lost on anyone.And Mr. Trump wants America to further retreat from world affairs. He believes the United States is too weak to shape events. Rather than reach out to allies, he wants to bludgeon many of them, even as he has shown a disturbing affinity for tyrants. Mr. Trump also wants Americans to think about global affairs in terms of financial transactions that net America money rather than relationships that promote security, freedom and order \u2014 and therefore advance American interests.Why, then, are Republican leaders and lawmakers unifying behind a man whose views they find offensive? For some, like Mr. Ryan, it is an effort to use his influence to pull Mr. Trump in a more conservative direction. For others, it is simple party loyalty. For still others, it is fear of opposing a winner, the most powerful figure in the Republican Party. And of course many Republicans find Mr. Trump distasteful but believe he would be a better president than Hillary Clinton.This is not the conservatism of William F. Buckley Jr. or Ronald Reagan or Jack Kemp; it is blood-and-soil conservatism primarily aimed at alienated white voters who believe they have lost the country they once knew. Trumpism also includes a heavy dose of conspiracy theories. It is no coincidence that Mr. Trump burst onto the national political scene in 2011 by claiming that Barack Obama, our first black president, was not a natural-born American citizen but rather was born in Kenya.Mr. Trump knows his target audience, which explains why, beginning the morning of the Indiana primary on May 3 (the day he became the de facto nominee), he has \u2014 among other in-the-gutter moments \u2014 implied that Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father was implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy; insinuated that Vince Foster, a friend of the Clintons who was White House deputy counsel, was murdered (five official investigations determined that Mr. Foster committed suicide); engaged in a racially tinged attack on Gonzalo Curiel, a district court judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit against Trump University; and expressed doubt that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case. This is conspiratorial craziness and rank racism \u2014 and all of it has happened after we were told Mr. Trump would raise his game.When a narcissist like Mr. Trump is victorious, as he was in the Republican primary, and when he has done it on his terms, he\u2019s not going to listen to outside counsel from people who think they can change the patterns of a lifetime. Republicans have not changed Mr. Trump for the better; he has changed them for the worse.So here we are, with Republicans who lined up behind Mr. Trump now afraid of being led off a high cliff. If the prospect of a November shellacking isn\u2019t enough to unnerve these Republicans, there\u2019s also this to factor in: What we are talking about is potential generational damage to the Republican Party.Consider this historical comparison: In 1956 the Republican nominee, Dwight D. Eisenhower, won nearly 40 percent of the black vote. In 1960, Richard Nixon won nearly a third. Yet in 1964, in large part because of his opposition to the Civil Rights Act, Barry Goldwater (who was no racist) won only 6 percent. More than a half-century later, that figure has remained low. Mr. Trump \u2014 through his attacks against Hispanics that began the day he announced his candidacy \u2014 is doing with Hispanics today what Senator Goldwater did with black voters in the early 1960s.The less resistance there is to Mr. Trump now, the more political damage there will be later.The stain of Trump will last long after his campaign. His insults, cruelty and bigotry will sear themselves into the memory of Americans for a long time to come, especially those who are the targets of his invective.Mr. Trump is what he is \u2014 a malicious, malignant figure on the American political landscape. But Republican primary voters, in selecting him to represent their party, and Republican leaders now rallying to his side, have made his moral offenses their own.There will be a fearsome price for Republicans to pay for their embrace of Donald Trump. Especially after the attacks on Judge Curiel, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell, decent men who have already criticized Mr. Trump harshly, should rescind their endorsement of him \u2014 as Mr. McConnell just hinted that he might. Mr. Trump\u2019s bigotry should earn him their enmity, not their loyalty.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Sense of \u2018Brexit\u2019 in 4 Charts", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 It can be difficult to notice history as it happens. Pivotal moments are often recognizable only in hindsight; decisions that seem minor at the time turn out to mean everything.Thursday\u2019s referendum in Britain is different. If Britain chooses to leave the European Union \u2014 a \u201cBrexit\u201d (Britain + exit, get it?) \u2014 we know with certainty that this decision will change the future of the country and of Europe.Leaving the union would gouge a hole in Britain\u2019s economy as well as Europe\u2019s. In the longer term, a Brexit could weaken the European Union and give momentum to nationalist politics already simmering across the Continent.To grasp why Britons might choose the risky path of independence over the safer status quo, you need to understand the deep divisions within the country \u2014 and that, for many voters, it is a referendum on the present as much as the future.If there is one chart that sums up the Brexit debate, it is this one. For Britons who want to \u201cRemain\u201d in the union, the most important driver is the economy, far outweighing the hot-button issue of immigration.For \u201cLeave\u201d voters, the calculus is almost precisely the opposite. In other words, this isn\u2019t just a split over what the effects of Brexit will be. Rather, the divide is over what is important \u2014 and the two sides of the debate prioritize totally different things.This second chart, showing the age split between \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d backers, helps explain why the two sides have such starkly different priorities.The split isn\u2019t just about divergent generational attitudes; different age groups have different stakes in the economy.Older voters are more likely to be retired and on a pension or other fixed income. That could mean they feel insulated from any short-term economic downturns caused by a Brexit \u2014 and that they don\u2019t expect to share in future economic gains from staying. Younger voters have more to gain and lose from the economy\u2019s performance \u2014 and from being able to freely work across Europe.The age gap may also be connected to differing views of immigration, which in turn may be linked to geography. Anti-immigrant sentiment is often highest in towns with few immigrants \u2014 places where the problem isn\u2019t foreigners competing with natives for jobs, but the absence of economic opportunities over all.Opposition to immigration has become an indirect way to express anxiety over the changes globalization has brought to Britain, said Alexandra Cirone, a fellow at the London School of Economics.\u201cFraming this globalization problem as immigration,\u201d she said, \u201ccan tug on the heartstrings of potential voters, regardless of the actual facts.\u201dIn recent decades, Britain\u2019s economy has shifted away from industry and manufacturing and toward services. That means many older Britons who once worked in factories or mines have seen their former employers shuttered and their communities become poorer, even as the country as a whole has become wealthier. They have also seen their towns wither as their children move to cities to find jobs.To people outside those communities, Britain today is a wealthy country, with low unemployment and vibrant cities, a place where young people have plentiful and exciting opportunities. But in the areas hit hardest by economic change, all that success feels like a shift away from a comfortable past and toward a frightening future.For voters who feel left behind by globalization and the rapid social changes that have come with it, a vote to leave the European Union can feel like a vote to restore Britain to its former greatness.\u201cBritain was a world power. They had an empire,\u201d said Terrence Peterson, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation. A vote to leave the bloc, therefore, can feel like vote to return to Britain as it once was.Last week, when the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign took the lead in many opinion polls, the value of the British pound plunged to its lowest level in nearly seven years. The last time it was that low against the dollar was during the global financial crisis in 2009.And so, heading into Thursday\u2019s vote, the question is whether British voters will decide that the high price of independence is worth paying.Follow Amanda Taub on Twitter: @amandataub.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, Riding High, Could Be the Ace in Clinton\u2019s Pocket", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaMore than at any time in memory, the United States faces a choice this fall between unpopular presidential candidates. Most voters view Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump with disdain.Yet one popular politician looms over the contest. That\u2019s President Obama, who this spring has seen his approval rating again creep past 50 percent. For Democrats hoping to hold the White House, that has come at just the right time.Mr. Obama\u2019s standing marks a final-year turn in the arc of a presidency defined largely by the intensity of his opposition. But it also colors the November battle to choose his successor.Notwithstanding hopes to the contrary when his career began, the nation\u2019s first African-American president has proved powerless to reverse a decades-long trend toward political polarization. As a result, his average approval rating in the Gallup Poll has rarely surpassed 50 percent for six of his seven full years in office.His yearlong average fell from 57.2 percent in 2009 to 46.7 percent in the midterm election year of 2010, when Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives. It dropped to 42.6 percent in 2014, when Republicans won the Senate, too.Mr. Obama has rebounded sharply from there. This year, his first-quarter Gallup average was 49.5 percent, his highest since just after his second inauguration in 2013. His average for May has been just over 51 percent.History suggests that a president\u2019s approval rating can help predict who replaces him. The opposing party has captured the White House in every race since World War II in which the current president\u2019s approval rating was below 45 percent in late spring of their final year: Harry S. Truman in 1952, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 and George W. Bush in 2008.Those with stronger ratings fared somewhat, if not uniformly, better. Six in 10 Americans approved of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, in 1960. John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, won narrowly anyway.After the late 1990s economic boom, President Bill Clinton commanded robust majority support despite an infidelity scandal that culminated in his impeachment. His vice president, Al Gore, won the national popular vote but lost the race in the Electoral College.The only departing postwar president whose party captured a third consecutive White House term was Ronald Reagan. In 1988, when Mr. Reagan recorded a yearly Gallup average of 53 percent, his vice president, George Bush, won comfortably.Several factors contribute to Mr. Obama\u2019s uptick. The economy has kept growing, driving down the unemployment rate and federal deficit. He reached an agreement with congressional Republicans to end the budget and debt-ceiling wars that began in 2011.Unable to get much from Capitol Hill, he has all but stopped trying. That largely removes him from partisan combat amid a raucous, often circuslike campaign that underscores his steadiness and calm.That above-the-fray dividend represents a perishable asset. Inserting himself actively into the campaign, as aides say Mr. Obama plans to do, will re-energize his opposition. Given a successor\u2019s ability to strengthen or weaken his legacy, any president would consider that price worth paying.His party still faces headwinds. In a New York Times/CBS News poll in May, 63 percent of Americans described the nation as heading in the wrong direction, extending a pessimistic mood lasting more than a decade.Just 36 percent said Mrs. Clinton could bring \u201creal change\u201d to Washington, while 51 percent said Mr. Trump could.Where Mr. Obama may be able to help most is in rousing elements of the coalition that twice elected him.In the Democratic race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton has struggled to appeal to younger and independent voters. Democratic leaders have grown anxious about when, and how enthusiastically, Mr. Sanders will rally behind Mrs. Clinton should she amass enough delegates to clinch the nomination after the final primaries next week.But she holds an insurance policy with the man who defeated her in the 2008 primaries and won the presidency. Among voters ages 18 to 29, Mr. Obama drew 63 percent job approval in the Times/CBS News poll. Among Sanders supporters over all, his approval stood at 83 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Day Care Plan: A Good Start, but Not Enough", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLas Vegas \u2014 OF all the milestones that have come from the first viable female presidential candidacy, one should come as no surprise: Unfortunately, it takes a \u201cwoman card\u201d to finally get a detailed plan to address the child care crisis in the United States.Earlier this year, Hillary Clinton introduced her plan to confront these rising costs. Arguably the most progressive part of her platform, it would use tax credits to cap child care costs at 10 percent of a family\u2019s income. This would have a significant impact on low-income parents, the demographic most in need of day care services and whose work-family conflicts are matters of survival, rather than inconvenience.I work in a casino, and I know many parents who are forced to forgo a necessary wage to stay home and care for their children, because the money they\u2019d make wouldn\u2019t cover the cost of child care. In the case of single parents who have no choice but to work, they often have to leave their kids at lower-quality and unlicensed facilities \u2014 or in extreme cases, home alone.In states like mine, Nevada, where low-wage work makes up a quarter of the economy, less than 25 percent of families can afford child care. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax credit would not only be good for individual families, but also for the larger economy \u2014 the Economic Policy Institute estimates that it could generate $1.92 billion in new economic activity for the state.True, her plan could always go further \u2014 Nordic-style free day care, for example \u2014 but it\u2019s close to comprehensive when measured against her rival\u2019s. Donald J. Trump doesn\u2019t have a day-care policy to speak of beyond, as he said at one point, that he thinks it\u2019s a wife\u2019s job.But he also said, in an Iowa town hall, that \u201cit\u2019s not that expensive for a company to do it.\u201d That\u2019s not a policy, but it\u2019s a good point, and it\u2019s one that Mrs. Clinton should take to heart. Her plan focuses on pumping up federal funding, but it doesn\u2019t place any onus on, or provide incentives to, large companies, which often have the resources to make child care available to their employees. A mere 7 percent of American businesses offer on-site child care, even though it has been proved to reduce turnover and increase worker productivity, as children are the No. 1 reason for absenteeism and tardiness.A city like Las Vegas is the perfect example of a labor market that would benefit from some combination of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s federal assistance and Mr. Trump\u2019s offhand business-centered approach. The leisure and hospitality industry employs over 375,000 workers in Nevada and operates round the clock, 365 days a year. Yet very few day-care facilities in Las Vegas offer weekend or overnight care, and those that do demand high rates or require large upfront deposits.Forget quality and affordability. Finding any child care center that accommodates the erratic hours of swing, graveyard or on-call shifts \u2014 the sort of schedules demanded of a majority of casino workers, and increasingly of wage workers across the country \u2014 can become another job in itself. MGM Resorts, the largest employer in Las Vegas, provides discounted child care to its employees, but relies on only one facility to serve its many thousands of workers.A co-worker of mine recently experienced this dilemma. Newly separated, she was unable to find affordable child care to cover her weekend shifts as a casino cocktail server. Turns out, she wasn\u2019t alone: Other co-workers offered her their empathy and advice, sharing similar experiences; even our bartender joined in, expressing his own challenges in finding a quality place to take his daughter. In the end, she did what many parents do in the choice between work and family: She took the pay cut and stayed home, a result beneficial to neither her family nor her employer.What Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan does is get assistance to the families like my co-worker\u2019s who really need it, but the challenge with any tax-credit plan is educating workers on how to properly claim it. And then, of course, they have to find a place to use the money those credits free up. In the meantime, as our economy becomes increasingly reliant on service positions, dual-income households and schedules that operate outside the traditional workweek, work-family conflicts aren\u2019t going anywhere soon, until the work sector takes some initiative in helping to relieve it.That\u2019s why, on top of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, we need to find ways to encourage, or require, employers to provide coverage themselves. Reforming work culture to be more compatible with family life is not only an ethical proposition, but a worthwhile economic investment.Brittany Bronson is an English instructor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revamping Community Colleges to Improve Graduation Rates", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byEducation InnovationOffer students a less confusing array of courses.Require fewer remedial classes to improve students\u2019 basic math and English skills. Or find a way to pair these not-for-credit courses with others that would provide progress toward a degree.Provide more personal advice.And lower the cost.While some of these steps might seem more obvious than others, they are among the changes community colleges across the country are making in hopes of ensuring that more students graduate.\u201cConfronted with evidence built up over years of research that community colleges are too often failing their mission of educating all comers, college leaders are embracing a reform movement that calls for a fundamental overhaul of the structure of community colleges and the way students choose and follow a route to a degree,\u201d said Thomas Bailey, a professor of economics and education at Teachers College at Columbia University and director of the Community College Research Center.That research makes a compelling case for change. Studies show that the traditional way the country\u2019s thousand-plus community colleges have operated \u2014 by offering a wide \u201ccafeteria-style\u201d mixture of classes and majors, and by placing large numbers of students into noncredit remedial classes to bolster their basic skills \u2014 is failing.Some experts say that figure is misleading because two-thirds of students attend community colleges part time, and many take six or more years to graduate. But most would agree that too many students aren\u2019t reaching the finish line.As researchers and administrators analyzed the reasons and the point at which students were dropping out, it became clear that small changes weren\u2019t enough to ensure that more students graduated. Rather, it was time to \u201crethink everything about their institutions,\u201d said Suzanne Walsh, deputy director of postsecondary education at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has contributed heavily to community colleges.That meant revamping community colleges into more structured environments, combining fewer courses with far more intensive help from advisers to ensure that students moved along guided pathways to complete their degrees.Community colleges in the United States serve 45 percent of the nation\u2019s undergraduates, many of whom are historically underrepresented in higher education: minority, low-income and older students. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, the average student is 29 years old, and two-thirds attend part time.Thirty-six percent are the first in their families to attend college. With average annual tuition of $3,430, the association said, community colleges are about one-third the cost of in-state tuition at a public four-year university.A number of community colleges, including Long Beach City College, are no longer relying solely on assessment tests; they use the tests as only one part of an entire picture, which also includes high school transcripts and standardized test scores.Four years of data have shown that those who were placed in the higher-level classes \u201cwere succeeding just as well as those who had to go through development,\u201d Mr. Oakley said.Tennessee\u2019s system of 13 community colleges revamped its remedial program, putting in place a corequisite model in which students who need, say, help in math are enrolled in a math class for which they receive credit and a remediation class to help them complete the course.In fall semester 2015, 52 percent of students passed a credit-bearing math class, compared with 12 percent for the entire 2013-14 school year, said Tristan Denley, vice chancellor for academic affairs at the Tennessee Board of Regents.\u201cWe are the first system to fully implement this kind of change, and we see improvement across academic levels, age, income and race,\u201d Dr. Denley said.Another major impediment to graduation is too much choice and too little guidance.\u201cIt is a very complicated environment for students, and they received less advice than at any selective college,\u201d Professor Bailey said. A school like Columbia can have one adviser for one hundred students, he said, while \u201cat most community colleges, the ratio is more like one for every thousand students.\u201dIt requires all first-year students to be full time and to attend orientation and a two-week summer program; it has a mandatory curriculum in the first year and no remedial classes.It has a 49 percent three-year graduation rate.At places like Guttman, it\u2019s not just how the courses are taught but what they teach. All students must take a yearlong course called Ethnographies of Work. They study works as diverse as those of Karl Marx and Barbara Ehrenreich and learn about modern workday issues like the gig economy and work-life balance. They also observe and interview people in an occupation that interests them.For Jovanni Lezama, a second-year student at Guttman, that kind of support gave him the ability and courage not just to earn his associate\u2019s degree but to go on to a four-year college in the fall.\u201cNot many people believed in me, but I wanted to accomplish something,\u201d Mr. Lezama said. \u201cNow I\u2019m about to graduate. To me it\u2019s such a big step forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mining Companies Buy Political Influence in Australia, Report Says", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY \u2014 Political donations by mining companies preceded legislative approval for several Australian mining operations, including plans to develop the country\u2019s biggest coal mine, according to a report by an independent Australian policy institute released on Thursday.The report contends that the donations from the mining industry bought access to Queensland state officials, giving the industry an \u201cundue influence on our democratic processes\u201d and resulting in decisions that \u201chave poor outcomes for our environment, economy and our communities.\u201d\u201cTaking money from mining companies undermines the integrity of political decision-making,\u201d Mark Ogge, the report\u2019s co-author said in an interview. \u201cIt should be illegal. It is a conflict of interest.\u201dThe report, written with the Australian Conservation Foundation, was released two days before Australia\u2019s national elections, which are Saturday. While the timing appears intended to highlight the influence of the mining industry in politics \u2014 Australia\u2019s campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of donations to major parties until months after the fact \u2014 the report does not refer to any contributions in the current election.The report\u2019s primary focus is on the Liberal National Party, led by Campbell Newman, which governed Queensland from 2012 to 2015, and his successor, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Labor Party, who took office there in 2015.Queensland is home to several large and contentious mining projects, including in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland. Two new mines there could add an additional 120 million tons a year to Australia\u2019s thermal coal exports.One of the mines would be Australia\u2019s largest and, environmentalists say, will damage the Great Barrier Reef.The project\u2019s developer, the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in India, donated $52,139 to the Queensland Liberal National Party and to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, from 2012 to 2015, the report said.The report said Adani officials met with Anthony Lynham, the state\u2019s minister for natural resources and mines, at least seven times and had 12 other meetings with state ministers in 2013 and 2014.In late 2014, the government of Queensland agreed to invest up to $220 million in rail and port projects to support the new mine. It also changed the legislation to remove the right of the community to object to mining projects, the report said.After an outcry from scientists and legal action by conservationists, the dredging decision was reversed. The dredge spoils will now be dumped on land.But the report said Adani\u2019s donations had \u201cinfluenced the approval process, encouraging successive governments to ignore concerns regarding their suitability to operate.\u201dMs. Palaszczuk defended her government\u2019s actions, saying it had lowered the reporting requirement for political donations to $738 from $9,458, making government more transparent. And in a written statement, a spokesman for the Queensland government said it had restored laws to allow communities to weigh in on proposed mining projects.The spokesman said the approval process for mining projects was extensive and transparent. It includes public consultation, environmental impact studies and strict conditions to protect the environment. Mine lease applications must also meet public interest requirements.The mines minister for Queensland, Anthony Lynham, was on vacation and was not available for comment. Adnani officials did not respond to a request for comment.The Adani case was just one example cited in the report.Two oil companies, Beach Energy and Linc Energy, and the mining companies Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal also made donations, according to the report, which says the companies received favorable treatment in return. Another company, Sibelco, spent money campaigning to support its sand mining operations ahead of the state election.A spokeswoman for Sibelco, Helen Stanley, said the company had made no direct donations to political parties but had funded an electorate campaign in support of its sand mining operations on North Stradbroke Island. She said the campaign was run in 2013. In 2015, the Palaszczuk government said it would end sand mining on the island by 2019.Beach Energy, Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal did not respond to questions. Linc Energy is in receivership, a company spokeswoman said, adding she could not answer questions about the company\u2019s political donations policy.Over all, the report said, the Queensland Liberal National Party received more than $700,000 in donations from mining companies from 2011 to 2015. The mining industry also donated nearly $2.2 million to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, which now leads the national government, in the five years since July 2011. The Queensland Liberal National Party and the Liberal Party of Australia are not one and the same.The Queensland Labor Party received $68,000 and the federal Labor party received $890,000 from donors connected to the mining industry over the same period.A spokesman for the Liberal Party said in a written reply on Wednesday that he would not comment on a report he had not read, but pointed out that the Australia Institute, a research center, employed former Greens Party supporters in important roles.Large mining projects often require state and federal government approval, especially if threatened species and their habitats are placed under duress by the proposed operation.\u201cThe report demonstrates that money doesn\u2019t just buy access, it buys outcomes,\u201d said Lindy Edwards, a political scientist from the University of New South Wales.

{"Headline": "The Global Stakes of a Saudi Aramco I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIt\u2019s hard to get one\u2019s head around it: An initial public offering that would value a company in the trillions of dollars. That\u2019s trillions, with a T.It\u2019s so big that the company\u2019s valuation is estimated at $1 trillion to $2 trillion; some put the figure as high as $10 trillion.A sale of a 5 percent stake would be the largest I.P.O. ever, with proceeds most likely approaching $100 billion. The investment banker fees may exceed $1 billion, which has prompted a feeding frenzy at this once-in-a-lifetime sale.Even so, the real eye-opening development may not be the amount of money involved, but where the Saudi government chooses to list the shares.If it decides to list only on the home country exchange, it will be a conservative choice with minimal impact. But if it seeks a listing in New York, London or Hong Kong, it could be revolutionary.The choice matters so much because this can really be thought of as an I.P.O. of the whole country.If Aramco lists only on the Saudi exchange, the I.P.O. will swamp the current market capitalization of the exchange, which is $300 billion to $400 billion, and dominate trading. In this environment where the company is the dominant one and is a creature of the state, Aramco can set its own rules on disclosure and other regulation, providing little comfort to foreign shareholders.If Aramco goes to New York, it will be subjecting itself to the full array of United States securities laws applicable to foreign companies. This will require extensive disclosure and will subject the company to the scrutiny of the public market.It would also mean that American investors, both big and small, could easily invest. A New York listing would be a way of bringing the company \u2014 and by implication, the country \u2014 into the full financial sphere.This may be why the Saudis are considering such a move. The kingdom knows that its century\u2019s worth of oil reserves may very likely never be used as the world shifts to greener, carbon-free energy. So it is selling now to reap some money while the going is good. Moreover, given the state of the Saudi budget and its current budget deficit \u2014 $98 billion last year \u2014 a successful I.P.O. will help ease local economic woes.Nonetheless, an offering is a step in transitioning the kingdom toward a more sustainable and more open post-oil economy.Having Aramco subject to United States financial reporting will itself be something of a shock to the Saudi system. It would be as if an entire country suddenly became listed and regulated by outside capital markets.That New York is even being considered for the offering highlights the continued strength of American capital markets in the years after the financial crisis.When issuers choose to list abroad these days, for the most part they go to New York. The only other real competitor is London. And when these global I.P.O.s happen, it is American banks that largely organize them. In this case, the lead adviser for Aramco is JPMorgan Chase, which has worked with the kingdom for decades. It stands first in line for what could be more than $1 billion in fees.This is a remarkable turn of events. After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002, there was a loud outcry that the United States was losing its stock listings.And these were listings by prominent companies like Alibaba, Manchester United and Ferrari.This is where it gets interesting for the Aramco I.P.O. If it does decide to list to the United States, a difficult task awaits. Audited financial statements for a public company would need to be prepared, work that could take years. Aramco would have to decide which assets to keep and which would remain private.The state\u2019s control will have to be formalized, including whether the offering will include an interest in the kingdom\u2019s oil reserves or be confined to other assets.Aramco, which is generally regarded as well run for a state enterprise, will have to adopt a board that may have outside members and to prepare for the criticism of the market. Some trimming of fat will also be needed. In recent years, the company has invested far afield in chemical and solar assets.Because of this, I am skeptical that an I.P.O. will happen soon. But I am also optimistic that if it does, and it goes to list in New York or London or Hong Kong, this can be a game changer for a country that is seeking to diversify its economy. (And yes, like all emerging market offerings, this is a risky one \u2014 perhaps even more so given the state of the Middle East and world oil \u2014 so retail buyers should beware.)I may be overstating the potential for Saudi Arabia, which is still very much a closed regime and will probably remain one for some time. But the attraction of the United States stock market \u2014 and the disclosures and changes the Saudis would have to make to take part \u2014 show the transformative power of global capital. An Aramco I.P.O. could be a victory for New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 and the Risks of Democracy", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStay or GoThe Brexit ballot puts one of democracy\u2019s riskiest tools, the referendum, to the test.The British people are voting on whether to leave the European Union. The betting markets and the financial markets are both signaling that the country will vote to stay. But even if Britain rejects Brexit, as leaving the European Union is known, the very act of holding a referendum will come in for criticism.In a single-issue vote, a small number of people can change the course of an entire country for generations. All it would take is a simple majority of Britons to throw Europe into turmoil with a vote to leave. This problem is made much worse if turnout is low.Then there\u2019s the democratic argument against referendums: The electorate already gets a chance to vote on big issues in a general election. In recent years, neither of Britain\u2019s two main political parties has run on a platform that includes leaving the European Union, and voters have repeatedly backed them to form governments. Also, a large proportion of current members of the British Parliament want Britain to remain in the union. This could cause a mess if Britain votes to leave. In such an outcome, politicians who favor Brexit are expected to take power. But the mostly pro-Europe Parliament might not support those leaders, leading to a period of turmoil and paralysis.Pretty ugly. So why might holding the ballot be worth these risks?Two reasons: A vote is overdue, and the British people seem to want the opportunity to vote on Europe separately from a general election.But the YouGov poll found that concerns about the economy and sovereignty were dominant. The poll asked which one issue would play the biggest role in deciding how the respondents intended to vote in the referendum. A third said their biggest consideration was what would be best for jobs and the economy, while 29 percent said they would choose mainly on the basis of what would best allow Britain to balance sovereignty and cooperation with other countries. Only 18 percent said immigration was the most important issue.The Brexit referendum has been bruising for Britain. But it\u2019s hard to say it was bad for its democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ask Not What the President Can Do for the Economy", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byTHIS year\u2019s presidential candidates, like all candidates before them, have talked endlessly about what they\u2019ll do to boost the economy if they make it to the White House.But politicians may be selling voters a bill of goods about how much their presidential pick really matters. Candidates spend a lot of time talking about tax plans and income growth \u2014 instead of the issues they could actually directly control in the White House. The economy is the issue the public cares the most about, but perhaps the one that presidents have the least power over.There is a longstanding trend that has baffled researchers and Republicans alike: Since World War II, the economy has consistently performed better under Democratic administrations than under Republican ones, no matter how one measures its performance. Why? It\u2019s mostly about luck.Presidents do influence those factors, of course. Starting a war in the Middle East will affect oil prices. Government can help foster new industries and technologies \u2014 say, the internet \u2014 that can alter productivity. But there are other big items under presidential purview that the studies found that don\u2019t have any impact, such as the size of the federal deficit or spending on the military.Whatever influence the president may have at times wielded over the economy is diminishing. With a gridlocked Congress, presidents are less and less able to push through enormous legislative changes that would substantially shift the course of the economy.So although he or she won\u2019t deserve it, the occupant of the White House will get some credit for strong economic performance at the outset. What happens after that will be mostly out of the president\u2019s hands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Survive Being an Airbnb Host", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayAfter my first Airbnb guests checked out of our garage apartment last February, I eagerly called up their online review. I had no reason to suspect anything but flattering comments from the two young women from Oregon, one of whom had originally planned on coming with her husband to celebrate their fourth anniversary until he had to drop out at the last minute. She brought a friend instead, but disappointment, I discovered, came along in her suitcase.When they arrived for the three-day stay in my home southwest of Austin, I met them cheerily with a basket of muffins and walked them through the apartment, which my husband and I used to rent out long-term until we decided to jump on the Airbnb gravy train. If all went well, we figured we could make the $650 we used to get per month in six nights.As a travel writer, I\u2019ve reviewed scores of hotels and was quite sure I knew what I was doing. We bought a sumptuous pillowtop mattress, luscious sheets and towels and an array of pillow styles. I left coffee, tea and real half-and-half (no powdered creamer for my guests!) as well as bubble bath for the tub. As I arranged the vintage patio furniture on the balcony and looked out over our 15 acres of rolling Texas Hill Country terrain, I thought, Who wouldn\u2019t love this?Well, as they say, pride goes before a fall. \u201cVery little supplies in the kitchen,\u201d was just one of the gripes the Oregon women left in their review. They gave me three out of five stars \u2014 a rating handed out in fewer than six percent of stays, according to a subsequent tsk-tsk note from Airbnb. Thanks to my faceplant out of the gate, I was told my search placement would be impacted. For months to come, my cumulative star rating remained less than nearby hosts. I was devastated, especially since I had sung the guests\u2019 praises in my review of them (reviews are published simultaneously so I didn\u2019t see theirs in advance). I felt the same pangs of rejection and inadequacy that go with unrequited high school friendships.But in all those pages of practical information, here\u2019s what Airbnb doesn\u2019t tell you.Honest reviews of both hosts and guests are what keep the whole Airbnb system in check. Without them, people could go on rock-star, room-smashing benders with no consequences. Or hosts could get away with horrors like leaving hair doilies in the shower drain.But even if you\u2019re used to people throwing darts at you in your professional life, it\u2019s something else to have strangers judging your home and your way of living. And doing it publicly. I\u2019d told the Oregon women they were my first guests and to let me know how I could improve, but they never mentioned any problems and seemed happy enough. Being called out online is like asking someone if you have food in your teeth and having that person proceed to announce that yes, in fact you do, over a loud speaker.That first review started well enough \u2014 beautiful setting and d\u00e9cor; kind, gracious host. Then came \u201calthough\u201d and the first salvo: \u201cThere was no drinking water,\u201d as if I was a stingy desert-dweller guarding my oasis spring, when I regularly had our well water tested and it was just fine. (The true outrage, I wanted to tell them, is when $700-a-night hotels charge $10 for a bottle of water.) The women also complained that the jets didn\u2019t work on my whirlpool tub, even though I had told them that\u2019s why I hadn\u2019t advertised the feature on my listing.The personal sting of such finger-wagging is compounded by the potential financial one, since negative comments affect future bookings. I had been told by experienced Airbnb hosts to price my property low initially to get reservations, which would lead to reviews that would attract other guests. Then I could raise my rates. But they didn\u2019t say what would happen if you got a big raspberry. Luckily, I already had more bookings lined up.Even the things you can\u2019t control. My worst sin in that first review turned out to be location, location, location. They claimed I was at least an hour from downtown (not 30 minutes as I said truthfully in my listing). Their low rating on my accuracy was, in the Airbnb webosphere, the equivalent of yelling, \u201cLiar, liar.\u201dMy listing included a map that showed exactly where I was in relation to Austin. When they arrived, the Oregon women told me their GPS took them the wrong way, and they did make the trip during rush hour; hence the 60-minute drive time. No matter. Their travel issues became my issue. I wanted to respond to their review with an apology for not clearing the highways out of Austin for them, but I had the sense to know snark would not win me future bookings. Instead I immediately put a disclaimer on my listing that \u201cyour driving time may vary because of traffic.\u201d \u201cDuh\u201d implied.Once you\u2019ve gotten a less-than-rave review, you start looking at every possible defect as a potential online skewer. One day, when the wind blew one of the sheets off the clothesline and onto the ground (I had some romantic notion that people would appreciate the smell of country-air-dried bedding), I imagined the review I\u2019d get if our next guests suffered a spider bite in bed. Another time I noticed the bathroom sink was leaking; in my head I saw, \u201cCould not sleep because of the drip, drip, drip.\u201d The emergency plumber bill was about half as much as my imminently arriving guests were paying for the whole stay. At that moment, the $650 a month from non-review-writing tenants seemed like a bargain.When I bemoaned my bad review to a friend, she mentioned that she always gives wine to her guests. Aha, I thought. That\u2019s what I was missing. So in addition to a basket of muffins, I began leaving a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc. \u201cHow much are you spending on each guest?\u201d my husband asked when he saw me carting the check-in swag to the apartment. To be honest, I didn\u2019t really care. My pride was at stake and anyway, it seems to have worked. All my reviews were glowing after the addition of alcohol.You may start your Airbnb career imagining you\u2019ll be a magnanimous, mi-casa-es-su-casa kind of host. But at some point you\u2019ll have guests who\u2019ll make you want to hide under your bed until they\u2019ve gone out for the day. We had a perfectly nice couple who could not master the thermostat and would call or text every time the temperature was not to their liking. They\u2019d also frequently update us on their struggles with the icemaker, the washer\u2019s spin cycle, the ceiling fan switch.On one occasion, when I ran into the couple in the driveway, they informed me that they\u2019d found an insect they suspected was a \u201ckissing bug\u201d (which they claimed was poisonous though I\u2019d never heard of it in my 20 years in the Texas Hill Country). They were thinking of sending it off for testing, and oh, by the way, the wife had some weird bite on her arm. I think my eyes spontaneously crossed. Later, after they\u2019d checked out and given me five stars (wine for me after that one), I got a text from them saying that the agricultural extension agency confirmed the insect was indeed a kissing bug. It was with great joy that I deleted it and thanked the patron saint of innkeepers, St. Martin of Tours \u2014 who according to some sources also serves that role for alcoholics, appropriately enough \u2014 that they hadn\u2019t included that little tidbit in their review.Even at a Motel 6. I\u2019m no longer hosting for Airbnb \u2014 not because I got my 600-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets in a wad, but because we sold our house five months into my gig. We made a bit of money from our stint as guesthouse hosts \u2014 maybe not as much as my husband hoped with the wine and all. Plus, because of that first blot on my record, I never felt I could raise my rates.However, I gained something else in the process: a new empathy for those I\u2019ve scrutinized in my other life as a hotel reviewer. Cleaning toilets in between guests will do that for you. These days I avoid using a hotel towel to wipe off my eye makeup because I know firsthand that mascara is nearly impossible to get out. I lose the woman-on-the-verge tone when I call the front desk over a temperamental Wi-Fi connection.I was just a hobbyist, but I\u2019ll think twice about re-upping with Airbnb in our new home though we have the space. The hospitality business is one long, grinning, love-me-please tap dance, more easily disparaged than done.Advertisement"}

Cronin, a senior adviser at the Center for a New American Security, called the decision by Beijing to halt talks a \u201cwarning shot across the bow.\u201d He said mainland officials were growing increasingly nervous about an independence movement in Taiwan and were seeking to hinder Ms. Tsai\u2019s domestic agenda, including her promise to revive a slowing economy.\u201cChina will deny carrots and signal red lines for President Tsai as she grapples with her fundamental challenge, which is righting the economy,\u201d Dr. Cronin said.Ms. Tsai has taken a more cautious approach, openly criticizing Chinese officials and warmly embracing China\u2019s historic rivals like Japan. Her party, the Democratic Progressives, has traditionally advocated Taiwanese independence, a move the mainland has threatened to counter with military force.Ms. Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo in cross-strait relations, but she has stopped short of offering an unequivocal endorsement of the One China policy.In 1992, Taiwan and the mainland agreed to consider themselves part of a single Chinese nation, but each side embraces a different interpretation of what that means.On Saturday, the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing revealed that talks with the Mainland Affairs Council in Taipei had been suspended since May, soon after Ms. Tsai\u2019s inauguration. The two entities represent one of the primary channels of communication between China and Taiwan, overseeing discussions related to trade, law, education and culture.On Saturday, Chinese officials defended their handling of the case, saying efforts to crack down on internet schemes were legitimate and supported by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.Analysts said the decision to suspend talks was probably the beginning of a campaign by Beijing to increase pressure on Taiwan.\u201cThe big unknown is the business community,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cChina will be reaching out to all the segments that are going to be dissatisfied with Tsai\u2019s policies.\u201dThe timing of Beijing\u2019s announcement, just as Ms. Tsai departed for Latin America on her first overseas trip as president, seemed aimed at undermining her leadership, analysts said.\u201cBy refusing to communicate, Beijing is making it more difficult for the Taiwanese government to fulfill its obligations to its citizens and as a member of international society,\u201d said Jonathan Sullivan, the director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham in England.He added, \u201cBeijing is saying, \u2018We don\u2019t care about inconvenience and are prepared to inhibit the management of cross-strait interactions if we don\u2019t get what we want.\u2019\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump\u2019s Campaign Could Redraw Voter Allegiances", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceFor decades, Republicans argued for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller welfare state. Democrats took up the opposite view, and voters split along familiar lines.Whatever you think of Donald Trump, it is clear that this election has the potential to reshape the allegiances of many white working-class voters who have traditionally sided with the Democrats, and many well-educated voters who have sided with the Republicans.Along with his departures on immigration and the welfare state, Mr. Trump is moving away from the labor fights and culture wars that defined 20th-century politics, and toward the new divide over globalization and multiculturalism that might define 21st-century politics.Mr. Trump currently trails in most polls. But according to a 2014 study by Pew Research on political polarization, positions like those held by Mr. Trump on trade, immigration, guns and the environment have considerable support from white working-class Democrats.Around 40 percent of white Democrats without a college degree agree that free trade has done more harm than good (exit polls showed the same thing in the Democratic primary), or think the United States should get tougher with China on economic issues. Similar numbers agree with Mr. Trump on guns and immigration. All of Mr. Trump\u2019s stances are more popular than traditional Republican views on the welfare state or culture war issues like abortion or same-sex marriage.The potential for Mr. Trump to break through among white working-class voters isn\u2019t merely theoretical. Recent public opinion surveys \u2014 even those showing Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin \u2014 all show him leading Mrs. Clinton by a wider margin among white voters without a college degree than the margin by which Mitt Romney led President Obama in 2012. Over all, Mr. Trump leads among white voters without a college degree by a 57-to-31 margin in the last six national polls. Mr. Romney led by a 55-to-37 percent margin with those voters in a compilation of the final polls in 2012.These gains have not been enough to give Mr. Trump an overall lead. He trails by an average of five points in the same surveys.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday was delivered in Monessen, Pa., the sort of place that typifies the overlooked Democratic resilience among white working-class voters, and that Mr. Trump needs in November. The area was once one of the most reliably Democratic parts of the country, and even today, Democrats still fare fairly well among white working-class voters. President Obama won Monessen by a 66-33 percent margin, and the town is at the tip of a region along the Monongahela River where Mr. Obama won among white working-class voters.There are places like this \u2014 traditionally Democratic, white working-class areas where Mr. Obama still showed important strength \u2014 across the Northern United States. In Pennsylvania alone, there are similar regions along the Beaver River \u2014 north of Pittsburgh \u2014 or in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre area in northeast Pennsylvania. There\u2019s Youngstown and Warren, Ohio \u2014 or a whole strip of towns along Lake Erie, from Toledo, Ohio, back to Erie, Pa. Many of these same areas broke heavily for Mr. Trump in the Republican primary.We will not know until November whether Mr. Trump will attract these traditionally Democratic voters. Even if he does, he might fall far short of winning the presidency, as current polls suggest. His gains among less educated white voters have been neatly canceled by losses among well-educated voters.This could prevent Mr. Trump from winning in states with a large white working class. A recent Marquette University poll showed Mr. Trump winning by seven points among white working-class voters in Wisconsin. Yet Mrs. Clinton was leading by a huge 22-point margin among well-educated white voters, even though four years ago they split almost evenly between parties. The same dynamic could doom Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania.But if you want to know why Mr. Trump is still in striking distance \u2014 why Mrs. Clinton is generally well beneath 50 percent, and not faring too much better among registered voters than Mr. Obama was in the fall of 2012 \u2014 this is why: Mr. Trump has made big gains among less educated white voters. He has adopted a platform to do it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 147 Years, Goldman Sachs Hangs a Shingle on Main Street", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byYou used to need $10 million to become a customer of Goldman Sachs.Now you can get in with a dollar.At a time when many storied firms on Wall Street are asking themselves profound questions \u2014 such as, What does it mean to be a Wall Street firm in this day and age? \u2014 one of the most elite institutions in the business is opening an old-fashioned, deposit-taking bank catering to the little saver.It is the crystallization of an extraordinary moment in the halls of American finance. Goldman, like other marquee banking companies, is hunting for new business as its traditional ones falter. Regulations rolled out since the 2008 financial crisis have put a crimp in deal-making, Wall Street\u2019s traditional expertise. The high-powered bond trading desks that generated most of Goldman\u2019s precrisis profits now make only a fraction of what they did before.Over the last year, Goldman executives have been preparing to introduce 401(k) accounts, loans for people saddled with credit card debt and new investment funds that can be purchased by anyone with an E-Trade account. It will all be online only. In fact, Goldman thinks one of its advantages will be that it does not have the historical baggage \u2014 read, expense \u2014 of traditional branches and tellers.All of this has prompted some head-scratching in the industry, given that Goldman has so little experience in the hotly competitive field of retail banking. Not least among the challenges: Getting Americans to warm to a bank that has been maligned as a symbol of Wall Street greed during the 2008 crisis.At least one new customer dismissed that worry. \u201cOf course they get blamed for stuff,\u201d said Daniel Sigal, a 24-year-old college student in the Los Angeles area who calls himself a Wall Street hopeful. But \u201cGoldman Sachs is the Nike of finance,\u201d he said \u2014 a brand everyone knows. Its foray into banking is \u201cvery, very positive,\u201d he said.He also liked the 1.05 percent interest rate on savings accounts that Goldman offered, which dwarfed the 0.01 percent he was getting from Wells Fargo. The average is 0.54 percent, according to Bankrate.comGoldman will have to pull in many people like Mr. Sigal to make even a tiny difference in its annual revenue, which tends to be measured in the tens of billions of dollars.The senior Goldman executive overseeing all of this said that none of these businesses were lines that he could have imagined the firm getting involved in even five years ago. \u201cWe had an opportunity to take a clean sheet of paper and draw out what we might do,\u201d said that executive, Stephen Scherr, the chief of strategy for Goldman and the chief executive of its federally insured bank.Before the crisis, Goldman did not even have a federally insured bank; it was forced to open one as a condition of receiving bailout funds during the financial crisis. Initially, the bank was viewed by executives as a drag. More recently, though, Goldman has come to view the bank as one of its brightest opportunities.\u201cOver the years, it became clear that the bank had greater potential to help grow the firm,\u201d Mr. Scherr said.Behind the scenes, Goldman executives have been debating how far they want to expand their new retail offerings and if they eventually want to end up with something that would look more like a full-service online bank. The company is in the earliest stages, and it could back off if the initial experiments fail.So far, interest has been strong. Mr. Scherr said that the bank had opened tens of thousands of new accounts in its first few weeks, in addition to the 150,000 accounts it acquired from GE Capital. (Goldman bought the online banking arm of General Electric\u2019s financial services subsidiary this year, acquiring about $16 billion in deposits as part of the deal.)Goldman\u2019s\u2019 way forward is likely to be anything but easy, even with billions backing it. It faces lots of entrenched competitors and has almost no experience in the human elements of this kind of banking, such as customer service.Goldman is betting that its investments in technology will help it take advantage of big changes in the financial industry over the last five years, during which banks have moved away from a business model based on relationships and branches and toward one that is more reliant on smartphones and software.Mr. Scherr said that Goldman was looking broadly at businesses where it could use its technology to provide a cheaper banking product. He cited small-business lending as a particularly attractive area for potential expansion, calling it \u201cripe for technology disruption.\u201dThe strategy of offering what are essentially discount financial products is a somewhat unexpected one for Goldman, given that it has long been known as the most upscale firm on Wall Street. This is somewhat like Maserati making a push into the motorized bicycle market. But the offerings, if successful, could provide a valuable public perception payoff for Goldman by softening the firm\u2019s image as a remote bastion of power and wealth.The first big test will come later this year when Goldman starts offering a lending product targeting people who need relatively small personal loans of around $15,000 to $25,000. Overseeing that effort is an executive hired from the credit card company Discover, Harit Talwar, who runs a team of about 50 people working on the so-called Mosaic project on the 26th floor of Goldman\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. Many of the employees are coders working on sophisticated ways to gauge the credit quality of potential borrowers.Last fall, Goldman introduced its first low-cost exchange-traded funds, which are managed according to computer algorithms and can be purchased through any brokerage account. Then, a few months back, Goldman purchased a small start-up, Honest Dollar, that offers inexpensive accounts for retirement savings, aimed at freelancers and other part-time workers in the so-called gig economy.Mr. Sidhu, of BankMobile, said he was not expecting big things but was watching with curiosity. \u201cIf Goldman wants to be a retail bank for every six-pack Joe, I wish them a lot of luck, because they will need it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A bull might be more appropriate.The company, which is famous across Asia for its use of cute, animated emoticons it calls stickers, is seeking to raise about $1 billion in listings in New York and Tokyo next month, according to a filing on Friday. That would value Line at more than $5 billion, which could make it the biggest market debut for a technology company so far this year.Line also lets people share images and make voice calls. It makes money by selling stickers of characters like Brown, its poker-faced ursine mascot, and through video games and conventional advertising.Like other Asian rivals, Line allows celebrities and brands to host official accounts to engage with users over social media. More recently, it has added ride-hailing and online payments to increase its sources of revenue.Line, which has more than 200 million users, is the messaging mainstay in Japan, the third-largest economy in the world, after the United States and China. It has been competing with the likes of WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, and WeChat, owned by Tencent of China, to draw smartphone users in markets across Asia. About half of its users come from outside Japan, mostly in Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand.The company\u2019s revenue has grown steadily in recent quarters.With the new round of fund-raising, Line will most likely continue to push into new markets, and also to expand services like payments.Still, the company faces competition from numerous messaging competitors, many of which have holds over important markets or demographics.So extreme is the competition that Line does not dominate in South Korea, even though its parent, Naver, is well established there. Kakao Talk prevails instead. In China, WeChat is the most popular app.Line has signaled that it intends to do more to compete in markets like the United States, where it also faces rivals like Facebook Messenger and Snapchat.Hisako Ueno contributed research from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Homeowners Find Themselves in a Land of Doubt", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byWENZHOU, China \u2014 Chen Furong and his wife bought their home 23 years ago for its proximity to the city center and for the tree-lined canal just outside. Their dream was to pass it on to their children and grandchildren, a piece of wealth giving their family a share of China\u2019s economic miracle.Then their neighbor tried to sell her place \u2014 and it was all thrown into doubt.Like every other homeowner in China, Mr. Chen and his neighbor own their homes but not the land underneath them. All land in China is owned by the government, which parcels it out to developers and homeowners through 20- to 70-year leases.When the neighbor \u2014 whose surname is Wang \u2014 tried to sell her apartment, local officials told her that her lease on the land had expired. To sell her apartment, they told her, she would have to pay them one-third of the sales value.Ms. Wang protested in a move that drew national attention. Suddenly millions of Chinese who had socked away billions \u2014 and possibly trillions \u2014 of dollars were worried as well. If the local authorities in other parts of China did the same thing, they thought, a big chunk of their own wealth could end up with the government as well.\u201cWhat will happen after our land lease expires?\u201d asked Mr. Chen, 69, who with his wife holds a 70-year lease. \u201cI will be dead when the lease expires, but will I be able to give it to my son?\u201dChina\u2019s erratic stock market and its strict limits on sending money overseas have prompted many Chinese families to invest in residential real estate. China\u2019s families have put nearly two-thirds of their wealth into housing, estimates Li Gan, a professor of economics at Texas A&M University who runs a widely read survey of Chinese households. Some own two or more homes and buy or sell them the way American investors play the stock market.That pot of household wealth is crucial to China\u2019s efforts to take its economy to the next level. As reliable sources of growth like exports and manufacturing falter, China is trying to turn its households into American-style consumers. Faith in their home savings would make them more likely to open their wallets.But even as it has pushed for increased homeownership, the Chinese Communist Party has done little to loosen its grip on the nation\u2019s land. The party attacked private landlords during its rise to power, and when it took control, it nationalized all land, following the Soviet model. Although the death of Mao Zedong led to reforms that allowed people to own their own homes, the central government continued to retain title to the land, giving it a major lever in China\u2019s economy.Some experts say the central government cannot continue to serve as national landlord. \u201cOur country still believes in an ideology that is already outdated,\u201d said Mao Yushi, a prominent economist who previously directed the Unirule Institute of Economics, a Beijing research firm. \u201cThe patriarch of public ownership, the Soviet Union, has collapsed already, but we are still holding onto public ownership.\u201dGiving land to the people would not be easy. Local governments in China do not have the power to levy taxes, so leasing land is one of the few ways they have to raise money.Allowing Chinese to own land could also concentrate wealth in the hands of a few, Mr. Mao said. \u201cSo how would we tax those who end up owning the vast swath?\u201d he asked.In 2007, China moved to reassure homeowners by requiring local governments to renew 70-year leases automatically. Yet the law was silent on whether homeowners would have to pay for the renewal and what would happen to those with shorter leases.China\u2019s Legislature needs to resolve this issue, said Sun Yuhua, an associate researcher at the East China University of Political Science and Law. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cit will trigger huge disputes.\u201dUncertainties about land leases come at a time of broader concerns about the affordability of housing in China. Some smaller cities have gluts of unoccupied apartments, but housing prices have risen steadily in wealthy cities like Shanghai and Beijing.Beijing is keeping a close eye on events in Wenzhou, a coastal city of eight million people in eastern China that was one of the first to set up private enterprise after China opened up its economy in the late 1970s. The government\u2019s land ministry sent an inspection team to Wenzhou in April, according to state media. National and local government officials declined to comment.At least three Wenzhou neighborhoods have been hit by government requests for money to renew land leases, including Henghe North, where Ms. Wang and Mr. Chen live. The Chens\u2019 home is typical of the area\u2019s modest dwellings. Nestled on the third floor of a gray-tiled building, the apartment crams two bedrooms into 580 square feet.A blocky complex of buildings, Henghe North is bordered by a busy avenue lined with noodle stands, vegetable markets and other small shops. Trees and flower beds grow along the canal that abuts the development. Mr. Chen said local people pooled their money to build a community center designed like a Chinese temple.The unassuming neighborhood was turned upside down by Ms. Wang\u2019s discovery. Local apartment owners started checking their lease documents. Chinese reporters went door to door, especially in Ms. Wang\u2019s building. \u201cThere were so many journalists here that she didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone,\u201d Mr. Chen said.Reached by telephone, a woman who identified herself as Ms. Wang said she was waiting to see how the government would resolve the problem. She declined to comment further.Property records in China are spotty, relatively new and unavailable to the public. According to her neighbors and local media, Ms. Wang and her family bought her 860-square-foot apartment three years ago for 1.4 million renminbi, or about $210,000 at today\u2019s exchange rates.Several blocks away, residents of another affected neighborhood, Shuixin, wondered what would happen when they tried to sell their apartments.\u201cPeople don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Ge Qingchuan, a retired real estate agent who stopped his motor scooter to talk. \u201cNo one paid attention to land leases, but now there are problems.\u201d\u201cFor example,\u201d he added, \u201cif you are buying a new apartment and using your current apartment, with a 20-year lease, as collateral to borrow money, you won\u2019t be able to do so. If the banks see your land lease is expiring, they won\u2019t lend you money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Far Right Sees an Opportunity in \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Among the many populist movements in Europe encouraged by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, none was more energized than France\u2019s far-right National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, exulted soon after the results were announced that it was \u201ca day of joy.\u201dFor nearly 30 years, the National Front has been vilifying the European Union while striking the same anti-immigration themes that animated the campaign in Britain. Now, with Britain having demonstrated the breadth and depth of opposition to the concentration of powers in Brussels and Europe\u2019s open-borders policy, Ms. Le Pen is seizing the opportunity to build support for herself and her party heading into next year\u2019s presidential election.\u201cThis gives us additional legitimacy to carry forward this same debate in France,\u201d she told journalists on Friday, calling for a \u201cFrexit\u201d referendum.The far-right party took particular heart that support for cutting ties with the European Union came from places and voters in Britain that are very similar to the National Front\u2019s base of support in France: working people who see themselves as losers from globalization; rural areas; and small and medium-size cities that feel left behind.With President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of the governing Socialist Party lagging badly in the polls and the main center-right party wounded by internal problems, Ms. Le Pen is widely expected to do well enough in the initial round of presidential voting next spring to make it to the final round against a candidate from one of the mainstream parties.Actually winning the presidency remains a more remote prospect. But the issues raised by the British vote \u2014 sovereignty, national identity, immigration and a popular backlash against what is perceived as an out-of-touch elite \u2014 provide Ms. Le Pen with a powerful platform.The idea of a referendum in France on membership in the European Union was curtly dismissed by Mr. Hollande in a meeting with Ms. Le Pen at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Saturday. The National Front is not backing down, though.For all the differences between France, a founding member of the bloc and a consistent force in seeking greater unity on the Continent, and Britain, which joined late and rejected membership in initiatives like the common European currency, there are enough similarities in their economies and electorates to give hope to the National Front for a breakthrough.Sixty percent of the population lives in \u201cPeripheral France,\u201d as the French geographer and sociologist Christophe Guilluy calls it, \u2014 \u201cthose who are no longer useful to the economy, who live in the rural areas and the small towns,\u201d he said in an interview.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.\u201cNo establishment party represents these areas,\u201d Mr. Guilluy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve got Trump, Brexit and the National Front,\u201d he added, referring to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nomineeAnti-establishment anger is increasingly evident among the working-class left in France, mirroring a phenomenon in Britain in which disaffected Labour Party voters abandoned their party\u2019s traditional pro-European stance to register their displeasure with policies and political leaders they felt had left them behind.\u201cBrexit is exactly the same as the National Front; it\u2019s a vote based on the same sociology and demographics,\u201d said Mr. Guilluy, whose work has earned him the anger of the French left and much attention in the news media partly because it stresses working-class cultural anxieties in the face of immigration.The themes that defined the referendum in Britain have also resonated in France because of the terrorist attacks of the past year and a half and the longstanding problems France has had assimilating Muslim immigrants.When Mr. Hollande reacted to the British vote in a televised address on Friday, the first priority he cited was \u201cthe security and defense of our Continent, to protect our frontiers.\u201dNicolas Sarkozy, the former president who is running again as a center-right Republican, called France a \u201cChristian country, in its culture and its mores,\u201d in a much remarked-on speech this month at Saint-Andr\u00e9-lez-Lille that called attention to the country\u2019s \u201ccultural, moral and even spiritual identity.\u201dEmmanuelle Reungoat, a National Front specialist at the University of Montpellier, said the British vote \u201cwas centralized around finding migrants a risk.\u201d\u201cIn France, this could serve the National Front,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an adaptation to the agenda of the National Front.\u201dIn France, the British vote has accentuated the split between the mainstream parties in France, none of whom are calling for an exit, and the National Front. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though I used a curse word,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said acidly as she left the Elys\u00e9e after her fruitless pitch to Mr. Hollande for a referendum.Given the array of other issues facing France, including a near-stagnant economy and high unemployment, it remains to be seen how central an issue membership in the bloc might be in the presidential race. But the National Front appears intent on using the moment.\u201cI am European by civilization, and I am French by nationality,\u201d Ms. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen said on Monday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t defend this cold monster that saps European identity.\u201dReporting was contributed by Melissa Eddy and Victor Homola from Berlin, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome and Beno\u00eet Morenne from Paris.Advertisement"}

And few nations were as willing to put a thumb as firmly on the scales of European debates in ways that benefit the United States.Now that quiet diplomatic leverage \u2014 including moderating European trade demands and strong-arming nations to contribute more to NATO military missions \u2014 is suddenly diminished.\u201cWhen Vladimir Putin is cheering,\u201d David Miliband, the former British foreign minister, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, \u201cthen you know you have got a problem in the international system.\u201dAnd then, of course, there is the threat of the Islamic State, which has found in Europe a new battlefield, one in which the development and sharing of intelligence, seamlessly, is critical.Addressing those challenges was daunting enough, American officials say, in the face of the tenor of the American presidential campaign, particularly Donald J. Trump\u2019s questioning of whether alliances are worth it if allies are not willing to pay more for American protection.Like the Arab Spring, the result of Britain\u2019s referendum took Washington by surprise. As late as early last week there was something between a hope and an assumption that the vote would \u201cgo the other way,\u201d as Secretary of State John Kerry said in Rome on Sunday. As a result, there was no serious planning for the all-consuming work of reimagining the European relationship, a task that will face President Obama for the next six months, and his successor for years to come.Mr. Kerry, usually the optimist, sounded almost downbeat as he arrived in Italy. He did not make any references to a \u201cshriveled Europe,\u201d as one of his top aides did in a conversation over the weekend. But he made clear that European allies are also going to have to rethink their relationships with the United States.\u201cTwenty-two of the nations in the E.U. are members of NATO,\u201d he said less than a minute into his meeting with his Italian counterpart, Paolo Gentiloni. He warned that the most critical step was to \u201cwork together to provide as much continuity, as much stability, as much certainty as possible\u201d to \u201cprotect the values and interests that we share in common.\u201dThe problem is that no one shares those values and interests quite the way the British do, a belief that no American diplomat would utter in public for fear of offending other members of the European Union. But British officials who have been at the center of that daily interaction say the concern goes both ways.\u201cI worry that we will have less clout on our own: In the future we won\u2019t have as much influence on Europe\u2019s response to Putin\u2019s transgressions, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, or the E.U.\u2019s foreign and security policy,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, one of Britain\u2019s most experienced diplomats and, until January, ambassador to the United States. \u201cAnd we will be less able to ensure it is U.S.-friendly.\u201dHe added that without Britain\u2019s direct involvement, Europe was likely to be less enthusiastic about free trade.Still, Mr. Westmacott noted that \u201cwe should be able to cooperate much as in the past on counterterrorism, on intelligence, on cyber and on military issues,\u201d assuming that \u201cour economy does not shrink too much as markets, investors and the Scots take stock of Thursday\u2019s outcome.\u201dAll of which raises the question: If Britain can no longer play that indispensable role for Washington, surely there is another country that can? Perhaps, but it is hard to think of who.It is not a role Germany has shown a real willingness to step into. Its post-World War II ethos still holds it back from committing combat forces, and it is not a member of the inner circle of intelligence sharing called the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d a club made up of the Anglo victors of World War II. (The other three are Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) A lengthy negotiation to improve the intelligence relationship last year ended with only modest changes.For all of its cooperation with the United States on a variety of issues, Germany still harbors deep suspicions of the United States that were fueled by the revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, including the American surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone conversations.And American officials were shocked recently when Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, warned that recent NATO exercises to deter Russia from thinking about destabilizing Poland and the Baltic members of the military alliance amounted to \u201csaber-rattling and warmongering.\u201dFrance has also not been as natural a fit with the United States as Britain. While relations have changed drastically since the George W. Bush administration, Paris often goes its own way, including its recent strategy for restarting Israeli-Palestinian talks. The Italians, for their part, are too broke, the Netherlands is too small, and Poland does not yet have the clout of older NATO members.Moreover, there is a question of leadership.British leaders were the Europeans most closely aligned with the American negotiating position in the major trade and investment deal being hashed out between the United States and some of its largest trading partners.When Mr. Obama visited London in April, he warned voters that Britain would be excluded from the deal if it left the bloc and would \u201cgo to the end of the queue\u201d for its own bilateral trade agreement. But the United States would also lose Britain\u2019s voice in moderating Europe\u2019s trade demands.The intelligence challenges created by Brexit are more subtle. Bilateral cooperation will continue as tightly or more tightly than ever to try to prevent terrorism. But the hope that Britain could improve intelligence sharing among the major European powers \u2014 something that is sorely needed \u2014 is most likely dashed even as terrorism threats have risen.Over a lunch near the White House a few weeks ago, a senior intelligence official said the obvious solution to intelligence gaps was a far more powerful, Pan-European intelligence service.It is hard to imagine a new intelligence institution, however, without MI-6 and GCHQ \u2014 the British equivalents of the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. \u2014 playing a lead role. And given Britain\u2019s likely preoccupation with the Brexit fallout, it is far from clear how high a priority a new intelligence organization, or a rethinking of NATO strategy, would be for Britain.There is a counterargument that Britain could emerge as a stronger security partner for the United States, that it will value its role in NATO and other institutions all the more.\u201cNow that it has chosen to become a relatively marginal economic player on the international stage,\u201d he continued, \u201cit will have to look for new ways to demonstrate value in its partnership with the United States if it hopes to maintain anything like the \u2018special relationship\u2019 it has become accustomed to (and dependent on).\u201dBut even if Britain seeks a more active role in NATO, it may not be accepted as one by its other members; Britain has often been referred to as an American puppet \u2014 with other states noting that former Prime Minister Tony Blair followed Mr. Bush into Iraq with few questions.There is nothing permanent about political unions and alliances, of course, and some argue that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is not necessarily a calamity for Washington.As James F. Jeffrey, a former American diplomat in the Middle East, and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute wrote last week, \u201cThe U.S. and U.K. were bosom allies for 30 years before Britain joined the E.U.\u201dBut part of what made the special relationship special in an era of global diplomacy was Britain\u2019s ability to act for Washington with the Europeans, to bridge the gap. Now, as one White House official put it, the bridge has been wiped out by a surge that few predicted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Fell Off the Miracle Path", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR years now, Donald J. Trump has been sounding the alarm on China, calling it an economic bully that has been \u201ceating our lunch.\u201d The crux of Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep it cheap and give Chinese exports an unfair advantage. But that narrative is so last decade. China is now a threat to the United States not because it is strong but because it is fragile.Four key forces have been shaping the rise and fall of nations since the 2008 financial crisis, and none of them bode well for China. Debts have risen dangerously fast in the emerging world, especially in China. Trade growth has collapsed everywhere, a sharp blow to leading exporters, again led by China. Many countries are reverting to autocratic rule in an effort to fight the global slowdown, none more self-destructively than China. And, for reasons unrelated to the 2008 collapse, growth in the world\u2019s working-age population is slowing, and turned negative last year in China, depleting the work force.It will be difficult for any country to grow as rapidly as 6 percent, and all but impossible for China. Nevertheless, in an effort to exceed that target, Beijing is pumping debt into wasteful projects, and digging itself into a hole. The economy is now slowing and will decelerate further when the country is forced to reduce its debt burden, as inevitably it will be. The next step could be a deeper slowdown or even a financial crisis, which will have global repercussions because seven years of heavy stimulus have turned the world\u2019s second largest economy into a bloated giant.In Beijing, confidence has given way to a case of nerves. Local residents often sense trouble coming before foreign investors and are the first to flee before a crisis. Chinese moved a record $675 billion out of the country in 2015, some of it for purchases of foreign real estate. If China were eating America\u2019s lunch, its people would not be rushing to buy safe-haven apartments in New York or San Francisco. Far from conspiring to cheapen its currency, as Mr. Trump charges, Beijing is struggling to keep the weakening renminbi from falling more, which would further erode local confidence and make a crisis more likely.The seeds of China\u2019s current problems were planted in the months after the global economic crisis of 2008. When I visited Beijing in September of that year, just before the Wall Street implosion, the country\u2019s economy was slowing, but the city was calm. Beijing had hosted the Summer Olympics, and in preparation had temporarily shuttered smokestack industries and eased censorship. The skies were clear, the conversation much more candid than it is today.The nation had good reason to feel confident. Like Japan, South Korea and other Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economies, China had generated a long run of double-digit growth by investing in export industries. But Wen Jiabao, then prime minister, was not complacent. He was warning that after three decades of heavy industrialization, China was \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunbalanced,\u201d with too many factories belching too much smog. Many prominent Chinese recognized that with per-capita income rising above $8,000, their nation would face a natural slowdown, as Japan and South Korea had when they reached a similar middle-income level. Meanwhile, among outsiders, there was hopeful talk of how China would evolve into a democracy as it grew richer \u2014 again following the path of earlier Asian miracles.Then, two weeks after I left, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States, tipping the global economy into recession. Demand collapsed across the world, crushing export growth in China. The leadership in Beijing panicked, apparently fearing that if the recession reached its shores, social unrest would follow. Mr. Wen reversed course and doubled down on the old industrial model \u2014 fueling investment in factories with trillions in state lending and spending.At first, the bet appeared to work. In 2009, China managed once again to beat its longstanding growth target of 8 percent, as the West struggled to recover from its deep recession. The rapid spending unleashed by Beijing contrasted sharply with the relative gridlock in Washington and the global elite, gathering for their annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, in 2011, marveled at the benefits of state capitalism. China, they said, was proving that unchecked autocracies had an advantage in managing the economy, particularly in a crisis.But looking back, we can see that this was the moment China began to fall off the miracle path.As its debt mania progressed, more of the lending was diverted into wasteful speculation. Normally, frenzied borrowing occurs amid excitement about a new innovation like the internet. But this spree spread on conviction that Beijing, obsessed with hitting its growth target, would not let lenders or borrowers fail. More and more unqualified players got in the game. The state banks soon had to compete with \u201cshadow banks,\u201d including crowdfunding websites that offered ordinary people a chance to invest in debt for as little as one renminbi (15 cents), promising fantastic returns.Try as the Chinese authorities might to steer the money into industry, they could never fully commit to stopping shadow banks from financing an increasingly questionable array of borrowers speculating in real estate. When I visited Shanghai in August 2010, I was stunned to see apartment blocks rising two to three rows deep all along the 110-mile route to Hangzhou. Many of the biggest debtors are front companies set up by local governments to evade national regulators. Small cities are borrowing to build futuristic museums, aquatic centers and apartment blocks that exceed local demand and are often as empty as ghost towns.My research shows that during the 30 worst debt manias of the past 50 years, private debt \u2014 which in China is often held by local governments \u2014 rose over five years by at least 40 percentage points as a share of gross domestic product. In all 30 cases, the economy slowed sharply, typically by more than half, in the next five years.China\u2019s mania is now the largest ever in the postwar emerging world. After holding steady at around 150 percent of G.D.P. for much of the boom, China\u2019s public and private debts surged after Mr. Wen\u2019s about face in 2008, rising to 230 percent of G.D.P. by 2014. That 80-percentage-point increase is also more than three times the increase in the United States before its bubble collapsed in 2008. Since then, United States debt has held steady as a share of its economy. Though many Americans still think the nation is drowning in debt, its burden is much less worrisome than China\u2019s because it is not growing.Paradoxically, the authoritarian form of government that helped guide China to those years of economic growth may now be undermining its economic stability. My research suggests that compared with democracies, autocracies generate far more unstable growth, and that\u2019s the risk in China now. Looking at the available records going back to 1950 shows that extreme swings between fast and slow growth are much more common under autocratic regimes. On a list of 36 countries that have been whipsawed between rapid growth and recession throughout the postwar era, three out of four were autocracies.Because these governments face no check on their powers, they can force feed periods of strong growth. But they can also veer off in the wrong direction with no one to set them straight. In the early stages of China\u2019s boom under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing did what authoritarian governments do best, suppressing opposition to breakneck development, steering the people\u2019s savings toward building export factories and commandeering land to build the roads and bridges to bring the manufactured goods to market. But the same decision-making process, centralized in a small circle in Beijing, allowed the government to impulsively shift course in 2008 and push through the lending campaign that put China on the increasingly unstable path of more debt, and less growth.ON my recent trips to China, I keep looking for Beijing to snap back to reality, but in vain. As the economy grows more unstable, the authorities have tried to control the business cycle with an increasingly heavy hand that extends into its financial markets. In late 2014, hoping to give its struggling companies a new lift, Beijing began to praise buying stocks as a patriotic act. Millions of ordinary Chinese signed up to play the market for the first time, many unaided by a high school degree, and started borrowing to buy shares as prices rose. When the bubble burst last June, Beijing did not let it implode, as it had in 2008. It ordered people not to sell or even to speak critically of stocks. The market collapsed anyway.Afterward the Davos crowd finally started to question whether Beijing could simply command its economy to grow. It looked as if the lesson might be learned in China, too, but when I visited this April, authorities had begun a new stimulus campaign, and debt was still growing three times faster than the economy. Against this backdrop, residents spoke of dizzying price rises in Shanghai and Beijing real estate and in obscure markets like steel rebar futures. Their intention was to keep dancing until the borrowed money stopped flowing.The sputtering global economy is one shock away from slipping into recession. In the postwar period, every previous global recession started with a downturn in the United States, but the next one is likely to begin with a shock in China. Through heavy stimulus, China was the largest contributor to global growth this decade, but it is fragile. China\u2019s miracle growth period is over, and it now faces the curse of debt.Ruchir Sharma is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

{"Headline": "My Undocumented Mom, America\u2019s Housekeeper", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorONE of the earliest memories I have in New York City is of scrubbing toilets alongside my mother. She worked as a housekeeper for wealthy families and because she could not afford a babysitter, she would often take me with her. I would do my homework while catching glimpses of my mother as she was dusting television sets or folding bedsheets in homes that we would visit once a week.I remember the day that my mother walked off a job after the homeowner refused to pay her. I was taking a nap; my mom woke me up. She had been having an argument with the owner, who told her she should feel grateful to have a job that would let her take her child to work. My mom was being exploited, but she was undocumented, and there was nothing she could do.She has been undocumented for 16 years. In 2014, we thought this might finally change. President Obama announced a program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, which would have protected her from deportation for at least three years and allowed her to get a work permit.But Texas and 25 other states sued to keep the program from going into effect, calling it an abuse of power. For months my mom would call me and ask what was happening with the president\u2019s immigration plan. I would tell her, \u201cNothing new,\u201d and I could always sense her disappointment. Then the calls got less frequent. Thursday morning, I called her. I had to tell her that the Supreme Court had taken the issue on \u2026 and deadlocked. The president\u2019s program couldn\u2019t move forward. My mother still can\u2019t get a work permit, or relief from anxiety-ridden nights.My mother and I moved from Puebla, Mexico, to the United States in October 1999, and we have lived in New York ever since. My little sister was born here. In Puebla, my mother was a lawyer. Here she is part of the pool of undocumented immigrants who facilitate the lifestyles of so many people in the country that she calls home. It feels like we have spent more time in other people\u2019s homes than our own, cleaning, dusting, scrubbing, cooking, the same tasks that many women who migrate to the United States subsist on.From a young age, I understood my place in the world through the eyes of my mother. Her jobs required her to use cleaning products that burned her skin and blurred her vision. Her knees have scars from all the years scrubbing floors. Housekeepers are the heroes of the immigrant economy \u2014 they do their work silently, efficiently, and find money on the table after the job is done. There is no exchange of stories. None of the people whose houses my mom has cleaned know that she was a lawyer, that she is an intellectual and passionate person; they don\u2019t know that she crossed a treacherous border, or that she lives with the constant fear of deportation.My mother and others like her are pushed to the background of conversations about immigration reform. When people talk about who \u201cdeserves\u201d to have a path to citizenship, they like to talk about young people who came to this country as children and therefore, most now can agree, don\u2019t deserve to be punished for it. As a result, in 2012, President Obama established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects people like me from deportation.But if I don\u2019t deserve to be punished, then my mother doesn\u2019t, either. Because she brought me here, I got a chance to go school, I got a chance to put down roots and build friendships, even while my childhood was vastly different from those of many, and my days were spent in the homes of strangers helping my mom fold and clean.As I got older, I got the chance to escape that reality. Thanks to the childhood arrivals program, I have a work permit and a good job. My mom, however, still cleans houses; my mom is still undocumented; and my mom is still criminalized by an administration that continues to deport the most vulnerable members of our community. Thanks to the Supreme Court, that\u2019s not going to change anytime soon.We will have to keep fighting to live without fear in this place we call home. But in moments like these, of sadness and defeat, I think of the night that we crossed the border. As we were running, I fell and for a moment looked up to the night sky, scared that I would be left behind. But my mom was there, she was there all along \u2014 she picked me up, and we started running again.Luba Cort\u00e9s is a youth organizer for Make the Road New York, an immigrant-rights organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Envy Lures Egyptian Teenagers to Europe and the Migrant Life", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byBURG MIGHEIZIL, Egypt \u2014 In the raggedy fishing village of Burg Migheizil on Egypt\u2019s north coast, where the mighty Nile pours silently into the sea, restless teenage boys are plotting their escape, lured by illusory dreams of money and glamour.One 15-year-old said that five of his friends had already made it to Italy after perilous sea journeys that started in the hush of night. Some worked for the smugglers, piloting boats filled with paying migrants in exchange for free passage. Others paid their way.Nearly all sent home, on Facebook, envy-inducing photos and bravura accounts of new lives: money, girls, flashy new sneakers. The teenager, Ashraf, who asked not to be identified because his father worked for the local government, said he intends to leave soon, too.Experts are struggling to understand what lies behind the soaring figures. Unlike other migrant countries, Egypt does not suffer a raging civil war or debilitating poverty. Instead they point to a crippling cocktail of factors: a stalling local economy; permissive Italian laws that indirectly encourage child migration; a proliferation of smuggling networks; and El Dorado-like examples of other Egyptian teenagers who have made it.The teenagers are oblivious to the calamitous images of death at sea \u2014 capsizing boats, bodies floating to shore \u2014 that dominate news coverage. Instead, they fixate on images of apparent success sent back via social media \u2014 even if those images often mask a grittier and more dangerous reality that includes exploitation, petty crime and prostitution.In Burg Migheizil, which has been devastated by decades of overfishing in Egyptian waters, smuggling has become the anchor of the local economy. At night, buses from Alexandria and Cairo bump through the dusty streets, carrying migrants on their way to a nearby beach, where they are hustled onto waiting boats.Unemployed fishermen moonlight as smugglers, piloting boats across the Mediterranean. Farmers harbor African and Syrian migrants before they clamber aboard. The local shipyard has enjoyed a small boom, as laborers fashion steel-hulled vessels that carry people instead of fish.None are breaking the law \u2014 under a quirk of Egyptian law, smuggling people is not illegal.Often, though, the trade takes a dark turn. In early June, villagers said, dozens of African migrants were stranded there after an argument between rival human traffickers caused them to miss their boat.Weeks before that, two bodies washed up on a local beach. Egyptian news reports identified the dead as a 20-year-old Egyptian and a Somali man.In Europe, many smugglers end up in jail. In interviews, several tearful parents and spouses told of how their young relatives had been arrested by the European police. A local fishermen\u2019s group said that more than 4,000 men from Kafr el Sheikh, the governorate that includes Burg Migheizil, have been imprisoned or detained in Europe on smuggling charges.The families of departed teenagers are caught between their desire for their children to find a better life and regret that they have left. At her home at the end of an alleyway, Nasara Shawky clutched a photo of her two sons, 16 and 17 years old, now in Rome. \u201cI feel so lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cThis entire village has been destroyed by the sea.\u201dFor restless young men, little can deter their dreams of flight. Ehab Nasser, 21, said he hated his job as a fisherman. Life at sea was cruel and lonely, he said \u2014 long trips into the dangerous waters of war-torn Libya in search of fish, often for as little as $100 a month. Two years ago he smuggled himself into Greece, after pawning his mother\u2019s wedding dowry, at a price of 2,500 euros (about $2,800).That trip ended in a Greek detention center, and with eventual deportation back to Egypt. But he will try again soon. His eyes lit up as he showed a picture on Facebook of his neighbor Ismail, now in London. In the picture, a young man fanned a wad of British pounds, his thumb raised, while casually dragging on a cigarette.\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.But every success story is countered by a tear-stained episode. At a farmhouse surrounding by towering date palms, Mohamed El Ghatani, a farmer, told of how he learned that his 16-year-old nephew, Amir, drowned on his way to Europe last month.Only two years earlier, Mr. Ghatani said, his own son died in the same manner. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said, his eyes reddening at the memory. \u201cThey think they\u2019ll get to Europe and find an amazing life. That\u2019s not true, of course, but they don\u2019t know that.\u201dThe main problem, said Naela Gabr, a senior diplomat who heads Egypt\u2019s official efforts to stem illegal migration, is Italian law, which forbids the involuntary deportation of unaccompanied minors.The Italian state provides foreign minors with schooling and temporary papers. Once they reach the age of 18, they can apply for permanent residency \u2014 a powerful draw for families to send their teenage boys.A lot of the time, though, it doesn\u2019t work so simply, said Ms. Valastro, the aid worker in Rome. Desperate to start repaying their parents\u2019 loans, many Egyptian migrants seek to start work immediately, which hurts their chances of getting schooling or official papers.Last year, some reports described Egyptian youths selling drugs or engaging in prostitution at Rome\u2019s main train station. But mostly, Ms. Valastro said, they end up working for pitiful wages in restaurants or fruit markets.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand the meaning of the word \u2018exploitation,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey think these people are helping them because they are giving them money, even if it\u2019s just 10 euros for eight hours work.\u201dNow the Egyptian government is taking the fight to Facebook. Ms. Gabr said she had prepared a public-relations campaign to persuade young Egyptians not to leave their homeland.But Ehab Nasser, the restless young fisherman, said he was determined to leave regardless, and his family was firmly behind him.His mother, Azza Abdel Fattah, gestured at the room of flaking paint and crumbling walls they were sitting in. \u201cWe wanted him to get to Europe and build a future and save us from this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what we are praying for.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is Just the Start of the Brexit\u2019s Economic Disaster", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 A few weeks before Britons voted on whether to remain part of the European Union, Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign, was asked why he should be trusted over the overwhelming number of economists and international authorities who opposed Brexit. \u201cPeople in this country have had enough of experts,\u201d he replied.Experts are, of course, known to make mistakes. But in this case, the people who voted for Brexit will pay a big price for ignoring economic expertise. The harmful effects of this vote are both immediate and lasting.Britons are already worse off. The pound has \u2014 so far \u2014 plunged by nearly 9 percent against the dollar, slashing the value of British assets, with higher import prices likely to follow. The stock market has also taken a hit. The prices of property, most British people\u2019s main asset, are almost certain to fall, too. While Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has already pledged 250 billion pounds (about $345 billion) to support the financial system and has said he could offer more if necessary, central bankers cannot protect against an enduring economic shock.Rarely have businesses faced such uncertainty. Britain\u2019s economy had already slowed as they put investment decisions on hold ahead of the referendum. Now, a country renowned for its political and legal stability is descending into chaos. The future prime minister is unknown, as is the direction his or her policies will take. The favorite to replace David Cameron, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who opportunistically campaigned for Brexit, styles himself as pro-market and pro-globalization, but in the lead-up to the vote he said he supports curbs on European Union migration, tariffs on Chinese steel and higher public spending. The future terms on which Britain will trade with both the European Union and all the countries with which it has negotiated trade deals on Britain\u2019s behalf are uncertain. Domestic regulations on everything from finance to environmental protection may change.All that uncertainty is amplified by the prospect of a second referendum on Scottish independence, which may this time be won. In Northern Ireland, the political party Sinn Fein has already called for a referendum on a united Ireland.Faced with such uncertainty, businesses are likely to continue to put investments on hold. Consumers may pull back, too. The resulting downturn will cause the government\u2019s budget deficit, already large, to swell. The pound\u2019s depreciation, which might have been expected to boost exports, is unlikely to do much to cushion the blow. Its huge decline in 2008 failed to boost exports and Brexit will dent them.This unpredictable situation will not be brief. Once triggered, the formal process of leaving the European Union is supposed to take two years. But extricating the union\u2019s second-biggest economy from 43 years of European Union legislation is a daunting task.Negotiating a new trade relationship with the European Union is equally tricky. Britain seems certain to lose access to the single market \u2014 with which it does nearly half its trade \u2014 because this is conditional on accepting the free movement of people and contributing to the European Union\u2019s budget. (These were key issues for pro-Brexit voters.) That will jeopardize the foreign investment and good jobs predicated on single-market membership. Britain-based financial institutions will lose their rights to operate freely across the European Union.Brexit\u2019s supporters are deluded when they argue that Britain could cherry pick what it likes about the European Union and discard the rest. Since exports to the European Union (13 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) matter much more to Britain than exports to Britain (3 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) do to the European Union, the European Union will call the shots. Other governments have every incentive to be tough, both to steal a competitive advantage and to deter others from following Britain out the door.A fallback position is trading with Europe on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, as the United States does. But that entails tariffs on good exports \u2014 up to 10 percent on car exports, for example, most of which go to the European Union \u2014 as well as non-tariff barriers that gum up trade. It offers little access to Europe\u2019s markets in services, in which Britain specializes. Less open markets will stunt competition, crimping productivity growth and living standards.Brexit\u2019s supporters claim that a deregulated Britain that trades with the rest of the world would prosper once unshackled from Brussels\u2019s overregulation and protectionism. But Britain has the least regulated labor markets in the European Union and the second-least regulated product markets, so any potential benefits from deregulation are likely to be meager. Moreover, Britain is likely to end up with worse access to markets in the rest of the world. While it won\u2019t be hamstrung by protectionist interests in the European Union, its relatively smaller economy, largely open markets and desperation for new deals will weaken its clout in trade negotiations.The young, the higher educated and city dwellers, the most dynamic members of Britain\u2019s economy, voted to Remain. They were outvoted by the old, the less educated and non-urban English, who often rely on taxpayer largess. With economic opportunities stunted, everyone will suffer for Leave voters wrongly blaming hard-working, taxpaying European migrants for everything they dislike about modern Britain and wrongly trusting economic charlatans like Mr. Gove.Philippe Legrain is the author of \u201cEuropean Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics Are in a Mess and How to Put Them Right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Cameron\u2019s Brexit Bust", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byLondon \u2014 FOR a sense of how historically important Thursday\u2019s referendum result in Britain is, consider the following. The last time British voters were formally consulted on continued membership of what was then called the Common Market, in 1975, mainstream politicians of the major parties joined forces with experts and establishment figures to persuade Britons that leaving was too great a risk. The \u201cIn\u201d campaign prevailed.This time, 41 years later, an almost identical strategy was adopted by the Remain camp. The Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, led the effort, with the notional support of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and a phalanx of heavyweight economists and world leaders (including, most theatrically, President Obama). Open letters signed by dozens of accomplished figures in their respective fields urged the voters to shun the perils of Brexit.In 1975, the British people deferred to such authorities. In 2016, they ignored them.Beneath these specific imperatives lurked more general sentiments \u2014 in particular, a contempt for the political class and a disdain for the self-styled aristocracy of experts. However much the Remain camp warned of the economic risks, the voters seemed more animated by the politics of identity and by the conviction that no government could control immigration while Britain was a member of the European Union.For decades, the economy has been the principal issue in the polling booth, according to a scale of priorities evidenced as recently as the general election of May 2015, when Mr. Cameron beat Mr. Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, Ed Miliband, with a promise to finish the job of repairing the nation\u2019s finances. But this vote was different. Economic peril was emphatically less important than the European Union\u2019s lack of accountability (its famous democratic deficit) and the British government\u2019s failure to follow through on promises to restrict immigration.This campaign has been pockmarked by xenophobia and thinly concealed racism: a deeply disturbing development in mainstream politics. True, there was widespread disgust at the poster introduced a week before polling day by Nigel Farage, leader of the reactionary U.K. Independence Party, which depicted hordes of migrants \u2014 mostly of apparent Middle Eastern origin \u2014 as if lining up to enter Britain under the label \u201cbreaking point.\u201d But Thursday\u2019s referendum result was every bit as much Mr. Farage\u2019s victory as a triumph for Vote Leave, the more genteel campaign whose leading figures included Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and now favorite to succeed Mr. Cameron as party leader, and Michael Gove, the Conservative justice secretary and, until recently, one of Mr. Cameron\u2019s most trusted lieutenants.The prime minister knew it was possible that he would lose the referendum and had drawn up plans in case his own members of Parliament demanded a vote of confidence in him. A few weeks ago, one of Mr. Cameron\u2019s closest allies walked me through the strategy, which, this person assured me, would place the prime minister\u2019s position beyond doubt and enable him to retire from leadership at a time of his choosing.The unforgiving light of Friday morning made a nonsense of such plans. Having lost the referendum, Mr. Cameron could scarcely stay in Downing Street. All authority had drained to a government within a government, run by the Johnson-Gove axis. How could Mr. Cameron plausibly negotiate Britain\u2019s exit from the union with our soon-to-be-former European partners when this was an outcome he had resolutely opposed during the campaign? As he weighed his options, it became obvious he had to go.As a student of political change, Mr. Cameron also knew that \u2014 in a single night \u2014 his cohort of followers had been supplanted. The Conservative Party, formerly managed by the prime minister\u2019s modernizing clique, is now wholly owned by the Brexiteers, whose direction is radically different.The so-called mods who took over in 2005 when Mr. Cameron swept to the leadership sought to make the party more in step with today\u2019s world, more pluralist in perspective, more environmentally aware and more sympathetic to women, gay voters and ethnic minorities. The Brexiteers, in sharp contrast, are the ideological grandchildren of the Thatcherites, longing to \u201cget out of Europe\u201d and convinced that Britain\u2019s future is as an independent, buccaneering nation of entrepreneurs, unhampered by the wet cement of communitarian obligations.They see the sun finally setting on the British Empire and applaud its descent. For them, small is beautiful. That goes for the state, too, by the way. Those voters who were taken in by Leave\u2019s apparent promises to fund health care services with the \u00a3350 million (about $480 million) no longer supposedly sent every week to the European Union are in for a shock.As the Conservative Party now metamorphoses, Labour has comprehensively abandoned the social-democratic center-ground from which it won three successive elections between 1997 and 2005. Indeed, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s followers and the Brexiteers have more in common than they would care to admit: a shared antipathy to the old political elite, crony capitalism and the sheer pace of global change.In leaving the world\u2019s largest single market, Britain has resigned from the grown-ups\u2019 table and effectively kicked out a prime minister voters had re-elected only 13 months earlier. As tantrums go, this was Olympic-class. So the referendum\u2019s winners had better deliver what they promised \u2014 and fast. The languorous talk of taking the process of exit slowly and cautiously is deluded. Having voted for change, the electorate will expect it quickly. Having demanded that Britain \u201ctake back control\u201d of immigration, they will not forgive backsliding.Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a political columnist for The Guardian and The Evening Standard and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Bond Yield Goes Negative on \u2018Brexit\u2019 Fears and Central Bank Policies", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 At first it seems illogical to buy bonds at prices practically guaranteed to lose money.But there are good reasons that the yields on 10-year German bonds dipped below zero percent on Tuesday for the first time, meaning investors are essentially paying Berlin to keep their money.The European Central Bank is also printing money to buy bonds in an effort to bolster the eurozone\u2019s weak growth. That has pushed prices higher, and made yields go down.While many central banks are pushing for low or even negative rates, the new world order could create unexpected consequences. Much of the global financial system is based on above-zero interest rates. Banks, pension funds and insurance companies depend on interest-bearing investments for a big part of their profits.Stock prices around the world have been falling since last week, and European shares are near three-month lows. Some investors are preferring to hoard cash until conditions improve.The surge of fear lately stems from the so-called Brexit vote. Recent polls are showing that support in Britain for leaving the European Union is on the rise: More voters are backing a departure from the bloc than are opting to stay. If Britain drops out, the future of the European Union could be in doubt, and financial markets would be in for a rough ride.Top officials of the European Central Bank, including Mario Draghi, the president, have said they have contingency plans if voters in Britain choose to leave the bloc. The central bank is battle-tested after enduring a series of crises since 2007, and it already has mechanisms in place to ensure that banks and businesses will be able to get access to all the pounds or euros they need. \u201cThe E.C.B. is ready for any outcome,\u201d Mr. Draghi said this month.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dStill, investors are nervous. And the cash \u2014 or liquidity in technical investment terms \u2014 that is sloshing around the eurozone looking for a home is not helping. For that, the European Central Bank is partly to thank, or to blame, depending on your point of view. For a year, the central bank has effectively been printing money and using it to buy government bonds. This month, the bank began buying corporate debt as well, spending about 80 billion euros, or around $90 billion, per month.All that buying drives down interest rates across the board, more so for the safest assets. Investors trust Germany because the government has a budget surplus, a healthy economy and a long history of fulfilling its obligations.The low-inflation environment is another important part of the equation for investors. At least for now, bondholders do not need to worry about their money losing too much value. When prices are weak, investors can even come out ahead despite paying negative interest rates. The real buying power of their euros can increase enough to more than compensate.The outlook is so dismal that some investors may be betting that yields will fall even further. The yield on the German 10-year bond went as low as minus 0.03 percent at midday. An investor who bought at that price could make a profit if market rates dropped below that level. In June 2015, the yield was 0.92 percent, a rate that once would have been regarded as ridiculously low.From the European Central Bank\u2019s point of view, low interest rates are the whole point. The bank set a precedent for negative interest rates two years ago when it began charging banks to keep money in its virtual vaults, instead of paying them interest as it did in the past. The so-called negative deposit rate is currently minus 0.4 percent.The lower borrowing costs take pressure off government finances and ripple through financial markets. Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds, for example, were trading at yields around 1.5 percent on Tuesday, compared with more than 7 percent in 2012.In theory, businesses and consumers will spend more, stimulating the economy. Low rates also help depress the value of a currency, bolstering exports. And they increase the attractiveness of stock markets, which are considered riskier investments than bonds.But very low interest rates also create tensions. In Germany, where many people are savers rather than borrowers, low rates make it hard for them to earn a return. Some economists, particularly in Germany, argue that central bank policies have encouraged dithering by political leaders in countries like Italy that need to do more to improve the performance of their economies by removing obstacles to hiring and firing or by investing in infrastructure.\u201cThe E.C.B. has allowed politicians to sit on their hands with regard to growth-enhancing reforms and necessary fiscal consolidation,\u201d David Folkerts-Landau, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients recently.Advertisement"}

Workers in Britain, many of whom have seen a decline in their standard of living while the very rich in their country have become much richer, have turned their backs on the European Union and a globalized economy that is failing them and their children.Could this rejection of the current form of the global economy happen in the United States? You bet it could.During my campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, I\u2019ve visited 46 states. What I saw and heard on too many occasions were painful realities that the political and media establishment fail even to recognize.On my campaign, I\u2019ve talked to workers unable to make it on $8 or $9 an hour; retirees struggling to purchase the medicine they need on $9,000 a year of Social Security; young people unable to afford college. I also visited the American citizens of Puerto Rico, where some 58 percent of the children live in poverty and only a little more than 40 percent of the adult population has a job or is seeking one.Let\u2019s be clear. The global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change.But we do not need change based on the demagogy, bigotry and anti-immigrant sentiment that punctuated so much of the Leave campaign\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 and is central to Donald J. Trump\u2019s message.We need a president who will vigorously support international cooperation that brings the people of the world closer together, reduces hypernationalism and decreases the possibility of war. We also need a president who respects the democratic rights of the people, and who will fight for an economy that protects the interests of working people, not just Wall Street, the drug companies and other powerful special interests.We need to fundamentally reject our \u201cfree trade\u201d policies and move to fair trade. Americans should not have to compete against workers in low-wage countries who earn pennies an hour. We must defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We must help poor countries develop sustainable economic models.We need to end the international scandal in which large corporations and the wealthy avoid paying trillions of dollars in taxes to their national governments.We need to create tens of millions of jobs worldwide by combating global climate change and by transforming the world\u2019s energy system away from fossil fuels.We need international efforts to cut military spending around the globe and address the causes of war: poverty, hatred, hopelessness and ignorance.The notion that Donald Trump could benefit from the same forces that gave the Leave proponents a majority in Britain should sound an alarm for the Democratic Party in the United States. Millions of American voters, like the Leave supporters, are understandably angry and frustrated by the economic forces that are destroying the middle class.In this pivotal moment, the Democratic Party and a new Democratic president need to make clear that we stand with those who are struggling and who have been left behind.

Rumbling and roaring his way across California, Senator Bernie Sanders brought his political revolution to the neighborhood of Goofy and Mickey.\u201cAnybody here work for Disney?\u201d he asked the crowd at the Anaheim Convention Center. Dozens of hands went up.\u201cAnybody here making a living wage working for Disney?\u201d No hands went up. After a shower of boos, Sanders continued, showing little joy in his role as socialist scourge. While Disney paid its C.E.O., Robert A. Iger, more than $40 million in total compensation last year, he noted, adults in mouse costumes were living out of motels, making $11 an hour.He predicted that ABC, owned by Disney, would not report those remarks. What would you expect of the corporate media? But in fact, the local affiliate of the company, ABC 7, reported the dig on its news.A day later, Donald J. Trump showed up at the same place. His supporters, mostly older whites, clashed outside with protesters, mostly younger Latinos. All the Trump rally appeared to do was unleash a spasm of airborne hatred.Sanders, by contrast, made his point about the great economic disparity in American life. His rallies in California \u2014 nearly two dozen in all \u2014 have drawn the expected crowds: young white Bernie bros in man buns, aging lefties in mildly subversive T-shirts \u2014 but also a fair amount of Hispanics and curious political neophytes.So, mission accomplished, yes? The Bern has been felt, the establishment rattled. Voters are decrying a \u201crigged economy\u201d run by 1-percenters. Time to go back to Vermont, resuming the virtual anonymity that has characterized his quarter-century in Congress.Not so fast. The Bernistas and the candidate himself may be on something of a late-stage kamikaze mission. The 74-year-old senator is predicting a win here on Tuesday, and with it enough momentum to sway unpledged delegates at what he says will be a \u201cmessy\u201d convention in Philadelphia.That the math is overwhelmingly against him, or that he\u2019s now on a reckless venture, does not seem to matter. As Stephen Colbert noted, Sanders promised to campaign in all 50 states \u2014 \u201c51 if you count the state of denial.\u201d The fear among other Democrats is that the Bernie-or-bust crowd will bring Hillary Clinton down, either by leaving her badly weakened or by not voting at all in the fall. One poll in May showed that 20 percent of Sanders supporters would actually vote for Trump.To this \u2014 a scenario that would produce a billionaire president who does not believe in climate change, and would build a police state to round up 11 million undocumented immigrants \u2014 many Sanders supporters respond with an agonized shrug.\u201cI cannot, right now, bring myself to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Nora Belrose, who dropped her studies at Purdue to become a field organizer for Sanders in the Bay Area. She was getting ready to knock on doors in San Francisco, one of dozens of daily Sanders grass roots activities \u2014 from a \u201cBeers and Queers for Bernie\u201d event to a \u201cBern the Mic\u201d hip-hop fund-raiser. Whether any of this will last longer than an Instagram video is another question.\u201cHillary is just too much about the money,\u201d said Robert Sturgeon, who is undecided for the general election. He used to work at a Hyundai dealership in Southern California, though he is now unemployed, and likes what he hears from Sanders.His complaint about money is another issue that Sanders has forced the Democratic Party he now wants to lead to confront. The party\u2019s current leaders, says Sanders, are all about \u201crunning around into rich people\u2019s homes and raising money.\u201dAnd if Clinton\u2019s pattern of doing just that \u2014 in between rallies of her own with regular folks in California \u2014 is a concession to the age of dark money billionaires, the Bernie brigades want nothing to do with it.It took a party elder, one of the original anti-establishment crusaders, Gov. Jerry Brown, to try to bring Democratic dead-enders back home \u2014 Moonbeam to ground control. \u201cThis is no time for Democrats to keep fighting each other,\u201d the popular governor wrote on Tuesday, in an open letter announcing his support for Clinton.Clinton\u2019s delegate lead will most likely push her past the nomination threshold when voting ends in New Jersey on Tuesday \u2014 three hours before polls close in California. That margin is \u201cinsurmountable,\u201d Brown wrote, leaving Clinton as the one \u201cto stop the dangerous candidacy of Donald Trump.\u201dBrown hinted at not just the reality disconnect of Sanders\u2019s followers, but of something fundamentally undemocratic about the senator\u2019s long-shot endgame. Clinton, no matter how you dice the numbers, has won approximately three million more votes than Sanders. Playing by the existing rules, she also has that \u201cinsurmountable\u201d delegate lead. Sanders wants the much-loathed party establishment to ignore Clinton\u2019s popular vote majority and award the nomination to him because of better poll numbers.\u201cDo you trust the establishment media?\u201d asked Cenk Uygur, host of \u201cThe Young Turks,\u201d an online news show. He posed this question at several Sanders rallies, warming up crowds with the closing pitch of the Bernie brigades.\u201cNoooooooo!\u201d\u201cThe establishment media has been telling us that Hillary Clinton is the more electable candidate against Donald Trump. Find me one poll where Bernie is behind.\u201dIndeed, Sanders has been crushing Trump in nearly all the recent matchups, while Clinton is barely ahead, or even losing in some. Clinton supporters argue that if the full force of Republican opposition were thrown at him \u2014 going after an aging socialist whose plans for free college and health care are no more thought out than a bumper sticker \u2014 he\u2019d wither. It\u2019s a debatable point.If Sanders were to concede at last after Tuesday, even if he won California, he could boast of having moved the Democratic Party to the populist left.On trade, his critique that global deals favor corporate interests at the expense of working people is ascendant. This may be his strongest argument for drawing in some of Trump\u2019s disaffected white voters, one that Clinton has already tried to incorporate into her campaign.His blasts at the money-and-lobbyist wing of his party have prompted many Democrats to take a long, hard look at who they are supposed to represent \u2014 a well-heeled, well-educated governing class, or something closer to the people at the lower end.Rule changes are likely to come at the convention, with less power for superdelegates in the future, and more open primaries. And no doubt, what Sanders has set in motion is not going to curdle in Vermont after the convention.\u201cIf we lose California, we\u2019ve still won, because Bernie has done something that nobody else has done this year \u2014 set the tone,\u201d said Dan O\u2019Neal, a Sanders delegate from Arizona, who was following his candidate around California. For O\u2019Neal, the fall election is personal: His stepdaughter, a Latina without citizenship, would face deportation under Trump\u2019s roundup plan.O\u2019Neal says he would never vote for Trump, and he believes even the most zealous and self-righteous of Sanders supporters will come around on Clinton, united in their fear of a Trump presidency. Still, he wants to feel the Bern one more time on June 7.As does the candidate. On Tuesday night, Sanders raced from a rally in Oakland to Oracle Arena, where the Golden State Warriors were in the midst of an unlikely comeback, after being down 3 games to 1.\u201cA good omen for our campaign,\u201d he said after the Golden State victory put them in the N.B.A. finals. And when asked if his presence was the difference, he smiled at reporters, for once seeming to enjoy himself. \u201cWhat other explanation is there?\u201dAdvertisement"}

They pay less at the pump because New Jersey\u2019s 14.5-cent-a-gallon gas tax is one of the lowest in the country, but it is insufficient to improve or maintain the state\u2019s roads, bridges and rails.The only sensible solution is to raise the gas tax, which is now being proposed by a bipartisan group of state legislators. Their plan is to bring New Jersey\u2019s tax rate from 14.5 cents a gallon to 37.5 cents a gallon, possibly as soon as this summer. That would still be lower than the 42.4-cent gas tax per gallon in New York and 50.3 cents in Pennsylvania.One problem with the package \u2014 always a problem with legislative horse trading \u2014 is that it includes an unrelated measure to phase out the estate tax by 2020. This regressive move would cost New Jersey at least $540 million a year. New Jersey currently taxes estates larger than $675,000, and levies an inheritance tax on beneficiaries who are not direct family members. The inheritance tax, which brings in more than $400 million a year, will remain.Democrats, who control both houses in New Jersey, are agreeing to the estate tax cut to win enough Republican support on the gas tax to override an expected veto by Gov. Chris Christie.Other measures in this package would cut taxes on retirement benefits and expand the earned-income tax credit for the working poor. But eliminating the estate tax would be a very costly mistake. It\u2019s a shame that New Jersey lawmakers have managed to tie an important and necessary gas tax increase that will help the state\u2019s economy with a pointless giveaway to the state\u2019s wealthiest residents.Advertisement"}

More than 33 million people in Britain use Facebook each month, according to estimates by eMarketer, a research company.A few data points about the vast online conversation before the vote suggest that the people supporting the \u201cleave\u201d campaign were far more engaged on the issue than their opponents on social media.Using data pulled from CrowdTangle, a social media analytics firm that has a partnership with Facebook, The New York Times ranked Facebook pages that had the most engagement \u2014 how many people liked, shared and commented on posts \u2014 around the term \u201cEuropean Union\u201d over the last 30 days.Seven of the top 20 pages with the most engagement around \u201cEuropean Union,\u201d including the top two, were explicitly pro-exit. Together, these seven pages produced more than 1.3 million interactions \u2014 including the page for Nigel Farage, a leading proponent of the \u201cleave\u201d campaign, at No. 6.Only two pages \u2014 those of the group Britain Stronger in Europe, No. 8, and the British Prime Minister David Cameron, No. 18 \u2014 were clearly associated with \u201cremain\u201d campaigns, and together, they accounted for just under 150,000 interactions.A search for \u201cBrexit,\u201d the widely used shorthand for the vote, produced a similar ranking. Other top pages included British and American news organizations that had broad news coverage, as well as pro-leave and pro-remain opinion columns.An analysis of two opposing campaign pages underscores the wide gap in reader activity. By Friday, a primary page for the \u201cremain\u201d campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe, had passed 558,000 followers. Its close counterpart \u2014 Leave. EU \u2014 led in followers, at just over 767,000. But the pages\u2019 total engagement figures, which approximate total conversations around all their posts, were far more disparate.Over the last six months, posts on \u201cremain\u201d pages resulted in more than 3.3 million interactions \u2014 that is likes, shares and comments \u2014 averaging about 475,000 a month. The \u201cleave\u201d page produced more than 11 million, or about three times as many.Between these groups, the official \u201cleave\u201d message, in other words, landed harder and most likely spread further on Facebook by a large margin.This month, Vyacheslav Polonski, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, published a study of Brexit campaigns\u2019 activity on Instagram. Mr. Polonski analyzed the activities of over 15,000 users who engaged in the referendum debate.Social media, by nature, is both a catalyst and a place for conversation. As such, the apparent dominance of pro-leave posts on Facebook and Instagram is neither a pure reflection of popular will nor a product of the services, but more likely something in between.A full picture of voter sentiment on social media is visible only to the social media companies themselves.

There are no picturesque, rolling fields, no tractors tilling soil; there is no white farmhouse or red barn. For that matter, there is no soil, or sunlight.The ability to grow in such a small space is the result of hydroponics, a system in which a plant\u2019s roots sit in nutrient-rich water instead of soil.Microgreens \u2014 the first, tiny greens on plants like arugula, radishes and bok choy \u2014 can go from seed to harvest in less than two weeks. That enables Farmbox Greens to compete on price against produce delivered from far away.\u201cWe are fresher and our greens last 20 to 30 percent longer than those grown outside the area,\u201d said Mr. Albert, who co-owns the farm with his wife, Lindsay Sidlauskas.It has revenue of under $500,000, but was profitable enough in 2014 that Mr. Albert quit his day job as a landscape architect to farm full time. He now has three employees and sells his greens to about 50 restaurants in the Seattle area, a local grocery chain and four weekly farmers\u2019 markets.Energy costs are still a significant barrier to success, making few vertical farms in the United States profitable. Those that are tend to be smaller ones.\u201cZhanna had gone to the grocery store and bought some heirloom tomatoes. They were about $7 a pound,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018I could grow those.\u2019\u201dHe converted a 10-foot-by-15-foot bedroom in their house into a vertical farm. He raises 80 different varieties of microgreens that are sold to about a dozen local restaurants.Mr. Hountz said the farm generated about $120,000 in income, and he did not plan to expand. \u201cWe want to keep it a mom-and-pop operation,\u201d he said.Vertical farming uses no chemical pesticides and far less water and fertilizer than traditional farms, but energy costs can be high. Even the best LED lights have only a 50 percent efficiency rate, said Bruce Bugbee, a professor of crop physiology at Utah State University who studies controlled environment agriculture. That means half the electricity is converted to heat, not light.\u201cTransportation costs account for about 4 percent of the energy in the food system,\u201d Professor Bugbee said. \u201cThe energy for electric lights is much greater than that.\u201dThe upshot is that indoor farming can produce as much as 20 times the amount of food per unit area as conventional outdoor farming, said Gene Giacomelli, the director of the Controlled Environment Agriculture Center and a professor in agricultural and biosystems engineering at the University of Arizona in Tucson. As these farms scale up, however, they will need more electricity, not just for lighting but to run equipment like pumps and fans, Mr. Giacomelli said.Greens are grown hydroponically, in columns of stackable trays six levels high under \u201cfrequency-specific\u201d induction lights. The light frequency used dictates what nutrient mix the plant gets, said Milan Kluko, Green Spirit\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.Green Spirit runs its system mostly on off-peak energy, from 7:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m., when rates are 30 percent lower. The frequency-specific LED lights allowed the company to cut energy use 45 percent in the last six months, while crop yields have increased by about 40 percent.\u201cThat\u2019s been a huge breakthrough for us,\u201d Mr. Kluko said. The farm\u2019s electric bill is about $7,000 a month now, and will most likely drop to $5,000 a month by year\u2019s end, he said.The farm employs 11 people and produces about 5,000 pounds of mixed greens a month (7,000 pounds a month in the summer), selling to restaurants and retailers within a 100-mile radius. It has raised $1.5 million from investors and its annual sales are more than $1 million.Such successes are prompting other vertical farming operations to grow, and grow big.When the cost of LED lighting decreased, the company changed the greenhouse into a vertical, indoor stacked system, using shade cloth to block light and mimic a warehouse environment, said Jason Green, a co-founder and chief executive.Edenworks, which is not profitable, has received $1.5 million in funding and intends to build a 10,000 square-foot vertical farm in a vacant Brooklyn warehouse, which is expected to open before year\u2019s end. Mr. Green said it should produce 130,000 pounds of leafy greens and 50,000 pounds of fish annually.Yet profitability can be elusive for aquaponic farming. According to a 2015 Department of Agriculture study on the economics of aquaponics, raising fish indoors is two to three times as expensive as raising fish in open ponds.Still, Mr. Green and his competitors are optimistic about the future of vertical farming. David Rosenberg, the co-founder and chief executive of AeroFarms in Newark, said although his business was not profitable, he believed that would change when it got larger. \u201cYou really need economies of scale for this to work, to address a host of complexities,\u201d he said.An earlier version of the photo caption accompanying this article misspelled the surname of the owners of City-Hydro.

He said he was now \u201cterrified\u201d about the country\u2019s economic prospects.Louise Driscoll, a 21-year-old barista in London, spent most of the day crying. \u201cI had a bad feeling in my gut,\u201d she said of Britain\u2019s referendum on Europe. \u201cWhat do we do now? I\u2019m very scared.\u201d Her parents both voted to leave the bloc, she said, and \u201cwill probably be gloating.\u201dAccording to pre-election surveys by the polling organization Survation, 57 percent of Britons between the ages of 18 and 34 who intended to take part in Thursday\u2019s referendum supported remaining in the bloc, while an identical proportion \u2014 57 percent \u2014 of Britons over 55 supported the opposite: leaving Europe behind.For those under 25, the desire to remain in the union was especially high: Three-quarters wanted Britain to stay in Europe.Many young people in Britain have grown up thinking of European integration as a given, not a political experiment that would be rolled back before they could fully take part in it.They are often more comfortable living in a multicultural society than their elders are, particularly in cities like London and Edinburgh, which are flooded by people from across the Continent to study and work.Many young Britons expressed astonishment, anger or despair that their parents and grandparents would seek to limit the travel, exposure to other cultures and opportunities to work and study abroad that being part of the European Union has afforded them.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.It failed, but the Remain campaign still pushed to register young voters, with some success: The deadline to register was extended by two days after a voter-registration website crashed because it was overwhelmed by visitors.But it was not enough.The vote \u201cis very damaging,\u201d Mr. Jack said, adding that he now welcomed a second referendum on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom, because \u201cit\u2019s better being inside the European Union.\u201dOf course, many young people supported the push to rid themselves of Europe. Ben Kew, 21, said he spent 30 hours at the Leave headquarters, watching the results come in.\u201cI was surprised; I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d go through with it, but I\u2019m pleased that the establishment has been given a kick,\u201d he said, adding that the vote was a moment when Britons expressed a desire for real change.But many young voters wondered what would happen to European Union funding for research and sciences. British universities currently receive about 16 percent of their research money and staff members from the European Union.James Calderbank, 21, a student at Falmouth University in Cornwall, England, wrote in an email: \u201cSince the early hours of this morning my Facebook newsfeed has been filled with my friends\u2019 disappointment that we are leaving the E.U.\u201dHe added: \u201cOur campus was part-funded by the E.U., so things are really not looking good for my university and its source of funds.\u201d Cornwall, as a fairly rural and less-developed part of southwest England, was also a beneficiary of economic aid from Brussels, he noted.Anxiety about the economy and immigration drove the Leave campaign\u2019s victory.

{"Headline": "Nation\u2019s Biggest Banks Would All Withstand Recession, Fed Says", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s biggest banks have all built up big enough buffers to weather a severe recession in decent shape, United States regulators said on Thursday.Yet even with those losses, regulators said, all of the big banks would remain in relatively good financial health \u2014 and well above minimum regulatory requirements \u2014 as a result of the big cushions of shareholder money they have stockpiled in the last few years.Nearly eight years after the financial crisis, a widespread public perception persists that not enough has been done to overhaul the institutions that are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Calls to break up the biggest banks can be heard among politicians, analysts and even policy makers.For their part, banking regulators have instead been quietly focusing on steadily pushing up an arcane but vital measure of the losses a bank could withstand in a crisis: its capital. Capital levels can be built up either by retaining profits or by raising money from investors.The results of the annual stress tests are a marker of just how much progress the regulators have made in pushing banks to beef up the capital buffers that will protect the financial system in any future crisis.And this years\u2019 tests were \u201carguably the most stressful stress tests yet,\u201d said Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist, noting that the big banks \u201cmust weather a downturn more severe than the Great Recession.\u201dThe test results came as the banks themselves were preparing for a real-world stress test, Britain\u2019s referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Given London\u2019s importance to global finance and markets, the banks were preparing contingency plans if they needed to move their European bases.Among the largest banks, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase all suffered big losses in the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. But all remained above their regulatory minimums.And in one important measure \u2014 the Tier 1 leverage ratio \u2014 the 33 banks together would be 67 percent above the required minimum level even in the worst case of the stress test.But even as the banks prove they have adequate capital, they are not out of the woods.Next week, they will all have to pass another type of test from the Federal Reserve that is a more subjective measure of the banks\u2019 planning and management processes. In the past, these so-called qualitative reviews have tripped up banks including Citigroup, which failed in 2014 even after demonstrating it had adequate capital.On top of that, several Fed officials have recently said that for the nation\u2019s biggest banks, future tests will become even more difficult, with stricter capital requirements.Even with $526 billion losses, stress tests found that all of the big banks would remain in relatively good financial health.\u201cWe need to have those eight most systemically important institutions more resilient than other banks in the economy,\u201d he said.The constant raising of capital requirements each year reduces the likelihood that the banks will ever need another round of taxpayer bailouts.But the ever-evolving requirements have confounded bank executives and shareholders, who complain that the regulations are making it impossible for the banks to generate consistent profits.Even as the economy has remained relatively stable over the last few years and the legal issues and losses from the crisis have been resolved, the share prices of large institutions like Bank of America have languished.On Thursday, the banking industry\u2019s trade group suggested that the stress tests had become unnecessarily burdensome.Some analysts have questioned whether regulators are purposely ramping up regulations to the point where it will no longer make sense to keep large commercial and investment banking operations as one entity \u2014 thus ending the threat of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions.In the short term, Thursday\u2019s stress test results, which are mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law of 2010, could portend good news for the banks\u2019 investors. The banks will probably be allowed to increase their dividends and buy back stock as part of their annual capital plans. The Fed will release its decision on whether to approve those capital plans next Wednesday.In past years, a handful of banks have failed the tests and had to scale back their payouts to shareholders. The figures released on Thursday indicated that the banks were likely to show improved results this year.The Fed looked at how the banks would do this year in a recession that would lead to big losses in consumer banking, which has been an increasing concern in recent months.The test also looked at how they would deal with negative interest rates, which have become more of a concern as central banks have struggled to raise the rates and depart from the policies they adopted immediately after the financial crisis. The test assumes that the banks could not make up for negative rates by charging their customers more to hold their deposits.These assumptions posed less of a danger to banks with big trading and Wall Street operations, but led to bigger consumer losses.While the tests posed extreme hypothetical events, real concerns about weakening consumer credit have plagued banks in recent months.Investors have worried that weakening employment could bring about an end to a period of low defaults, particularly in automobile lending and credit cards \u2014 which have been two areas of growth for the banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Relief Measure Clears Senate, Goes to Obama", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just two days before Puerto Rico plans to default on a large debt payment, the Senate on Wednesday passed and sent to the White House a relief measure to help the financially desperate island surmount its fiscal crisis, ending a grueling, monthslong effort to rescue the commonwealth.The Senate, eager to follow the House out of town for a long Fourth of July weekend, voted 68 to 30 for the legislation on Wednesday evening after a test vote that morning showed by a wide margin that critics in both parties did not have the numbers to block passage. President Obama will sign the measure, which his Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, had negotiated and lobbied for since December.\u201cI could write a bill that I think would be a better bill, but I don\u2019t know that anyone could write a better bill that would pass the Congress that also solves the problem,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview.The rescue package will not prevent Puerto Rico from missing the payment due on Friday on a $2 billion debt, and Republican congressional leaders labored to the end to reassure conservatives that the bill is not a bailout. Instead, the legislation would allow the island\u2019s government to restructure its $72 billion total debt so it can manage payments, and create a bipartisan oversight board mostly of outsiders to guide what is sure to be a painful recovery process.Crucially, given the imminent missed debt payment, the bill also would bar lawsuits by creditors for nonpayment retroactive to December \u2014 to provide Puerto Rico \u201cthe breathing room,\u201d as Mr. Lew put it, for its government and the control board to restructure the crippling debt and devise a new budget plan.The Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, opened the day\u2019s debate by describing what he saw as the high stakes. \u201cThe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is in crisis, it owes billions of dollars in debt, and it could be forced to leave residents without essential services like hospitals and public safety resources without prompt congressional action,\u201d he said.\u201cThis bill won\u2019t cost the taxpayers a dime,\u201d Mr. McConnell added. \u201cWhat it will do is help Puerto Rico restructure its financial obligations and provide much-needed oversight to put into place reforms.\u201dThe new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.Final Senate approval was thrown into some doubt in recent days because the House passed the bill last week and then left for its holiday. That meant that any changes the Senate made would force the bill\u2019s return to the House, extending the legislative process and delaying action until House members return next week.Yet a number of senators were demanding changes. Coal-state senators from Ohio and West Virginia wanted an unrelated amendment to protect coal miners\u2019 pensions and health benefits, which are threatened by the industry\u2019s economic travails.Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, opposed much of the Puerto Rico bill, and other Democrats found fault with various provisions. The seven-member oversight board, which at least initially will include four Republican and three Democratic appointees, was criticized as undemocratic for giving too little representation to the 3.5 million Puerto Rican-Americans. Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, compared the board to \u201ca colonial master\u201d for the island.Democrats also objected to Republican-sponsored provisions setting a lower minimum wage for young workers and limiting overtime pay on the island, attacking them as counterproductive to a stronger economy. The Senate voted down opponents\u2019 motions against the bill.If the Senate had failed to clear the measure for Mr. Obama\u2019s signature, it would have been the second time in two days that crisis-related legislation was blocked in the polarized Congress. On Tuesday, Democrats blocked a House-passed measure to finance efforts against the Zika virus \u2014 another crisis facing Puerto Rico \u2014 because Republican congressional leaders had made changes to the bill in final negotiations, from which Democrats were excluded.In the case of the Puerto Rico relief bill, the compromise was worked out between Republicans and the Obama administration, led by Mr. Lew. Yet, as the bill hung in the balance on Tuesday, both Mr. Lew and Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, lobbied senators to urge their support.Mr. Lew said the bill\u2019s loss would mean \u201cdescent into chaos.\u201d Top Democratic leaders announced publicly late Tuesday that they would support the legislation.On the final vote, dissenters included both liberal and conservative senators. What made the issue problematic in both parties was the deep unpopularity of perceived federal bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis, and the disconnect of most Americans from Puerto Ricans.\u201cI\u2019ve been having town hall meetings in Oregon recently. No one has asked a question about Puerto Rico, and we have a very small population of Puerto Ricans,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I also think that Congress has a responsibility to back American citizens. That\u2019s what this is about, backing American citizens. And that\u2019s important wherever they live.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many of them had already done various calculations, but now that the decision is real, a surfeit of new scenarios has emerged.Most of the war-gaming has been focused on the direct economic blow to Britain. But the catastrophe-shouting there has almost certainly been overly loud: Yes, Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer in the near term as the government reconstitutes and tries to negotiate its divorce with Europe. And yes, the pound will probably continue to lose value, and the uncertainty of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe will paralyze investment until new rules of engagement are put in place.All of which will makes markets around the world shudder, shrug and generally behave like petulant teenagers. \u201cStocks have entered a new realm of volatility, unlikely to abate anytime soon,\u201d according to a Wells Fargo research note issued on Monday. It warned, \u201cGet used to it.\u201dBut it would be wrong to focus exclusively on Britain when considering the possible financial ramifications and permutations. In a truly dire scenario, Britain is just the leading domino. It\u2019s the next dominoes \u2014 most likely across the Channel \u2014 that matter more.\u201cWe see Brexit as just one step in a process that is unavoidable of further referendums by other nations to exit the E.U.,\u201d Felix Zulauf, an investor who operates a hedge fund in Switzerland, wrote in a note on Monday, contending that \u201cthe damage\u201d of Brexit \u201cwill therefore be far worse for the E.U. than for the U.K.\u201dOf far greater concern will be if other European Union countries attempt their own exits \u2014 even if their efforts are unsuccessful. More glimmers of no-confidence among nations in the consortium could ultimately lead to a crisis that would be felt far beyond Europe.Consider this: Italy\u2019s government is considering pumping as much as $45 billion into its banking system after the Brexit vote. Shares of the biggest Italian banks have fallen more than 20 percent since the results of the vote were announced. And Italian banks are considered particularly vulnerable because they hold hundreds of billions of euros in bad loans. If Brexit forces a material economic slowdown across the Continent, Italy\u2019s banks \u2014 without a rescue plan \u2014 could significantly suffer.Remember: There\u2019s no need to panic now, at least not yet. But if, down the line, Italy\u2019s economy were to falter and help from the European Union was not forthcoming without tough conditions \u2014 remember Greece and the possibility of Grexit? \u2014 we could witness the seceding of Italy, which will be the third-largest member of the consortium after Germany and France (assuming that Britain does officially leave).That, in turn, could lead to a true catastrophe: Italy would probably be forced to return to the lira, which would most likely be tremendously devalued. An unstable lira would cause huge problems for investors and banks across the globe that have interests in Italy, as well as a massive credit crunch within the country. (By the way, you could replace \u201cItaly\u201d with \u201cSpain\u201d or \u201cPortugal\u201d in this scenario and end up in much the same place.)Long before then, however, there is a decent chance that we will see another country \u2014 probably the Netherlands \u2014 try to make a run for it. After Britain voted to break away from the European Union, Geert Wilders, the populist leader of the Netherlands\u2019 surging anti-immigrant Party for Freedom, posted on Twitter, \u201cHurray for the British.\u201d He added: \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn. It\u2019s time for a Dutch referendum.\u201d He used this hashtag: #ByeByeEU.The Netherlands is a relatively healthy country, so \u2014 as a matter of pure economics \u2014 the repercussions of its leaving the European Union would most likely be muted. But if Brexit wasn\u2019t enough of an inspiration for other fiercely nationalistic and economically healthy countries to seek an exit, watching a place like the Netherlands that actually uses the euro (unlike Britain, which never switched from the pound) could prove to be a convincing model.Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has already predicted that several countries will leave the European Union within the next five years, which is increasingly becoming the conventional wisdom. Given the low growth of so many countries in the union, it is hard to imagine that a populistic revolt won\u2019t emerge.\u201cThe global economy remains stuck in a deflationary expansion of minimal growth and minimal rates,\u201d Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to investors on Monday. \u201cAnd electorates are increasingly voting in the developed world against wage deflation, high unemployment, immigration and inequality.\u201dJames Pethokoukis, a commentator at the American Enterprise Institute, recently found a memorandum written in 2011 during the euro crisis by Willem Buiter, the global chief economist at Citigroup, that imagined the destruction of the European Union. \u201cA breakup of the Euro Area would be rather like the movie \u2018War of the Roses\u2019 version of a divorce: disruptive, destructive and without any winners,\u201d he wrote, describing how \u201ceven a partial one involving the exit of one or more fiscally and competitively weak countries, would be chaotic.\u201dHere\u2019s what would happen: \u201cExit, partial or full, would likely be precipitated by disorderly sovereign defaults in the fiscally weak and uncompetitive member states, whose currencies would weaken dramatically and whose banks would fail,\u201d Mr. Buiter wrote at the time. \u201cIf Spain and Italy were to exit, there would be a collapse of systemically important financial institutions throughout the European Union and North America and years of global depression.\u201dFor now, let\u2019s hope these worst-case scenarios are just that.Advertisement"}

Made me realize my whole life has been pretty much a waste. I suspected this anyway; he explained why: because I\u2019d not surfed. The last great book I reread would be Shirley Hazzard\u2019s \u201cThe Transit of Venus,\u201d which looks more and more like one of the most important postwar novels: epic and microscopic at the same time and stitched in prose of gorgeously sustained intensity.What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?I enjoy the kind of things I could never write: big history books that take seven years and multiple research grants to finish (finish writing, I mean, though they take ages to read, too \u2014 and then I retain almost nothing anyway). I don\u2019t read \u201cgenre\u201d fiction if that means novels with lots of killing and shooting. Even Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d seemed pretty childish in that regard.Tell us about your favorite short story.\u201cThe Gardener,\u201d by Rudyard Kipling. A mother goes to a large war cemetery on the Western Front in the aftermath of the First World War, looking for the grave of her son. She meets the gardener who is taking care of the cemetery. The sense of vast and unendurable grief is all the more powerful for being expressed with such restraint and economy.And about your favorite poem. \u201cThe Prelude,\u201d by Wordsworth, or \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d by Milton. \u201cThe Prelude\u201d is part of my bloodstream practically, or maybe I mean metaphorically. Obviously parts of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d are a total bore, but it\u2019s worth the slog. After reading the scene where Adam and Eve eat the apple (\u201cCarnal desire inflaming, he on Eve / Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him / As wantonly repaid. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201d), it\u2019s hard not to concur with Terence McKenna\u2019s claim that the expulsion was the original drug bust. The end is the most beautiful thing in all of literature; as Adam and Eve leave Eden they are us. Oh, and to bring things up-to-date, I love practically every funny, crazy and profound line in \u201cIt Is Daylight,\u201d by Arda Collins.And your favorite play. \u201cKing Lear,\u201d \u201cMacbeth\u201d or maybe \u201cThe Tempest.\u201d I will never forget seeing the whole of Prospero\u2019s \u201cOur revels now are ended\u201d speech written on signs, a few phrases at a time, on the way out of Burning Man in 2001. For a while I had this stupid prejudice about going to the theater in London but I\u2019m glad to say I\u2019m over that now (that I no longer live there).What moves you most in a work of literature? Appeals to and expressions of solidarity. I am still moved by passages of Marx: the \u201cCritique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right,\u201d for example, where, after the famous line about religion being \u201cthe opium of the people,\u201d he goes on to call it \u201cthe heart of a heartless world.\u201d The single most moving passage I know is in \u201cThe Country and the City,\u201d by Raymond Williams, where he looks at the big English country houses, describing their great beauty before adding, \u201cThink it through as labor.\u201d He then proceeds to do just that, reminding us of how long and systematic the exploitation and fraud must have been to have raised \u201cthat many houses, on that scale. See by contrast what any ancient isolated farm, in uncounted generations of labor, has managed to become, by the efforts of any single real family.\u201d I also found much that was moving in \u201cAll on Fire,\u201d Henry Mayer\u2019s biography of William Lloyd Garrison, the abolitionist editor of The Liberator. Last fall, in the Beinecke Library at Yale, I was able to see an original copy of the first issue of The Liberator (January 1831) with its famous editorial: \u201cI will not equivocate \u2014 I will not excuse \u2014I will not retreat a single inch \u2014 and I will be heard.\u201d I was worried that the page might become tear-damaged as I looked at it.How do you organize your books? Mostly by subject but there are all sorts of subcategories and exceptions \u2014 often because of size \u2014that make sense only to me. But I can put my hand on anything pretty quickly \u2014even if it\u2019s in the chaotic and always-expanding section of \u201coverspill.\u201dWhat book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? The complete works of Alistair MacLean, the first writer I read in his entirety, author of the script that became the masterly film (with Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton) that became the novel \u201cWhere Eagles Dare.\u201dWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?I don\u2019t know about \u201cever,\u201d but the most recent would be Mavis Gallant\u2019s \u201cParis Stories,\u201d because if I\u2019d not been given it I would have continued under the misapprehension that she wrote neat New Yorker-type stories, rather than these very strange, convoluted but weirdly perfect \u2014 and often sprawling \u2014 miniatures.What\u2019s your favorite TV, film or theater adaptation of a book? It could only be Tarkovsky\u2019s transformation of \u201cRoadside Picnic,\u201d by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, into \u201cStalker.\u201dTell us about your ideal adaptation of any book. The essential thing is that it becomes a proper film \u2014 a piece of cinema \u2014 rather than just a filmed transcript or a page of celluloid, as it were. \u201cStalker\u201d exemplifies this, in that it bears only a faint resemblance to the source material. As Tarkovsky said, the script has to dissolve into the film.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I didn\u2019t read much of anything till I was 15, except Alistair MacLean and Michael Moorcock \u2014 the sword and sorcery novels \u2014when I was about 13 or 14.As a current resident of California, do you have a favorite book about the state? I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a book about the state but Leonard Gardner\u2019s \u201cFat City,\u201d set in Stockton, is tremendous (especially when read in the New York Review Books edition with Denis Johnson\u2019s introduction). Another NYRB reissue: Darcy O\u2019Brien\u2019s wild little novel about growing up as the son of a famous actor in Hollywood, \u201cA Way of Life, Like Any Other.\u201d And I love Christopher Isherwood\u2019s \u201cDiaries,\u201d recording his life in Los Angeles.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? He doesn\u2019t need me to recommend books to him \u2014 this, needless to say, is not always the case with presidents. But if I were to give a book to the Queen of England it would be \u201cThe Enchanted Glass: Britain and Its Monarchy,\u201d Tom Nairn\u2019s classic republican (in the European sense) call to arms. I was excited to sit next to Helen Mirren at dinner once, even though her portrayal of the Queen has been a huge impediment to progress in this respect.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? D. H. Lawrence, Billy Collins and Rebecca West.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? I take against books for all sorts of reasons and give up on plenty. The last one? Following on from the California question, a number of people recommended D. J. Waldie\u2019s \u201cHoly Land: A Suburban Memoir,\u201d but I found it so flat and dull. Maybe that\u2019s the point; if so, I got that point early on, started skimming and then abandoned it completely.Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful? I guess the jazz book, \u201cBut Beautiful,\u201d because I hit on a new form, a combination of criticism and fiction that was entirely appropriate to the subject matter. I\u2019m also struck by the confidence I had back then, to write about this predominantly African-American art form that I\u2019d only been listening to for a couple of years. I\u2019d never have the confidence/arrogance to do that now. It also means a lot to me because musicians liked it (I can\u2019t play a note on any instrument) and it was the first book of mine to be published in America.Who would you want to write your life story?My wife, Rebecca Wilson, because she loves the ongoing comedy and understood my mum and dad.What do you plan to read next? Sarah Bakewell\u2019s \u201cAt the Existentialist Caf\u00e9\u201d: a group biography or history of Heidegger, Sartre, De Beauvoir, Camus, Merleau-Ponty and others who have meant a lot to me intellectually even if I didn\u2019t understand what many of them were saying.Advertisement"}

College graduates are found in virtually every profession: 15 percent of mail carriers have a four-year degree, as do one in five clerical and sales workers and 83,000 bartenders.Getting a bachelor\u2019s degree is what going to college means to most Americans and is so ingrained in our culture that students who do not march along are often admonished, questioned and considered \u2014 or consider themselves \u2014 failures.Yet the decades-long march to college-for-everyone-at-18 has actually closed off options for teenagers and 20-somethings, rather than opened up opportunities.As recently as the 1970s, a teenager had a number of options after graduating from high school: get a good-paying job right away, enlist in the military, find an apprenticeship in a trade or go to college.Today, a teenager really has only two of those options: the military or college. Less than 1 percent of Americans serve in the military, so most go to college right after high school. Yet only 52 percent of young people have either a two- or four-year degree or an industry certificate by the time they reach their mid-20s.Nearly half of the American work force has these jobs today, but many of them are baby boomers who will soon be retiring. It\u2019s expected that as many as 25 million of all new job openings in the next decade will be for middle-skills jobs.What we need are job-training institutions on par with academic institutions as prestigious and rigorous as the Ivy League to attract students interested in pursuing skilled jobs critical for the economy that don\u2019t necessarily require a four-year college degree.The school is just as selective as Harvard. It receives more than 4,000 applications each year for 230 spots, and significant numbers of its graduates go on to earn bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees.We need more such schools and pathways post-high school that serve a greater array of industries as well as students who don\u2019t want to travel the one route we offer them now.Jeffrey J.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Keeps Rates Steady as Inflation Shows Signs of Rising", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank made no changes on Thursday in its program to revive the eurozone economy, as it expressed slightly more optimism about the prospects for growth in the region.The lack of any significant policy moves was expected. Growth in the 19-member eurozone is neither so terrible that it requires a new burst of stimulus from the bank nor so torrid that there is a need to apply the brakes, analysts say. The European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council is now expected to pause for a while, after several years in which it pushed the boundaries of monetary policy.The bank left its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has been since March. It also left intact a penalty rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank. The so-called negative interest rate is designed to force commercial banks to lend money rather than hoard it.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that growth in the eurozone this year would be 1.6 percent, slightly more than earlier forecasts. But the bank\u2019s economists left their growth predictions for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 1.7 percent for both years.Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Vienna that although the risks facing the eurozone had declined, \u201cit\u2019s not a dramatic effect.\u201dAnalysts would have been surprised, indeed shocked, if the bank had taken action on Thursday after a monetary policy meeting in Vienna, one of the Governing Council\u2019s periodic forays outside its base in Frankfurt.The bank is also not expected to make any major changes to policy for some time to come. The meeting on Thursday \u201cwas a continuation of a series of wait-and-see events,\u201d Christoph Kutt, head of interest rate strategy at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said in an email.To the disappointment of some analysts, the central bank did not raise its inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018. That is a sign that the bank remains concerned about the risk of deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can be disastrous for economic growth and employment.The European Central Bank\u2019s charter defines its main job as keeping inflation below 2 percent, but not too far below it.Another reason the central bank had not been expected to announce new stimulus on Thursday is that its previous measures are just going into effect. In March, it said it would begin buying corporate bonds in an expansion of its so-called quantitative easing program, a way of pumping money into the economy. Those purchases are scheduled to begin on June 8.The central bank will want to take some time to see how those programs are working, analysts said.Along with questions about the direction of the economy, there is potential for a new crisis that would push the European Central Bank to mobilize.In such a situation, the central bank would be under pressure to intervene once again.Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that he and other members of the Governing Council believed that Britain should remain in the European Union. But if British voters elect to leave, he said, \u201cThe E.C.B. is ready for all contingencies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moving to Arizona Soon? You Might Need a License", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported bySCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 \u201cI usually start behind the neck,\u201d Grace Granatelli said from her plump brown sofa. \u201cThere\u2019s two pressure points back behind the ears that help relax them a little bit.\u201d In her lap, she held the head of Sketch, her mixed beagle rat terrier, as her fingers traced small circles through his fur.Ms. Granatelli, whose passion for dogs can be glimpsed in the oil portrait of her deceased pets and the bronzed casts of their paws, started an animal massage business during the recession after taking several courses and workshops. Her primary form of advertising was her car, with its \u201cK9 RUBS\u201d license plate and her website, Pawsitive Touch, stenciled onto her rear window.But in 2013, Arizona\u2019s Veterinary Medical Examining Board sent her a cease-and-desist order, demanding that she close up shop for medically treating animals without a veterinary degree. If not, the board warned, every Swedish doggy massage she completed could cost her a $1,000 fine.To comply with the ruling and obtain a license, Ms. Granatelli would have to spend about $250,000 over four years at an accredited veterinary school. None require courses in massage technique; many don\u2019t even offer one.Animal masseuses are hardly alone. Over the years, states across the country have added licensing requirements for a bewildering variety of jobs, requiring months or years of expensive education, along with assessing costly fees.The Obama administration and the conservative political network financed by the Koch brothers don\u2019t agree on much, but the belief that the zeal among states for licensing all sorts of occupations has spiraled out of control is one of them. In recent months, they have collaborated with an array of like-minded organizations and political leaders in a bid to roll back licensing rules.On Friday, the White House announced that it would provide $7.5 million in grants to organizations interested in working with states to reduce overly burdensome licensing and make it easier for licensed practitioners to work across state lines, an issue of particular importance to military families.\u201cThis grant is the first time the federal government has directly gotten involved to help states that want to reform their licensing practices,\u201d Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cIt was something a Democratic president proposed and a Republican Congress passed.\u201dIn Tennessee, a license is required to shampoo hair; in Florida, to sell a yacht. In Montana, you need the state\u2019s approval to be an egg candler; in Utah, to repair upholstery; in Louisiana, to be a florist.No one disputes that health and safety concerns make licenses indispensable in certain demanding professions, like nursing or flying a commercial airplane, and they are sometimes helpful in improving standards and providing quality assurance to consumers.Security guards in Michigan need to have three years of training; none is needed in New Hampshire and Ohio.\u201cWhy in the world do we regulate barbers?\u201d asked Mark Hutchison, a Republican and the lieutenant governor of Nevada, which shares billing with Arizona as one of the states with the most burdensome licensing requirements, according to the Institute for Justice. \u201cA bad haircut is the last thing that a person is going to put up with and return to. It is the ultimate example of self-regulating industry.\u201dThe most regulated states, paradoxically, are red. \u201cEven Republican governors with Republican legislatures in pretty conservative states have still found it extremely difficult to effect change,\u201d said Dick M. Carpenter, strategic director of the Institute for Justice. \u201cWhen there is an effort to dial back legislation, then the licensed industry turns out with huge counterattack. This is the same story that plays out in every state.\u201dOnly rarely are licensing requirements removed. Last month, though, Arizona agreed to curb them for yoga teachers, geologists, citrus fruit packers and cremationists.But dozens more professions escaped the ax. \u201cArizona is perceived as a low-regulatory state, but this was the most difficult bill we worked on this session,\u201d said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the Republican governor, Douglas Ducey.Licensing boards are generally dominated by members of the regulated profession. And in Arizona, more than two dozen of the boards are allowed to keep 90 percent of their fees, turning over a mere 10 percent of the revenue to the state.\u201cThey use that money to hire contract lobbyists and P.R. people,\u201d Mr. Scarpinato said. \u201cThis is really a dark corner of state government.\u201dThey are often joined in their campaign by lobbyists from industry trade associations and for-profit colleges, which sell the required training courses.Economists like Mr. Kleiner say there are less burdensome ways to highlight quality. For example, certification, with an exam to ensure a certain skill level, could be required to use a particular job title \u2014 like certified tour guide or chartered financial analyst \u2014 without prohibiting others from offering the service, perhaps at a lower price.The court\u2019s decision may prompt some states to monitor licensing boards more closely, said Robert C. Fellmeth, executive director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego.Once the lawsuit is finished, Ms. Whitmore said, it is possible the board will offer more guidelines.Ms. Kelly, whose strong hands can zero in on a knotted muscle like a heat-seeking missile, said she was continuing to work despite the order from the licensing board. She grew up around horses at her father\u2019s riding stable in Long Island and has taken several courses and workshops in equine massageLocal veterinarians have frequently referred horse owners to her. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said Ms. Kelly, who charges $55 for an approximately 90-minute massage. \u201cIt takes too long.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pedro Kuczynski Declares Victory Over Keiko Fujimori for Peru Presidency", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 A former Wall Street banker and finance minister declared himself the winner of the presidential contest in Peru on Thursday after narrowly edging out the daughter of an imprisoned former president.The former banker, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, 77, appeared to have prevailed against Keiko Fujimori, 41, after a second-round contest on Sunday whose result remained in suspension for much of the week because of a near-even split between the two candidates.\u201cThank you, Peru,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski exclaimed on Twitter on Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s time to work for the future of our country.\u201dWhile the election authorities still had not certified a winner, officials said Thursday that 99.7 percent of the ballots had been counted. It appeared unlikely that Ms. Fujimori could surpass her rival with the few outstanding votes despite a first-place finish in the first round and a lead in polls before the vote. The winner will take office July 28.Ms. Fujimori did not release a public statement on Thursday. Several party members said they would challenge some ballots because of irregularities, which they did not specify.The margin between the two candidates \u2014 roughly 41,000 votes out of 18 million cast on Sunday \u2014 was one of the narrowest in recent memory.Analysts said it underscored a deeply divided electorate. The candidates espoused similar free-market views but came from divergent backgrounds. Mr. Kuczynski, an economist, ran as a technocrat; Ms. Fujimori, a populist, is the daughter of one of the country\u2019s most controversial leaders.Her father, Alberto K. Fujimori, ran Peru with an iron fist from 1990 to 2000 in an effort to crush the Marxist rebel group Shining Path.While the insurgency was largely defeated during those years, many argue that his rule, which included eliminating the Constitution, damaged the country\u2019s democracy. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison for corruption and human rights abuses.During the campaign, Mr. Kuczynski portrayed himself as a stable alternative to Ms. Fujimori, whom he accused of being a populist eager to return to her father\u2019s authoritarianism.An Oxford-educated economist who speaks three languages and plays the flute and piano, Mr. Kuczynski is described by those who know him as having an academic personality shaped by years in the United States.\u201cHe has an impressive ability to prioritize the most critical aspects of each problem \u2014 he is very pragmatic,\u201d said Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos, a former Peruvian ambassador to the United States who worked with Mr. Kuczynski.Peru\u2019s economy has been a bright spot in a region suffering from declines of commodity prices, and Mr. Kuczynski has vowed to push its growth through state spending.He has said he wants to invest in large infrastructure and education projects while lowering sales taxes to create an incentive for businesses operating outside the formal economy to register with the government.Yet his goals may be difficult to achieve. Ms. Fujimori\u2019s party, Popular Force, won a large congressional majority in the election\u2019s first round.\u201cWhat worries me most is that he might maintain a technocratic style that makes governing a difficult task,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at Pontifical Catholic University in Lima.Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s work for American banks \u2014 he was a chairman of First Boston in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 has been a concern for some. During the election, his critics said that in previous stints in the government, he offered natural gas concessions at terms too favorable to businesses.Victor Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Belaunde, a congressman from the Popular Action party, said Peru\u2019s president would face difficult decisions over concessions to developers of its natural resources.\u201cI\u2019m afraid the government loses control or supervision and that big companies that are dedicated to concessions might have more advantages,\u201d he said.Others saw Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s past in the financial world as an asset.\u201cHe is essentially an executive and an excellent executive,\u201d said Richard Webb, a former president of Peru\u2019s central bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jobs Report Is Not Quite as Terrible as It Looks", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWell, that stunk.It is worth bearing in mind that this is noisy data, and the economy rarely zigs or zags as often or as dramatically as any initial set of numbers suggest. A better gauge of the underlying rate of jobs growth is to take an average over the past three months. By that measure, the labor market is creating around 116,000 jobs per month. This is a notable slowdown from jobs growth in the 150,000-250,000 range over most of the past five years. But it\u2019s a slowdown and not a sudden stop.There are actually two surveys of employment conducted each month, the headline measure that comes from a survey of firms, and an alternative and less reliable measure from a smaller survey of households. Both were weak. The household survey registered employment growth of only 28,000 in May.The household survey is also used to measure the unemployment rate. In an odd twist, it shows that the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, from 5 percent in April. But this is not the good news it seems, because it almost entirely reflects a decline in the number of people reporting that they were looking for work. The decline reversed the hopeful signs over recent months that labor force participation may be recovering.If all of these adjustments suggest that it\u2019s hard to know what the underlying pace of jobs growth is, then you are correct. These numbers are imprecise estimates, and they come with a margin of error of plus or minus 100,000.No matter what the true numbers are, the jobs report should be interpreted in the context of other indicators that do not show as speedy a slowdown. Putting it all together, the outlook is less rosy, but by no means terrible.The economy still appears to be reducing unemployment.There was a time when the working-age population was growing so rapidly that if the underlying rate of monthly jobs growth slipped to 100,000, that would not only be disappointing, but it would also point to rising unemployment. But that\u2019s not today\u2019s reality.That is, the economy is still growing faster than its long-run potential rate of growth, and the recovery is continuing.It\u2019s not that things are getting worse, it\u2019s that they\u2019re getting better more slowly.Moreover, unemployment is now at historically low levels. The last time the economy registered an unemployment rate this low was November 2007, on the eve of the Great Recession.There remains a vibrant debate as to whether the labor market has fully recovered from those dark days, or whether today\u2019s low unemployment rate overstates its health. Millions of people are still working part-time but looking for full-time work, and millions more are no longer actively searching for work, and so do not meet the technical definition of unemployment.Average wage growth of only 2.5 percent over the past year suggests there remains a lot of potential for the labor market to improve without sparking inflation.But at some point, slower employment growth is an inevitability.Forecasters have long suggested that as the economy approaches full employment, jobs growth must slow. By this reckoning, the economy cannot continue to create jobs more rapidly than the labor force is growing without the emergence of bottlenecks. If this is right, perhaps we should get used to seeing employment growth closer to 100,000 per month.The disappointing news, then, is that the day of reckoning may be a step closer than we had thought.Advertisement"}

There were no immediate claims of responsibility from militant groups like the Islamic State that might suggest the attack, which killed three intelligence officers and two other employees at the office, had had broader organizational support.Local news reports said the suspect might have been detained at the intelligence building sometime before the shooting \u2014 suggesting revenge as a possible motive.\u201cFor Jordan, it is a big shock,\u201d said Oraib al-Rantawi, the director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies in Amman, the capital, speaking of the shooting on Monday. \u201cWe are proud to have maintained our security and stability in this region for the past five years.\u201dBut the country faces growing danger from what Mr. Rantawi called a \u201cjihadist crescent\u201d in Syria, western Iraq and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, he said. The government has failed to fully root out growing extremism at home, despite its crackdown on suspected jihadists, he added, and Jordan faces a looming threat from hundreds of Jordanians who have joined militant groups abroad\u201cHow will we deal with them, reintegrate them? This is a major challenge,\u201d Mr. Rantawi said.The intelligence office that was attacked on Monday, belonging to the country\u2019s General Intelligence Directorate, was a particularly rich symbolic target for militants, Mr. Rantawi said. \u201cWhen it comes to Jordanian jihadists, or militants on the regional level, many consider the G.I.D. a harsh enemy with long arms,\u201d he added.The authorities did not release the name of the suspect or any details on his background. A video said to show his capture in a mosque showed a man surrounded by people, with his hands bound behind his back, and a child removing bullets from his pocket.Unconfirmed reports in Jordanian newspapers published before the secrecy order was issued said the suspect was 22. The reports said he had been detained about two weeks ago by the intelligence agency, which has been criticized in the past by human rights groups for carrying out secret detentions and torture. A government spokesman refused to answer questions about the case, saying the investigation into the shooting was classified.Faced with a vexing and escalating threat, Jordan\u2019s government has increasingly responded by preventing the news media from reporting on militant plots \u2014 following an example set by other authoritarian governments in the region, including Egypt and Turkey, which have turned to secrecy orders to prevent reporting on anything deemed sensitive or embarrassing to the government.Jordan has issued several secrecy orders in the last year, and has prosecuted at least one journalist who violated the orders, human rights advocates say.The decision to bar reporting on the shooting was aimed at \u201cmaintaining the confidentiality of investigations,\u201d a government statement said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In American Markets, Panic Begins to Subside", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byThe market panic that initially met Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union showed signs of subsiding on Monday.While stocks continued to slide for a second trading day, by the close of business Monday a measure of calm appeared to be returning to certain significant corners of the market.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was stable for most of the day after dropping around 2 percent in the first minutes of trading. It ended the day down 1.8 percent. Markets in Japan and China finished Monday in positive territory.A gauge of expected future volatility in the markets, the so-called VIX, fell on Monday after spiking on Friday, and remained far below the level it reached last summer when problems in the Chinese economy came to the fore.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting contagion here,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, based in Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty well insulated,\u201d he said of the American economy.The outlook was less sanguine in Europe.Investors continued dumping European stocks and seeking out the safety of gold and bonds on Monday, despite comments from British and European officials intended to calm markets.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke for the first time since the so-called Brexit vote, before markets opened on Monday. He said that while Britain\u2019s public finances would be affected by an exit from the bloc, the broader economy was still in good shape.\u201cOur economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cIt is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.\u201d\u201cWe were prepared for the unexpected,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are equipped for whatever happens.\u201dBut Mr. Osborne\u2019s comments appeared to do little to shore up the nation\u2019s currency. The British pound fell on Monday to its lowest level against the dollar since the 1980s.In another blow to the British economy, the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency announced on Monday that it was stripping Great Britain of its AAA rating. The country\u2019s rating was dropped two notches, to AA.Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts said in their report that the vote last week \u201cwill weaken the predictability, stability, and effectiveness of policy making in the U.K. and affect its economy, G.D.P. growth and fiscal and external balances.\u201dThere is still enormous uncertainty about how exactly Britain\u2019s exit will play out, and how it will ripple through the economy. The most obvious victims are likely to be the big European banks, which have relied on an ability to operate easily across borders.Trading in financial stocks like Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland was briefly suspended on Monday because of precipitous declines.Barclays fell 17 percent on Monday on top of its 17 percent decline on Friday. That brought the bank\u2019s stock below the bottom it reached during the 2011 eurozone crisis, though it remained far above the trough reached during the financial crisis.\u201cBanks are one of the most exposed sectors to Brexit,\u201d Andrew Coombs, a Citigroup analyst, said in a research note distributed on Monday.He noted that British banks were particularly vulnerable \u201cgiven the likely headwinds of a deteriorating domestic economy, and higher risk premia associated with a less predictable political and economic landscape.\u201dBut, he warned, \u201cthe European investment banks are also not immune, with sizable operations in London, which may now need to be reviewed.\u201dItalian officials said on Monday that they were looking at creating what amounted to a bailout fund to help struggling banks in the country.Throughout Europe, however, investors have not been assuming the worst \u2014 they seem to have reserved their harshest punishment so far for bank stocks. By contrast, a broad index of European shares, the Euro Stoxx, fell 2.8 percent on Monday but was still above the lows it reached earlier this year.In the United States, the S.&P. 500-stock index finished down 1.8 percent, or 36.87 points, at 2,000.54 on Monday.

The Nasdaq composite was down 2.4 percent, or 113.54 points, to 4,594.44.Some economists said that the turmoil in Europe could slightly stunt American growth. Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that they had reduced their estimates for American economic growth in the second half of 2016, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent.But other analysts were far more optimistic. Pantheon Macroeconomics said on Monday that it still anticipated American economic growth to gain steam this year, driven by improving consumer confidence.For American investors, the biggest fallout from the British vote may be the influence that it has on the Federal Reserve and its plans for raising interest rates in the economy.Traders were betting on Monday that the Fed would have to keep rates lower for longer, which could help stimulate the economy. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was supposed to attend a meeting of central bank chiefs this week in Portugal, but she called that off after the British vote last week.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting on Monday with officials from the nation\u2019s central bank and Finance Ministry to discuss how to contain the fallout from the vote in Britain, which pummeled markets in Japan and elsewhere on Friday.Japan was hit especially hard. The Nikkei suffered its biggest one-day point drop in 16 years and the yen jumped about 5 percent against the dollar.On Monday, Japanese authorities issued their strongest warning yet that they were prepared to intervene in the market to curb the rise of the yen. Markets elsewhere in the region were mostly little changed. Japan, however, generally fears an excessively strong currency, which can hurt the country\u2019s economy by making its exports more expensive and consequently less competitive.\u201cThere is still uncertainty and risk in the financial markets, and it\u2019s important that we continue to work for stability,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters after a meeting at the prime minister\u2019s office.He added that he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to \u201ccoordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose on Monday.

{"Headline": "U.S. Sanctions Expected to Hit Small Banks\u2019 Business With North Korea", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Chinese banks that do business with North Korea stand to lose several billion dollars in the wake of new United States Treasury Department sanctions on all such foreign institutions, analysts said on Friday.The new sanctions were announced days before a visit to Beijing by Secretary of the Treasury Jacob J. Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry for an annual meeting on economic and security issues that starts on Monday and whose agenda this year includes North Korea.The Chinese banks most affected by the sanctions will be comparatively small regional ones that facilitate the bulk of North Korea\u2019s business in China, the analysts said. Major banks in China suspended their North Korean accounts in 2013 after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, criticized a nuclear test conducted by the North that year, the analysts said.The smaller banks in the northeast area of China that borders North Korea would probably not want to risk continuing to do business with the North because the cost of sanctions by the United States would far outweigh the benefits of such commercial ties, said Jin Qiangyi, dean of the institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Yanbian University in Yanji.China is by far North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner.Using a provision of the Patriot Act, the Treasury Department designated North Korea on Wednesday as a \u201cprimary money-laundering concern,\u201d a move that will enable Washington to take aggressive measures to cut off its access to the United States financial system.Under the new designation, non-American banks and other entities are banned from conducting dollar transactions on behalf of North Korea, a prohibition intended to crimp the North\u2019s economic activities and its ability to further expand its nuclear program.The Chinese government said on Thursday that it opposed the Treasury action, although Beijing signed onto a tough new round of United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea in March as punishment for a nuclear test it conducted earlier this year.\u201cWe consistently oppose imposing unilateral sanctions on other countries based on one\u2019s domestic laws,\u201d said a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying. Instead of creating new sanctions, countries should \u201cfully implement\u201d the United Nations sanctions established in March, she said.The United Nations resolution called on member states to terminate \u201cjoint ventures, ownership interests and correspondent banking relationships\u201d with banks in North Korea within 90 days. The Treasury move goes a step further with its prohibition against United States banks\u2019 allowing North Korea access to the American financial system via third-country banks.If China were committed to enforcing the United Nations sanctions it agreed to, then the Treasury move would not affect it.The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman\u2019s pointed use of the word \u201cunilateral,\u201d however, raised questions about Beijing\u2019s commitment to the March sanctions.The tough approach by the Treasury contrasted with the decision by Mr. Xi to meet this week with a senior North Korean envoy, Ri Su-yong. Mr. Ri was dispatched by his country\u2019s young leader, Kim Jong-un, to mend North Korea\u2019s frayed ties with China, but he told the Chinese leader that North Korea had no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons, North Korean state-run media reported.The Treasury action also came as Mr. Kim has begun a policy, named byungjin, that calls for North Korea to keep expanding its nuclear weapons program while pushing for development that would bolster its rudimentary economy.The collective impact on the regional Chinese banks by the Treasury action will probably be much greater than the losses incurred by Banco Delta Asia, a bank based in the Chinese special administrative region of Macau, when it was designated a money-laundering concern in 2005 because of its dealings with North Korea, said Cho Bong-Hyn, an analyst at the Industrial Bank of Korea\u2019s Research Institute in Seoul.\u201cThe impact would amount to approximately a few billion U.S. dollars, considering most of North Korea\u2019s foreign bank accounts are in China,\u201d Mr. Cho said.Even so, he said, few of these banks are entirely dependent on North Korea\u2019s business. He doubted that many banks had North Korean deposits amounting to more than 10 percent of the bank\u2019s total deposits.\u201cI don\u2019t think these Chinese banks will be shaken by the said losses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may, however, worry about loss of future transactions.\u201dMost of them are in the major trading cities of Dandong and Hunchun on the border with North Korea, he said.These banks will now have to ensure that North Korea does not open bank accounts with them by using conduits.\u201cIf such illegal accounts are detected, it could be fatal for these banks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo both Korean and Chinese banks will have to do their best to prevent North Koreans from opening these irregular bank accounts with them.\u201dThe main banks in China were unnerved by what happened to Banco Delta Asia, and by 2013, after a nuclear test by the North earlier that year, they stopped doing business with North Korea, said Andray Abrahamian, associate research director of Choson Exchange, a nonprofit group based in Singapore that provides training for entrepreneurs in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.\u201cThe writing was already on the wall then,\u201d Mr. Abrahamian said.Even if a Chinese bank processed transactions for North Koreans in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, that bank\u2019s dollar trade would remain at risk, he said.It is not clear where North Korea might seek alternative places to conduct financial transactions outside the normal banking systems, the analysts said.Certainly, North Koreans would want locations far away from financial hubs. Recently, North Korean businesspeople have mentioned Cambodia and Indonesia as possible channels, said a Singaporean analyst who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.Soon after the United Nations sanctions were imposed in March, Chinese traders in Dandong, the main gateway for transportation of Chinese goods into North Korea, were using alternatives to the Chinese-run Bank of Dandong.In order to receive payments from North Korea, one major trader in Dandong said in April that he would receive a 50-percent down payment before a shipment. The money would be deposited in the Dandong office of the Korea Kwangson bank.That bank is North Korean and does business out of unmarked offices on the 13th floor of an office tower on the banks of the Yalu River. It was described as the last North Korean bank operating in the city.The trader would pick up the remaining 50 percent payment once the goods arrived in North Korea, he said. The transactions would usually be in renminbi, although sometimes they were in dollars, he said.In March, the Treasury singled out the Korea Kwansong bank for using front companies to gain access to the United States financial system and process transactions that supported weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.Previously, the Treasury had said that North Korean leaders had used one of the bank\u2019s front companies to open accounts at a major Chinese bank under the names of Chinese citizens and to deposit millions of dollars in 2013.Su-Hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Yufan Huang contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We\u2019re an Easy Target\u2019: Taken In by the Trump Brand", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byThe sales pitches seeking to separate Cheryl Lankford from her money began during the recession as she struggled to get back on her feet after the death of her husband, an American soldier serving in Iraq.Two of them were from companies that have boasted the Trump name.Another was Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, a vanity publisher promising \u201cbranding services\u201d that seemed to complement the real estate business she hoped to create. She paid thousands of dollars to Cambridge, whose spokesman and \u201cexecutive director of global branding\u201d was Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr.Six years later, Ms. Lankford, who is 44 and has a son, has little to show for the money she spent, aside from a nagging sense that she was taken advantage of. Several friends in her community in San Antonio fell for similar offers, she said, but most are not eager to talk about it.\u201cAs a widow, you find you were so dependent on your husband, and when you make a mistake because of predatory businesses, it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Ms. Lankford said. \u201cWe\u2019re an easy target.\u201dBut intersecting with these was another, largely unexamined, business venture, Cambridge Who\u2019s Who, which generated hundreds of complaints that it deceptively peddled the promise of recognition in a registry, as well as branding and networking services of questionable value. Dozens of people who paid Trump-endorsed businesses were also sold products by Cambridge, which benefited from its partnership with Donald Trump Jr. through \u201cleveraging relationships built by the Trump empire,\u201d according to Cambridge.\u201cBranding is the best way to gain recognition and exposure, and nobody knows this more than the Trump Organization,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said in a promotion for Cambridge.Cambridge employees played up the Trump association when pursuing customers.\u201cWe had scripts to read when we made our calls to people, and when Donald Trump Jr. came along, our scripts were changed to include him in it,\u201d said Joy Debono, a former Cambridge telemarketer. \u201cWe would basically say that Cambridge was a good company because Trump was involved in it.\u201dDonald Trump Jr. declined to answer questions about his work for Cambridge. His father\u2019s presidential campaign issued a statement saying the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s role at the company \u201cwas an arrangement made totally outside of the Trump Organization and there was never any commingling of the two corporations at any level.\u201dMr. Narod said that the younger Mr. Trump worked with Cambridge for a year while also continuing as a top executive with the Trump Organization, and that he had been aware of the complaints against Cambridge, as well as Mr. Narod\u2019s censure by the securities industry.\u201cDon Jr. was hired for a very short time as a spokesperson to help our members with their personal branding, since he and his family build one of the biggest brands in the world,\u201d Mr. Narod said. \u201cWe believed that he could be essential to enhance their online presence.\u201dThe \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d industry has a long and dubious history.There are some well-established companies that publish directories of professionals in various fields, such as lawyers and top corporate executives. But there are many others that target people of little distinction, shower them with accolades and then try to sell them costly \u201chonors\u201d such as placement in a directory or wall plaques.Cambridge and its subsidiary, Worldwide Branding, took the model a step further, adding the promise of branding \u2014 news releases, video biographies and a personalized web page \u2014 and networking with other Cambridge customers who paid a membership fee to join.When Donald Trump Jr. joined Cambridge, the company had already had about 400 complaints filed against it with the Better Business Bureau since 2006. Scores more appeared in online consumer forums like Ripoff Report, where customers vented about misleading sales calls, worthless products and difficulties getting refunds. Many of the complaints describe a similar pattern of aggressively steering people into ever more expensive products.A 69-year-old woman from Kansas reported that she had paid $788 for services she claimed were \u201cnot worth $50 collectively\u201d while she was going through a divorce and \u201clooking for a way to make a living, build a new life and expand my career through this organization.\u201d After she complained to the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, she eventually received a refund.\u201cI felt so stupid,\u201d the woman, identified only as \u201cPepper,\u201d wrote in an online posting. \u201cMy takeaway is this: all is not gold that glitters, and that includes the Trump name. Buyer beware!\u201dIn Oregon, Phyllis Fread was in her 80s, dealing with Parkinson\u2019s disease and had been retired from teaching for almost two decades when Cambridge started calling her at home, where she lived alone. Cambridge salespeople telephoned Ms. Fread \u2014 who did not use the internet \u2014 42 times trying to sell her networking services, a website and other products she did not need, according to an investigation by the Oregon attorney general\u2019s office.Eventually, Ms. Fread reached her credit card limit and her son disconnected her telephone to stop Cambridge from calling. In a recorded interview with an investigator from the attorney general\u2019s office, Ms. Fread became emotional as she recalled how \u201cthere were all kinds of things they\u2019d push and I\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want it at all.\u2019\u201d\u201cI remember saying, \u2018Wait a minute, I don\u2019t need anything, I don\u2019t want anything.\u2019 And then you couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. I probably should have hung up,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201dCambridge was accused by the state of \u201cunfair, deceptive and unconscionable practices\u201d and settled without admitting guilt, issuing a refund to Ms. Fread in 2012. She died 18 months later.Mr. Narod said many complaints about Cambridge stemmed from early \u201cgrowing pains\u201d before it transitioned from just a book-and-a-plaque vanity publisher to one that added branding services. Cambridge \u2014 which in recent years has shifted its focus to finding customers outside the United States through a related venture called Worldwide Who\u2019s Who \u2014 has worked to improve its sales techniques and to better address complaints, he said. The latest Better Business Bureau records show close to 100 complaints in the last three years about Cambridge and Worldwide.\u201cIt has been quite some time since Cambridge has received negative comments, and we believe that is a testament to the strength of our products and the work that we did to make necessary operational improvements,\u201d Mr. Narod said.A search of online records, as well as interviews, turned up dozens of members who also paid other companies licensed or endorsed by the Trumps, although Mr. Narod denied that the businesses exchanged customer leads. \u201cWe have never shared or sold our data with the Trump Organization, Trump University or Trump Network,\u201d he said.What they did have in common were sales appeals that had a similar theme of offering help navigating the recession. Ads for Trump University referred to government bailouts for banks, and asked the question, \u201cWho\u2019s helping you?\u201d Similarly, Donald Trump Jr. went on Fox Business and said Cambridge clients \u201care people that the stimulus should be benefitting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult economy out there, a very difficult job market,\u201d he told TheStreet.com while discussing Cambridge. \u201cAnd you really have to position yourself so you can take advantage of all those things properly.\u201dMs. Lankford, who heads her local Texas chapter of Gold Star Wives, which represents spouses of fallen soldiers, said she had lost money in the stock market collapse and decided to use an insurance payment from her husband\u2019s death to try to start her own business. Her husband, Jonathan M. Lankford, a command sergeant major in the Army, died in Baghdad in September 2007.In late 2009, she responded to an appeal from Trump University, which promised to \u201cturn anyone into a successful real estate investor\u201d and paid for the full package of seminars. Soon, however, she found they were of little practical value and she began \u201ccalling them and asking for help.\u201d\u201cThey ended up putting me in touch with some fellow out in California who tried to talk me into investing in trailer parks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a joke.\u201dMs. Lankford never filed complaints or pursued refunds, saying that it probably would have been fruitless, and that she was too busy raising her young son on her own and trying to rebuild her life. She came away from her experience believing both businesses were \u201call about taking money from people who don\u2019t have much to begin with.\u201dBesides Trump University, there were other Trump-connected enterprises that resonated with Cambridge members struggling to get ahead.On one of several Cambridge websites for its members, a chat group created in 2010 titled \u201cMaking Money in a Recession\u201d contained an appeal to join ACN, a multilevel marketer of telecommunications and energy services that was \u201cendorsed by Donald Trump and was featured in an episode of \u2018Celebrity Apprentice.\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure shows that he has collected more than $1 million in speaking fees from ACN, which charged people $499 to sell its products with the promise of profits for bringing in additional members, and has been the subject of numerous complaints.There was also an appeal for the Trump Network, the marketer of vitamins and nutritional supplements to which Mr. Trump licensed his name. Originally called Ideal Health and rebranded in 2009, the Trump Network and its top salespeople lured those hit by the economic downturn, suggesting they could become rich through commissions for bringing in new recruits.Christine Turner, a disabled nurse in upstate New York, said a friend persuaded her to spend \u201cclose to $500\u201d to get started with the Trump Network, but that it \u201cdidn\u2019t pan out\u201d after she struggled to get others involved. She also paid to join Cambridge, attracted to the prospect of networking with other members, but that did not work either.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any good experiences with members coming or approaching me or asking for products,\u201d Ms. Turner said, adding that she did not hold her bad experiences against the Trumps.\u201cI was fine with it, even with losing a little bit of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI really think that Donald Trump is a powerful businessman and I\u2019m actually for him, I\u2019m not afraid to say that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A French Minister Who Attracts Applause and Anger Considers a Bigger Stage", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEmmanuel Macron, the 38-year-old economy minister, whiz-kid technocrat and former Rothschild banker, has crystallized the hopes, fears and rage in the labor turmoil now unsettling France.Behind his back, colleagues in France\u2019s Socialist government whisper about his vaulting ambition. Many of them see him as a capitalist interloper, a traitor to Socialist ideals and a threat to their traditional base among workers.France appears both terrified and absorbed by Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas \u2014 making it easier to get and lose a job, to move to a new job, and to shake off the lifetime security of unbreakable contracts in search of something better.\u201cThere\u2019s a desire for change, but a fear of change, too. That\u2019s France,\u201d said Philippe Aghion, a Harvard economist who worked with Mr. Macron on a reform commission in 2008, and has influenced him.The ideas generated by that commission weigh in the minister\u2019s thinking, Mr. Aghion said.In a recent visit to the northern industrial town of Valenciennes, Mr. Macron appeared to be in full campaign mode.The police blocked off the city center, fearing protests. At a training center, apprentice welders and home health aid workers waited to take selfies with him. He quizzed them attentively, like a candidate, about their hopes and aspirations.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake for me is to inspire confidence again,\u201d Mr. Macron, striking a broad theme for France\u2019s future, told a worker grumbling about the labor reform law at a mattress factory. Nearby, other workers waited patiently for pictures.To the Socialist establishment, Mr. Macron is too ready to lecture much older politicians, and is the man who wants to \u201creintroduce mobility in the labor market,\u201d as he wrote in an article last year, but also to end \u201cour culture of paying managers more.\u201dIn his characteristic rapid-fire delivery, he told a parliamentary committee last month: \u201cWe\u2019ve created rigidities at the entrance point in artisanal occupations,\u201d like hairdressers and nail salons. \u201cWe\u2019ve put up barriers.\u201d France needs to \u201chelp in the creation of jobs for which qualifications are limited,\u201d he said. He was one of the youngest men in the room.An older Communist representative would have none of it.\u201cThere is always with you this, I won\u2019t say, obsession to liberate activity,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Chassaigne, a factory worker\u2019s son, scolded Mr. Macron. \u201cAs a society, we would lose our bearings.\u201dIn the central city of Orl\u00e9ans last month, he was invited by an opposition party mayor to preside over ceremonies honoring Joan of Arc, who made her decisive stand against the English there in 1429.\u201cJeanne was a shepherdess, but she beat a path to the king,\u201d Mr. Macron told hundreds spread out in the plaza in front of the towering 17th-century cathedral in the city where she led the French troops in battle.\u201cJeanne was a nobody. But she carried on her shoulders the will to progress and justice of an entire people. She was a crazy dream. But she wound up imposing herself as something obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve in individual initiatives, in courage, in risk.\u201dBut the audience was attentive, even if his arrival was greeted with boos from union members.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a crazy dream, impossible,\u201d he recently told a crowd in Lyon, \u201cbut this great change, necessary to our country, I\u2019m persuaded we can accomplish it together.\u201dThe City Hall in Lyon was packed, and the mayor there greeted him like a hero.Mr. Aghion, the Harvard economist, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a free atom. One doesn\u2019t really know where he is going.\u201d\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Mr. Aghion added, \u201che doesn\u2019t really have any allies.\u201dMuch of the challenge Mr. Macron will face, if he enters the lists in next year\u2019s race, was summed up in an encounter with reporters in Valenciennes. Defending himself over the harsh T-shirt encounter, he said, \u201cOne doesn\u2019t tutoie a minister,\u201d referring to the familiar form of the second-person pronoun.True, the \u201ctu\u201d form is generally used only with children and friends, and not with ministers. But a politician with national ambitions in France might be better off not pointing that out to a gaggle of journalists.\u201cHe\u2019s got to separate himself from his image as a technocrat,\u201d Mr. Aghion said.Advertisement"}

Hillary Clinton is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Yet the question of Bernie Sanders, and just what he will do next \u2014 and what he expects \u2014 remains unresolved.I think the national mix of open and closed primaries reflects that well. That said \u2014 and this is somewhat subtle \u2014 I think the case for requiring one party to have open primaries everywhere is a little worse than the case for open primaries in the abstract. In states where the G.O.P. has closed primaries, conservative registered Democrats or registered unaffiliated voters who lean toward Republicans will be able to participate only in Democratic primaries. That can make Democratic primaries more conservative, not less.And what could he ask for that he could plausibly get that would have the effect you\u2019re imagining?I think the danger for Sanders is that he loses leverage as the election moves on without him, especially if Clinton leads Trump.But speaking of something specific beyond his policy preferences, he would like changes in the leadership of the Democratic National Committee, especially the removal of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The early debate schedule set by the committee has long been a sore point with Sanders and his supporters: There were fewer debates than Sanders wanted \u2014 conspicuously fewer than the Republicans had \u2014 and most were on weekends, when fewer people would tune in.I thought he would have dropped out by now. Maybe we\u2019ll find out tonight.And this:I do think it\u2019s wrong to assume that Trump can mobilize a large pool of white voters who haven\u2019t voted in any recent election, especially with virtually no field operation to register and mobilize them.I doubt the G.O.P. will make big gains among Northern whites by pursuing the sort of messages and policies that Coulter prefers, but that\u2019s a separate question.Still, some of the numbers are scary for Trump: the percentage who say they could never vote for him (55), and the percentage of women who say they could never vote for him (63).In particular, I think it\u2019s very hard for him so long as a majority of Americans have a \u201cstrongly\u201d unfavorable view. The ABC/Post poll hasn\u2019t had it less than 48 percent all year, and it\u2019s 56 percent in this particular survey.The other view is that it was pretty close in 2012 \u2014 closer than Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and basically the same as Colorado \u2014 it has trended slightly toward the G.O.P. with respect to the country over the last decade or so, and it doesn\u2019t have very many nonwhite voters.I have a slightly different view, which is that I think Pennsylvania is as good a state as any for Trump, even if it\u2019s not a great one.So, I take the point that it\u2019s a huge long shot. But just about everything is a long shot for Trump at this point, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s harder for him than a state like Colorado or Virginia, which are better educated and more diverse, even if they have less Democratic voting traditions.He seems so obsessed with polls that I wonder if it will drive him nuts if he stays behind.It was pretty annoying in 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Warns That Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Thin Skin\u2019 Would Set Off War or Economic Crisis", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton delivered a lacerating rebuke on Thursday of her likely Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, declaring that he was hopelessly unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief. Electing him, she said, would be a \u201chistoric mistake.\u201dSpeaking in a steady, modulated tone but lobbing some of the most fiery lines of her presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton painted Mr. Trump as a reckless, childish and uninformed amateur who was playing at the game of global statecraft.\u201cThis is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\u201dThe speech, which mixed biting sarcasm and somber assessments of the foreign crises of the Obama years, unfurled what is likely to be the core argument that Mrs. Clinton will carry into the general election.Her remarks were billed as a major foreign policy address, and she was flanked by a row of 19 American flags as majestic as those that often back Mr. Trump at his public events. Yet the speech was devoid of new policy prescriptions, and she skipped over difficult episodes during her tenure as secretary of state, including the NATO intervention in Libya and its bloody aftermath in Benghazi.But Mrs. Clinton sought to turn Mr. Trump\u2019s prolific Twitter habit into an additional bullet point demonstrating that he was \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, as she put it. She twice referred to the scene in the White House Situation Room where as secretary of state, she advised Mr. Obama on the raid on a compound in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.\u201cImagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, eliciting cries of \u201cNo!\u201d from her audience. \u201cImagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he\u2019s angry, but America\u2019s entire arsenal.\u201dIn an interview with The New York Times during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s performance was \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cpathetic.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not thin-skinned at all. I\u2019m the opposite of thin-skinned.\u201dFor Mrs. Clinton, whose formal speeches tend to be earnest and laden with policy prescriptions, it was a striking departure \u2014 a rollicking political indictment that doubled as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s first full-blooded response to Mr. Trump\u2019s drumbeat of criticism about her ethics and judgment during a quarter-century in public life.The speech came after weeks of study by Clinton aides to determine which attacks by Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals had not worked. It was studded with punch lines: Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at one point. \u201cDonald doesn\u2019t see the complexity,\u201d she said at another. \u201cThis isn\u2019t reality television,\u201d she said of a Trump presidency. \u201cThis is actual reality.\u201d\u201cHe believes we can treat the U.S. economy like one of his casinos,\u201d she said.The speech was roughly 10 days in the making and written by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speechwriters, Dan Schwerin and Megan Rooney, and top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, with outside advisers including Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, reviewing a late draft. Ms. Rooney, a former State Department speechwriter, was perched on the arm of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chair on a flight from Boston to San Diego on Wednesday night, making revisions on her laptop and making sure the lines echoed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sardonic humor.The address was a meaty rebuttal to Democrats who had expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign lacked gumption in going after Mr. Trump, particularly because Mr. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have relished opportunities to skewer him.By turns mocking and stern, Mrs. Clinton derided Mr. Trump for suggesting that Japan should acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, that the United States should have walked away from the nuclear deal with Iran, and that \u201cmaybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.\u201d\u201cHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAnd to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a \u2018third-world country.\u2019\u201dIn vivid strokes, Mrs. Clinton framed not just her case against Mr. Trump but the broader foreign-policy debate in the election: She cast herself as the defender of an American-led world order against an insurgent who did not understand, let alone respect, the network of alliances the United States constructed after World War II to safeguard its interests.Mrs. Clinton presented herself as a sure-footed commander in chief, a fervent believer in America as an exceptional country, tested by her time in the Situation Room. She highlighted her ability to go \u201ctoe to toe\u201d with leaders in Beijing and Moscow, contrasting that with what she said was Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America\u2019s real friends are.\u201dMrs. Clinton recited a handful of highlights from her time at the State Department, including her role in brokering a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2012 and rallying the world to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. But she failed to flesh out her proposals for dealing with the Islamic State or the civil war in Syria.To Mrs. Clinton, such policy details were not as important as the black-and-white differences between her and Mr. Trump.\u201cHe has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists, even though those are war crimes,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cHe says he doesn\u2019t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has, quote, \u2018a very good brain.\u2019\u201d\u201cHe also said, \u2018I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.\u2019 You know what?\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t believe him.\u201dMrs. Clinton ended her remarks on a more solemn note, arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals, like barring Muslims from entering the United States, \u201ccould fuel an ugly narrative about who we are.\u201dMr. Trump, she said, would undo decades of statecraft by Republicans and Democrats. Striking a bipartisan note, Mrs. Clinton recalled an advertisement Mr. Trump took out in newspapers in 1987, during the Reagan administration, \u201csaying that America lacked a backbone and that the world was, you guessed it, laughing at us.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our president,\u201d she said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organizations about the significance of this decision.So there can be no doubt about the result.Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain\u2019s economy is fundamentally strong.And I would also reassure Brits living in European countries, and European citizens living here, that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.I am very proud and very honored to have been prime minister of this country for six years.I believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history, with reforms to welfare and education, increasing people\u2019s life chances, building a bigger and stronger society, keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.But above all restoring Britain\u2019s economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.That\u2019s why we delivered the first coalition government in 70 years to bring our economy back from the brink. It\u2019s why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain\u2019s position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.I held nothing back.But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.I will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.There is no need for a precise timetable today, but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October.Delivering stability will be important, and I will continue in post as prime minister with my cabinet for the next three months. The cabinet will meet on Monday.The governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen\u2019s Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty, the Queen, this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking.A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new prime minister, and I think it is right that this new prime minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the E.U.I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision.Britain is a special country.We have so many great advantages.A parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate.A great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multiracial, multifaith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths.I have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union, and indeed that we could find a way.Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way.And I will do everything I can to help.And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.Advertisement"}

Rajan, announced on Saturday that he would step down in September and return to academia, ending a three-year tenure that enhanced India\u2019s standing in international markets but frustrated conservatives and small business owners eager for deep interest rate cuts.Mr. Rajan previously expressed interest in staying on for a second term, but he said in a letter to colleagues that he had reconsidered. The decision, his letter implied, was driven in part by the preferences of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government.\u201cWhile I was open to seeing these developments through, on due reflection, and after consultation with the government, I want to share with you that I will be returning to academia when my term as governor ends on Sept. 4, 2016,\u201d the letter read.\u201cI will, of course, always be available to serve my country when needed,\u201d the letter added.Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted the 2008 global financial crisis three years before it happened, to an incredulous audience of prominent bankers and economists.He took over the Reserve Bank of India in 2013. At the time, India\u2019s economy was considered one of the \u201cfragile five\u201d emerging markets, and the rupee was in free fall. The technocratic Mr. Rajan was credited with reining in double-digit inflation and winning back the confidence of international investors. Indian journalists called him a \u201crock star economist\u201d and, in a reference to India\u2019s benchmark index, said he had \u201cput the sex back in Sensex.\u201dBut though India\u2019s growth has been strong by international standards, many of those who backed Mr. Modi have expressed frustration that Mr. Rajan did not do more to stimulate growth.Mr. Swamy, a former commerce minister and law minister, was jubilant on Saturday, saying a change in leadership would probably lead to swifter economic growth.\u201cI certainly wanted him out, and I made it clear to the prime minister, as clear as possible,\u201d he said, adding that he expected a positive reaction from India\u2019s industrialists.\u201cHis audience was essentially Western, and his audience in India was transplanted westernized society,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople used to come in delegations to my house to urge me to do something about it.\u201dThe public attacks on Mr. Rajan, analysts said, coincided with a growing conviction among Mr. Modi\u2019s inner circle that with inflation under control, the time was ripe to loosen monetary policy and publicly celebrate India\u2019s robust growth.Mr. Rajan was not inclined to do so. In interviews, he continued to urge the government to undertake structural reforms to the banking industry and to warn against complacency.In April, when Mr. Rajan was asked to comment on India\u2019s new status as a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the global economy, his response was notably sober.\u201cWe have this saying, \u2018In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,\u2019\u201d he said. Shortly afterward, one of Mr. Modi\u2019s top lieutenants rebuked Mr. Rajan for offending the visually impaired, and Mr. Rajan publicly apologized.He also raised hackles by warning in a speech against \u201canyone imposing a particular view or ideology because of their power,\u201d a remark that was viewed as stepping outside his area of expertise and into the realm of politics.\u201cThey wanted him to be the purveyor of good news, rather than a sense of realism, and that did not go down well at all,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cNow that there is a sense the economy has turned a corner, the view that he was dispensable had come to take hold.\u201dMr. Rajan is the first central bank governor since 1992 to opt not to seek a second term.The finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has said an announcement on a successor will come \u201cshortly.\u201d Markets were expected to open lower on Monday on the news, as investors wait to see who will replace Mr. Rajan.Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC Bank, called it \u201ca sad day for all of us.\u201d He said he expected to spend Monday responding to calls from upset investors, but said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to convince them that the macroeconomic factors are extremely strong.\u201d\u201cIf this had happened when India was weak, it would be chaotic, it would be terrible, it would be catastrophe,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can take it at this time. The hit will be minimal.\u201dAmong those who expressed regret at Mr. Rajan\u2019s decision was Palaniappan Chidambaram, a senior leader of the opposition Congress Party, who said he was \u201cdisappointed and profoundly saddened,\u201d but not surprised, by the news.\u201cThe government had invited this development through a craftily planned campaign of insinuations, baseless allegations and puerile attacks on a distinguished academic and economist,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government did not deserve Mr. Rajan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I believe we are always stronger together.\u201dThe ad\u2019s overarching theme echoes a new slogan, \u201cStronger Together,\u201d that the Clinton campaign will emphasize this week, beginning with a speech Mrs. Clinton plans to deliver in Cleveland on Monday in which she will accuse Mr. Trump of racism and call for the country \u2014 including Republicans turned off by their party\u2019s nominee \u2014 to get behind her candidacy.\u201cIt\u2019s time to unite behind some simple, common goals \u2014 to build a strong economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d she says.Mrs. Clinton already has a significant advantage over Mr. Trump in broadcast advertising thanks to the support of Priorities USA Action, the main \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her candidacy.Priorities USA ads have been on the air since mid-May and are now running in eight states deemed essential in the general election: Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Iowa and North Carolina.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to say where the \u201cWho We Are\u201d ad would run.Since capturing enough delegates to become the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump has not aired a broadcast ad, preferring to continue his campaign through large rallies that are often broadcast live, giving him free media exposure.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s first broadcast ad of the general election demonstrates a change from the main themes of her primary ads. Her campaign\u2019s most used ad during the primary against Mr. Sanders asserted her readiness for the presidency, and she often ran ads highlighting her support in and connection to minority communities.Having Mrs. Clinton narrate an ad, rather than hiring a narrator or using clips from her speeches, is also a departure from the primary campaign, although it is not a total surprise. A first ad in a general election is often meant to reintroduce a candidate to the electorate, even one as well known as Mrs. Clinton.The Clinton campaign has shown a willingness to advertise on television frequently, spending nearly $50 million in broadcast advertising during the primary campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Hints That Fed May Hold Back on Raising Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Weak economic growth in the United States could force the Federal Reserve to hold off on any imminent interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress on Tuesday.While Ms. Yellen said that the American economy\u2019s long-term prospects remain favorable, she signaled that headwinds, including slower employment gains in recent months, weak productivity growth and the persistence of a sluggish pace of inflation have prompted the Fed to adopt a more cautious stance.\u201cThe latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside \u2014 that domestic demand might falter,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\u201cProceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while we assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace,\u201d she said.Mirroring the habit of Fed leaders going back decades, Ms. Yellen hedged her bets, emphasizing her positive outlook for the years ahead, if not the coming quarter or two.But she acknowledged influential voices in academia and elsewhere who have warned that long-term growth could be substantially below the pace achieved in the decades before the Great Recession.\u201cAlthough I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue in the future,\u201d she said.In the question-and-answer portion of the hearing, Ms. Yellen termed recent productivity growth \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and pointed out that business investment had been similarly weak during the recovery. She added that the productivity issue was something Congress needed to address by improving polices for workplace training and other issues.Ms. Yellen\u2019s appearance is part of two days of testimony before Congress that the Fed leader is required to present twice each year. Another session is scheduled on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.Her previous testimony on monetary policy was in February, so this week\u2019s appearance before Congress is Ms. Yellen\u2019s last before the presidential election in November.As a result, Ms. Yellen received a barrage of questions on everything from the course of interest rates and banking regulation in the United States to the potential fallout if British voters decide in favor of leaving the European Union when they go to the polls on Thursday.Responding to opening questions from Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking committee, Ms. Yellen emphasized that until recently, the job market had held up well despite \u201cmixed developments in the economy.\u201dNoting that the jobs data for May was disappointing, she nonetheless said that \u201cit is important we don\u2019t overblow the significance of single report.\u201d\u201cIf the slowdown is a reflection of weak growth earlier in the year, I\u2019m hopeful we will see stronger job gains going forward,\u201d she added.Ms. Yellen called the possibility of a so-called Brexit \u201csignificant for the United Kingdom and Europe,\u201d and said that if Britain left the European Union it could usher in a period of uncertainty and volatility \u201cthat could affect market conditions and the U.S. economic outlook.\u201dLate in the hearing, Ms. Yellen said that while the Fed was closely monitoring the Brexit vote and the possible consequences of a vote to leave, she was not offering advice on how to vote.Although the decision \u201cis a unique event that has no close parallel,\u201d she said, the Fed \u201cis not attempting to take a stand. I am not providing advice in that sense.\u201dUnder questioning from Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, Ms. Yellen took aim at a recent suggestion from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, that one option in managing the federal debt might be to force investors to accept less than the face value of what the government owed.So-called haircuts aren\u2019t unusual for bondholders of troubled companies, or for businesses going through bankruptcy, like the ones Mr. Trump controlled as a businessman. But she made clear such a strategy could prove disastrous for the government and the economy alike.\u201cI feel the consequences for the United States and the global economy for defaulting on Treasury debt would be very severe,\u201d she said, avoiding mentioning Mr. Trump by name. \u201cAt a minimum, it could result in much higher borrowing costs for U.S. households and businesses.\u201dDespite the Fed\u2019s first move to tighten monetary policy in a decade in December, interest rates remain extremely low by historical standards and not too far above the so-called zero-bound.That kind of accommodation provides support for the economy, Ms. Yellen said, but it does rob the Fed of what she called a \u201ctried and true\u201d tool in the face of an economic shock: a rate cut to spur growth.For now, though, Ms. Yellen saw little reason to fear an impending crisis and she dismissed fears among some on Wall Street that the Fed has contributed to imbalances in the markets. \u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence,\u201d she said, \u201cof those broad-based financial stability concerns.\u201dAnd for all her caution about the outlook for the economy, Ms. Yellen said she did not see a recession on the horizon.\u201cThe odds of a recession are low,\u201d she said. Even as the Fed chairwoman listed headwinds like a weak manufacturing sector, lower commodity prices and job losses in the energy sector, she said, \u201cI remain quite optimistic.\u201dRecessions are usually preceded by the threat of rising inflation and tightening monetary policy, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any such conditions in play right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In New Mexico, for example, I met some kids who lost their parents \u2014 to drugs, death, deportation or something else.They get run through a bunch of systems, including homeless shelter, foster care, mental health and often juvenile justice. They\u2019re like any kids \u2014 they turn hungrily to any beam of friendship. But for these kids, life has been a series of temporary stops at impersonal places. They sometimes have only the vaguest idea where they are going next month. \u201cI\u2019m going back into the foster care system,\u201d one teenager told me, without affect either way.You meet people who are uncomfortable with the basics of the modern economy.I met a woman in West Virginia who had just learned, to great relief, that she didn\u2019t have to give an anticipated speech at church. \u201cWe\u2019re not word people,\u201d she explained.

A lot of wonderful people speak through acts of service, but it\u2019s hard to thrive in the information age if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with verbal communication.You see the ravages of drugs everywhere. I ran into a guy in Pittsburgh who hires people for his small plant. He has to give them drug tests because they\u2019re operating heavy equipment. If he pulls in 100 possible hires, most of them either fail the drug test or don\u2019t show up for it because they know they will fail.But this kind of tour is mostly uplifting, not depressing. Let me just describe two people I met on Saturday in Albuquerque.Yet this woman glows with joy and good cheer. She\u2019d built a family out of her friendships. She\u2019d completed high school, learned to express her moods through poetry and novellas, found a place to live through New Day\u2019s Transitional Living Program, found a job and had plans to go to community college.I have no idea how a person this beautiful can emerge from a past that hard, and yet you meet people like this all the time. Their portion of good luck may have been small, but their capacity for gratitude is infinite.This is a center for kids who, given the stress and poverty all around, have often lost their fathers to suicide, drugs or accidents.The young kids are anxious about who is going to die next. They don\u2019t really understand what death is and wonder if their loved one is going to be wet and cold if it\u2019s raining on his grave.The older kids are sometimes trapped in magical thinking: Maybe if I\u2019d gotten better grades, he wouldn\u2019t be gone. Sometimes they will start dressing, talking and acting like the deceased.Many teenagers don\u2019t want the other kids in school to know, so they go through life as if nothing is wrong. Then three years later when they suffer some breakup or setback, it all comes barreling out because it hasn\u2019t been processed up until now.Along with a hundred other volunteers and staff members, Bock gets these kids to process their grief. She sits with them in group after group, tender but in a realistic no-nonsense sort of way. She\u2019ll cry and be present, but she won\u2019t let you escape the task of moving through it.

{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 3 Centuries of Unity in Britain Are in Danger", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 When people discuss the stakes of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, they often talk about implications for the \u201cEuropean project,\u201d the continuing post-World War II effort to unify the Continent politically and economically. But within hours of the polls\u2019 closing on Thursday, it appeared that something much more basic could be at risk: Britain as a multinational state.The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as it is formally known, is one of only a handful of countries that consist of multiple nations, politically and legally distinct but united under a common government.That system of government has been the subject of far less frenzied commentary than European unity, because it is smaller, and because it has seemed so stable. But the crisis-ridden, relatively young European Union may well outlast the 300-year-old United Kingdom, a prospect that speaks to both the underappreciated audacity of Britain\u2019s multinational experiment and the strength of the forces that could now put it to an end.In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the calls to leave the United Kingdom may focus on the economic benefits of European Union membership, but they will also overlap with \u2014 and, if they are to succeed, rely upon \u2014 more visceral desires for independence.After all, the world has spent much of the last few centuries organizing itself under the principle of national self-determination, in which people with a common identity acquire their own state. Think of Italy for the Italians in the 1870s, Algeria for the Algerians in 1962, Tajikistan for the Tajiks in 1991 and so on.While this idea has brought liberation to much of the world, it has also contributed to countless wars, including Nazi Germany\u2019s invasions to \u201cunify\u201d with the German people of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethno-linguistic lines and the Israel-Palestine conflict.What makes the United Kingdom so unusual is that it brought together four nationalities who see themselves as distinct yet have chosen to coexist. Multinational states are rare. Some, like China, are undemocratic and oppose political organizing by minority groups, including Tibetans and Uighurs. Others, such as Russia and Nigeria, have struggled to peacefully and effectively unify.Still, questions of national identity have pulled at the country since 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Because the English have so dominated the country\u2019s politics, culture and economy \u2014 they are the largest group, and England\u2019s capital, London, became the kingdom\u2019s \u2014 Scots have long pushed for greater autonomy.These questions have been even harder for Northern Ireland, which experienced a violent internal conflict, partly over whether to remain in the United Kingdom or to join Ireland, for much of the 20th century\u2019s latter half. The long road to the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement illustrated the difficulty of keeping a multinational state together, and the calm in Northern Ireland since the agreement shows the value of such a state.Having survived nationalist yearnings from Scotland and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom could now succumb to the nationalism of its largest and most powerful group: the English.The English voted most heavily to leave the union. While many analysts say this grew out of opposition to immigration or skepticism about Europe, Mr. Tombs suggested another driver: an English sense of being underrepresented in their own country.In recent decades, the United Kingdom has kept unity by \u201cdevolving\u201d political authority to the three non-English nations, allowing them greater autonomy and independent institutions. Only England, for example, does not have its own Parliament.It is hard to miss the significance that voters in one of the world\u2019s most successful multinational states just chose to leave the world\u2019s largest multinational government. And it is striking the degree to which the United Kingdom\u2019s four nations seem to have disagreed on that choice.The European Union was explicitly founded to address problems of national and political identity. Britain, its most skeptical member, dealt with those very same problems \u2014 sooner, and with more success.Now the country could be about to abandon that project, even as the union, for all its setbacks, carries on. But it speaks to the promise of multinationalism that its most committed adherents in the United Kingdom are not the largest and most powerful group, but rather the minority Scottish and Irish so eager to be tied to something larger, even if that means leaving the old partnership to remain in Europe.Follow @Max_Fisher on Twitter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is \u2018Brexit\u2019 the Precursor to a Donald Trump Presidency? Not So Fast", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byDriving the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote were many of the same impulses that have animated American politics in this turbulent election year: anger at distant elites, anxiety about a perceived loss of national sovereignty and, perhaps most of all, resentment toward migrants and refugees.\u201cAnd so lots of folks want to turn the clock back and make America, or their country, great again.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump may struggle to convert a message of national retrenchment into victory here, some of the stark divisions on display in Britain do mirror political trends in this country.The highly educated, younger voters around London who voted to remain in the European Union, for example, share some commonalities with the American urbanites who were the pillars of Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition. And Mr. Trump has triumphed with the American counterparts of the British \u201cLeave\u201d voters: older whites who lack university degrees and live in less prosperous regions of the English countryside.But beneath those generalities, there are crucial distinctions between the Brexit vote and the 2016 presidential election.In the United States, there is no recent history of electing nationalist presidents hostile to immigration, and even recent Republican presidents have celebrated new arrivals as integral to American prosperity and identity.American presidential elections are largely decided by a diverse and upscale electorate, anchored in America\u2019s cities and suburbs. These communities more closely resemble London than Lincolnshire. Minorities made up more than a quarter of the electorate in the last presidential campaign.And while Britain decided to leave the European Union through a popular vote, the White House race will be determined by the Electoral College, which is tilted toward the Democrats. Some large states with significant nonwhite populations have been out of reach for Republican candidates for much of the last three decades; California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania have voted for every Democratic nominee since 1992. Mr. Obama also won Florida twice, and Mrs. Clinton has a lead there now in part because Mr. Trump is unpopular with Hispanics.Together those six states offer 166 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.Mr. Trump is at an even greater disadvantage than other recent Republican presidential nominees because of his dismal standing with nonwhite, college-educated and female voters. Unless he can reverse the deeply negative views such voters have of him, he is unlikely to capture the voter-rich communities around Philadelphia, Denver, Miami and Washington that are crucial to winning the White House.Joe Trippi, a Democratic political strategist who was a consultant for former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, said he expected the Brexit vote to embolden American conservatives. But their excitement, Mr. Trippi said, would be largely \u201ca false read\u201d of the results.\u201cThere are some very similar things \u2014 a polarized electorate, nativism, nationalism were clearly big factors, and Trump exemplifies them here,\u201d Mr. Trippi said.\u201cBut there is a difference in the multiculturalism and diversity of the United States, versus nowhere near the same factors in the U.K.\u201dFurther, the vote in Britain was a referendum on a European entity that was easy to rally against, while the presidential vote here is increasingly becoming a referendum on a polarizing individual.\u201cAmericans will be asked to vote for or against a person: Trump,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former press secretary for George W. Bush.\u201cAnd that\u2019s a higher hurdle. If you want to express yourself with a protest vote, you\u2019ll have to vote for Trump, and he is singularly unattractive and even offensive to a large majority of Americans.\u201dIf the moment seemed to invite a triumphant, thematic victory speech by Mr. Trump on Friday, the candidate himself had other ideas.Mr. Trump was dismissive of the economic ramifications of the referendum, and predicted that a downturn for the British pound would benefit his business. \u201cWhen the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The larger impact of the vote may not play out in this fall\u2019s election between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. But it will almost certainly divide the Republican Party in the years ahead, deepening the internal rift caused by the rise of Mr. Trump and his coalition.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, both widely thought to be considering presidential bids in 2020, quickly released statements that seized on the \u201cLeave\u201d vote as an illustration of the disconnect between the voters and internationalist leaders in Washington, London and Brussels.\u201cThe G.O.P. is becoming more nationalistic, and this trend will probably continue whatever happens with Trump,\u201d Ms. Ingraham wrote in an email before the referendum result was announced.Advertisement"}

It will be the seventh time the two leaders have met.There are compelling reasons the leaders of the world\u2019s largest democracies would find common cause. The United States is encouraging the rise of India as a giant Asian partner to balance China, and India is trying to accelerate its economy with an injection of investment from American companies.It is worth recounting just how unlikely such a friendship is.The nation\u2019s first black president, Mr. Obama has made the protection of minorities a central pillar of his life. And he has argued that criticism and dissent are core tenets of democracy.Generally poorer and less educated than India\u2019s Hindus, Muslims are about 14 percent of the population, about the same proportion as African-Americans in the United States. In India, Mr. Modi\u2019s reputation among Muslims could broadly be compared to that of a Southern segregationist from the 1950s.Explore key developments in the 2002 riots in Gujarat that shadowed Narendra Modi\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s office.Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Modi is given to displaying affection. Both avoid the socializing common in their capitals. And while Mr. Obama is a doting father and dutiful husband who maintains close bonds with his childhood friends, Mr. Modi abandoned his arranged marriage decades ago and has no children or any public friendships.Some political analysts have expressed deep skepticism that the two leaders have any real fondness for each other.\u201cObama is the opposite of that, so it is hard to see how close they can be,\u201d Mr. Bajpai said.Others see similarities that extend beyond political beliefs.Both men rose from modest circumstances, had difficult relationships with their fathers and were widely considered transformational figures when elected. (Mr. Modi\u2019s humble origins, largely corruption-free government and intense focus on winning foreign investment are sharp breaks from his predecessor.) And parts of Mr. Modi\u2019s political operation, in particular its effective use of social media, were based on Mr. Obama\u2019s model.\u201cModi is a really down-to-earth guy who tries to answer your questions and doesn\u2019t just go to talking points,\u201d Mr. Vickery said.\u201cThe hours they\u2019ve spent together,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said Saturday, \u201chave allowed them to have a good understanding of their respective worldviews and domestic circumstances, and made it possible to deepen defense ties, advance our civil nuclear cooperation and achieve a breakthrough on climate change.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s also an indication of how important President Obama thinks our relationship is with India, as the world\u2019s largest democracy and an increasingly important partner.\u201dA shared interest in clean power and climate change is central to their personal bond, some analysts said.\u201cThese two guys get very little political traction at home for being climate champions, but they are anyway, and I think they respect each other for that,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former senior adviser to the United States special envoy on climate change.Tavleen Singh, an Indian commentator and admirer of Mr. Modi, said the prime minister\u2019s high-profile sanitation campaign and his efforts to improve the status of women would also endear him to Mr. Obama. Still, she said she doubted that the two men were truly affectionate.Zia Haq, an assistant editor at The Hindustan Times in India, was also skeptical.\u201cI refuse to believe the two men could be very good personal friends deep down, because Modi is all things Obama can\u2019t possibly be,\u201d Mr. Haq wrote in an email.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commitment to Class Conflict Drives Leader of French Labor Unrest", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 All up and down the boulevard, store windows were smashed \u2014 at a Starbucks, a supermarket, a handbag store. Young men clambered on top of bus shelters. Even a children\u2019s hospital was attacked. The police brought out tear gas and a rarely used water cannon.Even for a country used to unruly labor protests, the violence on the streets of Paris on Tuesday was a shock. But days later, the man behind the antigovernment protests that have rippled across France was barely apologetic. If anything, he promised more.Philippe Martinez, the mustachioed boss of one of France\u2019s biggest labor unions, the General Confederation of Labor, known as C.G.T., has mobilized tens of thousands of workers and sent them coursing through the streets of French cities for weeks.This past week, it was Paris\u2019s turn. Mr. Martinez \u2014 55, stocky, pugnacious and combative \u2014 ordered over 600 buses to ferry union protesters from the provinces to a march here, which drew tens of thousands of demonstrators on Tuesday.The protests are aimed at stopping a government push for a new labor law that would make it slightly easier to hire and fire workers. But they are also part of a struggle between competing visions for France\u2019s future, experts on French unions say.For unions, the government\u2019s proposed labor law is another step by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to move France to the center in order to address the challenges of a global economy. Mr. Martinez, those familiar with him and his union say, has a different vision, shaped by decades of close ties between his union and the French Communist Party, of which he was a longtime member.The Communist Party and Mr. Martinez share a view of class struggle and unending worker exploitation, according to several experts on French unions. Mr. Martinez, a Renault car factory worker, declined to be interviewed.\u201cHe agrees that class struggle is the watchword of history, and that workers are necessarily in combat against bosses,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Mouriaux, a leading historian of the French union movement. In Mr. Martinez\u2019s view, he added, between bosses and workers \u201cthere can be compromises, but no definitive agreements.\u201dThree weeks ago, Mr. Martinez\u2019s workers went on strike to block the printing of France\u2019s national newspapers for a day after newspapers refused to publish a commentary he had written. The Communist newspaper L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 was the only one to print it.On Friday, Mr. Martinez angrily denied that the protest had been connected to the violence at the march through Paris, which left the Boulevard du Montparnasse, a main artery of the city\u2019s Left Bank, looking like a war zone.\u201cThe hooligans are there to discredit our movement,\u201d he told journalists in the courtyard of the Labor Ministry, vowing to continue the marches until the government gives up its labor law.But despite Mr. Martinez\u2019s belated disavowals, violence, including serious injuries, has been a constant feature of his union\u2019s protests over the past few months.Paris\u2019s police prefect has released photos of union members ripping up paving stones to be used as projectiles. Mr. Martinez said they had simply been defending themselves.Shocked by the smashed windows at the children\u2019s hospital, Mr. Hollande said a ban on future demonstrations was possible, provoking outrage among some members his own Socialist Party.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us now to back down from our days of mobilization,\u201d Mr. Martinez told reporters on Friday after a fruitless meeting with the labor minister to end the standoff. \u201cFor three months, the government has been counting on us to lose steam. It\u2019s been a bad bet.\u201dMr. Hollande\u2019s government is equally unlikely to back down. It is pinning its hopes of denting France\u2019s chronically high unemployment on a law that would only slightly relax negotiating conditions between workers and management.The change is considered mild by most economists, but has been deemed hopelessly pro-capitalist by Mr. Martinez\u2019s union and even by members of Mr. Hollande\u2019s party.Months of protests have weakened the proposed law, and it no longer includes a mechanism to cap payouts to fired workers. The law would also define more precisely how companies could lay off workers \u2014 currently an arduous process in a country where workers are highly protected.But the part of the proposal that most infuriates C.G.T. and a few other unions would allow labor agreements negotiated by individual companies \u2014 over such issues as hours worked, paid holidays and bonuses \u2014 to take precedence over agreements negotiated at the occupational sector level.That change would weaken the power of unions such as C.G.T., and it has made Mr. Martinez see red. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect the hierarchy of norms,\u201d he told reporters on Friday, while leaving the door slightly open to possible exceptions.Yet with each new burst of violence in the streets, the government is increasingly dismissive of Mr. Martinez and his motives. Some government officials say that the violence will backfire and put the French on the side of the labor law, and that Mr. Martinez is using the violence to shore up his base.If so, the union leader is doing a good job. France has among the lowest rates of unionization in Europe, and C.G.T., which represents train workers, metalworkers, public sector workers, miners and others, has been losing members for years. Between 1975 and 1993, it lost nearly two-thirds of its members, and now stands at about 686,000.Today it is made up of mainly hard-core militants, analysts say. The old-fashioned language of class struggle was much in evidence among the crowds at Tuesday\u2019s march, underscoring how many of France\u2019s contemporary struggles are rooted in both the language and facts of its history.\u201cI Am in the Class Struggle\u201d was a sticker sported by many protesters. \u201cWork Is a Crime Against Humanity,\u201d read another. \u201cVictory in Chaos,\u201d someone had scrawled on a building. \u201cThe Struggle Is About Class Against Class,\u201d read one billboard.Mr. Martinez moves easily among these views. His father fought in the Spanish Civil War in the International Brigades against the fascists, and his mother was a housekeeper.C.G.T. was founded in 1895, and its \u201cexplicit aim was to bring down the state,\u201d said another historian of French labor, Nick Parsons of Cardiff University in Wales. \u201cIt still has that anticapitalist orientation.\u201d\u201cThis is a guy who was brought up in that sort of atmosphere,\u201d Dr. Parsons added. \u201cHe\u2019s imbued with that history and culture.\u201dMr. Martinez has shown a willingness to compromise in negotiations as a metalworker representative in preceding decades, Dr. Parsons noted. But that side is not evident now, with polls showing that most French people are still opposed to the labor law.The class struggle continues.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be called the \u2018law on work,\u2019 but the \u2018social dumping law,\u2019\u201d Mr. Martinez yelled during a recent speech at a factory in southern France. \u201cWe\u2019re not close to giving up. The stakes are high \u2014 for today\u2019s workers, for the young, for our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Buy a more fuel-efficient car.But consumers are heading in the opposite direction. They have rekindled their love of bigger cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, favoring them over small cars, hybrids and electric vehicles, which are considered crucial to helping slow global warming.In 2008, President Obama set a goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 in the United States, but the total is now around 442,000, including plug-in hybrids. This year, electric and hybrid sales have dropped to 2.4 percent of new-car purchases.\u201cPeople have very short memories about the price of gasoline,\u201d Dr. Sivak said.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cNobody is interested,\u201d said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his father-in-law\u2019s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1,500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer.Mr. Di Maria said that his father-in-law, who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford F-150 pickup.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to drive around in a big tank?\u201d Mr. Di Maria said. \u201cWhen people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?\u201dBuyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether.Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americans\u2019 views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology.When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325,000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M.I.T., was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in low-emission cars.\u201cAll my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,\u201d he said. \u201c I thought, this is great news.\u201dYears from now, he added, \u201cwe will look at this as a watershed moment.\u201dOthers who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car.When he gives speeches and is asked how the electric-car market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201dSeconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation.

{"Headline": "Only in Europe Can Britain Be Great", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAcheson argued that Britain\u2019s paths to influence in the world, including its special relationship with the United States, were \u201cplayed out.\u201d Just one avenue remained: positive engagement with Europe. The only obstacle was British recalcitrance.So it appears today, even after more than 40 years of European Union membership. The \u201cLeave\u201d campaign tries to summon a vision of Britain at its patriotic best when it stands alone, a race apart, an island unto itself and fiercely independent of Europe. The pro-European \u201cRemain\u201d camp would like to talk of a Britain that is outward-looking and at the heart of Europe.But ministers of the Conservative government, under pressure from the euroskeptics within their party\u2019s ranks, find it difficult to break out of negative terrain. For most of the campaign, they have defended European membership merely as the lesser of two evils. At times, this bitter and bad-tempered referendum resembles a battle between those who want us half out of Europe and those who want us fully out.Traditional patriotism and modern realities need not be at odds. In an interdependent world, each country must strike a balance between the autonomy it desires and the cooperation it needs. In the European Union, Britain can play a constructive role without either subjugating its identity to a European superstate or lurching backward into a \u201cLittle England\u201d mind-set. The way we can reconcile the competing forces of memory, destiny and reality is by leading Europe\u2019s next stage of development.America rightly claims to be an exceptional country. So, too, is Britain. We honor British exceptionalism, show national pride and confound the euroskeptic message when we put ourselves in the vanguard of charting Europe\u2019s future. And the world benefits from a Britain unafraid to lead.A British-inspired agenda can help reinvigorate this Continental soul and promote the union that the international community needs: a global Europe no longer self-absorbed and inward-looking, but focused on building powerful and productive diplomatic and trading relationships throughout the world.Consider the problem of terrorism. The multinational operations of the Islamic State can be countered only by cross-border security cooperation. Britain is home to one of the world\u2019s most respected intelligence agencies, which makes it well placed to lead a more professional pan-European effort on intelligence-sharing and surveillance.Our history of engagement with the Middle East and Africa also positions Britain to shape a European-led modern version of the Marshall Plan that would combine diplomacy, aid and economic incentives to address the causes of instability in those regions. And as Europe faces its largest humanitarian crisis since 1945 \u2014 tens of millions of migrants and refugees \u2014 Britain must help the union provide its neighbors with new educational, economic and entrepreneurial opportunities. A fast-growing population of about 200 million young people in the Middle East and North Africa must have a future defined not by the choice between tyranny and terrorism, but by opportunity and hope.With British encouragement, Europe can lead the world in confronting climate change. The Continent needs to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, which is subsidizing oppression near the union\u2019s eastern border. A reformed European energy market, recalling the union\u2019s postwar origins as a coal and steel community, could integrate abundant British wind and wave power into a Continental low-carbon energy grid.Europe can be an engine of global growth again if we open its digital, information technology and service industries to cross-Continental competition, unite the union\u2019s brightest scientific and academic minds to create the world\u2019s largest research hub, and conclude a better, more transparent trade deal with the United States. Britain should also be a key player in demonstrating that such powerful economic cooperation is about creating more than merely a competitive marketplace, but a community underpinned by social rights and workplace standards.A Britain that accomplishes these things will not make any of us less British as a result. The high tide of Europe\u2019s federalist ambitions is receding. In its place is a more acceptable model of decision making shared by its 28 national governments. The Continent\u2019s future lies not in a United States of Europe, but in a United Europe of States.At Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4, 1962, President John F. Kennedy called for a \u201cdeclaration of interdependence\u201d with Europe, in which the United States was pledged as a partner, toward \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d And he urged Britain to champion \u201ca united Europe\u201d in order to promote the rule of law, freedom, peace and prosperity around the world.He was right then, and his words live on. For Britain in its post-imperial era, engagement is our oxygen, cooperation our imperative and leadership our destiny. If Britons vote to lead in Europe, not leave it, on June 23, they will show that Britain is anything but \u201cplayed out.\u201dGordon Brown is a former chancellor of the Exchequer and prime minister of Britain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Chasing a Legend, Katie Ledecky Discovers a Buoyant Ally", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byOMAHA \u2014 To those who have watched her swim circles around the competition, Katie Ledecky appears to have no peers in the pool. Ledecky, however, knows better.At a meet outside Phoenix in April, she spotted Debbie Meyer, the woman she will probably be chasing at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, and trundled over to say hello. Meyer greeted her with a hug and exclaimed: \u201cYou\u2019re great! Two, four, eight. Do it this summer!\u201dAt the 1968 trials ahead of the Olympics in Mexico City, Meyer set world records in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles. Two months after turning 16, she swept her events at the Summer Games to become the first swimmer to win three individual Olympic gold medals. No Olympian since has matched Meyer\u2019s 200-400-800 string of gold (the men contest the 1,500 meters instead of the 800).Ledecky, 19, may be the one to finally match the feat.She owns the fastest times in the world this year in the 200-, 400- and 800-meter freestyles. Aside from Michael Phelps, she was the only American swimmer who was No. 1 in the world in individual events in the 2015 year-end rankings. Ledecky\u2019s performance heading into the United States Olympic swimming trials, which began Sunday at CenturyLink Center, has turned Meyer, 63, into a time traveler. Suddenly, it seems like 1968 once more, with another teen queen preparing for her prom date with history.Ledecky, who will enter Stanford in the fall, is far too humble to count her gold medals before they are won. But she indirectly declared her intentions to go after Meyer\u2019s record when she posted the sixth-fastest performance in history in the 200 freestyle at a competition in Texas in January. She already owns eight of the 10 top times in history in the 400 freestyle and nine of the 10 fastest swims ever in the 800.Ledecky will begin her pursuit on Monday in the 400 meters at the Olympic trials.Ledecky\u2019s lodestar is Janet Evans, who won the 400- and 800-meter freestyles (and the 400 individual medley) at the 1988 Summer Olympics and successfully defended her 800 title in 1992.But Ledecky\u2019s remarkable range carries old-timers back further in time, to Meyer in the late 1960s and Shirley Babashoff in the first six years of the 1970s. In 1976, Babashoff came closest to matching Meyer, earning silvers in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles behind East German competitors later found to have been part of a state-sponsored doping program (at the 1972 Munich Games, Australia\u2019s Shane Gould won the 200 and 400 and finished second in the 800).Since upsetting Britain\u2019s Rebecca Adlington in the 800 freestyle at the 2012 London Games in her first international competition, Ledecky has held a python\u2019s grip on the women\u2019s distances. In this year\u2019s world rankings, she is almost four seconds faster than her nearest rival in the 400 and more than 11 seconds ahead of her closest competitor in the 800.\u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words sometimes when I think about what she has been able to do the last four years,\u201d said the Olympian Rowdy Gaines, an NBC swimming analyst, adding: \u201cShe loves to train. She loves to be out there every day and loves that feeling. You don\u2019t get that a lot, and I think that\u2019s really helped her.\u201dMeyer exerted an enormous influence on her heir apparent, though Ledecky was wholly unaware of it until they met in 2014. Ledecky and her older brother, Michael, inherited their love of the sport from their mother, Mary Gen, who was a teenage swimmer in North Dakota in 1968 when Meyer broke the American record in the 800-meter freestyle five times.Ledecky\u2019s mother, a freestyler who went on to compete at the University of New Mexico, was beguiled by Meyer. She begged her parents to allow her to stay up to watch the telecast of the swimming at the Mexico City Games, where the women\u2019s 800 freestyle made its Olympic debut.Ledecky was with her mother at a U.S.A. Swimming-related function when they ran into Meyer. Recalling their meeting, Meyer said Ledecky\u2019s mother seemed more excited than Ledecky. Nearly a half-century later, Meyer has been the one glued to the television, watching Ledecky develop into the most formidable all-around freestyler of her, or possibly any, generation.\u201cWhen I watch her swim, it brings back so many memories,\u201d Meyer said.She looks at Ledecky and sees an upgraded version of the swimming machine that she was as a teenager \u2014 an Apple MacBook Pro to Meyer\u2019s Honeywell kitchen computer. Like Ledecky, Meyer got her start in an East Coast recreational swimming league and later was known for taking her races out fast, treating whatever distance she was racing as a sprint.Like Ledecky, Meyer was spurred on in training by a male teammate who was also an Olympian. And as Ledecky aspires to do, Meyer emerged as the bright star of an Olympics with a first-time host, in a city whose preparation for the Games was fraught with problems.\u201cThere are a lot of similarities,\u201d Meyer said.In 1965, Meyer\u2019s father was transferred to California, and Meyer, then 12, joined Arden Hills, in Sacramento, the training base for a handful of top-level swimmers, as Nation\u2019s Capital Swim Club, where Ledecky trains, has become.Meyer\u2019s coach, Sherm Chavoor, held practices twice a day and used a stopwatch in lieu of a pace clock. He trained his swimmers to take races out hard and hold the pace. Mike Burton, a three-time Olympic champion, was the one everybody followed.Five years older than Meyer, he would become the first man to surpass 16 minutes for the 1,650-yard free, the first to break 8:30 in the 800-meter freestyle and the first man to win consecutive 1,500 freestyle Olympic crowns.Meyer idolized Burton, nicknamed Mr. Machine because of his ability to grind out mileage. She doggedly chased him when he returned home from U.C.L.A., to train. Eventually she progressed to where she could catch him and, on occasion, beat him.\u201cI could not wait for him to get back from college,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI would get in the lane right next to him so I could race him.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Burton recalled Meyer breaking world records in practice.\u201cShe was very, very tough, just a very hard worker,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery practice, I was just trying my damnedest to stay ahead of her.\u201dLedecky\u2019s pacesetter is Andrew Gemmell, who finished ninth in the 1,500-meter freestyle at the 2012 Olympics. A couple of times a week, Ledecky said, she and Gemmell go head-to-head in training.\u201cIt keeps me honest,\u201d Gemmell said before a swim meet in May in Atlanta.They do not go head-to-head every day. The practices run by Gemmell\u2019s father, Bruce, the head coach of Nation\u2019s Capital, reflect the era. The over-distance emphasis popularized by Chavoor and his ilk has been replaced by shorter sets performed at race pace.Instead of trudging through repeats of 800 meters, which Meyer did routinely, Ledecky is more apt to swim a set of eight 100s, each at race speed.As often as not, she is likely to swim in the same lane as Gemmell and start 10 seconds after him, leaving them both to race the clock.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of fun training with Andrew the last couple of years, even if I\u2019m not directly racing him in a practice,\u201d Ledecky said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s great to have an elite distance swimmer there \u2014 somebody that\u2019s been to the Olympics and has experienced the same thing and is working toward the same goals as I am.\u201dThe Mexico City Olympics, the first Games to be held in Latin America, took place during a tumultuous time in history. In the months before, there were pro-democracy student demonstrations that turned violent, with dozens, perhaps hundreds killed during one protest less than two weeks before the Games. Others stridently voiced their disapproval over the exorbitant amounts of money being spent on sports facilities while Mexico\u2019s social problems worsened.Meyer recalled sitting down with a piece of pie \u00e0 la mode one night and watching the NBC program \u201cThe Huntley-Brinkley Report.\u201d One of the anchors, she recalled, mentioned the possibility that the 1968 Olympics could be canceled, and Meyer said she immediately lost her appetite.\u201cI sat up straight in the chair,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201dMany people aren\u2019t sure what to think about the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, the first Games to be held in South America, which are also taking place during a tumultuous time in history.Brazil\u2019s president is facing impeachment, the country\u2019s economy is in a tailspin, global public-health officials are worried about the spread of the Zika virus, and polluted bodies of water slated for use during the Olympic competition present another health risk. For all these reasons, there have been calls to cancel or postpone these Summer Games.\u201cWhen you\u2019re watching the news and it comes up, I sometimes listen,\u201d Ledecky said.The dire reports, she added, do not give her pause.\u201cEach Olympics seems to have different things that could be thrown our way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just have to do the best we can to prepare.\u201dSo Ledecky resolutely forges ahead, training her focus on what she can control. Swimming is a solitary sport, especially when one\u2019s main competition is the clock. But Ledecky does not feel alone as she prepares to set the table at the trials for a 200, 400 and 800 feast in Rio.It inspires her to know Meyer is following her progress.\u201cTo know that the person who did it is supporting me as I go to the Olympic trials,\u201d Ledecky said, \u201cthat\u2019s cool.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The land sits on a prime piece of coastline in Elliniko in southern Athens.Elliniko is part of an ambitious privatization program by Greece\u2019s leftist-led government and the country\u2019s international creditors. Apart from Greece\u2019s power board and other state companies, the portfolio of Greek assets for sale includes former government buildings, beaches and hotels.The deal, which was frozen for a year and a half because of protests, was hailed as a breakthrough. Taiped\u2019s chairman, Stergios Pitsiorlas, said the site, which covers four square kilometers, or 1.5 square miles, would accommodate \u201cthe largest urban regeneration project in Europe,\u201d and create thousands of jobs for the debt-ridden nation.

The office of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the investment would help \u201crestart the economy.\u201dCurrently, however, the site is home to some 3,000 refugees who live in a makeshift settlement in the former airport building. The structure also houses several small companies, chiefly shipping and advertising firms. It had served as sports venues for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.The government has promised to clear the site and relocate the refugees to a yet-to-be-determined location by November.The deal was one of the few loose ends needed for creditors to sign off on 7.5 billion euros, about $8.5 billion, in bailout money after the approval of fresh austerity measures in recent weeks.Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Greek authorities had done \u201c95 percent of the changes necessary\u201d to unlock the money.First signed by the previous conservative-led coalition in November 2014, the privatization deal was held up after protests by local residents and authorities.It was clinched after locals \u201ccame around to the idea,\u201d Mr. Pitsiorlas said in an interview. The developers also agreed to demands by the Greek state for the site to include more green spaces, and to pay maintenance costs. The site will also have malls, golf courses and luxury homes.The consortium of Lamda Development, the Abu Dhabi-based real estate firm Al Maabar and the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International has pledged 915 million euros, about $1 billion, to lease the plot for 99 years. Another 7 billion euros, about $7.9 billion, will go toward the creation of parks, luxury homes, golf courses and the extension of the public transportation and drainage network over 15 years. According to Mr. Pitsiorlas, the project would create more than 40,000 jobs.Despite pressure from creditors to sell off state assets, a succession of governments have raised just over 2.5 billion euros from privatizations, including the leasing out of Greek regional airports and the Greek horse race betting organization, compared to an initial target of 50 billion euros.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping Jobs for India Follow, Modi Clears Investors\u2019 Path", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byWhile the economy is still hampered by the country\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies and sprawling bureaucracy, the changes represent a greater shift away from the socialist and protectionist policies of India\u2019s modern post-independence history. The new rules will allow foreign investors to establish 100 percent ownership in companies involved in defense, civil aviation and food products, although with government approval.India\u2019s latest reports on job creation may have tipped the scales in favor of further economic liberalization, some experts said. Domestic data showed weak employment numbers in the last quarter of 2015 in jewelry, automobiles and information technology, compared with a year earlier.India began life as an independent country in 1947 with a heavily controlled, protectionist economy. It changed course in 1991 when a balance-of-payments crisis forced the government to loosen its controls on industry and reduce barriers to imports, among other things.Those changes are credited with spurring India\u2019s transformation into the fastest-growing large economy in the world. But its growth rate of 7.6 percent is too slow to provide jobs for the one million people entering the work force each month. The previous government, and Mr. Modi\u2019s, had promised further liberalization.Mr. Modi has struggled to enact the major changes he promised, such as making it easier for companies to acquire land, because his party does not control the upper house of Parliament. Monday\u2019s policy shifts required only the approval of his top administration.Still, Mr. Modi is expected to win passage in July of a new law to allow the imposition of a uniform goods and services tax on the country, in place of the state-by-state taxation, making it easier for businesses to operate nationally. The tax change, together with new rules on foreign investment, could have as significant an impact on India\u2019s economy as the 1991 reforms.Particularly significant on Monday was the change allowing 100 percent foreign investment in defense companies in India, Mr. Bhalla and others said.\u201cWith this liberalization, we would expect again some manufacturing activity in defense products to come in,\u201d Shaktikanta Das, secretary of economic affairs at the Ministry of Finance, told reporters in New Delhi. \u201cThe driving force behind the whole thing is that all these investments should facilitate creation of jobs.\u201dPrevious rules, which all but required a local majority stake, had scared off foreign weapons makers who feared losing control of valuable technology, said Ben Moores, a defense analyst at IHS Jane\u2019s, a global intelligence firm.Mr. Moores said the change would expose the big Indian defense companies, like Tata Advanced Systems and Hindustan Aeronautics, to competitive pressures for the first time.The Indian government plans to award more than 800 defense contracts worth $76.5 billion over the next 10 years, he said, on combat aircraft, tanks, anti-submarine equipment and more.There are benefits for smaller Indian companies as well, Mr. Moores said. Not only will their larger rivals potentially face direct, heavyweight competition from abroad, smaller companies will have opportunities to partner with outside defense contractors to gain expertise and domestic market share.India also relaxed its requirements that single-brand retail outlets purchase 30 percent of their supplies locally.This requirement has posed an obstacle to foreign investors who have been unable to find local sources. Apple, eager to expand its retail operations in India, had sought an exemption from this local sourcing requirement earlier this year but the Indian government appeared reluctant to comply.Under the new rules, foreign retail outlets will be given a three-year reprieve on the local sourcing requirement that could be extended to an additional five years, if the products being sold are \u201cstate of the art\u201d and \u201ccutting edge\u201d technology, the government said in its announcement.An Apple spokeswoman said the company was evaluating the new rules and had no immediate comment. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, visited India this year and met with Mr. Modi to discuss retail and manufacturing in the country, the Indian government said.Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a technology consulting firm in New Delhi, said the new rules removed a large hurdle to foreign single-brand retailers like Apple that wanted to open stores in India.\u201cThis will permit Apple to open its own stores and control the complete experience of the brand and the product,\u201d Mr. Singhal said.The new pharmaceutical rules, allowing foreign firms to purchase portions of Indian drug companies, were also seen as a positive development.But some consumer advocates worried that easier foreign investment could also undermine India\u2019s role as the supplier of inexpensive generic drugs to poor countries throughout the world.\u201cThis is perhaps going to make it even easier for the bigger pharmaceutical companies to control India as a competitor in the global marketplace,\u201d said Tahir Amin, co-founder of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, a New York-based nonprofit organization that works on access to medicines by challenging certain patents on drugs. \u201cMy prediction is the Indian generic marketplace is going to look very different in five years.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on June 21 about the Indian government\u2019s announcement of new rules to ease foreign investment referred incorrectly to a development involving Raghuram G. Rajan, governor of India\u2019s central bank, that took place two days previously and affected the timing of the announcement. Mr. Rajan said he would not continue for a second term as governor; he did not resign.Reporting was contributed by Gerry Doyle and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong, Vindu Goel from San Francisco, and Andrew Pollack from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and India Mark a New Moment in Relations as Narendra Modi Speaks to Congress", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India condemned global terrorism and said during a lengthy address to Congress on Wednesday that growing economic ties benefit both his country and the United States.Mr. Modi made clear that he intended the speech to hail a new moment in relations between the United States and India when he told Congress at the outset that he had started his visit to Washington with a trip to Arlington National Cemetery. He called it \u201cthe final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land.\u201d\u201cI honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy,\u201d Mr. Modi added.Indian leaders have long been skeptical of American military power and have often been deeply critical of the Vietnam War and other military interventions by the United States. Celebrating American war dead, though, was a telling signal of what both sides say is a very different relationship between the two countries.Mr. Modi has encouraged a continued American military presence in Afghanistan because he is worried that Pakistan will have unchallenged influence there once the Americans leave.\u201cYour contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated,\u201d Mr. Modi said, adding: \u201cA commitment to rebuild a peaceful and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective.\u201dThe different references to Afghanistan are a measure of just how much relations between the world\u2019s largest democracies have changed in three decades.In another sign of a break with the past, Mr. Modi gave a strong endorsement for global institutions, most of them created with American leadership.\u201cGrowing uncertainties and political complexities \u2014 our engagement can make a difference by promoting cooperation, not dominance,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cConnectivity, not isolation. Inclusive, not exclusive mechanism. Respect for global commons and, above all, for international rules and norms.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s decision to accelerate already-warming ties with the United States has been greeted in Washington with excitement and surprise.On Tuesday, he held meetings at the White House with President Obama, where the two leaders formalized a wide range of agreements covering climate change, renewable energy, security and economic issues. Before Congress, Mr. Modi also repeated that India was open for business.Mr. Modi is eager for greater foreign investment, and although he has failed to deliver many fundamental reforms that would make business easier to conduct there, the smaller steps he has taken and his obvious enthusiasm have persuaded some major investors to give India a try.In his speech, Mr. Modi gave a nod to his difficulties in passing much of his economic reform agenda. Although Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority in the Lok Sabha, India\u2019s lower house of Parliament, it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.\u201cMr. Speaker, I\u2019m informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is harmonious,\u201d Mr. Modi said to laughter. \u201cI\u2019m also told that you\u2019re well known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.\u201d\u201cThe protection of the environment and caring of the planet is central to our vision of a just world,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cfor us in India to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient beliefs.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cOur partnership aims to balance responsibility and capacity and focuses on new ways to increase availability of renewable energy.\u201dMr. Modi has vowed to sharply increase the growth of solar power in India, but Indian diplomats have also pushed for commitments from the United States to make new solar power technologies available as cheaply as possible, either by waiving intellectual property fees or by providing favorable financing.\u201cThis has been the goal of our efforts in G20 and climate change summits,\u201d Mr. Modi said, to a mixed ovation \u2014 lawmakers on the Democratic side of the aisle stood and clapped, while those on the Republican side mostly stayed seated.Mr. Modi was forceful in his condemnation of global terrorism, a subject he dwelt on at length. \u201cNot just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,\u201d he said, adding in a clear reference to Pakistan: \u201cAlthough its shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India\u2019s neighborhood.\u201dIndia\u2019s long rivalry with Pakistan has meant that India has been a target of terror attacks funded and encouraged by Pakistan, most famously in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008.Some members of Congress have criticized Mr. Modi\u2019s human rights record, but the politics of a visit by an Indian leader have also changed. Before Mr. Modi spoke, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced more than a dozen members of Congress who were said to be escorting Mr. Modi into the chamber.There are 3.5 million Indian-Americans, and they are a highly successful immigrant group with both wealth and deep community connections, making them sought after by politicians. In just one example, some 40 percent of hotel rooms in the United States are owned or managed by Indian-Americans, according to Arun K. Singh, India\u2019s ambassador to the United States.An article on Thursday about an address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to a joint meeting of the United States Congress misstated the year of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

{"Headline": "Phoenix Focuses on Rebuilding Downtown, Wooing Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byAnd that is just a small taste of the disrespect often heaped on the nation\u2019s sixth-largest city.Phoenix is the way it is largely because of where it is, in a sprawling desert. It became a place of huge growth, where people from colder climes flocked for affordable single-family homes where air conditioning was de rigueur and not a single garage had to make room for a snow blower.But the Phoenix that has been disparaged by so many is undergoing a change. It began when the housing bubble burst, and affordable home after affordable home went into foreclosure. City officials, intent on revitalizing the place, searched for a new formula, one that focused not on the outer edges of the desert, where there remains plenty of room to expand outward, but on the long-neglected downtown.These days, there is hardly an empty lot left in the city\u2019s core, and there are as many apartments under construction, or about to be built, as all of those that were built from 1996 to 2008. But, are there enough people to fill them? That is a multibillion-dollar gamble, and Phoenix has gone all in.The city bought entire blocks of empty land to entice three state universities to build their campuses downtown, increasing the number of students to 12,000 this year from 400 just 10 years ago. It has given developers tax breaks and other incentives to build, build, build.It might be hard for many to think of Phoenix as a vibrant urban environment rather than a subdued, sun-baked retirement village. Still, every month or so, the city\u2019s ambassadors are pitching downtown Phoenix to young entrepreneurs frustrated by the high cost of doing business in Silicon Valley.Some tech start-ups have already been sold: Uber opened a support center for drivers and riders last year, in a building that had stood half empty for a long time. DoubleDutch, a maker of events apps, is opening its first office outside San Francisco nearby.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to move here because we have great golf courses and cheap homes,\u201d Mr. Stanton said in an interview. \u201cWhat I want is young college graduates from the East Coast moving here, and our college graduates staying here because they see their future here and we have a great urban community.\u201dPhoenix has staged other attempts at making over its downtown, but never quite got it right. It pegged a tourism tax to hotel stays and car rentals to pay for the construction of a basketball arena, which opened in 1992, and used the money raised from a sales tax increase throughout the county to build a baseball stadium, the first in the nation with a retractable dome and real grass. Both still bring people downtown, but are not necessarily reasons anyone would want to live there.A bike-sharing program survived its first summer, a time of the year when riding a bike, or doing any other outdoor activity for that matter, is borderline heroic.Skeptics worry that there is just too much building going on this time and that it is only a matter of time until it all comes crashing down again, as empty units stall in a real estate market that is well known for its boom-and-bust cycles.Long a wasteland at night, downtown now has a tinge of hip, with bars, restaurants and small concert venues keeping it going long after lights go off in the city, county and state offices that for long were its anchor. It also has plenty of dark, desolate spots that do not feel safe at night.The place is undergoing a sort of rearrangement that is common in the transformation of any neighborhood. The squat building that housed Paz, a popular taqueria, was razed to make way for a condominium in what is now one of the densest residential intersections in the city; the tacos are now being sold from a food truck. Songbird, a coffee shop that had a disagreement with its landlord, moved down the street into a charming century-old house, which qualifies as old in this young city.On a recent Sunday, mothers and their babies met around a picnic bench there while eight young women in leggings and tank tops practiced yoga nearby, their colorful mats stretched on a patch of grass. That was an unusual sight.Three blocks west, at a cafe called Phoenix Public Market, Naveed Shan, a physical therapy student in Northern Arizona University\u2019s campus downtown, was having a lunchtime beer with a large group of classmates to celebrate the end of the school year. Mr. Shan, 28, who grew up in Phoenix, said \u201cthere just wasn\u2019t enough good reason for anyone to ever come downtown.\u201dNow, he cannot afford to live downtown, he said, as prices have soared.Mr. Park and Mr. Marino hired a security guard to watch over cars on the parking lot at Tuft & Needle, on Grand Avenue. Across the street, a sign advertises divorce and bankruptcy filings for $200. Next door to it is a vacant house once used by squatters, though the squatters are gone.By year\u2019s end, they said, the warehouse will be filled by work stations, a quality-control lab and a half basketball court.\u201cWe\u2019d have to raise capital just to pay our rent in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Marino, at work in high-tops and shorts one afternoon. In Phoenix, he said, \u201cWe can have a home and a pool and 36,000 square feet of office space.\u201dAn article on Sunday about the redevelopment of downtown Phoenix misstated the reason that the Songbird coffee shop relocated. The owners had a disagreement with the landlord; the store was not displaced by redevelopment.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fix Feminism", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byTo me, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sheer professional survival is as inspiring as any of her other accomplishments. A woman with a small child can easily lose faith that she\u2019ll ever do anything else again. God knows I did. For the first five years of my child-rearing life, I was supposed to be writing a book, but mostly I dodged my editor\u2019s calls. The 3-year-old had separation anxiety, so I waited it out on one of the nursery school\u2019s kid-size chairs. I lacked the heart to say no to play dates, so I shut my computer and attended to juice boxes.Then there was Ladies\u2019 Night, when the mothers on my cul-de-sac got together to drink too much wine. Fun, sure, but really: \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d? The fact that I went every week proved that my professional viability was fast disappearing, or so I thought at the time.How did Mrs. Clinton hold on to hers? How did she rebound from the years in which she was raising a daughter, pursuing a law career and serving as first lady of Arkansas? She has a steely will, as everyone knows. But another answer is that it was in many ways easier to be a working mother in 1980, when Chelsea Clinton was born, than it is today.Between the \u201980s and the aughts, when I had my children, a cloud of economic anxiety descended on parents, tightening what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild has called \u201cthe time bind.\u201d The workweek of salaried professionals ballooned from 40 hours to 50 hours or more, not counting the email catch-up done after the kids\u2019 bedtime. Union protections, predictable schedules and benefits vanished for vast numbers of blue-collar workers. Their jobs in the service or on-demand economies now pay so little, and child care costs so much (168 percent more than it did a quarter-century ago) that parents have to stitch together multiple jobs. Meanwhile, terrified that their offspring will sink even lower, parents siphon off time and money to hand-raise children who can compete in a global economy.Women like me who scale back in the face of impossible expectations feel themselves morphing into caricatures: attachment freaks, helicopter moms, concerted cultivators, neo-traditionalists. These stereotypes are just plain sexist, but I don\u2019t know many mothers whose careers, paychecks and sense of self-worth haven\u2019t been eroded by all the compromises they\u2019ve had to make. Our worlds have narrowed; our bank accounts have dipped below the minimum balance; and our power within the family and the world has dwindled. We\u2019d be quick to tell you that we wouldn\u2019t have done it any differently. Still.What if the world was set up in such a way that we could really believe \u2014 not just pretend to \u2014 that having spent a period of time concentrating on raising children at the expense of future earnings would bring us respect? And what if that could be as true for men as it is for women?We live in an age rich in feminisms. One celebrates our multiplicity of identities: black, lesbian, transgender. Another has effectively anathematized sexual violence. Yet another \u2014 I think of it as C-suite feminism \u2014 chips away at the glass ceiling that keeps women out of the most powerful jobs, such as, say, the presidency.But we need another feminism \u2014 and it needs a name that has nothing to do with gender. Let\u2019s call it, for lack of a better term, \u201ccaregiverism.\u201d It would demand dignity and economic justice for parents dissatisfied with a few weeks of unpaid parental leave, and strive to mitigate the sacrifices made by adult children responsible for aging parents.Mrs. Clinton could be a champion of caregiverism. She has been blunter this electoral season about family-friendly policies than she has ever been before. She emphasized paid family leave when she began her campaign and again in the opening statements of the first Democratic presidential debate. In May, she said she\u2019d cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of a household\u2019s income, down from what, for a household supported by minimum-wage workers, can now be more than 30 percent.But she needs to go further. Her focus is on wage-earners; what about the people who want to get out of the workplace, at least for a while? Mrs. Clinton should talk to Representative Nita Lowey of New York, who last year introduced a bill that would give Social Security credits to caregivers who left the labor market or cut back on hours \u2014 a public nod to the reality that care is work and caregivers merit the same benefits as other workers.Mrs. Clinton belongs to an earlier generation, one whose objective was to free women from the prison of domesticity \u2014 at least the middle-class women who didn\u2019t already have jobs \u2014 and send them marching into the work force to demand equality there. But true equality will take more than equal pay and better working conditions. It will require something more radical, a \u201ctransvaluation of all values,\u201d in Nietzsche\u2019s phrase.There is also a venerable tradition in feminist history of trying to overturn a status quo that esteems professionals and wage-earners while demeaning those who do the unpaid or low-paid work of emotional sustenance and physical upkeep. In the 1960s, the largely African-American National Welfare Rights Organization demanded welfare payments that would maintain a decent standard of living, partly on the grounds that these mothers were working already, raising future workers, and partly because they couldn\u2019t find jobs that would support them. \u201cI am 45 years old; I have raised six children,\u201d wrote the group\u2019s chairwoman, Johnnie Tillmon, in 1972. \u201cA job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an adequate income. There are some 10 million jobs that now pay less than the minimum wage, and if you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ve got the best chance of getting one.\u201dAround the same time, the Marxist feminists Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James began a campaign called Wages for Housework that called for the overthrow of a capitalist order subsidized, in their view, by the unpaid slog of homemaking and, yes, sexual services. This did not mean that women should necessarily go out and find jobs. \u201cNot one of us believes that emancipation, liberation, can be achieved through work,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSlavery to an assembly line is not liberation from slavery to a kitchen sink.\u201dLiberal feminists accused them of wanting to push women back into domestic drudgery, but they denied it. \u201cWe have worked enough,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe have chopped billions of tons of cotton, washed billions of dishes, scrubbed billions of floors, typed billions of words, wired billions of radio sets, washed billions of nappies, by hand and in machines.\u201d So what did they want? I asked Silvia Federici, a founder of the New York chapter of Wages for Housework who writes prolifically on these questions. Actual wages for housework aside, she said, the movement wanted to make people ask themselves, \u201cWhy is producing cars more valuable than producing children?\u201dThe program put in place by Bill Clinton in 1996, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, cuts off benefits after five years or less; forces women to hold or look for jobs, whether or not there are any to be had; and allows states to shunt welfare funds into other programs. And so, from 1996 to 2011, the number of families living in extreme poverty \u2014 on $2 per person a day or less \u2014 more than doubled. A majority of those households were headed by single mothers.IN an important new book, \u201cFinding Time,\u201d the economist Heather Boushey argues that the failure of government and businesses to replace the services provided by \u201cAmerica\u2019s silent partner\u201d \u2014 the stay-at-home wife \u2014 is dampening productivity and checking long-term economic growth. A company that withholds family leave may drive away a hard-to-replace executive. Overstressed parents lack the time and patience to help children develop the skills they need to succeed. \u201cToday\u2019s children are tomorrow\u2019s work force,\u201d Ms. Boushey writes. \u201cWhat happens inside families is just as important to making the economy hum along as what happens inside firms.\u201dI had my children at 39 and 40. (Mrs. Clinton was 32.) My 12-year-old daughter is already calculating how soon she\u2019ll have to have children if I\u2019m going to be strong enough to lift them. Younger than I was, I tell her. But she\u2019s bright and ambitious. I could see her going to graduate school.I recently got into an argument with a professor friend about the plausibility of restructuring higher education and the professions so that women \u2014 and men \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have to hustle for positions like partner or associate professor just as they reach peak fertility. Many universities, I said, now stop the tenure clock for a year when assistant professors have children. My friend laughed. A year is nothing when it comes to a baby, she said. She\u2019d never have won tenure if she\u2019d had her son first.I didn\u2019t know what to say. At least she had a child, unlike friends who waited until too late.Here\u2019s a fantasy my daughter and I entertain: What if child-rearing weren\u2019t an interruption to a career but a respected precursor to it, like universal service or the draft? Both sexes would be expected to chip in, and the state would support young parents the way it now supports veterans. This is more or less what Scandinavian countries already do. A mother might take five years off, then focus on her career, at which point the father could put his on pause. Or vice versa.Vice versa was the deal struck by characters on the Danish TV series \u201cBorgen,\u201d a member of Parliament and her husband. He\u2019d schlep and clean for five years; then she\u2019d do the same. (As it turned out, she became prime minister and their marriage went to hell. But that\u2019s a problem few of us would ever have to face.)What really makes the \u201cBorgen\u201d model a mismatch for the United States is that American families, particularly low-income families, can\u2019t do without a double income, given wage stagnation and the cost of children in a country that won\u2019t help parents raise them. But having to work should not be confused with wanting to work, at least not without some stops along the way. \u201cIt takes 20 years, not 12 weeks, to raise a child,\u201d as the feminist legal scholar Joan Williams has written.It\u2019s a little late for me, if not, thank goodness, for my daughter. I fled my cul-de-sac before I should have, in part because I convinced myself that it was becoming a lovely, leafy, azalea-pink prison. City life is great, thank you, but I have regrets. I should have gone on longer rambles with the babies; blown more deadlines; been quicker to heed my son\u2019s demand to \u201csee train\u201d at the nearby station. The articles could have waited; the sight of a little boy clapping as a train squealed to a stop could not. As for Ladies\u2019 Night, it took me a long time to assemble a coterie of mothers as genial and supportive. If I\u2019m ashamed of anything now, it\u2019s how little I appreciated them then.Advertisement"}

Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of Wall Street\u2019s most important overseers, has twice held closed-door sessions at the bank, located in downtown Manhattan, to urge top banking executives to overhaul the behavior inside their companies. His goal has been to get bankers to think about what they should do instead of what they can do and get away with.Some banks just don\u2019t get the message. Take Credit Suisse, the large Swiss bank that over the years has swallowed up two of Wall Street\u2019s premiere investment banks, First Boston and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, to form the core of its investment-banking practice. It has been a rough 2016 for the bank and its new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, who is facing a revolt from some of his employees after he suggested that Credit Suisse would start de-emphasizing investment banking after an unexpected $1 billion or so of trading losses in the last two quarters.In March, in an effort to right the ship on the credit side of the investment bank, Credit Suisse named Brian Chin, the chief of structured finance, and David Miller, the chief of credit products, to be co-chiefs of Credit Suisse\u2019s global markets credit division. This is yet another big job for Mr. Miller, with lots of responsibility and high pay, but his appointment sends exactly the wrong message about the values and behavior that a Wall Street bank should be rewarding.Mr. Miller, you may recall, was the bank\u2019s architect, starting in 2004, of a new syndicated loan product \u2013 called a dividend recapitalization loan \u2013 that allowed big-time real estate developers in the Western half of the United States to borrow based on the inflated valuation of their projects, pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of dividends and lay the risk at the doorstep of new investors whom Mr. Miller and his team had lined up.From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Miller and Credit Suisse arranged for $5 billion of these kinds of loans, which were then sold to investors. The deals produced hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the bank, a high percentage of which, of course, went into the pockets of Mr. Miller and his team. From 2004 to 2008, Mr. Miller received compensation of $23.1 million, including $7.2 million in 2006.In the end, all of the loans blew up, and investors lost billions. Soured deals include $375 million in loans to the Yellowstone Club, an hour outside of Bozeman, Mont.; $250 million to the Tamarack Resort in Idaho; $540 million to Lake Las Vegas, a 3,592-acre golf community in Nevada; $275 million to Promontory, a 10-square-mile second-home resort outside Park City, Utah; $400 million to the Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii; and $675 million to the Ginn resorts in Port St. Lucie, Fla.; Naples, Fla.; Boone, N.C.; and the Bahamas.After each of the developments ended up in Bankruptcy Court, a federal bankruptcy judge admonished the Credit Suisse bankers by calling the loans \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d from the outset.An affiliate of Highland Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Dallas, argued in a lawsuit that \u201cCredit Suisse was motivated by naked greed in perpetrating its fraudulent scheme.\u201d (In September, Highland Capital won a $287.5 million judgment against Credit Suisse related to losses stemming from its participation in a refinancing of Lake Las Vegas before it went into bankruptcy; Credit Suisse is appealing the ruling, and the judgment has not yet been paid pending the appeal. Highland Capital affiliates are also suing Credit Suisse in New York State over additional losses related to other deals.)Emails released as part of the litigation give a glimpse of the type of culture that Mr. Miller fostered in his group and its seeming lack of accountability.In a Sept. 22, 2004, in an internal email to other Credit Suisse executives, Mr. Miller promoted the soon-to-close Lake Las Vegas deal \u2014 the bank\u2019s first \u201cdividend recapitalization loan.\u201d He bragged about how the development\u2019s half-owners, the wealthy Bass brothers of Texas, were going to get what turned out to be a $469 million dividend.Fellow Credit Suisse bankers marveled at the deal\u2019s ingenuity for creating new business seemingly out of nowhere. \u201cYou must have the biggest and deepest dredge known to mankind,\u201d Grant Pothast, then head of the bank\u2019s distressed loan group, wrote to Mr. Miller. Responded Mr. Miller, \u201cI go wherever I can find a fee,\u201d while noting that the bank would be making $9 million on the deal. He added that he took comfort in knowing that his colleagues were willing \u201cto work in the deep dredges of life with me.\u201dAfter the deal closed in November 2004, it was hailed internally as \u201ca tremendous success.\u201d According to emails disclosed as part of the lawsuits, Mr. Miller was singled out for bringing \u201ccreativity on structure,\u201d \u201cthoughtful advice on positioning,\u201d \u201ccalm, assuring feedback to the client\u201d and for \u201cpushing the real estate bankers to roll this out to other homebuilders.\u201dAs the machine got cranking in August 2005, and after one of Mr. Miller\u2019s colleagues questioned an aspect of the creative structure, Mr. Miller replied, \u201cThese are aggressive deals and it is in all of our best interests that the investors are protected, because if one of them blows up, you will see these investors pull out of this land development mkt [market] and our gravy train will stop.\u201dAfter the Lake Las Vegas deal was refinanced in June 2007, based on what turned out to be overinflated appraisals of the value of the property, a news article about the deal was circulated internally at Credit Suisse.\u201cThis reads like we operate some sort of gene splicing lab \u2013 or a bell and whistle factory,\u201d Tom Newberry, the chief of the bank\u2019s syndicated loan group, wrote to Mr. Miller and others, according to an email contained in the court filings. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cWe are going to start recruiting Physics PHD\u2019s from MIT,\u201d Mr. Miller replied.\u201cWe don\u2019t need them,\u201d wrote Mr. Newberry. \u201cDr. Frankenstein is apparently already an employee.\u201dCredit Suisse stands by its man. The bank \u201chas a zero-tolerance policy which we take very seriously,\u201d Nicole Sharp, a company spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cOur conduct and integrity is of utmost importance to how we operate. These are old matters which continue to be litigated and we do not wish to comment.\u201dThe unanswered question, though, is whether Mr. Miller\u2019s employment at Credit Suisse sends the right message to the troops.Advertisement"}

The group has been working on its second album for over a decade. That album, \u201cWildflower,\u201d is to arrive on July 8, and the band released its first single and video from it, a song called \u201cFrankie Sinatra.\u201d It rests on a repeated sample of \u201cBobby Sox Idol,\u201d by the calypso singer Wilmoth Houdini, and then turns to the melody of \u201cMy Favorite Things.\u201d The video is not lovely: an ice cream truck sells a radioactive-looking yellow drink at an everglades fair, creating a violent, tripped-out, Diane Arbus vision of country folk gone wild. And the song is not amazing: except for the rap verses by Danny Brown and MF DOOM (not as good as Houdini\u2019s lyrics), it sounds like lesser work from the early aughts. BEN RATLIFFTo remake Rihanna\u2019s tale of sexual power imbalance, \u201cNeeded Me,\u201d the Canadian producer ATTLAS opens with soft piano figures cut with abrasive industrial noises. Is it a caress? An act of menace? With Rihanna, it\u2019s always both, and ATTLAS understands that deeply on this remix, which evolves into brisk, electric nature-film house music. This remix is included in a pair of new remix EPs for the songs \u201cNeeded Me\u201d and \u201cKiss It Better\u201d that include elegant contributions by R3hab, Four Tet, Feenixpawl and Kaytranada. These are remixes that solve a problem \u2014 \u201cKiss It Better\u201d and \u201cNeeded Me\u201d are slightly outside of conventional radio formats, and some of these remixes get them closer. But as much as a remix is an act of commerce, it can be an act of love, and the best of these songs break down and reconstitute her songs in order to build Rihanna a glorious pedestal. J.C.\u201cMaybe you know that it\u2019s been too long/Going through the motions as you sing your song.\u201d So begins \u201cIntern,\u201d the intriguing new track by Angel Olsen, which unfolds as a synth-pop dirge, shimmering and glacial. It\u2019s a pointed departure from the strummed-guitar sound of \u201cBurn Your Fire for No Witness,\u201d the breakthrough album Ms. Olsen released in 2014. As if to embody the shift, she appears in the video with a silver wig and various other props: a blocky headset, a telephone receiver, someone listed in the credits as a \u201cclever young interviewer.\u201d Throughout the clip, which cuts short before the end of the song, Ms. Olsen fixes the viewer with a dispassionate stare. But her singing, which still carries an echo of Roy Orbison, is ripe with feeling. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fall in love with you someday,\u201d she pledges. Who\u2019s to say this is drudgery? NATE CHINENXavier Dphrepaulezz, the singer who leads Fantastic Negrito, reaches back to both the raw Chicago blues of Howlin\u2019 Wolf and its rock extrapolations by way of Led Zeppelin and Captain Beefheart. But on his album \u201cThe Last Days of Oakland,\u201d which includes \u201cHump Thru the Winter,\u201d he\u2019s got current concerns in mind: poverty, gentrification, income inequality and perseverance. \u201cI\u2019ve been working three jobs just to pay my bills,\u201d he yowls over stop-start guitar chords in a tricky, irregular meter. All he can do is urge himself and listeners forward: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta keep on pushin\u2019, gotta keep it moving,\u201d he exhorts, and the sweat is audible. J.P.On her deliriously kinetic third album, \u201cTempo,\u201d the composer, singer and electronic producer Olga Bell puts a high-minded spin on dance music, coming up with something poplike but wonderfully strange. The video for \u201cATA,\u201d a collaboration between Ms. Bell and the Japanese digital artist Baku Hashimoto, nails the elusive feeling of this music with 3-D effects: an image will suddenly pull apart, refract or splinter, in trippy and disorienting ways. Meanwhile, the lyrics pay homage to a poem by Frank O\u2019Hara, \u201cA True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island.\u201d Ms. Bell sings both sides of the conversation, including the sun\u2019s evenhanded assessment of her work (in a close approximation of O\u2019Hara\u2019s language): \u201cYou\u2019re maybe not the greatest, but you\u2019re good/You\u2019re different.\u201d N.C.Someone\u2019s about to be let down not so easily in Margaret Glaspy\u2019s \u201cYou and I,\u201d the advance single from her June 17 album \u201cEmotions and Math.\u201d Her voice is raspily matter-of-fact and her guitar delivers a blunt, distorted riff \u2014 grunge with a twang \u2014 as bass and drums thump along. Apparently her current bedmate has started to mistake sex for love, and she\u2019s not interested. \u201cYou and I have been a mistake/I let it linger too long,\u201d she concludes, leaving the guitar riff to kick the door shut. J.P.Pomp doesn\u2019t last long in \u201cHow It Felt,\u201d the latest free-associative track from the Canadian electronica producer Ryan Hemsworth. It wanders from plinking bell tones and samples of hummed notes to hints of Japanese koto into drums and synthesizers that sound like the start of a big trance buildup. But that\u2019s abruptly deflated, back to plinks and high-hat taps. Later, a pretty piano chord progression, a potential crowd pleaser, appears and gets quickly discarded too, as does another big beat, all in favor of more plinks and hums. There\u2019s comedy in some of the ups and downs, as well as introspection; at the end, there\u2019s snoring, which may explain the track\u2019s dream logic. J.P.The vocal line of \u201cLonely Lover,\u201d the first single from Xenia Rubinos\u2019s new album \u201cBlack Terry Cat\u201d is a long, teasing, jazzy, chromatic zigzag, pausing only to wiggle a little and then veer off at one more different angle. She\u2019s got plenty of room to swivel over little more than a bass line, a backbeat and cool electric piano chords that link her to Erykah Badu, Chaka Khan and Stevie Wonder. But in the song and across the album, Ms. Rubinos builds her own persona, freely admitting private imperfections in some songs while calling for \u201cbrown\u201d pride and solidarity in others (like \u201cMexican Chef\u201d and \u201cBlack Stars\u201d). \u201cLonely Lover\u201d is a playful little plaint: \u201cGive a little space \u2018cause I\u2019m going insane/And I just need to breathe today,\u201d she sings, with a poise and agility that suggest she\u2019ll get by. J.P.Ryley Walker, a guitarist and singer-songwriter from Chicago, has a knack for wriggling free of expectations. He has use for the sound of pastoral British folk-rock from the 1960s, but you can\u2019t really keep him there: He\u2019s also drawn to psychedelia, experimental jazz and endless variations on a drone. Last year he released an excellent album called \u201cPrimrose Green,\u201d on Dead Oceans; his next one is \u201cGolden Sings That Have Been Sung,\u201d slated for release on Aug. 19. \u201cThe Halfwit in Me,\u201d its lead single and opening track, suggests a declaration of intent. It opens with a lonesome prelude for clarinet and acoustic guitar, before tumbling fully into gear, with Mr. Walker\u2019s vocals and fingerpicking up front. Over a flowing, sun-dappled arrangement \u2014 produced by the former Wilco associate LeRoy Bach, and reminiscent of recent work by Jim O\u2019Rourke \u2014 Mr. Walker sings about homecomings and misgivings, along with the feeling of being one step out of sync with the crowd.

But to cite \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncertainty\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the reason for holding rates steady is putting it very politely. The most plausible reason to hold rates steady is that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike and there is no sign that conditions will meaningfully improve any time soon.Before that five-month slide, the index had been in positive territory nearly every month since the recovery began in mid-2009. The only exceptions were shallow contractions in May and June of 2012 and in March of 2015.Historically, when the index has trended down as it has of late, the Fed has either reduced rates or held them steady. There is no doubt about that.The real uncertainty is what the Fed can do if the deterioration continues. With rates already so low, dropping them further would have little effect. Instead, it would be largely up to Congress to do what it should have been doing all along: spending and investing to offset insufficient demand from consumers and businesses.In the meantime, speculation about the next rate increase is off base. The logical question to ask now is how to boost the economy, not when to slow it down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Housing\u2019s New Players Spiraled Into Banks\u2019 Old Mistakes", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 2Some private equity firms that came in as the cleanup crew for the housing crisis are now repeating errors that banks committed, while others are bypassing the working poor.Supported byWhen the housing crisis sent the American economy to the brink of disaster in 2008, millions of people lost their homes. The banking system had failed homeowners and their families.New investors soon swept in \u2014 mainly private equity firms \u2014 promising to do better.But some of these new investors are repeating the mistakes that banks committed throughout the housing crisis, an investigation by The New York Times has found. They are quickly foreclosing on homeowners. They are losing families\u2019 mortgage paperwork, much as the banks did. And many of these practices were enabled by the federal government, which sold tens of thousands of discounted mortgages to private equity investors, while making few demands on how they treated struggling homeowners.Private equity firms, and the mortgage companies they own, face less oversight than the banks. And yet they are the cleanup crew for the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression.Out of the more than a dozen private equity firms operating in the housing industry, The Times examined three of the largest to assess their impact on homeowners and renters.Unlike the banks, Nationstar wears many hats at once: mortgage bill collector, auction house for foreclosed homes and lender to new borrowers. By working every angle, and collecting fees at each step, the company faces potential conflicts of interest that enable it to make money on what is otherwise a costly foreclosure process.When Nationstar becomes your mortgage bill collector, it can make money at every step, regardless of whether you remain in the home or are foreclosed on and kicked out. Making money on foreclosures creates potential conflicts of interest.In the rental market, The Times found, other big private equity firms largely bypassed the nation\u2019s poorest neighborhoods as they scooped up and renovated foreclosed homes across the country. Those firms include Blackstone, a huge private equity firm and the nation\u2019s largest private landlord of rental houses.These decisions point to shortcomings of the government\u2019s response to the housing crisis. Rather than enact sweeping changes to housing policy, the government largely handed the problems to a new set of companies.Normie Brown and her husband, Derrick, have lost two fights \u2014 first with their bank and then with private equity. Initially, the Texas couple say, they faced a wrongful foreclosure by Bank of America. The bank paid them $50,000 as part of a broader government settlement over suspected mortgage abuses, and the Browns used that money to fight for their house in court.But the couple couldn\u2019t stop their new bill collector, Nationstar, from auctioning off their home.\u201cYou think all you have to do is show them where they did you wrong, and basically justice will prevail,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case.\u201dThe court hadn\u2019t yet decided the case, but it didn\u2019t matter: They lost their house. The couple has since separated and Mr. Brown, a decorated Gulf War veteran, said he had moved in and out of homelessness.Nationstar declined to comment on the Browns\u2019 case, but said it had outperformed banks on avoiding foreclosure. Nationstar\u2019s chief executive, Jay Bray, said in an interview that \u201cforeclosure is always, always the last resort.\u201dPrivate equity plowed into the housing market after big banks and regional lenders, facing a crackdown from federal regulators for wrongful foreclosure practices, pulled back in the aftermath of the crisis. The shift led private equity firms to spend tens of billions of dollars acquiring homes and troubled mortgages from banks and the government.For private equity firms, which specialize in buying companies at a bargain, the housing market was just their latest investment in a distressed asset. These firms, unlike banks, raise money for their deals from pension funds and other huge institutional investors.The wave of private equity investment in housing has had a positive impact on the American economy.The firms displaced poorly performing banks. They also helped stabilize the nation\u2019s housing market, and it achieved that through smart business decisions about where to put its money. That, in turn, rewarded investors \u2014 which is how private enterprise is supposed to work.The idea is that banks should follow an implicit social contract: In return for government loans and other support, they are expected to serve a community\u2019s needs. Private equity, which unlike the banks does not borrow money from the government, is answerable to its investors. Those investors include some of the nation\u2019s largest pension plans, whose members \u2014 teachers and police officers among them \u2014 may support improvements to such lower-income areas.As a result, The Times found, private equity has focused on buying newer homes in middle-income areas like the suburbs of Tampa, Fla. They have largely avoided more urban communities with older homes, because doing so would be less lucrative for their investors.\u201cThere has been a missed opportunity here,\u201d said Dan Immergluck, a professor of city and regional planning at the Georgia Tech College of Design, who has studied the effect of the financial crisis on housing. \u201cThey are pushing the market up at the top end and neglecting the bottom end.\u201dGovernment officials are also concerned that private equity\u2019s mortgage firms face less scrutiny than banks. While banks are examined by regulators for financial soundness, no similar testing occurs for private equity\u2019s companies.Ginnie Mae, which issues securities backed by mortgages with government guarantees, wants Congress to grant it greater oversight over nonbank mortgage firms and provide money to perform \u201cstress tests.\u201d The fear is that one firm\u2019s failure would create hardship for millions of customers.\u201cIt\u2019s an Achilles\u2019 heel for us to some degree,\u201d said Ted Tozer, Ginnie Mae\u2019s president.Translation: If foreclosing on a homeowner is the most profitable option, Lone Star is likely to foreclose.Federal officials hoped things would be different.In 2012, America was still in the grips of the worst housing crisis in decades. Foreclosure signs lined the American landscape, casting a shadow on more than 3.5 million homes. In some communities, abandoned houses outnumbered occupied ones. And soured mortgages made by banks were weighing on the government because it had insured them against default.The government, eager to stem its own losses, decided to ramp up the sale of distressed mortgages to investors. In all, it has sold more than 100,000 soured mortgages to investors \u2014 one of the largest such series of sales. The mortgage sales enticed private equity firms like Lone Star into the mortgage market, where they saw bargains.Housing officials reckoned that private equity firms would bring about change. For one thing, these firms were among the only investors with pockets deep enough to take on billions of dollars worth of ailing mortgages. And they could be more flexible than the banks in keeping Americans in their homes because they had bought the mortgages at steep discounts.But instead of showing greater flexibility, Lone Star \u2014 much like the banks before it \u2014 has often remained rigid about modifying mortgages. And in some cases it has moved quickly to foreclose, taking possession of homes to sell them, according to dozens of court proceedings, as well as interviews with borrowers and housing advocates.In a statement, Caliber Home Loans, Lone Star\u2019s mortgage servicing subsidiary, said that \u201cmodifying a nonperforming loan for a borrower is almost always the most profitable option for a lender, and Caliber is incentivized to pursue that outcome.\u201dYet Lone Star and Caliber have foreclosed on more than 14 percent of the 17,000 loans the firm picked up at auction from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2014, according to an analysis of loan filings that RealtyTrac performed for The Times. Caliber is now moving toward foreclosing on at least another 3,200.Some critics say the government is partly to blame by not expressly requiring private buyers to modify most loans. Its priority, these critics argue, was to sell off the mortgages to protect taxpayers against losses, rather than protecting homeowners.\u201cI understand HUD wants to make its money back,\u201d said Representative Michael E. Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat. But, he said, \u201chedge funds and private equity firms have one interest only, and that is the bottom line.\u201dIn its defense, Caliber said that 71 percent of the 17,000 mortgages it bought in the HUD auction had already begun the lengthy foreclosure process and that more than half of the homes were vacant at the time of foreclosure. Caliber said its goal was to \u201cavoid foreclosure whenever possible,\u201d noting that it had done so for roughly 4,200 homeowners in the pool of mortgages it bought from HUD.Modifications don\u2019t always save borrowers money.After filing for personal bankruptcy, Michael Rego, 51, of Yonkers, held out hope for a loan modification when JPMorgan Chase sold his delinquent mortgage to Lone Star. Last October, he received a letter from Lone Star\u2019s Caliber that began: \u201cCongratulations! You are approved for a trial period plan.\u201dBut his hopes were dashed when it turned out that the proposed modification would actually increase his monthly payment by $500. Two months later, to add insult to injury, Mr. Rego lost his job as a marketing consultant at Citigroup.\u201cI would hate to just walk away from the house,\u201d said Mr. Rego, who has lived in the three-bedroom home for nearly 20 years. \u201cBut if I have to, I have to.\u201dCaliber and Lone Star have largely opted not to participate in government programs that encourage mortgage modifications. To date, Caliber has received just $3.3 million in payments from the Treasury Department for modifying loans in compliance with the federal Home Affordable Modification Program.In contrast with Caliber, most banks have participated more fully in the government modification program, as has Nationstar, which has received $158 million in payments.Lone Star, led by the billionaire investor John Grayken, has expanded Caliber \u2014 which employs more than 1,000 people \u2014 into one of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing lenders. As a business, Lone Star has been a success. It has generated an average annual net return of 20 percent for investors for more than two decades.It also just completed one of the largest securitizations of nonprime mortgages since the financial crisis. In early June, the firm announced a $161.7 million bond deal backed by mortgages underwritten by Caliber, including many loans to people who had either filed for bankruptcy or been previously foreclosed on.And the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, opened an investigation last fall into Caliber over its handling of delinquent mortgages. Mr. Schneiderman recently expanded the investigation to include an examination of Lone Star\u2019s securitization of mortgages, including delinquent loans.The New York State Department of Financial Services is also reviewing some of Caliber\u2019s practices.\u201cThese companies are pitching their models as being well aligned with home buyers, but it\u2019s hard to know if that\u2019s true,\u201d said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy for the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Inside Nationstar\u2019s headquarters on the outskirts of Dallas, government regulators made an alarming discovery \u2014 and then another one, and another.The regulators, who gathered at Nationstar in 2014 for what should have been a routine examination, found \u201cinaccurate information\u201d in customer loan files, according to confidential documents reviewed by The Times. Nationstar, which became a huge mortgage bill collector in recent years, often failed to detect these errors \u201cuntil the foreclosure process is underway.\u201d Some of the breakdowns, the documents said, \u201cplaced consumers at significant risk of servicing and foreclosure abuses.\u201dRegulators laid the blame on Nationstar, citing deficient technology and a failure to employ enough trained workers as it rapidly expanded to become the nation\u2019s fourth-largest mortgage bill collector. In 2010, it ranked 18th.The examination, conducted by more than 15 states and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, showed the flaws of private equity\u2019s new role in the mortgage market. Nationstar, controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, was repeating some of the banking industry\u2019s mistakes.As new regulations prompted banks to scale back their servicing of mortgages, companies owned by private equity went on a buying spree. Private equity sensed an opportunity as the mortgage servicing business became a liability for the banks, leading Bank of America alone to reach settlements worth billions of dollars over federal accusations of using illegal foreclosure documents and unfair rejections of loan modifications. Since 2012, Nationstar has bought the rights to collect payments on more than $450 billion in mortgages, much of it from Bank of America.The previously unreported documents detailing Nationstar\u2019s 2014 examination tell the story of its expansion and the problems that followed. \u201cNationstar Mortgage pursued a strategy of explosive and virtually unchecked growth, but did not put in place appropriate operational controls,\u201d one regulatory memo said.The Times focused on three of the biggest private equity firms operating in the housing industry to better understand their impact on homeowners and renters.Authorities are investigating Nationstar based on the 2014 examination, and it could face an enforcement action this year.Jay Bray, Nationstar\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that \u201ccandidly, we did a poor job\u201d handling the 2014 exam. But since the exam, he said, \u201cWe are proud of the work we\u2019ve done to improve the customer experience.\u201d The company has invested in technology and added staff, he said.\u201cDid we make mistakes? Yes. Was it a systemic problem? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, attributing the problems to growing pains.\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to play Monday morning quarterback,\u201d he said.Wesley Edens, a founder of Fortress, Nationstar\u2019s private equity backer, maintains that the servicer has performed better than the banks it replaced. Since buying some of the banks\u2019 most troubled assets, Nationstar has overseen a 50 percent decline in delinquent loans, though those improvements coincided with a broader recovery in housing.\u201cThank God those loans were moved from Bank of America to Nationstar, because so many borrowers were better off,\u201d Mr. Edens said in an interview.(A Bank of America spokesman called the company \u201can industry leader in providing foreclosure avoidance solutions to more than 2.1 million customers since the beginning of the crisis.\u201d)Mr. Edens, noting that Fannie Mae ranked Nationstar higher than its peers at preventing delinquency, encouraged The Times to contact federal authorities to verify these improvements. The authorities declined to comment.Nationstar notes that, over the last four years, it has approved more than 172,000 loan modifications that saved homeowners an average of $380 a month. Whereas all servicers collectively rejected 69 percent of applications for the government\u2019s modification program, Nationstar has been more generous, rejecting 54 percent of borrowers.Nationstar also recently announced plans to rename its mortgage operation \u201cMr. Cooper,\u201d presenting a more consumer-friendly face.Even as Nationstar has shown improvements, on multiple occasions last year the company \u201cwrongfully terminated\u201d borrowers from the federal mortgage modification program, according to a published report. \u201cOver multiple quarters, Nationstar is wrongfully kicking people out of the program, and that\u2019s a real serious concern,\u201d said Christy Romero, the special inspector general for the 2008 bank bailout law and the author of the loan modification report.In Phoenix, Millard and Adria Gaines struggled to modify their loan as it changed hands four times in 20 years.During a recent interview at his home, Mr. Gaines walked to his kitchen freezer, pulled out a pack of cigarettes and described how he tried for years to get Bank of America, and then Nationstar, to modify their loan. In 2014, his wife exchanged emails with a Nationstar \u201cforeclosure prevention specialist\u201d who suggested she apply for a modification.After months of no change, Mrs. Gaines sent a letter detailing family misfortunes that imperiled their finances, including that her husband had been told he had acute kidney failure.About six months later, Nationstar finalized a mortgage modification for the Gaineses. But even then \u2014 reducing the interest rate to 3.2 percent from 5.3 percent \u2014 it was months too late to help the Gaineses avoid a second bankruptcy.Sheri Cellini\u2019s family of five loved their ranch-style home in Ashland, Ore., a small town in the foothills of the mountains. They lived there for six years until a foreclosure turned them into renters.\u201cThe kids want to drive by it all the time,\u201d Ms. Cellini said of the family\u2019s old house. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable thing.\u201dThe recent history of her former home reflects private equity\u2019s new dominance. By the time their home was foreclosed on in 2013, and after the family tried in vain to lower monthly payments, the Cellinis had bounced from one mortgage firm to another.The company that oversaw their foreclosure was Nationstar. Another family took over the Cellinis\u2019 house, winning it through an online auction platform called Homesearch. That family then obtained a mortgage through a company called Greenlight Loans.The companies all have different names and different roles, but all three are essentially the same company. Homesearch and Greenlight are owned by Nationstar.The whirl of transactions illustrates how Nationstar can control nearly every stage of the mortgage process, posing potential conflicts of interest as it earns fees along the way. Nationstar collects bills and, when people don\u2019t pay, can foreclose on homes. Nationstar earns fees auctioning those homes through Homesearch. Ads on Homesearch, which is now known online as Xome.com, direct bidders to Greenlight.Nationstar can then collect on the new mortgage, bringing the process full circle.Shane Hunter, who won the Cellinis\u2019 house through Homesearch, took out a mortgage with Greenlight, even though he had been leaning toward another lender. Nationstar earned a 5 percent \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d by selling the house through its auction website, an extra $10,450 that it rolled into the loan.As a mortgage bill collector, Nationstar\u2019s interests typically align with borrowers\u2019, because foreclosing can be far more expensive than modifying and continuing to service a loan. But because Nationstar earns fees from selling homes through its auction site, as well as making new mortgages from winning bidders, that added business may compete with the company\u2019s interest in keeping borrowers in their homes.Mr. Bray, the Nationstar chief executive, said the company would always rather keep people in their homes. \u201cWe don\u2019t make money from foreclosing on folks,\u201d he said, pointing to data showing that it costs the company 10 times as much to handle a loan in foreclosure. \u201cWe hate foreclosures.\u201dTo prevent potential conflicts, Nationstar said it keeps its servicing employees separate from the auction staff. They work in different buildings and use separate email systems, the company said.Auction sites are a driver of Nationstar\u2019s growth. From 2013 to 2015, revenue more than tripled in the unit that includes the auction platform and other services. This stands in contrast with banks, which generally do not own these types of sites.In interviews, several borrowers said that Nationstar required them to list their homes with Homesearch, even after they had found a buyer through their own real estate agent. While Nationstar argues that Homesearch helps to validate an outside offer price, homeowners and their agents complained that it could slow the sale process.\u201cAny requirement to use a particular auction site, especially one affiliated with the loan servicer, raises serious concerns,\u201d the Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, said in a statement.He is one of several state attorneys general investigating Nationstar\u2019s auction business, questioning whether it imposes unnecessary costs on consumers. The New York State Department of Financial Services is conducting its own investigation of the auction process and the potential conflicts it presents, according to a letter obtained through a public records request.The case of the Browns \u2014 the Texas couple who first fought their bank, then fought Nationstar \u2014 illustrates Nationstar\u2019s aggressiveness when selling a home through an auction site.The Browns won a temporary restraining order against Nationstar as they fought what they argued was a wrongful foreclosure. But Nationstar went ahead and listed the home for sale on Auction.com, an outside auction platform that has split fees with Nationstar.On Sept. 26, 2013 \u2014 more than a week before the restraining order would expire \u2014 Nationstar auctioned off the home through Auction.com. Next, Nationstar moved the case from state to federal court, and it closed the deal before the new judge could rule.\u201cThis was our first home,\u201d said Ms. Brown, who ultimately lost the case after the home was sold. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up on it.\u201dTo a visitor, Ruskin, Fla., a town just south of Tampa, looks like cookie-cutter suburbia.But to private equity, it is pay dirt. Blackstone, one of the largest private equity firms, owns 125 homes in Ruskin that it operates as rentals.The financial crisis hit Ruskin hard: Nearly 800 families lost their homes in foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac. But the town is bouncing back. Amazon has opened a giant warehouse and distribution facility in Ruskin that now employs 2,000 people.Across America, private equity firms stormed areas like Ruskin, calculating that the decline in home prices would be relatively short-lived. Ruskin\u2019s long-term economic prospects looked good. And it had many relatively newer homes, which are cheaper for a landlord to maintain.In making such a large investment in housing \u2014 $9 billion buying and renovating mainly foreclosed homes over the last four years \u2014 Blackstone effectively bet on which communities would emerge from the housing crisis as winners.It bet correctly. The firm, which now owns about 50,000 homes in 14 markets, recently reported that the fund holding its Invitation Homes rental subsidiary has generated a 23 percent annualized return for its investors.More broadly, private equity\u2019s investment in housing helped stabilize home prices across the country. The Obama administration supported private investment in foreclosed homes, with Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, remarking in 2011 that it would \u201csupport neighborhood and home price stability.\u201dStill, there has been a cost. Blackstone largely steered clear of more urban communities with older homes, which are more expensive to maintain.LuTanya Garrett, who pays $1,395 a month for a four-bedroom house that Blackstone owns in Ruskin, said she was looking for another home because of the rent. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m going to pay rent like this, I might as well own my own home,\u201d said Ms. Garrett, 47, a mother of three.Nationally, the average rent on an Invitation Homes home is $1,605 a month. The median rent in Ruskin is $1,452, according to Trulia, a listing service.Blackstone says 72 percent of its homes have monthly rents that are within federal affordability guidelines for the markets it operates in.Institutional investors, which collectively have bought more than 200,000 homes across the United States, point out that the rental homes they operate are a small fraction of the more than 15 million rental homes nationwide. Most are owned by small investors.About 3 percent of Blackstone\u2019s rental homes are leased to lower-income tenants with federal housing subsidies known as Section 8 vouchers. The numbers are lower for most other big private equity firms.Blackstone has said it welcomes Section 8 voucher holders, if the federal subsidy is enough to cover the rent. \u201cWe are proud to provide quality housing choices for working families,\u201d said Claire Parker, a spokeswoman for Invitation Homes.Blackstone needs to compete for middle-market renters to serve pension fund investors that have come to expect strong returns. And that leads private equity to focus on suburban communities with relatively few Section 8 voucher holders.Housing advocates argue that large private equity firms investing in rental housing should do more for the communities where they operate. \u201cThe urban areas took a big hit, and they have stayed down,\u201d said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress, a nonprofit that advises communities on dealing with vacant and blighted homes. \u201cThese firms are going into markets which would have recovered anyway.\u201d7 PhotosThere are exceptions, though. Patriarch Properties of Newport Beach, Calif., is one small private equity firm that has set up shop mainly on the South Side of Columbus, Ohio, where abandoned buildings dot the streets, some inhabited by squatters and drug users.For the most part, Columbus has rebounded from the financial crisis. Unemployment is low, and the city is home to companies like Nationwide Insurance and Huntington Bancshares.Patriarch has bought about 260 deteriorated homes on the city\u2019s South Side, an area yet to recover, and is using a combination of investor capital and low-interest loans from a nonprofit to rehabilitate the properties. The firm intends to rent the finished homes to residents, many with Section 8 vouchers, for $500 to $900 a month.\u201dWe are trying to bring up an entire area,\u201d said Ethan Temianka, 32, the founder of Patriarch.But there are questions over whether Patriarch can generate the hefty returns it promised investors.\u201cTheir very presence is a validation that there is a renaissance in the South Side,\u201d said the Rev. John Edgar, who heads Community Development for All People, a nonprofit group already rehabbing homes in Columbus. \u201cBut I am not certain that in the long run the business model is viable.\u201dLes Neuhaus contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "\u2018Destined to Disappear\u2019: The Last Generation of China\u2019s \u2018Bang-Bang Army\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byChongqing JournalMr. Niu, 62, may belong to the last generation of itinerant porters, known as \u201cbang-bang,\u201d who have become a symbol of Chongqing, a city that clings to the towering hills where the Jialing River flows into the mighty Yangtze in southwest China.The streets here once teemed with a \u201cbang-bang army,\u201d as residents call the porters. Now they are disappearing.\u201cThe next generation will never carry one of these,\u201d Mr. Niu said, tapping his sturdy bamboo shoulder pole or bangzi, whose name inspired the popular nickname for the porters. \u201cOur work is vanishing.\u201dThe decline of the porters is, in miniature, the story of social and population shifts reshaping China\u2019s economy. The economy is slowing, but the flow of rural migrants seeking work in cities is also slowing, and those migrants are aging. Younger, better educated migrants often reject such poorly paid, harsh work, and modern transportation has cut demand for the backbreaking job of hauling loads up and down Chongqing\u2019s hills.These changes have left the \u201cbang-bang army\u201d shrinking, aging and struggling economically.\u201cIt\u2019s tough being a bang-bang now,\u201d said Hu Zuhua, 50, who has worked as a porter for a decade. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t even make enough to pay for meals. The couriers are taking all our business.\u201d\u201cThis is a business that is destined to disappear and it won\u2019t be long before it does,\u201d Mr. He said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business steadily being made obsolete by a combination of economic development and the laws of nature. As the Chinese economy rapidly develops and forms of transportation diversify, they no longer have a role to play.\u201dFor decades, residents never had to go far to find porters, who for a dollar or two heaved food, clothes and other loads from door to door.\u201cThere were so many bang-bang, they\u2019d worry that we\u2019d fall into the river and drown,\u201d Mr. Niu said, drawing on a cigarette as he rested between jobs. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about that now.\u201d7 PhotosChongqing, a sprawling, industrial metropolis, grew from trade up and down the Yangtze River, and long relied on brute human strength to haul loads.But demand for the porters took off in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping\u2019s market reforms gave urban Chinese residents more spending power and let farmers enter cities to find work, unleashing a wave of migrants desperate for jobs at a time when the working-age population was bulging.Villagers from the steep hill country around Chongqing found a living using their stamina to carry loads in the city, and the streets and docks teemed with men in faded blue coats and canvas shoes clutching poles and bundles of rope.But many porters said the sentimental images belied their hard lives. Even after decades working in the city, few felt it was their home, and middle-class residents often winced at the sight of the ragged men waiting for work.\u201cThey look down on us; only a few people show us respect,\u201d said Tang Zhengqu, who has worked as a porter for 20 years. \u201cIf you ask for five yuan for a job, they\u2019ll say one yuan, as if you\u2019re a beggar, not a worker.\u201d Five yuan is about 75 cents.Even so, porters said business has fallen off. Many said they now made $300 to $450 a month, about half of what they could earn a few years ago. Many residents now have cars. Courier vans and bikes have also cut into the porters\u2019 business, as have online shopping and neighborhood supermarkets close to residents\u2019 homes.\u201cI couldn\u2019t carry loads like that, not ever,\u201d said Peng Xiaohua, a 35-year-old courier with an electric three-wheel scooter parked near the garment markets where porters gather. He said he quit his job as a cook because he saw more promise in e-commerce and its demand for fast couriers.\u201cThose old guys can only carry things up and down the hills,\u201d he said \u201c Couriers are doing well, because we can deliver parcels anywhere.\u201dThe porters often start work at dawn, when they gather at markets and docks hoping for jobs making deliveries. Much of their day involves waiting for customers to yell or phone for help.As shops close in the afternoon, the porters drift back to their hot, cramped dormitories and rooms, which they often share with dozens of other porters, saving money to send to their families in their home villages.\u201cThis is the job you take when there is no other,\u201d said Tan Wancheng, a 51-year-old porter waiting for work outside a garment market in Chaotianmen, a raucous shopping neighborhood near the city\u2019s main docks.He shares a dormitory with 20 or more other men, and often subsists on rice and pumpkin porridge, he said. \u201cNow the youngsters go out to become security guards or couriers or construction workers, anything but a bang-bang,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to change jobs too, but I can\u2019t.\u201dIn boastful moments, Mr. Niu has said he would work until he was 70. Like many porters, he is about five feet tall with exceedingly brawny limbs. Even so, he appeared drained after hauling two loads to the dock, for which he had made the equivalent of $3.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough, not even for the day\u2019s meals,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t go on, I\u2019ll go back to my village and live in an old-age home. I won\u2019t miss this life.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018White Trash\u2019 Ruminates on an American Underclass", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesCrackers and squatters, rednecks and hillbillies, sandhillers and mudsills, clay eaters and hoe wielders: America has developed a rich vocabulary to describe one part of its permanent underclass. The epithet that subsumes them all, to borrow the title of Nancy Isenberg\u2019s formidable and truth-dealing new book, is white trash.Ms. Isenberg\u2019s project in \u201cWhite Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America\u201d is to retell United States history in a manner that not only includes the weak, the powerless and the stigmatized, but also places them front and center.As such, she has written an eloquent volume that is more discomforting and more necessary than a semitrailer filled with new biographies of the founding fathers and the most beloved presidents. (Look, here are six more in my mailbox.) Viewed from below, a good angle for no one, America\u2019s history is usefully disorienting and nearly always appalling. \u201cWhite Trash\u201d will have you squirming in your chair.Ms. Isenberg is a professor of American history at Louisiana State University. Her books include a well-regarded biography of Aaron Burr. Her own class background goes unmentioned in \u201cWhite Trash.\u201d This study does not require the emotional accelerant of memoir.Ms. Isenberg contends that adults in America are spoon-fed their history as if they were toddlers. We are eager consumers of the national hagiography. She subverts this hagiography at every turn, starting at the beginning.America\u2019s colonial beginnings tend to be viewed, Ms. Isenberg writes, through the \u201cbeliefs of those principled leaders molded in bronze \u2014 the John Winthrops and William Penns \u2014 who are lionized for having projected the enlarged destinies of their respective colonies.\u201dYet she demonstrates that most early settlers did not buy into these destinies. Nor did most come to escape religious persecution. \u201cDuring the 1600s,\u201d she writes, \u201cfar from being ranked as valued British subjects, the great majority of early colonists were classified as surplus population and expendable \u2018rubbish.\u2019\u201dMany were indentured servants. Others were \u201croguish highwaymen, mean vagrants, Irish rebels, known whores and an assortment of convicts shipped to the colonies for grand larceny or other property crimes.\u201d Others were simply lazy \u2014 \u201cidlers,\u201d in the lingo of the time. They would rather drink rum than clear an acre of pine trees.America did not develop a House of Lords, yet we imported the rigging of the British class system, Ms. Isenberg argues. This was hardly a land of equal opportunity. Brutal labor awaited most migrants. There was little social mobility.\u201cPuritan religious faith did not displace class hierarchy, either; the early generations of New Englanders did nothing to diminish, let alone condemn, the routine reliance on servants or slaves,\u201d she observes. \u201cLand was the principal source of wealth, and those without any had little chance to escape servitude. It was the stigma of landlessness that would leave its mark on white trash from this day forward.\u201dFrom this beginning, Ms. Isenberg moves confidently forward, through, for example, the class issues that undergirded the Civil War and the popular eugenics movement, favored by Theodore Roosevelt, that marked many as targets for sterilization. Slavery and racism are hardly discounted in this book, but she maintains her focus on poor whites.She singles out North Carolina as \u201cwhat we might call the first white trash colony.\u201d It was swampy and, thanks to its shoal-filled shoreline, lacked a major port. It had no real planter class. Its citizens were viewed as sluggards, \u201ccowardly Blockheads\u201d in the words of one early writer. Another referred to the state as the lawless \u201csinke of America.\u201dMs. Isenberg moves through the Great Depression, pausing to admire James Agee\u2019s complex yet urgent nonfiction account of the lives of poor tenant farmers in Alabama, \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men\u201d (1941). Elvis arrives. So does Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society.Trailer parks, redolent of \u201cliberty\u2019s dark side,\u201d come under her appraisal, as do movies like \u201cDeliverance.\u201d (She finds its redneck caricatures to be loathsome.) The careers of Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and Bill Clinton are analyzed. Mr. Clinton\u2019s dalliance with Monica Lewinsky resulted in a spectacle that the author likens to a \u201cwhite trash outing on the grand national stage.\u201dThroughout this volume, there is an awareness of a cruel aspect of our moral complexion. \u201cAmericans not only scrambled to get ahead,\u201d she writes, \u201cthey needed someone to look down on.\u201d Gore Vidal put this another way: \u201cIt is not enough merely to win; others must lose.\u201dMs. Isenberg does not skimp on economic analysis. She notes how the central engines of our economy, from slave-owning planters up through today\u2019s bank and tax policies, have systematically harmed the working poor. \u201cWe have to wonder,\u201d she writes about her book\u2019s subjects, \u201chow such people exist amid plenty.\u201d\u201cWhite Trash\u201d is indeed a bummer, and a thoroughly patriotic one. It deals in the truths that matter, which is to say, the uncomfortable ones.White TrashThe 400-Year Untold History of Class in AmericaNancy IsenbergIllustrated. 460 pages. Viking. $28Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Flight Signals End of an Era of Transnational Optimism", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byReporter's NotebookStill, the news stung. For me and others of my generation, this vote was about more than Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It signaled the definitive end of the era of transnational optimism in which I came of age: the \u201990s. Back then, we believed that interconnectedness was a strength. People wanted to study human rights law. Nationalism was out of fashion \u2014 at least in Western Europe \u2014 and weaponized Twitter didn\u2019t yet exist to galvanize political change. (Or rather, to take down institutions, not build them.)Regular people didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and neither did many European leaders, cocooned in their provincialisms. Sometimes there was chatter that no, Greece wouldn\u2019t get kicked out of the euro, but that maybe one day Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, would leave. Never mind how Germany had grown rich because its banks had lent Southern Europe money to buy German goods, a fact that didn\u2019t fit into the \u201clazy Greeks\u201d narrative of the German tabloid news media.The European Union hasn\u2019t done a good job of explaining its purpose \u2014 it\u2019s too opaque, too bureaucratic, too confusing \u2014 and its slow handling of the debt crisis, especially in Greece, where it acted fast so French and German banks could cut their losses, but left Greece asphyxiated, had devastating consequences for all. Decisions made for short-term financial stability have led to long-term political instability.Still, the right appeals to nationalism and the left does not. The right sells a nostalgic version of national identity that resonates viscerally but doesn\u2019t reflect reality, especially not for young people born into a Europe of Erasmus scholarships that let them study across borders, and EasyJet, which lets them travel around on the cheap.These critiques of Europe from the left and right aren\u2019t really ideological in the way that the 20th-century battles between communists and fascists were. Instead, voters have the sense that abstract economic forces are determining their fates, that their countries have given up part of their economic sovereignty to Europe \u2014 but that Europe, a vague construct, has not assumed that power and can\u2019t act on it. Europe hovers in a kind of purgatory of semisovereignty. In this confusion, nationalists thrive.\u201cSince 1989 there has been a return of memory and with it, and benefiting from it, a revival of the national units that framed and shaped that memory and gave meaning to the collective past,\u201d he wrote.Who inherits England? It\u2019s a question that has obsessed British novelists for decades. And who inherits Europe? Today in Europe the past is equally unpredictable, and the path ahead looks very uncertain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For David Cameron, TV Appeal Against \u2018Brexit\u2019 Turns Tense", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 He was accused of hypocrisy, scaremongering and a failing common among politicians worldwide \u2014 waffling.And while it might not prove a decisive moment for the June 23 referendum, the debate could energize a campaign that has shown relatively few signs of igniting public interest.During the broadcast, Mr. Cameron pointed out the economic risks of quitting the European Union, arguing that leaving its single market of about 500 million people would be an \u201cact of self-harm,\u201d and appealing to voters not to \u201croll a dice\u201d on the economic futures of their children and grandchildren.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut from the start of his interview on Sky News, Mr. Cameron was pressed by its political editor, Faisal Islam, on the issue of immigration and on his government\u2019s failure to keep its pledge to restrict the number of arrivals to below 100,000 people a year.Migration has emerged as the strongest issue for those campaigning for Britain to quit the European Union. They argue that Britain will never be able to control immigration as a member of the union because citizens of countries inside the bloc can live and work in other member nations, and Britain, with its relatively successful economy, has attracted many workers from the east and south of Europe.Mr. Islam got a laugh from the studio audience when he parodied some of the claims about the consequences of a Brexit, which critics believe are exaggerated. \u201cWhat comes first: World War III or the global Brexit recession?\u201d he asked.But perhaps the most memorable comment of the evening came from a member of the audience, Soraya Bouazzaoui, who, when dissatisfied with a response from Mr. Cameron interjected, \u201cI\u2019m an English literature student; I know waffling when I see it.\u201dMr. Cameron responded calmly, insisting that claims from his opponents that millions of Turkish citizens would soon be able to live in Britain were fanciful.Turkey is not likely to join the European Union soon, Mr. Cameron said, pointing out that talks on its membership had stalled and that Britain and every other member nation could veto its entry.Mr. Cameron\u2019s governing Conservative Party is deeply split over the referendum, and the format of pre-referendum television debates has proved controversial.Hoping to limit damage to his party, Mr. Cameron is avoiding a head-to-head confrontation with members of his cabinet who support a British withdrawal. So, the justice secretary, Michael Gove, will make the case for Brexit on Friday in a separate program.With the Conservative Party divided, a pivotal factor in the referendum outcome will be the willingness of those who normally vote for the Labour Party to turn out and cast their ballots to remain in the union, their party\u2019s official position.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of being halfhearted in his support for European Union membership. But on Thursday he called again for a vote to remain, and argued that the bloc had helped to lift environmental standards and to protect workers\u2019 rights.In a speech in London, Mr. Corbyn also defended immigration, arguing that Britain \u201ccannot and should not want to close the borders.\u201d Many non-British Europeans help sustain the British health service, he said, and many Britons exercise their reciprocal rights to work in other nations on Europe\u2019s mainland.The main group campaigning for a withdrawal, Vote Leave, faced an unexpected setback on Thursday when it had to evacuate its London headquarters as water gushed in from a floor above. Paul Stephenson, a spokesman for the group, joked that there was no indication that the episode was an act of pro-European sabotage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Tie Blocks Obama Immigration Plan", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it had deadlocked in a case challenging President Obama\u2019s immigration plan, effectively ending what Mr. Obama had hoped would become one of his central legacies. The program would have shielded as many as five million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowed them to legally work in the United States.The 4-4 tie, which left in place an appeals court ruling blocking the plan, amplified the contentious election-year debate over the nation\u2019s immigration policy and presidential power.The decision was just nine words long: \u201cThe judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.\u201dBut its consequences will be vast, said Walter Dellinger, who was acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration. \u201cSeldom have the hopes of so many been crushed by so few words,\u201d he said.Speaking at the White House, Mr. Obama described the ruling as a deep disappointment for immigrants who would not be able to emerge from the threat of deportation for at least the balance of his term.The decision was one of two determined by tie votes Thursday \u2014 the other concerned Indian tribal courts \u2014 and one of four so far this term. The court is scheduled to issue its final three decisions of the term, including one on a restrictive Texas abortion law, on Monday.\u201cIf you keep on blocking judges from getting on the bench, then courts can\u2019t issue decisions,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd what that means is then you are going to have the status quo frozen, and we are not able to make progress on some very important issues.\u201dMr. Obama has said he took the action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by circumventing Congress.\u201cToday\u2019s decision keeps in place what we have maintained from the very start: One person, even a president, cannot unilaterally change the law,\u201d Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said in a statement after the ruling. \u201cThis is a major setback to President Obama\u2019s attempts to expand executive power, and a victory for those who believe in the separation of powers and the rule of law.\u201dThe court did not disclose how the justices had voted, but they were almost certainly split along ideological lines. Administration officials had hoped that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would join the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing to save the program.The case hinged in part on whether Texas had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. Texas said it had standing because it would be costly for the state to give driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy.Mr. Obama said the White House did not believe the terse ruling from the court had any effect on the president\u2019s authority to act unilaterally. But he said the practical effect would be to freeze his efforts on behalf of immigrants until after the November election.He also predicted that lawmakers would eventually act to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system.\u201cCongress is not going to be able to ignore America forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if; it\u2019s a matter of when. We get these spasms of politics around immigration and fear-mongering, and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in.\u201dWhite House officials had repeatedly argued that presidents in both parties had used similar executive authority in applying the nation\u2019s immigration laws. And they said Congress had granted federal law enforcement wide discretion over how those laws should be carried out.But the court\u2019s ruling may mean that the next president will again need to seek a congressional compromise to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws. And it left immigration activists deeply disappointed.\u201cThis is personal,\u201d Rocio Saenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement. \u201cWe will remain at the front lines, committed to defending the immigration initiatives and paving the path to lasting immigration reform.\u201dA closer look at those affected by the court\u2019s decision.The lower court rulings in the case were provisional, and the litigation will now continue and may again reach the Supreme Court when it is back at full strength. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that the program will be revived.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\u201cDeferred action does not provide these individuals with any lawful status under the immigration laws,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it provides some measure of dignity and decent treatment.\u201d\u201cIt recognizes the damage that would be wreaked by tearing apart families,\u201d Mr. Verrilli added, \u201cand it allows individuals to leave the shadow economy and work on the books to provide for their families, thereby reducing exploitation and distortion in our labor markets.\u201dThe states said they had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave them standing to sue.Judge Jerry E. Smith, writing for the majority in the appeals court, focused on an injury said to have been suffered by Texas, which he said would have to spend millions of dollars to provide driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants as a consequence of the federal program.Mr. Verrilli told the justices that Texas\u2019 injury was self-inflicted, a product of its decision to offer driver\u2019s licenses for less than they cost to produce and to tie eligibility for them to federal standards.Judge Hanen grounded his injunction on the Obama administration\u2019s failure to give notice and seek public comments on its new program. He found that notice and comment were required because the program gave blanket relief to entire categories of people, notwithstanding the administration\u2019s assertion that it required case-by-case determinations about who was eligible for the program.The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one. The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama\u2019s statutory authority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smart Way to Help Ex-Convicts, and Society", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI RECENTLY gave a talk at the state prison in San Quentin, Calif. At the event, a former inmate said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why over the 18-year period of my incarceration, over $900,000 was paid to keep me in prison. But when I was paroled, I was given $200 and told \u2018good luck.\u2019 \u201dHe\u2019s right. For our economy to succeed, we need to equip every American to be effective in the national work force. But the more than 600,000 people who leave prison every year are not getting the support they need. That fails them and fails the economy for all of us.To prepare for my talk at San Quentin, I spoke with some of the people incarcerated there. I was trying to understand what I had to offer them in a speech \u2014 and I discovered how much they had to offer me. They are individuals \u2014 with a whole range of strengths, weaknesses and, yes, contributions still to make. And while there\u2019s been a rightful focus on ending mass incarceration, there has been little public discussion of how we reintegrate this growing population.Criminal justice reform is not just about being fair to the individuals who will be most directly affected, but it\u2019s also about doing what\u2019s right for our nation\u2019s well-being. A 2009 study estimated that the official poverty rate would have declined by 10 percent for the years 1980 until 2004 had it not been for our incarceration policies. And while there hasn\u2019t been a large-scale study of the economic effects of criminal-justice reform, most experts in the field agree that preparing people for life after prison is a critically important public investment that would alleviate poverty and increase worker productivity.In California, incarceration policies have already changed, and the San Quentin inmates I spoke to said that the increased chance of freedom has changed the way they behave in prison. They said they were more focused on increasing their chances of parole and preparing for life after San Quentin by trying to learn the skills and behaviors that can lead to productive and meaningful lives outside.When you witness the powerful effect the prospect of release has on changing behavior, it helps you realize how badly we are analyzing the effects of the current system on the outcomes we want for society. And when you analyze the economic effects of our current system, it becomes clear where it is failing.How is giving a former inmate $200 and not much else \u2014 no suitable place to live, no help finding work, no help adjusting to life outside prison walls \u2014 preparing him for a productive life? Society imposes a stigma on former prisoners that makes all of that harder. All of this decreases the probability of success.There are five key areas where we could make a significant difference in improving the chance that individuals released from prison can make a successful transition to mainstream society.First, we need to enhance educational opportunities for people inside prison and just out of it. Many prisons offer some level of basic education and G.E.D. preparation, but it is often inadequate, and higher education is almost entirely lacking. Fewer than one in 10 inmates has access to college-level classes. Inmates who are interested and qualified should have the opportunity to pursue a college education; it will only improve their chance to succeed when released.Second, we should remove unfair barriers to employment. Many jobs now require professional certification, like being a barber in Connecticut or a truck driver in Texas, and state certification boards often bar former prisoners. We should eliminate those blanket prohibitions.Third, we should support transitional assistance efforts across the country. For example, the New York-based Center for Employment Opportunities provides work in four states for people as soon as they are released, and couples those opportunities with skills programs, training and job placement. Efforts like these have proven records of success and should be deployed nationwide.Fourth, we need to help the formerly incarcerated have access to secure and stable housing. Currently, many states ban former prisoners from living in assisted housing. We should instead give individual housing authorities discretion so they can protect the safety of residents but also offer housing to people leaving prison who are ready to start new, productive lives.And finally, we should help people take advantage of health care coverage for which they are already eligible. Twenty-eight states expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and while most people just out of prison are eligible for it, too many are unaware or need assistance enrolling.Of course, these investments cost money, but come with a significant return. Because efforts to help people make a successful transition back to mainstream society both reduce recidivism and equip former prisoners to be effective parts of the work force, it will help our economy over the long term.Solving this problem begins with people outside prison recognizing the humanity of people inside prison. As one man incarcerated at San Quentin said to me: \u201cNobody is just the crime they committed. We are all much more than the worst thing we have done.\u201dPeople in prison are part of America, as are those who have been released. They are part of our society. And we have a powerful stake in their success.Advertisement"}

Mr. Cameron and Mr. Johnson both emphasized on Monday that \u201cthere will be no immediate changes in their circumstances.\u201d\u201cThis is not the post-Brexit Britain we want to see,\u201d she wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tl;dr and Modern Macroeconomics (Wonkish)", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Dear spell-correct: no, I do not mean \u201cmonkish.\u201d When the Great Recession struck, there was a sharp division in economic commentary between those who had learned and appreciated the old Hicksian framework and those who hadn\u2019t and/or didn\u2019t. For that framework made some important predictions \u2014 namely, it said that things would be different at the zero lower bound. Increases in the monetary base \u2014 even huge increases \u2014 would not be inflationary. Budget deficits would not drive up interest rates. And fiscal multipliers would be much larger than they are in normal times, when fiscal expansion or contraction is offset by monetary policy.Those were deeply controversial predictions at the time, but they were overwhelmingly vindicated by experience \u2014 dead-enders are reduced to arguing that Hicksians just happened to be right for the wrong reasons.But here\u2019s the thing: doing anything like HIcksian analysis in public is still very much frowned on within the economics profession. It\u2019s ad hoc, not microfounded, sloppy about intertemporal relationships. DSGE models with sticky prices are OK; publishing IS-LMish stuff, even in a policy forum, remains hard and in general is possible only for old guys with enough professional capital to get away with it.And yet \u2026 it\u2019s really tough going, epitomizing too long; didn\u2019t read to the nth degree. In part I guess I\u2019m just an aging economist with much less tolerance for algebraic grinding than I used to have. You also want to bear in mind the old principle that the optimal level of technical difficulty in papers is always precisely the level of your own papers. But still.What do we get out of the rigor \u2014 the overlapping-generations setup, the explicit modeling of borrowing constraints, and so on? Suppose you came at this issue in an old-fashioned way, using Mundell-Fleming \u2014 the open-economy version of IS-LM. You would boil it down (as Olivier Blanchard has suggested in an email) to a Metzler diagram, with the exchange rate (price of foreign currency) on the horizontal axis and interest rates on the vertical:The idea here is that a depreciation of Home\u2019s currency causes economic expansion in Home, which Home\u2019s central bank leans against, hence the upward slope; meanwhile, it causes contraction in Foreign, which Foreign\u2019s central bank also leans against, hence downward slope. But both face a potential zero lower bound, hence the flat sections.With perfect capital mobility and static expectations, interest rates must be equalized, so equilibrium is where the two lines cross. And it\u2019s now obvious that an adverse shock in Foreign, suggested by the blue arrows, will push interest rates down in both countries. If the shock is enough to drive Foreign to the ZLB, it will do the same to Home, as transmitted through the exchange rate. In other words, Europe can export its secular stagnation to us via a weak euro and a strong dollar.Now, you get a few additional insights from the EMSS paper, such as the role of credit constraints in inducing stagnation and the rule of limits on capital mobility in limiting its spread. But the cost in terms of complexity and cumbersomeness is huge.So I don\u2019t have any general opposition to the more elaborate modeling approach. What worries me is the effective prohibition on simple, ad hoc models that sometimes yield most of the insight \u2014 in the case of contagious secular stagnation, I\u2019d put the ratio well above 90 percent \u2014 in a form that is much more useful for real-world policy discussion.Or then again, maybe it\u2019s just my vintage. Also, you kids get off my lawn.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve expressed both as shares of potential GDP, and further normalized by taking deviations from the 1990-2007 average of these shares:Nonresidential investment has basically recovered from the recession-induced slump. Residential investment is still a bit low by historical standards, but not as much as you might think if your baseline is the boom of the mid-naughties. And given the slowing growth of the working-age population \u2014 down from more than 1 percent a year to less than 0.5 \u2014 should\u2019t we expect some reduction in home construction?So I don\u2019t see an obvious reason to believe that current rates are too low.

If the House votes to impeach Mr. Koskinen, the Senate would not hold a trial and could not muster the necessary two-thirds vote to convict him if it did, Senate Republicans say.The genial septuagenarian has long enjoyed a sort of behind-the-scenes prominence, well known to Washington insiders and business leaders. He is also well known to fans of soccer and Duke University \u2014 his dual passions \u2014 and the soccer stadium there, Koskinen Stadium, is named after him. Mr. Koskinen won the prestigious Elliot L. Richardson Prize this year \u201cfor excellence and integrity in government service,\u201d timing that suggested the selection panel\u2019s indifference to the well-publicized complaints of congressional Republicans.\u201cPeople like that who are sort of turnaround specialists and willing to take on hard jobs, there aren\u2019t that many of them. And people know who they are,\u201d said Alice M. Rivlin, an economist who worked with Mr. Koskinen in the Clinton administration, then in overhauling the government of Washington, D.C., after Congress stripped city officials of their budget power after years of mismanagement.In Mr. Koskinen\u2019s telling, he does not get hired; he is \u201cdragooned\u201d \u2014 he used the word more than once during an interview in a spacious, if drab, office with few personal touches besides family photos and mementos from previous jobs.\u201cI never apply for jobs \u2014 I just keep getting them,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said. \u201cI say I\u2019m going to go into the witness protection program, and they\u2019ll never find me again.\u201dHe has a physics degree from Duke and a law degree from Yale, and held various government jobs from the mid-1960s to early 1970s: clerk to the chief judge of a federal appeals court; adviser to a national commission on urban riots; aide to Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, a Republican, and then to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut.Next came 21 years in the private sector at the Palmieri Company, where he ultimately became the chief executive and revamped failed entities. Among them were the Penn Central, a Teamsters union pension fund and Mutual Benefit, at the time the largest life insurance company to have failed.When the Y2K job ended without computer chaos, Ms. Rivlin recommended Mr. Koskinen to Washington\u2019s newly elected mayor, Anthony A. Williams. Mr. Koskinen became city administrator and deputy mayor, helping local officials reclaim powers that Congress had transferred to a board of outsiders headed by Ms. Rivlin.\u201cWho in their right mind would want to take on a job like that?\u201d asked Joel L. Fleishman, a longtime friend of Mr. Koskinen\u2019s and a law professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke. He put that question to Mr. Koskinen then, and again 13 years later when his friend told him about the I.R.S. job offer.\u201cJohn said, \u2018Well, somebody\u2019s got to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fleishman recalled.\u201cI don\u2019t know how they even got my cellphone number,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.For a time, he was also Freddie Mac\u2019s chief executive and chief financial officer.

Trump wins the presidency.She offers reasonableness instead of resentment, urging voters to see the big picture and promising to manage economic and immigration upheaval, just as Mr. Cameron did. She, too, is a pragmatic internationalist battling against nationalist anger, cautioning that the turmoil after the so-called Brexit vote underscores a need for \u201ccalm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House.\u201dBut prudence is cold comfort to people fed up with more-of-the-same.According to their friends and advisers, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have worried for months that she was out of sync with the mood of the electorate, and that her politically safe messages \u2014 like \u201cI\u2019m a progressive who gets results\u201d \u2014 were far less compelling to frustrated voters than the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d of Senator Bernie Sanders or Mr. Trump\u2019s grievance-driven promise to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dMr. Sanders and Mr. Trump won a combined 25 million votes during the primary season, compared with 16 million for Mrs. Clinton. And while many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters are expected to support her in November, she has not recalibrated her message to try to tap into the anger that he and Mr. Trump channeled.Nor does Mrs. Clinton have any plans, advisers say, to take cues from the Brexit campaign and start soft-pedaling her support for globalized markets, or denouncing porous borders, illegal immigrants and the lack of job protections in free-trade agreements.Much distinguishes the presidential contest from the British fight, of course, including a head-to-head matchup between well-known candidates, a sharply different economic context, and a long and proud history of immigration.While Mrs. Clinton is counting on Mr. Trump\u2019s history of racist and sexist remarks to doom his candidacy, Thursday\u2019s Brexit referendum was an unnerving reminder that voter anger is deeper and broader than many elite politicians and veteran pollsters realize. In swing states like Ohio, many Democrats and Republicans yearn for an economic comeback and are not confident that Mrs. Clinton understands their frustrations or has the ideas and wherewithal to deliver the sort of change that could satisfy them.\u201cBrexit is clearly a cautionary tale for the Clinton campaign not to get too complacent with a potential victory,\u201d said David B. Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. \u201cTrump, Sanders and those in Great Britain who ran the Leave campaign are tapping into an anger and anxiety that is clearly festering. Working-class folks in the United States are similar to working-class folks in Europe. And a lot of those working-class people feel as if the international economic system is not working for them and strangling the middle class.\u201dMike DuHaime, a Republican strategist, said the British vote was the clearest sign yet that \u201cthe intensity against the status quo is far more real than many are still willing to acknowledge.\u201d\u201cIf the Trump victory in the primary wasn\u2019t enough of one, the Brexit vote serves as a major wake-up call indicating just how frustrated average voters are with those in power,\u201d Mr. DuHaime said.Several Democrats cautioned against drawing too many lessons from the Brexit vote, saying mass immigration and economic malaise were bigger problems in Britain and the European Union than in the United States. They also said many British voters were revolting against a bureaucracy in Brussels that they regarded as bloated, overpaid and prone to interfering in the affairs of sovereign countries.Yet the Democrats acknowledged that the worldview held by Mrs. Clinton and many of the party\u2019s elites was not as attractive to many voters as it once was.\u201cLiberal internationalism seems to have been dying for a while,\u201d said Mark S. Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is not involved with the Clinton campaign. \u201cBut while that may be the animating philosophy of foreign policy intellectuals the world over, it is not the animating philosophy of America, nor of our domestic politics.\u201dFor Sean Harrington, a husband and father of three who owns the Town Pump Tavern in downtown Detroit, the support for free-trade deals and international markets cannot die fast enough. Taking a break from his bookkeeping duties on Friday, he said President Clinton\u2019s economic policies were still \u201cruining the economy\u201d by giving benefits to large corporations that move jobs overseas, while in states like Michigan, \u201cthe average work force loses.\u201d\u201cIf my fellow Americans were doing better, there would be more money around and traded in and out of my pockets,\u201d said Mr. Harrington, a registered independent who is undecided between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump.On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton regularly pledges to \u201cmake sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d as she put it on Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C., where she also promised to reject \u201cbad trade deals and unfair trade practices.\u201d She also argued in favor of Britain\u2019s remaining in the European Union.But she was not surprised that the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign won, her advisers said Friday, because she understands the extent of voter anger. Her advisers said they were confident the referendum in Britain did not mirror the presidential election in the United States.\u201cThese are two different countries, with very different circumstances and demographics, facing different choices,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe believe American voters are looking for concrete solutions to address their economic frustrations and unlikely to find the turmoil, economic uncertainty and roiling of markets caused by the Brexit vote particularly appealing.\u201dFrank Luntz, a Republican expert on political messaging, said Mr. Cameron and the \u201cRemain\u201d camp had failed to \u201cpersonalize, individualize or humanize their campaign.\u201d The \u201cStronger Together\u201d slogan shared by the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign and Mrs. Clinton feels bloodless and overly intellectual compared with the more emotional, country-first appeals of Mr. Trump and the \u201cLeave\u201d movement, he said.\u201cThe problem with the concept of \u2018together\u2019 is that it promotes groupthink rather than individual pursuits,\u201d Mr. Luntz said. \u201cWe are in an age of individual action, not collective responsibility.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s arguments against Mr. Trump often require a great deal of explanation to voters, which can sometimes turn them off.While Mr. Trump thrills his audiences with big promises \u2014 without saying much about how he would fulfill them \u2014 Mrs. Clinton can get caught in the gears of policy. One recent exception was a foreign policy speech in early June, when she hit a rhythm and ripped into Mr. Trump with memorable lines like \u201cHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia.\u201dBut when Mrs. Clinton takes pains to explain why Mr. Trump\u2019s promises and policies do not add up, or are too risky, she runs a risk of her own: that she will sound as though she is instructing or talking down to her audience. Not many voters want a lecturer as president.\u201cA slogan and a message must be aspirational \u2014 either give people hope things will get better or that the bad stuff will stop \u2014 both,\u201d said Ruth Sherman, a political communications analyst who is not affiliated with any campaign. Referring to one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s taglines, she said: \u201cHillary\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m with her\u2019 \u2014 I remember thinking when I first saw it, \u2018Really?\u2019 It\u2019s not my job to be with her. She should be with me.\u201dIf Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is resonant \u2014 \u201cby far the best slogan of all the candidates,\u201d Ms. Sherman said \u2014 Mrs. Clinton is counting on voters to appreciate policy ideas that are more strategic than feel-good.She argued in Raleigh, for instance, that markets like the European Union \u201cwork best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits.\u201d While that statement was hardly in the aspirational vein that Ms. Sherman recommends, it set a clear goal and was less divisive than Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the British referendum.The American electorate has tilted this year toward presidential candidates who make them feel as much as think, but Mrs. Clinton and her allies hope that voters will reflect on the vote in Britain and opt for the steadiness and predictability that she promises.\u201cI don\u2019t think the average American who has a retirement account right now is thrilled about Donald Trump\u2019s support of Brexit,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, who was a deputy secretary of state under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHillary Clinton understands we always need to change \u2014 but change that doesn\u2019t cause unintended consequences for the average American.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the slogan of the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign in Britain. It was \u201cStronger In\u201d \u2014 not \u201cStrongerTogether,\u201d which was a popular hashtag for some Remain supporters (as well as the slogan of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign).Mary Chapman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Push to Improve Welfare of Horse Racing\u2019s Involuntary Heroes", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported bySports of The TimesLast year at this time, the thoroughbred horse racing community and casual racing fans alike were riding the high of a milestone: American Pharoah had won the Belmont Stakes to become the first horse in 37 years to complete the Triple Crown.A year later, without the distraction of a Triple Crown or even a rematch between this year\u2019s Kentucky Derby winner, Nyquist, and Exaggerator, the Preakness winner, the racing industry has had to look in the mirror. What it sees is still not pretty. The systemic problems that existed before the Triple Crown have not gone away. Horses are still dropping dead on the track as unscrupulous trainers, under pressure to produce, continue to administer harmful drugs, threatening the sport\u2019s already fragile credibility.\u201cThere has to be a correction,\u201d said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.Pacelle and I have spoken over the years about animal welfare and animal cruelty. In his recent book \u201cThe Humane Economy: How Innovators and Enlightened Consumers are Transforming the Lives of Animals,\u201d Pacelle argues that businesses that do not adjust to consumer concerns about the treatment of animals are doomed.\u201cIf a business is engaged in some sort of animal cruelty or animal mistreatment, it\u2019s eventually going to catch up to them,\u201d he said.Some are starting to pay attention. Ringling Brothers retired its elephant herd last month after having had the animals as part of its traveling circus act for nearly 150 years. In March, SeaWorld announced that it would stop breeding orcas.\u201cThe two biggest brand names have phased out or are phasing out the use of animals that are the center of their brands because of the animal welfare concerns,\u201d Pacelle said. \u201cEverything is changing, yet horse racing is still resisting reform. There has to be a correction.\u201dBut thanks in part to social media, the casual fan, who tends to care about horse racing only in April, May and June (around the time of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont), is taking an active interest in how equine athletes are treated. Their concerns \u2014 along with the specter of death at the track, of still too many breakdowns, of widespread doping \u2014 are also compelling some forces within the industry to take steps toward real reform, beginning with doping.The powerful Jockey Club is working with the Humane Society to eliminate the scourge of doping and, in the process, get the fragmented racing industry to play by a single set of rules.The two groups are supporting federal legislation, the Thoroughbred Horse Racing Anti-Doping Act of 2015, that would put the United States Anti-Doping Agency in charge of monitoring the administration of race-day medication at the track. The organizations hope to put Usada, an independent agency, in a position to police the sport\u2019s deeply rooted doping culture.Race-day doping is particularly troublesome. It can give horses an advantage, but it can also put already injured horses, who should not be racing, at risk of greater, even catastrophic, injury.\u201cIt won\u2019t solve everything, but doping is the most insidious of the practices in racing,\u201d Pacelle said. \u201cIt is Exhibit No. 1 for the idea that people are more concerned with winning than they are with the protection and welfare of the horses.\u201dThe Jockey Club has taken polls over the last five years that show convincingly that racing fans are paying attention to aspects of the sport beyond simply wagering.They are concerned, said Jim Gagliano, the chief executive of the Jockey Club, with matters of \u201canimal welfare and the fairness and integrity of competition.\u201dHe added: \u201cThose are very high among our current fans and potential new fans. It is good business for racing.\u201dThere are many contentious issues in the sport: breeding horses for speed, for example, not endurance; sending poor and underperforming horses to slaughter. But this legislation is just about doping.\u201cYou have to start somewhere,\u201d Pacelle said.The support from the Jockey Club, which, made up as it is of owners and breeders, is the closest thing racing has to central leadership, is an acknowledgment that the regulatory system in place to police doping could be substantially improved by Usada\u2019s oversight.For a sport that plays by 38 different sets of rules corresponding to the 38 racing commissions nationwide, a universal set of doping regulations would be a major accomplishment.\u201cThere\u2019s a collective recognition that the system that\u2019s in place, and has been in place for a long time, hasn\u2019t been adequate, hasn\u2019t been nimble enough, hasn\u2019t been uniform across all the racing states,\u201d Gagliano said.Pacelle and Gagliano will no doubt face fierce opposition from within racing.Some of the sport\u2019s stakeholders don\u2019t want to reboot the process and surrender ome of their autonomy.\u201cChange is always hard for some to contemplate,\u201d Gagliano said. \u201cOthers feel this is going to require a federal act, and they oppose federal intervention in our sport.\u201dBut if horses keep dying on the track, breaking down and being exploited by race-day doping, the sport could find itself up to its neck in federal intervention, and deservedly so.The larger issue \u2014 the only issue, really \u2014 is the care of the animals.We write quite a bit about the danger of participating in high-risk sports and recreational pursuits. Human beings take risks, whether we\u2019re jumping out of planes, climbing mountains, playing football or boxing. We go into them, more or less, with our eyes open. But race horses are involuntary participants in a tough sport; they need protection now more than ever.Bringing Usada into thoroughbred racing is the best idea in the sport in decades.\u201cWe\u2019re not unlike any other sport,\u201d Gagliano said, \u201cexcept we\u2019ve got a competitor \u2014 the horse \u2014 whose responsibility and welfare is really entrusted to us.\u201dFrom Eight Belles, who died at the end of the Kentucky Derby in 2008, to scores of others that died more anonymous, inglorious deaths on the track, the industry has abused its horses and the trust of its fans.With this legislation, racing can take a small step toward winning it back.Email: wcr@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Unveil Plan to Revamp Dodd-Frank", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee outlined on Tuesday a legislative proposal that aims to dismantle significant portions of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.The plan, whose details will be released in full later this month, has little chance of passing Congress this year. But the proposal by Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, may influence the presidential debate and help shape the Republican agenda in the next term.The conservative lawmaker has been a longtime critic of the financial reform law. The Financial Choice Act, which stands for Creating Hope and Opportunity for Investors, Consumers and Entrepreneurs, builds on longstanding efforts by House Republicans to roll back or repeal major elements of the law, and would strip financial regulators of significant authority to oversee some of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions. The plan is an outgrowth of a call by House Speaker Paul Ryan for Republican lawmakers to offer affirmative policy proposals that go beyond criticisms of Democratic policies.Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said that he will dismantle Dodd-Frank, though he has not provided detail about how he would replace or rewrite the law.\u201cSimply put, Dodd-Frank has failed,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said in remarks to the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new legislative paradigm in banking and capital markets.\u201dHis proposals will call for replacing the financial reform law\u2019s \u201corderly liquidation authority\u201d for winding down a failing financial institution with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code.The plan would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which aims to stop banks from making some risky bets with their own money. Moreover, the legislation would prevent a body of regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council from designating any nonbanks as \u201csystemically important.\u201d MetLife recently won a federal court case to throw out its \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label from the F.S.O.C., but other companies, including the American International Group and Prudential Financial, are still covered. General Electric\u2019s financial unit has applied to have the designation removed.At the same time, the proposal would allow the country\u2019s largest banks to exempt themselves from capital and liquidity requirements and other regulatory standards if they hold enough capital to maintain a leverage ratio of 10 percent.\u201cThe Republican plan does not \u2018force\u2019 any bank to raise a dime of new capital,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said . \u201cRather, it allows banks to opt into a regime that replaces Dodd-Frank\u2019s suffocating regulatory complexity and control with market discipline.\u201dThe legislation would also restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and remove some of its powers. The plan would replace the agency\u2019s single director with a bipartisan commission, which would be called the \u201cConsumer Financial Opportunity Commission.\u201d All of the financial regulatory agencies would have to abide by heightened cost-benefit analysis standards that critics have argued are designed to slow or even halt the rule-writing process. The other financial agencies would also be reformed as bipartisan commissions, in cases where they are not already, and all would be subject to the congressional appropriations process, except in the case of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy.Still, the conservative plan does contain some elements that others may find more palatable. The legislative outline calls for imposing stronger penalties for financial fraud and for greater transparency in the enforcement process, which policy makers on both sides of the aisle have advocated since the financial crisis, albeit with little to show so far. It also gives a nod to community banks, teeing up provisions that would loosen standards for smaller financial institutions. But even some of those proposals have faced resistance from Democrats in Congress.President Obama, in a recent speech on the economy, reiterated the White House\u2019s stance against broad rollbacks of the financial reform law, underscoring the uphill battle the legislation would face in the current political environment.\u201cHave we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago? It hasn\u2019t been that long ago,\u201d Mr. Obama said last week in Elkhart, Ind., referring to big banks. \u201cAnd because of their reckless behavior, you got hurt. And the notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economy\u2019s back makes no sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 a Splitting Hangover for the City of London", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Luke Hickmore had an aperitif Thursday night, watched the early results on Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and went to bed. He didn\u2019t sleep long.Mr. Hickmore, 46, helps oversee $13.7 billion for Aberdeen Asset Management, a global investment firm. He switched on his TV at 3:30 a.m., and said he thought, \u201cHang on a sec, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go the way the market priced in.\u201dThe financial district stretches from the stately offices of hedge funds in Mayfair to Canary Wharf, where glass-and-steel bank headquarters have replaced abandoned docks. But its heart, Britain\u2019s version of Wall Street, is known as the City of London or simply \u201cthe City,\u201d referring to roughly a square mile where you can find the old walls of Londinium, the city built by the Romans.Brexit is on everyone\u2019s mind, as bankers absorb a second Big Bang as profound as the one three decades ago \u2014 though one without a road map forward.After the tumult of Friday, bankers, traders and other finance types could be found at the Pavilion End, a City pub in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. A group stood outside the pub, as is the custom in London when the weather allows. Some had their jackets off, white dress shirts and suit trousers with ties, and held pints of beer as they pondered where the City\u2019s jobs might move. Paris. Amsterdam. Frankfurt seemed the most likely. But few seemed excited about the prospect of living there.\u201cThere\u2019s no confidence; it\u2019s been shredded,\u201d said Andrew Towill, 28, one of four employees of a multinational real estate consultancy who were also standing outside the Pavilion End.Anna Benjamin, 50, said not much was different on Friday in their business \u201cbecause we\u2019re dealing with projects that are ongoing. But there is a definite feeling that once they start coming to an end, where is the next one coming from?\u201dJohn Lowes, 35, said there was a general \u201cfeeling of real concern.\u201d\u201cNow what happens? We just don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.The group worried about returning to the kind of conditions they faced during the financial crisis.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Robert Harper, 37, said. \u201cThere were times when I had nothing to do.\u201dAs with every financial shock, there are winners and losers.Many of the less well-to-do will suffer. While older voters led the charge for Brexit, the value of their pensions took a hit along with the British stock market and economy.Executives described a tense night on trading floors. At Goldman Sachs, there was activity on the London floor throughout the night, with TVs blaring referendum returns. In a note to JPMorgan Chase employees, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the firm \u201cprocessed 1,000 trading tickets per second at one point,\u201d many times the typical trading volume. The chief executive at Citigroup in New York, Michael Corbat, personally walked the trading floor, a relatively rare move for a Wall Street chief these days.It will take days and months to sift through the ramifications for the markets and the City, as Britain negotiates its post-Brexit relationships and global financial firms figure out their next steps. The aftermath of a Leave vote was predictable in many ways, unforeseen in others.Earlier this week, at a conference, Andrew Jackson, chief investment officer at Cairn Capital, a London-based firm, was asked about the best way to prepare for a possible Brexit vote.Much further, it turned out. RBS fell 18 percent on Friday, Barclays 17.9 percent and Lloyds Banking Group 21 percent.Many hedge funds stayed on the sidelines heading into the referendum, looking to pounce in the aftermath.\u201cIt is early to tell, but there will be very few that have done exceedingly well or exceedingly badly,\u201d said Anthony Lawler, an executive at GAM, an investment management firm that oversees portfolios of hedge funds for institutional clients.Many investors, he said, preferred voting on probabilities, not binary yes-or-no outcomes. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a massive sudden move, that\u2019s very difficult to trade.\u201dMr. Hickmore said he had already reduced risk by moving away from bets that bond yields would go higher.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold that choice through a U.K. referendum vote like this, because the risk of you being wrong is so high,\u201d he said.Bets were being made, however. The pound rallied sharply Thursday as polls indicated a vote to remain in the European Union, only to collapse starting late Thursday night, well before the official results were announced.Mr. Odey, who declined to comment, has long supported a Brexit vote. After suffering losses in his portfolio earlier this year, his faith in Brexit paid off.\u201cI would rather we were out of Europe,\u201d Mr. Odey said in an interview in 2014, adding then that it was a \u201cprobably a protest vote.\u201dBack in the City, some less-celebrated finance types, cramped outside a dark pub called Ye Olde Watling, contemplated an uncertain future. One wondered aloud whether he could still build a career in London. With the prospect of Frankfurt in the air, another joked that he was giving German lessons now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Reversal, Germany\u2019s Military Growth Is Met With Western Relief", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 You know times have changed when the Germans announce they are expanding their army for the first time in 25 years \u2014 and no one objects.Back when the Berlin Wall fell, Britain and France in particular feared the re-emergence of a German colossus in Europe. By contrast, Berlin\u2019s pledge last month to add almost 7,000 soldiers to its military by 2023, and an earlier announcement to spend up to 130 billion euros, about $148 billion, on new equipment by 2030 were warmly welcomed by NATO allies.It has taken decades since the horrors of World War II, but Berlin\u2019s modern-day allies and, it seems, German leaders themselves are finally growing more comfortable with the notion that Germany\u2019s role as the European Union\u2019s de facto leader requires a military dimension.Perhaps none too soon. The United States and others \u2014 including many of Germany\u2019s own defense experts \u2014 want Germany to do even more for Continental security and to broaden deployments overseas.As a July NATO summit meeting in Warsaw approaches, Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, is now key to how the alliance will face the twin perils that have transformed the strategic situation in Europe: a more menacing Russia and the Islamic State\u2019s expansion beyond individual acts of terrorism like executions to seizing territory.In Europe, where NATO\u2019s easternmost members, particularly Poland and the Baltic States, have clamored for permanent deployment of Allied troops to deter Russian meddling, Germany looks set to take command of a brigade in Lithuania, joining Britain and the United States in leading the effort to marshal a robust presence on Russia\u2019s borders.Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany is also playing a part in NATO programs to pool resources of member states for greater collective security. Defense experts hold up increased German-Dutch cooperation as a model.The path to even a semblance of collective European defense is littered with unmet promises of better cooperation \u2014 for example, the quarter-century-old Franco-German brigade, which remains mostly a paper tiger, and the scramble ahead of the Warsaw meeting to find a fourth country to command a unit in the new NATO deployment in Eastern Europe. Britain and France, both nuclear powers, continue to set their own priorities.But whether on its own or with others, Germany is showing signs of growing more comfortable with embracing a bigger military role, a gradual but distinct shift away from an instinctive pacifism that took hold starting in 1945, and a post-Cold War tendency to shrink the nation\u2019s military.The shift started becoming publicly apparent in 2014, when Germany\u2019s president and foreign and defense ministers all urged an increased global security role for the country at the annual Munich Security Conference. Weeks later, Russia\u2019s leader, President Vladimir V. Putin, annexed Crimea from Ukraine.Since then, Germany has responded by helping to build a NATO rapid response force in Eastern Europe, leading the diplomacy efforts in Ukraine, and training and arming Kurdish pesh merga battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Now, a new government strategy document, the first such \u201cWhite Book\u201d in 10 years, is being prepared. It is likely both to bolster Germany\u2019s role on the world stage \u2014 beyond its traditional sphere of activity in Europe \u2014 and to talk explicitly of military contributions.How far this thinking has spread outside the political and military elite is open to question. Polling shows that \u201cthe general public is not very comfortable with the military dimension,\u201d said Sylke Tempel, the editor of International Policy, the magazine of the German Council on Foreign Relations.The policy-making elite, on other hand, know that \u201cstrategic thinking includes the notion that you have to build a force in order to be taken seriously, and that you have to spend on this dimension,\u201d Ms. Tempel said.Germany is not moving fast enough for defense experts like Hans-Peter Bartels, the parliamentary commissioner for the military, or Karl-Heinz Kamp, the president of the government\u2019s Federal Academy for Security Policy.Dr. Kamp was more upbeat about German and NATO efforts, particularly the plans for meeting any Russian challenge on the alliance\u2019s eastern borders.\u201cWe are almost at permanent presence, almost,\u201d Dr. Kamp said. \u201cMore is being decided than Putin could ever have imagined.\u201dThe major danger he sees for these plans is \u201cthe fact that we have these anti-establishment movements on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 we have the Alternative for Germany, we have the National Front in France and in the U.S.A. we have Trump.\u201dPopulists in such movements have little interest in knitting together trans-Atlantic interests and deploying Allied forces for common goals, he said.\u201cThese anti-establishment movements stand in contrast to everything which is NATO, and that is the only point which really worries me,\u201d Dr. Kamp said.In German politics, the post of defense minister has traditionally proved difficult. The job is prestigious, but plagued by difficulties in securing finances and suitable, modern equipment.Neither the defense minister nor the chancellor is commander in chief of the army \u2014 another legacy of post-Nazi efforts to constrain Germany. Control of the army belongs to the Parliament, and any military expense or deployment is subject to its approval.Thomas Wiegold, an expert on defense affairs, noted that regular troop strength \u2014 around 166,000 in April \u2014 already lags the current target of 170,000 and asked whether the defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, could reach that level and then keep her pledge of more soldiers by 2023.\u201cThe political message is that after decades of shrinking, we want to grow,\u201d Mr. Wiegold said. \u201cBut how that translates practically, nobody yet knows.\u201dThe defense minister has taken several steps to make the military a better employer. They include hiring a senior aide from the business consultant McKinsey to examine structures, and simply ensuring more contact between soldiers overseas and their families back home.A new cyberwarfare unit is a priority. The Defense Ministry is trying to end equipment failures and malfunctions. Last year, a dispute erupted with the arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch over the standard issue G-36 machine gun, which the ministry said did not always fire straight.Another major task is to convince skeptical Germans, particularly in the east, that NATO is keeping its 1997 bargain with Russia that alliance troops would not be stationed permanently at Russia\u2019s edge.And so, in another measure of how things have changed in Europe, listeners of a Berlin broadcaster, rbb Inforadio, heard an unusual early morning interview on May 19. On the line from the Polish port city of Szczecin was Lt. Gen. Manfred Hofmann, a 42-year veteran of the German Army, who commands a corps that began in 1999 as a German-Danish unit to help Poland integrate into NATO, which it joined that spring.Dialogue with Moscow has not shut down, he said, and NATO is keeping its commitments not to permanently station combat units on former Soviet bloc territory.But the general noted that the corps command is now a 400-person, 21-nation unit, overseeing rapid deployment of NATO units if necessary, and reflected that since the 2014 summit meeting in Wales, \u201can unbelievable amount has happened.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Brexit Spillover", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe immediate effects of the vote on the rest of the world \u2014 a sell-off in global stock markets and gyration in currency markets \u2014 have been painful and worrisome, but so far not out of control.But worse is surely yet to come for Britain itself. Its economy is likely to stumble badly or even to contract as the flow of global capital to London\u2019s vast financial center begins to slow, exposing imbalances in the British economy even as the country\u2019s policy makers are forced to contend with the referendum\u2019s other consequences \u2014 among them the downgrading of Britain\u2019s credit standing and the loss of favorable trade agreements.The question going forward is how severe the spillover effects of a British downturn will be elsewhere, and what can be done to control or contain them.In the European Union, the disruption of trade with an important partner \u2014 amid speculation about which other nations may try to leave \u2014 raises real threats to the strength of the underlying eurozone economy. These, in turn, could lead to renewed financial instability and increasing political disarray, echoing earlier eurozone crises.In the United States, the British vote coincides with slower job growth, feeble business investment and a general slowdown in economic growth. This slowdown does not seem temporary, and Britain\u2019s move could complicate matters further. American exporters would be harmed if the dollar strengthened significantly against the pound and the euro. The broader economy would suffer if the sell-off in the stock market became severe enough to curtail spending by high-end consumers.Hedge funds and other asset management firms are another source of potential risk. Some of them have undoubtedly suffered losses on the swings in asset prices after the vote. If those losses lead to failures and asset liquidations, asset prices could fall precipitously.In general, the weaker the economy, the less able it is to absorb shocks. This is especially true now because interest rates are already low, leaving the Fed little room to boost a faltering economy. This much is clear: By deciding to leave the European Union, Britain has become a major source of uncertainty, not only in Europe but in America as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Is Locking In the Forces That Already Haunt the Global Economy", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsSometimes, something bad happens, and it creates huge financial market swings and long-lasting economic ripples. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an example, as was the 2011 Japanese nuclear disaster.But the so-called Brexit is different.The immediate financial downturn after Britain voted Thursday to leave the European Union resembles the fallout from those disasters. But the other events were largely disconnected from the broader economic currents of their time. They were one-off events, at least in terms of their economic ramifications.What makes Brexit so concerning is that it accentuates and deepens global forces that have been building for years. So far, governments have been unable to limit any of it. And those forces have self-reinforcing, vicious-cycle dimensions that make it a particularly perilous time for the global economy, even though the type of full-scale panic that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 looks unlikely.Britain accounts for less than 4 percent of world G.D.P. Most people on Earth don\u2019t really have a rooting interest in the exact details of the nation\u2019s trade relationship with the rest of Europe. But its decision to leave the European Union is making more powerful six interrelated forces that already weigh on the global economy:And since the Brexit decision, markets are signaling that those forces have become even more energized.The price of oil fell 7.5 percent from Thursday to Monday\u2019s close, despite little reason to think that the British referendum will cause any major changes in, for example, the supply of oil from oil reserves that the nation controls.And bond markets are priced at levels that imply the years ahead will have lower inflation that was priced in before the Brexit news. While high inflation is often seen as the greater threat, in the last few years economists have viewed too-low inflation \u2014 which can discourage spending and investment and make debts more onerous \u2014 as the more pressing concern. In the United States, bond market prices imply that investors now expect annual inflation of 1.37 percent a year through 2026, down from 1.55 percent on Thursday before the vote\u2019s results, a drop of 0.18 of a percentage point; in Germany, the drop was 0.13 of a point and in Japan 0.10 of a point. (The one exception: Britain itself, which will almost certainly see much higher inflation in the coming years because of a drop in its currency.Some of this reflects good health: The United States economy is reasonably strong, with steady growth since 2009 and a 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once and contemplate further moves.Some of the dollar rally reflects a more negative global outlook. The economies of Europe, Japan and many emerging markets have remained exceptionally weak, making the United States look comparatively fantastic. Factor in the United States\u2019 traditional role as the beacon of stability in turbulent times, and American assets look more attractive than their underlying economics would suggest.Most worrisome is that there are some feedback loops between the strong dollar and economic weakness abroad. Many international companies, especially in China and emerging markets, owe debt in dollars, so a stronger dollar makes their debts more onerous and creates spillover economic weakness. And the stronger dollar is undermining American exporters, slowing growth in the United States.Brexit is only accentuating this. The dollar index is up 3 percent since Thursday, most significantly because of the collapse in value of the British pound, but it is also up against the euro.So far it hasn\u2019t been enough to get inflation persistently up to 2 percent or achieve sustained strong growth. And it is an open question if more of the same will change anything, particularly given that the economic challenges emanating from Britain are more because of existential questions of national identity than because of a garden-variety business slowdown.Nonetheless, in the aftermath of Brexit, analysts and financial markets are now pricing in even slower interest rate increases for the Fed and the Bank of England, and a real possibility of yet more easing programs by the E.C.B. and the Bank of Japan.In the two trading days since the Brexit vote, that rate has fallen to 1.44 percent. Other bond markets, including across Europe and in Britain itself, have also experienced falling longer-term rates. Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries even have negative long-term interest rates, meaning a person who buys a bond and holds on to it will lose money.That\u2019s very much related to the decline in investors\u2019 expectations for lower inflation and more central bank activism. But it may also reflect a \u201cfear premium\u201d as investors throw money into anything that seems safe \u2014 even if it means they are guaranteed to lose money.You can have endless debates about the underlying causes. Is this the inevitable result of a lull in productivity growth, a result of bad policy or bad luck, or some mix? Either way, the reality is that the global economy seems locked into lower growth than had been the norm in the decades before 2007.Britain\u2019s E.U. vote raises the risk of further dragging down that growth rate, particularly if there is a prolonged period of uncertainty around the country\u2019s fate or a permanent breakdown in the trade ties that make an economy richer.Brexit is the most recent example, supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. The rise of right-wing nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example, as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States; Jeremy Corbyn in Britain; and the far-left Podemos party in Spain.Of course, less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed. But if nothing else, the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes \u2014 including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy.Again, none of these stand in isolation. Each is deeply related \u2014 either as cause, effect or both. And each has been pushed further by Britain\u2019s choice. Where the cycle ends, and when, no one knows.An Upshot article on Tuesday about the effect Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union could have on the global economy referred incorrectly to the dollar\u2019s performance against the yen between Thursday and Monday. It dropped against the yen; it did not rise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alvin Toffler, Author of \u2018Future Shock,\u2019 Dies at 87", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byAlvin Toffler, the celebrated author of \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d the first in a trilogy of best-selling books that presciently forecast how people and institutions of the late 20th century would contend with the immense strains and soaring opportunities of accelerating change, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 87.Mr. Toffler was a self-trained social science scholar and successful freelance magazine writer in the mid-1960s when he decided to spend five years studying the underlying causes of a cultural upheaval that he saw overtaking the United States and other developed countries.The fruit of his research, \u201cFuture Shock\u201d (1970), sold millions of copies and was translated into dozens of languages, catapulting Mr. Toffler to international fame. It is still in print.In the book, in which he synthesized disparate facts from every corner of the globe, he concluded that the convergence of science, capital and communications was producing such swift change that it was creating an entirely new kind of society.His predictions about the consequences to culture, the family, government and the economy were remarkably accurate. He foresaw the development of cloning, the popularity and influence of personal computers and the invention of the internet, cable television and telecommuting.\u201cThe roaring current of change,\u201d he said, was producing visible and measurable effects in individuals that fractured marriages, overwhelmed families and caused \u201cconfusional breakdowns\u201d manifested in rising crime, drug use and social alienation. He saw these phenomena as very human psychological responses to disorientation and proposed that they were challenging the very structures of communities, institutions and nations.He continued these themes in two successful follow-up books, \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d (1980) and \u201cPowershift\u201d (1990), assisted by his wife, Heidi Toffler, who served as a researcher and editor for the trilogy and was a named co-author in subsequent books. She survives him.Mr. Toffler popularized the phrase \u201cinformation overload.\u201d His warnings could be bleak, cautioning that people and institutions that failed to keep pace with change would face ruin. But he was generally optimistic. He was among the first authors to recognize that knowledge, not labor and raw materials, would become the most important economic resource of advanced societies.Critics were not sure what to make of Mr. Toffler\u2019s literary style or scholarship. Richard R. Lingeman wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Toffler \u201csends flocks of facts and speculation whirling past like birds in a tornado.\u201d In Time magazine, the reviewer R. Z. Sheppard wrote, \u201cToffler\u2019s redundant delivery and overheated prose turned kernels of truth into puffed generalities.\u201dMr. Toffler\u2019s work nevertheless found an eager readership among the general public, on college campuses, in corporate suites and in national governments. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House, met the Tofflers in the 1970s and became close to them. He said \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d had immensely influenced his own thinking and was \u201cone of the great seminal works of our time.\u201dPrime Minister Zhao Ziyang of China convened conferences to discuss \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d in the early 1980s, and in 1985 the book was the No. 2 best seller in China. Only the speeches of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping sold more copies.Mr. Toffler was born in New York on Oct. 4, 1928, and raised in Brooklyn, the only son and elder of two children of Sam and Rose Toffler, immigrants from Poland. His father was a furrier.Alvin began to write poetry and stories soon after learning to read and aspired to be a writer from the time he was 7 years old, he told interviewers. His inspiration, he said, came from an uncle and aunt \u2014 Phil Album, an editor, and Ruth Album, a poet \u2014 who lived with the Tofflers.\u201cThey were Depression-era literary intellectuals,\u201d Mr. Toffler said in an interview for this obituary in 2006, \u201cand they always talked about exciting ideas.\u201dMr. Toffler enrolled in New York University in 1946 and, by his account, spent the next four years only mildly interested in his academic work. He was far more engaged in political activism. In the fall of 1948, during a brief trip home from helping to register black voters in North Carolina, he met Adelaide Elizabeth Farrell, known as Heidi.\u201cI went to Washington Square,\u201d he said, \u201cand as I walked across the park, I saw a girl in one of my classes. And next to her was a gorgeous blonde. We have been inseparable since.\u201dWhere Mr. Toffler was voluble and visionary, Ms. Toffler was cleareyed and direct. Early in 1950, before they were married, she persuaded him to finish his course work at N.Y.U. and graduate with a degree in English.\u201cI barely made it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI paid no attention to credits. In my youthful view I thought, \u2018Who needs ceremony?\u2019 Heidi is far more practical.\u201dBoth shared expansive intellects and the passion to make their lives matter. Like the writers he most admired, Mr. Toffler wanted experiences to report on. \u201cSteinbeck went to pick grapes,\u201d he said. \u201cJack London sailed ships.\u201dThe couple decided to move to Cleveland, then at the very center of industrial America. They were married there on April 29, 1950, by a justice of the peace whom Mr. Toffler described as a \u201croaring drunk.\u201d They lived on the city\u2019s west side and took production jobs in separate factories.Mr. Toffler learned to weld and repair machinery and came to understand in the most personal way the toll that physical labor can have on industrial workers. He broke a vertebra when a steel beam he was helping to unload twisted unexpectedly and fell on him.At night, Mr. Toffler wrote poetry and fiction and discovered he was proficient in neither. But he still aspired to be a writer. In 1954, soon after the birth of the couple\u2019s only child, Karen, he persuaded the editor of Industry and Welding, a national trade magazine published in Cleveland, to hire him as a reporter.Mr. Toffler recalled: \u201cThe editor told me, \u2018You\u2019re getting this job because you know how to weld. Now, show me you know how to write.\u2019\u201dMr. Toffler soon landed a job as a reporter for Labor\u2019s Daily, a national trade newspaper published in Charleston, W.Va., by the International Typographical Union. It sent him to Washington to cover labor news there in 1957.Two years later, he sent Fortune magazine a proposal to write an article about the economics of the growing mainstream interest in the arts. Fortune rejected the idea but invited Mr. Toffler to New York for an interview and hired him as its labor editor and columnist.Besides his wife, Mr. Toffler is survived by a sister, Caroline Sitter. The Tofflers\u2019 daughter died in 2000.But, he added: \u201cWe are not isolated by it. And when the information overloads us, most people are still wise enough to use the power of the \u2018Off\u2019 button to gain some peace.\u201dIn writing \u201cFuture Shock\u201d 46 years ago, Mr. Toffler acknowledged that the future he saw coming might ultimately differ in the details from what actually came to pass.\u201cNo serious futurist deals in \u2018predictions,\u2019\u201d he wrote in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cThese are left for television oracles and newspaper astrologers.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe who explore the future are like those ancient mapmakers, and it is in this spirit that the concept of future shock and the theory of the adaptive range are presented here \u2014 not as final word, but as a first approximation of the new realities, filled with danger and promise, created by the accelerative thrust.\u201dAn obituary on Thursday about the author Alvin Toffler misidentified the reviewer who wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Toffler, in his book \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d \u201csends flocks of facts and speculation whirling past like birds in a tornado.\u201d He is Richard R. Lingeman, not the mechanical engineering scholar and systems theorist Richard W. Longman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Immigration Policies May Cause Trouble Among Independents, Poll Shows", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite intense support among his followers for his proposals for a Mexican border wall and a ban on Muslim immigration, Donald J. Trump will face trouble with independent voters on immigration in the November election, according to a survey published on Thursday by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution, nonpartisan research organizations.Over all, 58 percent of respondents said they opposed a border wall. But among people who said they supported Mr. Trump, 82 percent favored the plan for a wall, reflecting the deep polarization in this election season.Mr. Trump also appears to be out of step with independents and the majority of Americans on his proposal to deport 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally. In the survey, 78 percent of independents \u2014 and the same percentage of Americans over all \u2014 said those immigrants should be allowed to become American citizens or legal residents, while 21 percent favored deportation. Despite the fierce arguments over immigration issues in the presidential campaigns, support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants has not changed since 2013, the survey found.Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on illegal immigration and to restrict the legal flow of people from Muslim countries were enormously popular with voters in the Republican primary. But for the general election, Mr. Trump will have to expand his support to include independents and Democrats attracted to his pledges to rebuild the American economy.Mr. Trump\u2019s positions were \u201ca winning strategy for the Republican primary but are not connected to where the country is as a whole,\u201d said Robert P. Jones, chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, known as PRRI. \u201cIf Trump continues to double and triple down on that message, he may run into a wall with independent voters.\u201dThe survey found that Americans\u2019 views of immigration are not closely tied to their experience with immigrants. Only 22 percent of Americans in the poll said immigrants were having a significant impact on their communities. But about twice as many \u2014 39 percent \u2014 said immigrants were significantly changing the society at large. Among Republicans, while 25 percent said immigrants were changing their communities, 51 percent said immigrants were changing the society.\u201cThe perception differences are more rooted in ideology and partisanship,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Among white Americans who said immigrants were changing the country, nearly six in 10 \u2014 58 percent \u2014 said the change was negative. By contrast, among Hispanic Americans who saw immigrants changing the society, seven in 10 \u2014 or 72 percent \u2014 said the impact was positive.Americans\u2019 views are shaped by increasing fears of terrorism, according to the survey, which was conducted before the massacre in Orlando, Fla., by a gunman pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. Half of Americans \u2014 51 percent \u2014 said they feared that they or a relative could be a victim of an attack, an increase of 18 points since late 2014.Supporters of Mr. Trump are especially likely to be wary of foreign influence in American life, with 83 percent saying that influence needs to be curtailed. The same percentage of Trump supporters say the Islamic faith is at odds with American values, according to the poll.The report is based on a bilingual survey in English and Spanish of 2,607 adults in the United States conducted from April 4 to May 2.

{"Headline": "As Novak Djokovic Shines, Boris Becker Basks in a Rediscovered Glory at His Side", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 An underwhelming television analyst, Boris Becker has turned out to be quite successful at analyzing what makes Novak Djokovic tick.His tennis commentary for the BBC during Wimbledon \u2014 in which, from 2002 to 2013, he was often the master of the self-evident \u2014 was one of the reasons there was considerable skepticism about his ability to impart wisdom to Djokovic when they joined forces in December 2013.But with Djokovic now the reigning champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, the results speak for themselves, which is the way Becker, going against his own grain, seems to prefer it at this stage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about me,\u201d Becker said in a rare extended interview. \u201cI\u2019m very clear about that. I mean I love to talk, as you know. I was a journalist after my tennis career in television, but this is not about me. It\u2019s about Novak. It\u2019s his time to shine.\u201dShine Djokovic has, supernova style. His record since Becker joined his coaching staff to work alongside Marian Vajda is 187-17, with 24 singles titles, six of them Grand Slam crowns. Djokovic\u2019s winning percentage before Becker\u2019s arrival was 80.4 percent. Since Becker\u2019s arrival, it is 91.7 percent.Although it is difficult to determine precisely how much credit Becker deserves (Djokovic also had a fabulous season in 2011, before they teamed up), it is often the marginal improvements that prove decisive at the highest level.\u201cThey took time to feel each other out, but it gels well,\u201d said Roger Rasheed, who has coached Lleyton Hewitt and, most recently, Grigor Dimitrov. \u201cI think Boris has done a great job in understanding Novak and keeping his own personal ego and status out of the way when coaching at all times. It\u2019s a great effort, as some cannot.\u201dBecker, a father of four children, feels the timing was right.\u201cI think I\u2019m a much better coach now at 48 than I would have been at 38, because at 38, it was still a lot about me,\u201d Becker said. \u201cNow, the kids have grown older, so you become a little more mature, a little more about everybody else than you. And I think that gives me an advantage somehow with how I deal with Novak.\u201cMy oldest son is 23. Novak\u2019s 29, and so the difference isn\u2019t that great.\u201dThere have been tactical contributions, too.\u201cI think Boris has added value to what was already a great game of speed, reaction and ability by pushing Novak up on the baseline more, using his great assets in an even stronger way,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cHe has kept challenging Novak to develop and not sit still at No. 1.\u201dProgress was clear during Djokovic\u2019s run to his first French Open title this month. He excelled not only tight to the baseline but in the forecourt, where, on the slide or the run, he was often the triumphant cat to Andy Murray\u2019s mouse in the final.\u201cThere is more forward thinking at bigger moments,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cNovak doesn\u2019t wait. He makes it happen and controls the outcome with more confidence.\u201dBecker was an attacking player in heart and mind on his way to the No. 1 ranking, in 1991, and three Wimbledon singles titles. He also had that boom-boom serve, another sector of the game in which he appears to have made a positive impact on Djokovic. But his emphasis, according to Vajda, has been more on the mental game.\u201cBecause he won six Grand Slam titles, Boris knows exactly what he\u2019s dealing with when it comes to the pressure,\u201d said Vajda, a Slovak who peaked at No. 34 in the singles rankings in 1987.Although Becker and Djokovic generally speak English together, they also communicate in German.\u201cEspecially in the locker room, when other guys are around,\u201d Becker said, chuckling. \u201cIt really helps that his interest is not just tennis. It\u2019s politics. It\u2019s about the economy. It\u2019s about different sports, so it never gets boring. And usually the topics don\u2019t repeat themselves.\u201cIt helps that he speaks a few languages. When you talk to some of the other players, you realize after a 10- or 15-minute conversation that boy, that was long. How do you cover 10 minutes? But with him it never stops, because he\u2019s open-minded and wants to learn and wants to get better, and I think we feed off each other quite well that way.\u201dThere is other common ground. Tennis was front and center in Germany when Becker and Steffi Graf were wunderkinds in the 1980s and \u201990s. Becker, with a big personality to match his big game, was a national obsession, which helps him relate to the even bigger societal role that Djokovic occupies in Serbia.\u201cI think that really helped, that in my early life, my teenager life, I had to deal with Germany,\u201d Becker said. \u201cHis relationship with Serbia is very similar. Unless you\u2019ve experienced it, you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going through when he goes back home. But unless you\u2019d been with me back home, you wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, either.\u201dWhat is clear to many observers, including John McEnroe, is that the arrangement has benefited both parties. Becker, who long appeared to struggle to find his footing in middle age, looks happier and fitter. Hip surgery in 2014 helped, as did a change in diet. So, too, did returning to his natural habitat.\u201cSport was always my life, and obviously, eventually, you have to retire and do something else, and I became a shirt-and-suit guy \u2014 the ties not so much \u2014 but a shirt-and-suit guy,\u201d Becker said. \u201cYou go through different things and challenges, but in my heart I\u2019m a sportsman. I love this sport. I love other sports, and if I can be around young sportsmen and sportswomen, I love that. It refreshes me. It\u2019s good for my soul. It\u2019s good for my body.\u201cI\u2019m 48, but I feel like I\u2019m 28 in many ways because I\u2019m back in a track suit, back on the practice court,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m back with the coaches I used to play as a player, too, and that\u2019s a nice feeling.\u201dThe list has increased in the past month, with Ivan Lendl rejoining Andy Murray\u2019s team and McEnroe, who briefly coached Becker in 1993, joining Milos Raonic\u2019s team for the grass-court season as a consultant.\u201cGreat to see John back in the locker room and on Centre Court,\u201d Becker said. \u201cHis knowledge of the game is second to none. I\u2019m sure it will improve Milos in all areas. Just don\u2019t know about his look on the sidelines. He is always so well-dressed in the commentary booth.\u201dThe booth is one domain where McEnroe, who will continue to do commentary at Wimbledon for the BBC, has an unmistakable edge over his former rival, even if McEnroe does not always grasp that less talk can be more.\u201cSome things are for some people, and some aren\u2019t,\u201d McEnroe said. \u201cI have never heard Boris do commentary in German, so I don\u2019t know. He might have been a different commentator in German, but in English it\u2019s not easy. Maybe he was thinking something different than what came out, and it came out sort of basic, like why is Boris just saying this? But it may have been, to some degree, the language.\u201dFor now, however, Becker is on top of the coaching heap, with Djokovic the first man to hold all four major singles titles since Rod Laver did so in 1969. A true Grand Slam \u2014 winning all four in the same calendar year \u2014 remains possible.\u201cI think this has actually allowed Boris a way in, when his body had broken down and he was sort of off doing other things, and I think ultimately he\u2019s getting more satisfaction out of being part of this,\u201d McEnroe said. \u201cIt was something where at the time they got together you weren\u2019t quite sure, but it turned out to be a win-win for the sport.\u201cNovak\u2019s handled it so well,\u201d he added, \u201cand Boris, the last couple years \u2014 I mean you\u2019ve got to give him credit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Countrywide Mortgage Devastation Lingers as Ex-Chief Moves On", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byFair GameAngelo Mozilo can finally get on with his life.This month the Justice Department told Mr. Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, once the nation\u2019s largest subprime mortgage lender, that he was no longer under investigation in connection with civil mortgage fraud. The government\u2019s criminal inquiry into Mr. Mozilo\u2019s role in the financial crisis was dropped previously, so he is now in the clear.At least that\u2019s the view from Washington. On Main Street, where the pain of Countrywide\u2019s reckless lending and abusive foreclosure practices still throbs, it\u2019s safe to say that Mr. Mozilo is still identified as a major figure in the mortgage crisis.Countrywide, a freewheeling mortgage machine co-founded by Mr. Mozilo and based in Southern California, was at the epicenter of the mortgage meltdown that in 2008 brought the nation\u2019s economy to its knees. Perennially tanned and fond of flashy suits, Mr. Mozilo personified the home-lending good times that ultimately went bad. The decision by the government to close the book on Mr. Mozilo is something of a milestone and a moment to revisit the deeds of the company he co-founded.Mr. Mozilo declined my request for an interview, as he has throughout the nine years I\u2019ve written about Countrywide. His lawyer, David Siegel, emailed this statement, \u201cThe government conducted a professional and thorough investigation of possible civil claims, and we are pleased that it decided to close that investigation without another lawsuit.\u201dEver since his company collapsed in 2007 and was taken over by Bank of America in a fire sale, Mr. Mozilo has steadfastly maintained that neither he nor Countrywide did anything wrong. The operation that he co-founded in 1969 and that made him immensely wealthy simply got caught up in a Force 12 financial gale.Did Countrywide have a role in creating that storm? Not in Mr. Mozilo\u2019s view. On the contrary, his company made America a better place.What about the thousands of loans with exploding interest rates made to unsophisticated borrowers who had no ability to repay them? The abusive foreclosure practices that increased the burden on struggling people? The shattered lives?I asked Mr. Mozilo\u2019s lawyer whether, years later, his client still believed that Countrywide had done nothing wrong.\u201cMr. Mozilo always has been deeply troubled for the many borrowers who played by the rules and who still suffered during the financial crisis, and any implication otherwise would be unfair,\u201d Mr. Siegel said in an interview on Thursday.\u201cHe built Countrywide to help people purchase and stay in homes they could afford, and he was proud of the company\u2019s success in doing that for many years,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.In the last week, I reread and listened to many of the interviews government investigators had with Mr. Mozilo after the financial crisis. In those conversations, Mr. Mozilo maintained that his company had strong ethical standards.Privately, though, he took a more nuanced view, often recognizing missteps or troubling practices in his company\u2019s operations.In an email to a colleague written in April 2006, for example, Mr. Mozilo spoke critically about a situation in which Countrywide had to buy back problem mortgages it had sold to HSBC.\u201cThe loans were originated through our channels with serious disregard for process, compliance with guidelines and irresponsible behavior relative to meeting timelines,\u201d he wrote.And they were not the only ones. Internal documents provided by a former Countrywide employee showed that as early as September 2004, lending audits in six of the company\u2019s largest regions identified one in eight loans as \u201cseverely unsatisfactory\u201d because of poor underwriting. And that was well before the housing boom.Mr. Mozilo certainly succeeded in creating a profit powerhouse at Countrywide, at least for a while. One reason the company\u2019s stock became a highflier is that Countrywide was a vertically integrated mortgage machine, with an array of subsidiaries poised to wring fees from every stage of the lending and loan servicing process.Providing in-house appraisals, property maintenance, insurance and other services meant Countrywide could mark up the costs of its services, sometimes by more than 100 percent, the government found.Such charges were at the heart of a June 2010 case brought by the Federal Trade Commission against the company. The agency\u2019s determination? Countrywide overcharged almost half a million of its customers.The strategy was intended to increase Countrywide earnings from default-related services during an economic downturn, the commission said. In other words, if profits from home loan originations fell, Countrywide could make up for it by increasing the burden on its most troubled customers. A choice statistic from this case: Countrywide charged some borrowers in foreclosure $300 to mow their lawns.\u201cIt is astonishing that one single company could be responsible for overcharging more than 450,000 homeowners, which is more than 1 percent of all the mortgages in the United States,\u201d Jon Leibowitz, then chairman of the trade commission, told me in a 2011 interview after Countrywide settled the case. Its business model was \u201cbased on deceit and corruption, and the harm they caused to American consumers is absolutely massive and extraordinary.\u201dBorrowers weren\u2019t the only ones harmed by Countrywide. The company also ran roughshod over the nation\u2019s bankruptcy court system.Countrywide, the servicer of the Atchleys\u2019 loan, levied improper fees and claimed twice that the borrowers were behind on their mortgage when they were not. Lawyers for Countrywide moved to seize the Atchleys\u2019 property, withdrawing only after the couple proved them wrong in court.\u201cCountrywide\u2019s failure to ensure the accuracy of its pleadings and accounts in this case is not an isolated incident,\u201d Mr. Walton wrote in a brief. \u201cIn recent years, Countrywide and its representatives have been sanctioned for filing inaccurate pleadings and other similar abuses within the bankruptcy system.\u201dIn western Pennsylvania, a court found that the company had fabricated documents related to a borrower\u2019s bankruptcy. The documents, supplied to the court, erroneously claimed that a borrower owed $4,700 for escrow-related costs.In a recent interview, I asked him about Countrywide\u2019s impact on his world. He found a silver lining: The exposure of the company\u2019s practices, he said, helped improve the bankruptcy system for consumers.\u201cThe Atchley case highlighted the abuses and caused the system to be changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system works a little differently now and is a little fairer.\u201dWell, that\u2019s something.Next, I wanted to check in with some former Countrywide borrowers to see where they stood eight years on.\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Mozilo wrote in the message, which quickly ricocheted across the web. \u201cMost of these letters now have the same wording. Obviously they are being counseled by some other person or by the internet. Disgusting.\u201dIn an interview Wednesday, Mr. Bailey said he considered himself very lucky because Bank of America worked out a deal with him to stay in his 900-square-foot bungalow. Nevertheless, it took the better part of seven years, he said.\u201cI lucked out,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cIf I had been any other person, I would be out of my house and living on the street. I\u2019m part of the 0.0001 percent because everybody else this happened to didn\u2019t get that email from Mozilo.\u201d\u201cI spent months on the phone every day trying to get someone to help me sell,\u201d Ms. Connor said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThey ignored us, and every month that went by our indebtedness grew.\u201dIt was only after I asked Countrywide about Ms. Connor\u2019s situation that the company started working with her to sell the house.How is her life today? \u201cI know that I ended up pretty well because I was really lucky and really stubborn on a couple of fronts,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about how many families out there didn\u2019t have the kind of luck and stubbornness that I had.\u201dMs. Connor said she is looking forward to Aug. 20, when the record of her personal bankruptcy will disappear from her credit report.Mr. Mozilo doesn\u2019t have such worries. But he did get dinged by the federal government in one matter: the S.E.C.\u2019s suit, which he settled in October 2010.Regulators contended that Mr. Mozilo and two of his former lieutenants hid growing risks in Countrywide\u2019s operations from investors and generated improper profits on stock sales while aware of Countrywide\u2019s woes.From November 2006 through October 2007, the commission said, Mr. Mozilo generated $140 million in gains on stock he sold.Without admitting or denying the accusations, Mr. Mozilo settled the case and accepted a permanent prohibition on serving as an officer or director of a public company. He paid $67.5 million to the government, $45 million of which was covered by Countrywide and Bank of America.The roughly $22 million Mr. Mozilo personally paid pales in comparison with the gains he reaped from Countrywide stock over the years.And that doesn\u2019t even begin to compare with the money Bank of America doled out, first to acquire Countrywide for $4 billion, and then more than $50 billion in fines and settlements with the government over mortgage abuses, though, in fairness, not all of it was because of Countrywide.Finally, I asked Mr. Siegel whether Mr. Mozilo believed he had been held to account for Countrywide\u2019s actions. \u201cThere were many lawsuits and government investigations,\u201d he replied in a statement. \u201cWe prevailed in those that reached final decisions, a number were settled (including the S.E.C.\u2019s lawsuit), and the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation closed without further claims.\u201dStill, there is an overarching failure that Mr. Mozilo cannot deny.In a November 2007 deposition with the S.E.C., he was asked to describe his responsibilities as the chief executive of Countrywide. \u201cThe primary responsibility\u201d he said, \u201cis make sure the company is O.K., that it\u2019s maintained its financial integrity and its reputational integrity.\u201dClearly, he flunked those three tasks. And even in Mozilo world, that\u2019s still got to smart.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Trump and Boris Johnson: Is this how the era ushered in by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher finally ends?It once looked as though the financial crisis of 2008 might even bring about the end of laissez-faire economics. \u201cThe idea of an all-powerful market which is always right is finished,\u201d declared Nicolas Sarkozy, then the president of France. And Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, Germany\u2019s finance minister at the time, predicted that \u201cthe U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system.\u201dBut I suspect few would have guessed that the economic order built on Reagan\u2019s and Thatcher\u2019s common faith in unfettered global markets (and largely accepted by their more liberal successors Bill Clinton and Tony Blair) would be brought down by right-wing populists riding the anger of a working class that has been cast aside in the globalized economy that the two leaders trumpeted 40 years ago.Britons\u2019 vote last week to exit the European Union was not simply about their idiosyncratic distaste for all things European \u2014 an aversion shared by Thatcher, who saw Brussels as the kind of meddlesome big government she loathed. Brussels was merely a stand-in for something deeper: the very globalization that Thatcher as Britain\u2019s prime minister so enthusiastically promoted.The so-called Brexit vote was driven by an inchoate sense among older white workers with modest education that they have been passed over, condemned by forces beyond their control to an uncertain job for little pay in a world where their livelihoods are challenged not just by cheap Asian workers halfway around the world, but closer to home by waves of immigrants of different faiths and skin tones.Their frustration is turning traditional ideological labels on their heads. Mr. Trump, a bombastic businessman who\u2019s never held office, and Mr. Johnson, the former journalist turned mayor of London, might not put it this way, since they continue to cling to a conservative mantle. But they are riding a revolt of the working class against a 40-year-long project of the political right and its corporate backers that has dominated policy making in the English-speaking world for a generation.So where does capitalism go now? What can replace a consensus built by a charismatic American president and a bull-in-a-china-shop British prime minister in favor of small governments and unrestrained markets around the world?The British political scientist Andrew Gamble at the University of Cambridge has argued that Western capitalism has experienced two transformational crises since the end of the 19th century. The first, brought about by the Depression of the 1930s, ended an era in which governments bowed to the gospel of the gold standard and were expected to butt out of the battles between labor and capital, letting markets function on their own, whatever the consequences.In his 2010 book, \u201cCapitalism 4.0,\u201d the London-based economic commentator Anatole Kaletsky refers to a document in the archive of the British Treasury that shows the reaction of the permanent secretary to a proposal by the great economist John Maynard Keynes to use government spending to spur Britain\u2019s economy. It has three words: \u201cExtravagance, Inflation, Bankruptcy.\u201dMr. Keynes\u2019s views ultimately prevailed, though, providing the basis for a new post-World War II orthodoxy favoring active government intervention in the economy and a robust welfare state. But that era ended when skyrocketing oil prices and economic mismanagement in the 1970s brought about a combination of inflation and unemployment that fatally undermined people\u2019s trust in the state.Even the former president of France Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u2014 a Socialist who nationalized the banking system, increased government employment and raised public-sector pay after being elected in 1981 \u2014 was forced into a U-turn. In 1983, he froze the budget and brought about \u201cla rigueur\u201d: the austerity.The Keynesian era ended when Thatcher and Reagan rode onto the scene with a version of capitalism based on tax cuts, privatization and deregulation that helped revive their engines of growth but led the workers of the world to the deeply frustrating, increasingly unequal economy of today.There are potentially constructive approaches to set the world economy on a more promising path. For starters, what about taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to tap the world\u2019s excess funds to build and repair a fraying public infrastructure? That would employ legions of blue-collar workers and help increase economic growth, which has been only inching ahead across much of the industrialized world.There is, however, little evidence that the world\u2019s leaders will go down that path. Despite the case for economic stimulus, austerity still rules across much of the West. In Europe, most governments have imposed stringent budget cuts \u2014 ensuring that all but the strongest economies would stall. In the United States, political polarization has brought fiscal policy \u2014 spending and taxes \u2014 to a standstill.The cost of inaction could be enormous. Mr. Johnson\u2019s campaign to reject British membership of the European Union is already producing political and economic shock waves around the world. Mr. Trump \u2014 whose solutions include punishing China with high tariffs and building a wall with Mexico \u2014 is trying to ride workers\u2019 angst into the most powerful job in the world.There are less catastrophic ways to put an end to an era.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s partly because the referendum has mostly become about national sovereignty and curbing immigration. A country in the European Union has little control over the movement of people between other countries in the union. The British have long been concerned about this freedom, and the \u201cleave\u201d campaign has focused on those worries.Still, the extent to which the economic question has taken a back seat is surprising.True, voters are sometimes willing to accept some economic pain to achieve other goals they consider important. A stark example: In the lead-up to the Iraq war that began in 2003, most people said they expected the economy to suffer even as they strongly supported going to war.Over all, 49 percent of respondents said a recession was likely, and 48 percent said unlikely. That suggests there was enough economic fear circulating to benefit the \u201cremain\u201d camp.Still, other polls suggest the British people are not particularly nervous about the economic impact. In a recent YouGov poll, 37 percent of people said Britain would be worse off if it left the E.U., while 22 percent said the country would be better off. But 26 percent said it would make no difference to the economy. In other words, almost half the respondents thought the economy would be better or no different. (In this poll, 15 percent were \u201cdon\u2019t knows.\u201d)Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dCertainly, there appear to be big contradictions in the minds of the \u201cleave\u201d camp when it comes to economic questions. Britain relies heavily on immigrants, so restricting immigration could hurt the economy. And leaving the European Union might also reduce British companies\u2019 access to an enormous trade area.But what about Brexit\u2019s threat to trade? Voters may simply find it hard to gauge the importance of trade agreements. Or they may believe that the European Union would seek to maintain most of the current trade arrangements, rather than taking a sharply retaliatory line. That\u2019s not a crazy expectation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Africa\u2019s Charcoal Economy Is Cooking. The Trees Are Paying.", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byTOLIARA, Madagascar \u2014 When Julien Andrianiana started selling charcoal 14 years ago, he was just one of a few dealers around. Most households in Toliara, a coastal city in southwestern Madagascar, still used firewood for cooking.As the city\u2019s population doubled, business became so brisk that he managed to send two of his children to college, \u201cthanks to charcoal.\u201d It quickly became the product of choice in kitchens not only in Toliara, but also in other fast-growing cities across Africa.Charcoal \u2014 cleaner and easier to use than firewood, cheaper and more readily available than gas or electricity \u2014 has become one of the biggest engines of Africa\u2019s informal economy. But it has also become one of the greatest threats to its environment.In Madagascar, an island nation off the eastern African coast and one of the world\u2019s richest nations in biodiversity, the booming charcoal business is contributing to deforestation. It is expected to exacerbate the effects of climate change, which has already disrupted farming, fueled a migration to cities, and pushed many rural residents into the one thriving business left: charcoal.Sellers now appear on street corners throughout Toliara, hawking charcoal made from trees from the surrounding forests, an ecologically rich and fragile area with plants and animals found nowhere else. Throughout the day, their supplies are replenished by pickup trucks and convoys of ox-drawn carts.But acquiring high-quality charcoal made from hardwood trees has become increasingly difficult for dealers like Mr. Andrianiana, 44, as a third straight year of drought has pushed ever more people into the charcoal trade. He now wakes up at 3 a.m. and rides his bicycle an hour north to try to strike deals with charcoal producers before his competitors do.\u201cMost of the trees have been cut down,\u201d he said recently, hours after securing only 60 bags of charcoal, below his daily average of 80. \u201cWithin five years, all the trees will be gone.\u201dTrees have been disappearing in a widening arc from Toliara in the past decade. As charcoal producers first culled trees in forests closest to Toliara, leaving villages surrounded only by thickets, the business has shifted to remote areas about 100 miles away, accessible by dirt roads and sometimes waterways.\u201cIt rains less and less nowadays,\u201d he said as white smoke rose from the dirt kiln in which he was making charcoal by burning the tamarind wood without oxygen. \u201cThat\u2019s why I started making charcoal. No one\u2019s going to help me, and this is the quickest way to make money.\u201dIn a poor neighborhood in Toliara one recent evening, housewives sat on stools outside their homes, keeping watch over pots on charcoal stoves. Monira Ferdinand, a 32-year-old mother of four who was preparing lentil soup, said she had used firewood back in her village, but the smoke would sting her eyes and the fire required constant fanning.\u201cThe good quality charcoal lasts twice as long,\u201d Ms. Ferdinand said. \u201cAnd with the cheap stuff, it\u2019ll die out if there\u2019s even a little wind.\u201dThe charcoal business, along with the expanding use of land for farming, is expected to increase deforestation and worsen the effects of climate change on a continent poorly equipped to adapt to it.Randria Zigzag, the government official responsible for overseeing zones of intensive charcoal production near Toliara, said 45 percent was illegal. He said police officers at checkpoints on the road to Toliara should confiscate contraband charcoal being transported by unlicensed producers.\u201cBut that\u2019s not how things work in Madagascar,\u201d Mr. Zigzag said. \u201cIn Madagascar, if you have money, you give money and you do what you want. The charcoal producers give money to police officers, who then tell them, \u2018Go, go, go!\u2019\u201dPeople have gravitated to cities, like Toliara, where the population has risen by 50 percent in the past two decades to around 120,000, said Col. Jules Rabe, the chief administrator of the Toliara region. In a self-reinforcing movement, the migration to the cities has led to a greater demand for charcoal from rural areas.In Antevamena, a village of cassava and corn farmers about 80 miles by road from Toliara, poor harvests have pushed more and more people into the charcoal economy as tree cutters, charcoal burners, transporters, middlemen, agents and financiers.One farmer, Jackot Brula, 23, moonlights as a speculator, buying directly from the charbonniers in the surrounding forests and selling to agents based in Antevamena. He typically makes a 15-cent profit on each 110-pound bag of charcoal.Hundreds of bags of charcoal in the village center were waiting to be collected by four agents working for the network\u2019s financier, a woman whom villagers identified as a Madame Bijoux.Madame Bijoux, or Bijoux Ravaofotsy, says she ships her charcoal to a town near Toliara, where it is transported to the city.She entered the business four years ago after losing customers at the refreshment stand she still runs along the main road. A competitor across the street had bought rooftop solar panels to power a refrigerator, bringing the novelty of cold drinks to her town, which is not connected to the national grid.\u201cPeople have become picky now,\u201d she said, adding that, unable to afford solar panels herself, she went into charcoal instead. \u201cThe demand for charcoal is big.\u201dThings were far different in Befoly, a village not far from Toliara. Befoly supplied Toliara with charcoal until it ran out of trees.\u201cEverybody was involved in the charcoal business,\u201d said Reginike Faralahy, 26, a former charbonnier who, in the boom years, made so much money that he was able to invest in goats and chickens. More than 20 other former charbonniers had left the village, some to work as petty traders in Toliara, he said.The village chief, Evomasy, 48, said he believed that the trees\u2019 disappearance had caused the recent severe droughts.\u201cWe cut down everything,\u201d he said, looking at the shrub land now surrounding his village. \u201cWe used to have trees all around us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re too bloody soft!\u201dPaddy Ashdown, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats and a supporter of remaining in the European Union in the vote next Thursday, shook his head and responded with a touch of bitterness: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve not seen much evidence of that here.\u201dIf Britain votes to leave, it will be in large part because of strong anti-Europe sentiment in much of England, the heart of the movement to divorce Britain from the Continent. Pollsters and analysts say that while Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to vote overwhelmingly to stay in the bloc, England, far more populous, is likely to go the other way, reflecting a broad and often bluntly expressed view that English identity and values are being washed away by subordination to the bureaucrats of Brussels.South Benfleet is a suburban and largely working-class town in the Castle Point district of Essex, full of people who have made it out of London\u2019s tough East End to a kind of English paradise with lots of single-family homes, lawns, beaches, seaside amusement parks and fish-and-chip shops.The people here are fiercely English, fiercely Conservative and fiercely pro-Brexit, as the possible exit is being called, and many feel that their sovereignty and identity are being diluted by a failing European Union and an \u201cuncontrolled\u201d influx of foreigners.Their nationalism is proving to be a key part of the exit debate. It embodies national pride, nostalgia and a sense that something precious to these islands is being destroyed by the many European Union citizens who, allowed by the bloc\u2019s rules to move to any member nation without a visa, have come to Britain to live and work, attracted by a vibrant economy and jobs.\u201cPeople here are self-reliant and very hardheaded, and they have sacrificed for our independence and want to retain it,\u201d said Bob Spink, a former Conservative member of Parliament from Essex who was an early supporter of a British exit. He compared Essex, which is often the butt of \u201cdumb blonde\u201d jokes in the rest of Britain, to Texas.The first legislator to defect to the anti-immigration, anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, back in 2007, Mr. Spink quit the Tories because he wanted a referendum on leaving the European Union. While he lost his seat in 2010 to Rebecca Harris, a Conservative, he still speaks for many here.\u201cPeople want to vote for the people who make our laws and set our taxes; they want to talk to them and be able to throw them out; and they don\u2019t want to give up sovereignty, independence and democracy to Brussels at any price,\u201d he said.England makes up about 85 percent of Britain\u2019s population, and so dominates. But the English identity, while subsumed into the British one, is not entirely the same, drawing as it does on its own rich history and deeply embedded political and cultural traditions. In particular, the English are considerably less willing than their fellow Britons in Scotland and Northern Ireland to see themselves as a subset of Europe \u2014 there is more nativism and more \u201cLittle England\u201d nationalism, which can veer into xenophobia.\u201cThe campaign seems hardly about Europe at all, but it\u2019s all about us and the English identity,\u201d Professor Tombs said. \u201cThere is a deep-seated sense that we the people ought to make decisions and not be led by an elite and not be told what to do by foreigners, even by the ones we like, like Obama, and there is a stubborn resistance to parades of international institutions telling us how to vote.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe working class feels that it is slipping behind, people here said, and construction jobs that used to be theirs in London are now going to skilled European immigrants who work more cheaply. \u201cPeople say to me that \u2018we have to control the numbers to protect what we have,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThey say, \u2018We\u2019re a tiny nation and we\u2019re full, Rebecca, we\u2019re full.\u2019 And there\u2019s anger that Europe wouldn\u2019t let us agree to have more control over who comes, that there\u2019s a loss of control.\u201dDavid Manclark, 58, who attended the Brexit debate in South Benfleet, said that \u201ca lot of people feel exiled in their own country.\u201d Around here, he said, \u201cwe feel we need to be able to control our own borders and bring in the people we need.\u201dRobert Baron, 67, said: \u201cIt\u2019s being British.

He runs a real estate agency with 30 employees. \u201cThink of the shock Brexit would create,\u201d he said. \u201cMortgage rates would rise and prices drop, and all the good work of the last few years would go to waste.\u201dThough he said he felt British and \u201cnot particularly European,\u201d Mr. MacLean added: \u201cBut I like the privileges E.U. membership brings.

But both think that despite the tide of opinion in Essex, Mr. Cameron and other proponents of staying in Europe will eke out a victory.

{"Headline": "Separated at Birth", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byWhat is the most striking consequence of deepening income inequality? Could it be the rise of social immobility?that 60 percent of those born into a bottom-quintile family will themselves be in the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution at age forty, and that 56 percent of those born into a top-quintile family will be in the top two quintiles of the distribution at age forty.If we focus just on the least well off, the United States today is moving toward \u201cincreasing inequality of opportunity,\u201d with the gains over the past several decades for those in the bottom of the income distribution modest, at best, or non-existent.Katharine Bradbury and Robert Triest, economists at the Federal Reserve in Boston who are the editors of the report, which is called \u201cOpportunity, Mobility, and Increased Inequality,\u201d argue that when inequality of outcome stems from entrepreneurship and \u201cdifferences in work effort,\u201d the increase in inequality is justified and that therefore \u201cno remedial changes in public policy are needed.\u201dIf, however,the increase in inequality results mostly from factors largely beyond the ability of individuals to control or counteract, then a strong case can be made for a public policy response.Bradbury, Triest and other contributors to the report argue that inequality of opportunity stemming from \u201can individual\u2019s innate characteristics and the circumstances of birth and early environment\u201d isgenerally regarded much more negatively than inequality of economic outcomes, because it is associated with characteristics and circumstances that are beyond an individual\u2019s ability to control.At least half of all bottom-quintile children who were African American, whose parents did not finish high school, or who grew up with a never-married mother, remained in the bottom quintile as adults. Three-quarters or more (74, 78, and 80 percent, respectively) ended up in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution as adults, thereby failing to realize the American dream.In an email follow-up, Smeeding wrote thatif you start in the bottom quintile, race matters; but also it is a single parent issue and it is a high school dropout \u2013 or \u201cless than high school\u201d \u2014 issue: children who start in the bottom quintile and grow up in each type of family end up stacked at the bottom of the distribution when they get older.Further contributing to circumstances over which individuals have no control are unequal inheritances. Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, points out that the mean inheritance of children in the bottom 50 percent is just under $8,000 while those in the top 5 percent inherit a mean of more than $500,000.Smeeding notes that an absence of financial resources is \u201chighly correlated with housing insecurity and behavioral problems in children, especially boys.\u201dDuncan and Murnane make the case that the ability of the affluent to invest in their children has contributed to the \u201cgrowth in the income-based gaps in children\u2019s reading and mathematics achievement\u201d which, in turn, has \u201ccontributed to a growing gap in the rate of college completion.\u201d The two authors also document the growing disparity of parental financial investment in \u201cchild-enrichment goods and services.\u201d In 1972-73high-income families spent about $2,850 more per year per child on child enrichment than low-income families did. By the 2005\u20132006 school year, this gap had nearly tripled, to $8,000in inflation-adjusted dollars. While several of the Russell Sage authors cite the success of a few specialized education programs in raising the academic achievement levels of low-income students, the report suggests that given unequal circumstances at birth, over which children have no control, traditional schooling may be aggravating pre-existing disadvantage.Two report authors, Isabel Sawhill and Richard Reeves, both of Brookings, found that:among children born of normal birth weight to married mothers who were not poor and had at least a high school education at the time of their child\u2019s birth (advantaged-at-birth), 66 percent can be expected to be ready to start kindergarten, versus only 46 percent otherwise. This gap never narrows.In the late 1960s, test scores in reading of low-income children lagged behind those of their better-off peers by four-fifths of a standard deviation \u2014 about 80 points on an SAT-type test. Forty years later, this gap was 50 percent larger, amounting to nearly 125 SAT-type points.Bradbury and Triest, the Boston Federal Reserve economists, follow up by drawing attention to the inexorable disadvantages accruing to already disadvantaged kids:A 40 percentage-point gap in college enrollment of students born in the early 1960s between poorest-quartile and richest-quartile students expanded to a 51 point gap for the later cohort; similarly, the earlier cohort\u2019s 31 point gap in college completion between rich and poor grew to a 45 point gap for the later cohort.Bradbury and Triest put forward a bleak assessment of the options available to young people born into the poorest families, even children who possess considerable native gifts:A key question is whether primary schools, once children come under their care, level the playing field and reduce these disparities. Most research findings suggest that they do not.Not only do \u201cchildren of affluent parents graduate from college at substantially higher rates than children of low-income parents,\u201d according to Bradbury and Triest, \u201cthe gap persists even when controlling for ability in the form of test scores.\u201dThey cite data showing thata child\u2019s earnings in adulthood reflect parental investments in his/her human capital (education) as well as his/her endowment of earnings capacity and market luck. That endowment, in turn, is determined by the reputation and \u201cconnections\u201d of their families, the contribution to the ability, race, and other characteristics of children from the genetic constitutions of their families, and the learning, skills, goals, and other \u201cfamily commodities\u201d acquired through belonging to a particular family culture.Four key factors or mechanisms of intergenerational earnings persistence \u201cthat are related to family incomes and that have a return\u201d in the labor market play an outsize role in determining the fate of American children, according to studies cited by Bradbury and Triest: \u201cnoncognitive skills, cognitive ability, early labor market experiences, and educational attainment.\u201dSmeeding notes thatlow incomes have a well-established negative impact on brain development, social-emotional development, and lifelong outcomes.But, he continues,a little more money makes a big difference to children on the bottom rungs of the ladder.The benefits of the Earned-income tax credit, the Child Tax Credit and the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (food stamps), Smeeding writes,lead to better outcomes for children and parents, especially positive longer-term developmental effects on low-income children.These resources are distributed \u2014 increased, diminished and otherwise tweaked \u2014 through political processes, over which by definition children are powerless.Sawhill and Reeves cite impressive gains from a five-stage program of intensive and sustained intervention with poor children and adolescents. These range from \u201cbiweekly home visits and group meetings to instruct and equip parents to be effective teachers for their children\u201d during infancy to a \u201ccomprehensive high school reform initiative aimed at reducing student dropout rates.\u201d Children whose parents are positioned, materially and psychologically, to take advantage of such interventions are fortunate, but the children themselves have no control over access to these resources.Sawhill and Reeves write that the benefits of these interventions exceed the costs:The baseline 20 percentage point gap in the share of low-income and high-income children reaching middle class by middle age shrinks to 6 percentage points after the multi-stage intervention.In their essay, Duncan and Murnane cite three \u201cinnovative, quite durable programs\u201d \u2014 the Boston pre-K program, the campuses of the University of Chicago charter school and New York City\u2019s small high schools of choice \u2014 that provide \u201cproofs that it is possible to improve the education of substantial numbers of low-income children.\u201d But these successful programs are available to a vanishingly small proportion of the poorest children nationwide.The Russell Sage report, despite presenting some good news, highlights an unresolved dilemma: Are there economic forces at work that are inexorably worsening equality of opportunity regardless of government intervention?Bradbury and Triest implicitly raise this issue when they point out thatNations or eras with greater disparities in pay levels according to educational attainment will, other things equal, have higher intergenerational earnings elasticities, hence, lower mobility, because any level of intergenerational correlation in education translates into greater differences in earnings and, hence, higher correlation of parent and child earnings.In other words, the economy, by increasing the wage premium for high skill jobs requiring college degrees or more, is working to exacerbate the problems documented in the Russell Sage report.To take this a step further, not only do advocates of strong intervention face opposition from conservative domination of state and, increasingly, local government, they also face economic forces that have proven phenomenally difficult to turn in a more favorable direction.Frustration over the failure to remediate the dire, even gruesome, situation of those toward the bottom of the American economic order \u2014 and resentment against the elites who have allowed this situation to persist \u2014 has clearly provided much of the momentum behind the campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton has tried to address this frustration with mixed success. How she deals with this problem during the general election campaign will help determine not only whether she can win the presidency but how much power she will have to execute an anti-poverty agenda if she does.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is \u2018Brexit\u2019 Europe\u2019s Lehman Brothers Moment?", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byAftershocksIs this another Lehman Brothers moment?The short answer is \u201cno.\u201dThe long answer is \u201cno, but.\u201dLehman was a financial event with long-lasting geopolitical consequences. \u201cBrexit\u201d is a geopolitical event that may or may not turn out to have long-lasting financial consequences.The most fundamental similarity between Britain\u2019s vote and the Lehman failure is that both were deep shocks to markets and upended the understanding that investors, banks and policy makers had about the way the world worked.In 2008, the widespread view was that the United States government would not allow a large, interconnected financial firm to go bankrupt, and that Lehman would be bailed out just as Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae were. In 2016, the assumption was that while Britain might threaten to leave the European Union, its voters would never actually choose such a disruptive path.So in both cases, an event prompted a reordering of what we thought was plausible. In 2008 it went like this: If the United States would let Lehman fail, could Goldman Sachs and Citigroup be the next dominoes to fall? If an investment bank like Lehman could default, could any financial firm really be trusted?And Lehman Brothers had $619 billion in liabilities, which by definition were somebody else\u2019s assets. Who knew for sure what other banks were sitting on huge losses from Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy that would make them insolvent?Against that backdrop, banks globally hoarded cash and became highly reluctant to lend to anyone. It was a modern version of a bank run.There are few signs any of that is happening in response to Brexit. European bank stocks have fallen sharply since the June 23 vote. They\u2019ve actually fallen by a larger percentage than during the first three trading days after the Lehman declaration. But nothing in the bank lending markets suggests widespread panic.In the three trading days after the Lehman bankruptcy announcement, the premium banks charged to lend to one another in dollars rose by about half a percentage point. A comparable measure of the health of the British banking system has risen only 0.08 percent since Brexit, and actually was down Tuesday. The spread has risen even less in euro-denominated bank lending.That\u2019s good news. It suggests investors think that profits by banks will get hammered by Brexit \u2014 but not that this will endanger their very solvency.Banks may be facing huge costs as they weigh whether to relocate operations from London to continental Europe. Investors will find uncertainty around their businesses and leaner profits as central banks potentially cut interest rates further. But collectively, it appears that investors believe that banks will weather the storm, or at least that governments won\u2019t let them fail.So the mechanisms of financial contagion that turned the collapse of the fourth-largest American investment bank into a global crisis just don\u2019t seem to be gearing up. And that is reflected even in the most widely followed markets. Yes, the British pound is down sharply on currency markets. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is down only 4.5 percent, and is still above its levels from as recently as March.But if financial contagion doesn\u2019t appear to be a grave threat, political contagion does.The modern global economy is built on the notion of a free flow of trade, capital and people among the major advanced nations of Europe, North America and Asia. The European Union has been a key vehicle through which that modern order has evolved.Britain\u2019s E.U. exit won\u2019t by itself change that, and even British advocates of leaving the trading bloc say that they want continued good relations, trade and otherwise, with Europe. Things might work out just fine, with perhaps a more inward-focused Britain but no other major changes to this global financial and economic order.But if this is just a first step toward raising much higher walls between the major powers of Europe \u2014 if countries like France, Spain, Italy and even Germany retreat inward and build distrust that rips at that order?It will make Lehman seem like a historical asterisk.In September 2008, no one predicted that the Lehman bankruptcy could lead to a Greek sovereign debt crisis that would halt half a century of progress toward European unity. The risk with Brexit is, similarly, not in the consequences we know, but in the ones that we don\u2019t know.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenneth Axelson, Who Troubleshot New York City\u2019s Fiscal Crisis, Dies at 93", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byKenneth S. Axelson, a J. C. Penney executive who was foisted on New York City Hall as a deputy mayor during the 1975 fiscal crisis to restore integrity to the city\u2019s extravagant budget, and who left after a year with his goal largely accomplished, died on May 23 in Rockport, Me. He was 93.The cause was chronic kidney failure, his son Stephen said this week.Mr. Axelson, at the time a senior vice president for finance and administration at the department-store chain, was enlisted by Mayor Abraham D. Beame at the urging of Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York and the bankers and other bondholders who had precipitated the crisis by refusing the city\u2019s routine request to borrow more money.As the first deputy mayor for finance, Mr. Axelson profoundly influenced the administration\u2019s grudging response to what Mayor Beame himself acknowledged were years of \u201cfiscal gymnastics\u201d that had burdened the city with a $3.3 billion cumulative deficit. The annual operating budget then was about $12 billion.When Mr. Axelson returned to the private sector in 1976, Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created to borrow on the city\u2019s behalf, said Mr. Axelson had \u201cprovided a level of integrity to the city\u2019s numbers, and a degree of trust, that was unparalleled.\u201dMr. Rohatyn was the public face of the administration\u2019s outside monitors, state appointees who had imposed a fiscal recovery plan and were charged with ensuring that the city did not deviate from it. In contrast, Mr. Axelson operated from within city government to verify that every budget submitted to the monitors adhered to predetermined spending levels.In an interview on Friday, Eugene Keilin, a former special assistant to Mr. Axelson and later a successor to Mr. Rohatyn at the assistance corporation, called Mr. Axelson an architect of the city\u2019s recovery. Mr. Axelson, he said, helped put the city on a trajectory toward eliminating its deficit, adopting a balanced budget in three years, and restoring self-government sooner than anticipated.\u201cWe had a dry run on the night and morning of Oct. 16 and 17, and that experience scared the devil out of all of us,\u201d Mr. Axelson told the City Club of New York in November 1975. \u201cIt suddenly comes cracking down how disastrous and how uncertain it all is.\u201dJ. C. Penney had lent him to the city as a deputy mayor making $1 a year, but he retained his $188,000 company salary, well over what the other three deputies were making combined.Mr. Axelson dealt mostly behind the scenes as a fiscal hard-liner. Sometimes he served as a foil for Mr. Beame, fending off politically potent supplicants and accusing semi-independent agencies of foot-dragging in imposing economies. He also warned New Yorkers that further retrenchment was necessary to obtain federal loan guarantees, darkly invoking the administration of President Gerald R. Ford, which had resisted aiding the city.The city, he predicted, \u201cwill develop an expertise in how to contract, which will be a new skill in New York.\u201dMr. Axelson negotiated with organized labor and with the fiscal monitors. He prodded the mayor to pare the municipal payroll, ratify contracts financed by productivity improvements, raise taxes and sacrifice sacred cows, including free tuition at the City University of New York and the 35-cent subway fare.Perhaps most enduringly, he instilled a degree of professional rigor and transparency in the city\u2019s accounting practices; today, strict accounting rules are in place to prevent such a crisis from recurring.Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp, said his fiscal-crisis epiphany occurred when he asked Mr. Cavanagh how many people the city employed. Mr. Cavanagh fished a slip of paper from his pocket, Mr. Wriston recalled, and said, \u201c397,402 \u2014 or something like that.\u201d But Jac Friedgut, a Citicorp economist who was present, noticed that the paper was blank.\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew we were in trouble,\u201d Mr. Wriston said.Kenneth Strong Axelson was born in Chicago on July 31, 1922, the son of Charles F. Axelson, an insurance agent, and the former Katherine Strong.Drafted into the Army during World War II, he was shifted out of his original unit and assigned to audit procurement contracts. He later learned that the outfit had almost been wiped out in Belgium.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from the University of Chicago, where he also received a master\u2019s degree. After studying to be a certified public accountant at DePaul University, he worked for the big accounting firms Arthur Andersen & Co. and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. before joining J.C. Penney in 1963.At Penney he was executive vice president, director of finance and public affairs, a board member and a member of the four-person office of the chairman. By the time he retired in 1981, he had helped the company expand to more than 2,000 stores.Mr. Axelson also served as chairman of the Fund for the City of New York.His wife, the former Roberta Bearhope, died in 2011. In addition to his son Stephen, he is survived by three other sons, Kenneth Jr., Jerrold and Chris; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.He denied any wrongdoing and was cleared by federal investigators and by the company.In his stint at City Hall, Mr. Axelson experienced culture shock as a corporate accountant thrust into a world where budgets were at the mercy of electoral politics. Preconceptions vanished when he was confronted with the reality of running a government, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve found that a great change took place in New York City on Sept. 16, the day I became deputy mayor,\u201d Mr. Axelson said in the City Club speech. \u201cBefore that day, I had all the solutions to the city\u2019s problems. But in the two months since then, things have gotten much more complicated, because I find I don\u2019t have all the answers any more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Pushes Back Against U.S. Complaints of Industrial Overcapacity", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese finance minister jabbed back on Monday at complaints from his American counterpart that China\u2019s glut of factories making mountains of steel, aluminum and other products was overwhelming foreign markets and makers.\u201cAt that time, the whole world applauded and thanked China,\u201d Mr. Lou told a news briefing near the end of a day of annual meetings in Beijing between senior Chinese and American officials. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying that China has a production glut that is a drag upon the world. But what did they say at the time?\u201dMr. Lou was responding to questions about the Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who has complained that China\u2019s huge surpluses were being sold so cheaply on international markets that they were distorting the global economy.\u201cThe United States supports efforts to reduce excess capacity and leverage in the economy,\u201d Mr. Lew said at the opening session of the talks, called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, held this year on the grounds of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.\u201cExcess capacity has a distorting and damaging effect on global markets,\u201d he said. He added that defusing the problem was \u201ccritical to the function and stability of international markets.\u201dThe talks, set to end on Tuesday, also cover foreign policy and international security tensions, such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and China\u2019s territorial disputes with neighbors in the South China Sea. There was no sign of either side shifting its position in those disputes in the meeting\u2019s opening remarks by President Xi Jinping and Secretary of State John Kerry.But Mr. Kerry said the annual talks, which started in a smaller form a decade ago, remained \u201cone of the best opportunities that we have to discuss our differences and to seek creative ways to narrow them or to eliminate them altogether.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China\u2019s exports of cut-price steel, aluminum and other products have become a contentious international issue, prompting anti-dumping tariffs and feeding into the American presidential race. Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued in their campaigns that blue-collar workers have lost jobs because of skewed trading rules.This year, the Department of Commerce began putting heavy tariffs on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost.Mr. Lou (pronounced \u201clow\u201d) said there was nothing wrong with Mr. Lew raising the excess capacity problem in the talks. But he suggested that Mr. Lew had his eyes on critics back in the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re under pressure domestically,\u201d he said.The Communist Party leadership fears that sweeping industrial closings could kindle widespread worker protests like those that erupted in several northeastern rust belt cities in 2002.Mr. Lou also told reporters that the Chinese government had no estimate of the numbers of workers who would have to be laid off from steel mills, mines and other industrial plants as part of that growth program. A labor official said this year that cutbacks in the steel and coal sectors alone could lead to layoffs of 1.8 million workers.Mr. Lou declined to offer his own figure, citing as one example the number of factories in private hands, which tend to have fewer workers than China\u2019s state-owned mills. The government cannot control the economy through central planning in the way it once did, Mr. Lou said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very hard to estimate how many people you reduce if you reduce steel production by 10,000 tons.\u201dBut Scott Kennedy, a researcher on Chinese economy policy, said at a presentation in Beijing that the hand of the state still meddled too much in deciding winners and losers in sectors ranging from new technologies to improving the environment.The result was \u201cinefficient growth,\u201d Mr. Kennedy, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in presenting a new report about China\u2019s latest five-year economic growth plan.\u201cThere is a lot of genuflecting to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you get to the reality the plan is far less ambitious.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain to Leave Europe for a Lie", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 I have been overcome by gloom since Britain voted to leave the European Union. It\u2019s not just the stupidity of the decision. It\u2019s not merely the lies of the charlatans who led the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign. It\u2019s not only the absence, now so evident, of any \u201cNextit.\u201d It\u2019s not even the betrayal of British youth. It\u2019s far more: a personal loss. Europa, however flawed, was the dream of my generation. The European Union was an entity, a bloodless noun, yet it had a beating heart.Riding a European train, gazing at the lines of swaying poplars, the villages huddled around their church spires, it was often impossible, at least for me, not to look past the tranquility to the blood-seeped soil and the tens of millions who gave their lives in Europe\u2019s collective suicides. Well, as the Germans say, we had the blessing of late birth; and the duty inherent in that blessing was to build a united Europe.Covering the European Parliament from 1980 to 1982, I would drive down from Brussels to Strasbourg. The Parliament was a bit of a farce. Unwieldy bundles of documents translated into Europe\u2019s many languages were carted back and forth. Yet, in its cumbersome way, the Parliament embodied something important: the hard trade-offs of European construction, union conjured from Babel.When I moved to Italy, with its large Communist Party and spasms of political violence, I would hear how \u201cscaling the Alps\u201d into the core of Europe was critical to the country\u2019s stability. The E.U. was insurance against the worst. For Mediterranean countries like Spain and Portugal that emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s it was something close to salvation.Memories: feckless Europe at the time of the Bosnian war and the thirst, nonetheless, of the small nations reborn in Yugoslavia\u2019s death to join the European Union and escape the bloody Balkan gyre. Watching Germany move its capital back to Berlin from Bonn in 1999 and thinking, the German question is solved and Europe is home free! Driving, when I lived in Berlin, into Poland and pinching myself to recall the unspeakable suffering overcome by German-Polish reconciliation as Poland prepared for E.U. membership.No miracle was ever so dull. Britain tended to see the E.U. in prosaic terms: It had not been delivered from ignominy or tyranny by European integration. Still, it gave the union heft, a free-market prod, a universal language and its second-largest economy. It was that recalcitrant member any good club needs.Sure, the challenges mounted. The 30-year postwar economic miracle ended \u2014 and with it full employment. The Franco-German balance at the heart of the union collapsed. German dominance stirred unease. The creation of a single currency, the euro, was bungled. The admission of former Communist states spurred large migrant movements. The European welfare state was strained. Resentments multiplied.Technology accelerated globalization, pulling hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in Asia but also offshoring millions of European jobs. Societies disaggregated. For each City honcho getting a daily Christmas delivery from Amazon Prime there was some poor sod out there in Nowheresville working a precarious warehouse night shift packaging stuff.Boris Johnson understood, in his scurrilous way, that the E.U. had become a perfect scapegoat for Western societies beset by the dilemmas of modernity. Opposed to Brexit early this year, he became its chief advocate, playing on every base instinct. Brexit was a tool, a plaything, never a principle. If he looks so glum in triumph it is because the adrenalin has run out.There will be no extra $470 million for the National Health Service from European Union savings, after all. Immigration is not about to fall. Some of the regions that voted for Brexit are also those that get the most funds from Brussels. \u201cThere is now no need for haste,\u201d Johnson says. Oh, really? \u201cWe are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans,\u201d he says. Oh, please!If Johnson becomes prime minister in the fall, he will be an unelected leader, just like all those \u201cunaccountable\u201d high rollers in Brussels. When he tries to extricate Britain from the union, he will face a hostile Parliament. Last time I checked, Britain was a parliamentary, not direct, democracy. So perhaps there is still hope. If words mean their opposite, as they do in Johnson\u2019s mouth, anything is possible. Europa is worth a fight.The union, for all its failings, did not deserve to be betrayed by a huckster. It will not die because of this imbecilic vote, but something broke \u2014 a form of optimism about humankind, the promise of 1989.My children will not inherit the Europe I hoped for. I look at my hands and see my father\u2019s emerging, the veins now more pronounced. Life feels diminished. Some things are unavoidable. This was not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans, Who Warned of Dithering on Ebola, Now Hesitate on Zika", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers say Washington is dithering while a dangerous epidemic threatens American shores. They suggest darkly that the government is playing down the risk to avoid panic. They warn: Don\u2019t wait for it to arrive at the airports and establish a perilous foothold.\u201cThere is just a lack of urgency about it,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who added that lawmakers could find themselves facing difficult questions about a flat-footed congressional Zika response as Election Day looms this fall.\u201cPeople are going to be asking, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do anything?\u2019\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou are going to have to have a pretty good answer, and I am not sure there is going to be one.\u201dScientists increasingly believe that the Zika virus may cause birth defects in infants. Here\u2019s why.Mr. Rubio has a special interest in the disease, given that the climate and conditions in his state are well known for breeding mosquitoes. He worries that even the smallest of outbreaks could send his state\u2019s economy into a spiral as visitors stay away.\u201cI tell people we are one mosquito-borne infection away from serious damage to our tourism industry,\u201d he said.\u201cI just think they\u2019re long overdue,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said last week. \u201cAn emergency bill could have passed \u2014 we\u2019re over 100 days since the request.\u201d She noted that the public health community \u201ccould have been well down the road to what needs to be done in terms of prevention, in terms of research and the other aspects of stopping the epidemic.\u201dThe issue is particularly grating at the White House, which came under siege in October 2014 over what Republicans called a lack of preparedness for Ebola. The administration believes it was unfairly maligned for political purposes by Republicans who saw an opening to make voters anxious close to the election. Mr. Obama said recently that he was having difficulty squaring Republicans\u2019 position on Ebola with their much more casual approach to Zika, \u201cgiven that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of how concerned people were about Ebola.\u201d\u201cI think we are fine,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, predicting that Republicans had done what they needed to avoid a political backlash. He said that shifting the money had provided public health experts with the resources they needed and that the necessary funds \u201cwill be there in the end.\u201dNegotiators working on a compromise are expected to move toward the $1.1 billion approved by the Senate as opposed to $622 million allocated by the House. Mr. Rubio and others favor providing the full amount sought initially by the White House.As of last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified nearly 700 Zika infections in the continental United States, though all appeared to have been contracted elsewhere. More than 1,000 have been counted in Puerto Rico. Public health experts are now preparing for the first case of someone\u2019s being infected by a mosquito in the United States.Mr. Rubio worries that the federal response has fallen too far behind.\u201cI think in some ways we are already too late,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes time to get this implemented. Every day that goes by is wasted.\u201dAs they try to hold on to control of the House and Senate, Republicans should hope that Mr. Rubio is wrong and that the disease does not become a crisis in the United States. If it does, it could be Democratic attacks on Republicans for moving too slowly that go viral.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Brexit\u2019 Will Affect the Global Economy, Now and Later", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byMarket ReactionThings fall apart. And now, \u201cthings\u201d includes the European Union.British voters delivered a well-aimed kick at the global elites who prefer a Britain that is deeply intertwined, economically and diplomatically, with Europe.So now that they did it, what does it mean for the British economy and the rest of the world?With the caveat that nothing is really clear in the immediate aftermath of a seismic event like the one that happened Thursday, here\u2019s how to think about the economic forces that have been unleashed and how we can expect them to play out in the weeks and months and years ahead.If you run a British company that exports a lot to Europe, or manage a European bank with thousands of employees in London, nothing much changed with the results Thursday.Britain is a member of the European Union today, and will be one tomorrow. Your products can still be shipped to D\u00fcsseldorf without any hint of a tariff. Your employees can work legally whether their passport is from Sweden or Spain.The immediate effects of \u201cBrexit\u201d will flow almost entirely through financial markets. Markets may be flawed, but they really do amount to a real-time verdict by millions of people with vast sums of money at stake on what something will be worth over the indefinite future. Economic shifts happen slowly; financial shifts happen overnight (literally, in this case).The truth is that the stock market declines that took place worldwide Friday are nothing to be too concerned about. The British stock market, as measured by the FTSE 100 index, was down 3.2 percent late Friday afternoon in Britain, above its levels of mid-June. That suggests that investors do not envision the Brexit hit to hammer corporate profits in the near future.But what is happening in the bond and currency markets suggests bigger problems are brewing. The 7.6 percent drop in the British pound against the dollar is indeed a seismic move \u2014 major currency pairs just don\u2019t do that. Since 2012, the average daily move in the pound-dollar exchange rate is 0.35 percent. This move is 21 times that.Combined with a rally in British government bonds (and consequently lower interest rates), the currency shift will mean a burst of inflation for British consumers as imported goods become sharply more expensive. It will also make the nation\u2019s export industries more competitive (for the moment, at least).As the months pass, the economic consequences of Brexit become less about financial market disruptions and more about real economic activity. Within Britain, a pall of uncertainty is likely to be cast over every business\u2019s decisions on whether to hire people or make capital investments \u2014 and that\u2019s true of both British-owned businesses and the many affiliates of global companies in Britain.If you\u2019re an American company that has its European headquarters in London, do you keep calm and carry on? Or do you start checking out real estate in Frankfurt or Dublin or some other place where the relationship with the E.U. is more settled? If you run a British company thinking of building a new factory, do you start to entertain the same question?Even if the ultimate answer for these companies is \u201cremain,\u201d it is easy to see how the desire to wait for clarity could hold back economic activity for many months to come \u2014 and perhaps beyond British borders.And the decision comes at an uncomfortable time. The world\u2019s central banks, normally the first responders in times of economic distress, are poorly positioned to help. Those banks have signaled that they are ready to act, with statements from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve promptly dispatched Friday morning.And it is looking as if the Fed is leaning toward easier money in the wake of Brexit. Futures markets priced in a 50 percent chance of a Fed interest rate hike Thursday, but that fell to 14 percent Friday after the news, along with a 12 percent chance of an interest-rate cut this year.But both the Fed and the E.C.B. are already tilted toward cheap money \u2014 indeed, the E.C.B. already has negative interest rates. And the Bank of England faces an extraordinarily knotty situation. It simultaneously must plan for a possible recession caused by Brexit uncertainty and for higher inflation because of the drop in the currency and outflow of capital. It can fight one of those problems, but it can\u2019t fight both at once.So a decline in business confidence and a rise in uncertainty, paired with limited responses by central banks, makes a recession a major risk in Britain and something of a risk in the rest of Europe and the United States.Things like business confidence, market swings and central bank responses shape the economy in the short and medium run, but over time it is bigger forces that prevail.And this is where there is the most uncertainty of all. What will a post-E.U. Britain really look like?One possibility \u2014 the benign option, if you want Britain to remain well integrated with Europe \u2014 is to model itself on Norway or perhaps Switzerland, two countries that are not part of the E.U. but maintain free trade within the bloc.The only problem with that: The price of maintaining free access to the rest of the European marketplace for those countries is allowing free migration from E.U. member states and accepting E.U. regulations on businesses. To the degree that pro-Brexit sentiment was driven by British opposition to immigration and regulation, this solution wouldn\u2019t really solve anything.Britain will get through the immediate financial turbulence and a possible recession just fine. The question for its future is which of two options British leaders now choose. They can maintain the status quo and remain a major international business center (while ignoring the impulse that led voters to choose \u201cleave\u201d in the first place). Or they can become a smaller, more isolated island that is a less important cog in the global economy \u2014 but at least one that honors its voters\u2019 wishes.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re angry about many, many things.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.At the news conference, he was pressed repeatedly on the British referendum, and at several points he blamed Mr. Obama, who had urged Britain not to split from the European Union. \u201cIt\u2019s not his country, it\u2019s not his part of the world, he shouldn\u2019t have done it, and I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He also attacked Hillary Clinton, saying she had \u201cmisread\u201d the mood of the country \u2014 violating a tacit rule of decorum that politics stop at the water\u2019s edge.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s visit at times had the feel of an American abroad promoting his moneyed golf links, rather than his own candidacy for president. He was greeted, much like the queen of England would be met, by staff members of Trump Turnberry \u2014 all clad in red \u201cMake Turnberry Great Again\u201d hats \u2014 as well as bagpipers who, along with Secret Service agents, preceded him up the sloping steps to his property. And he waxed proud about his golf resort for more than 15 minutes, before finally taking questions on the seismic news of the day.At one point, Mr. Trump even compared his renovation of Trump Turnberry to how he is hoping to overhaul the United States. When a reporter pointed out \u2014 correctly \u2014 that a country is hardly a golf course, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cNo it\u2019s not, but you\u2019ll be amazed how similar it is. It\u2019s a place that has to be fixed.\u201dOther candidates have made such trips abroad to burnish their foreign policy credentials and elevate themselves as a statesman in the eyes of voters back home, jamming their days with high-level meetings with dignitaries.Yet even across the ocean, Mr. Trump was unable to escape the news of the campaign trail. A group of Scottish communities and leaders organized a phone call Friday to discuss their opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Mr. Trump, who nonetheless received a fairly warm welcome in Scotland, where locals say they appreciate the money he has poured into the village economy since buying the golf course in 2014, is unlikely to be greeted as cheerfully when he visits Balmedie, north of Aberdeen.Frank Cruickshanks, 52, who is a caddy at Mr. Trump\u2019s property, including for Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric, said he appreciated the work Mr. Trump had put into overhauling the golf course.\u201cHaving caddied for the last three weeks, mostly for Americans, I have yet to meet one who\u2019s voting for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Cruickshanks said.Asked if those American tourists were voting, then, for Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruickshanks paused. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, with a mischievous grin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Measuring the Trump Effect", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byPOTTSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 At the moment, Donald J. Trump casts a long shadow over this once-thriving community, where steel mills, furnaces, bridge works, brickyards, textile plants and boiler shops provided steady jobs for the city\u2019s working and middle classes.In 1950, most of those jobs involved making things: steel, auto parts, castings, sewer pipes, coatings, textiles and pies. Today, only two of Pottstown\u2019s top employers make things: Dana Corp. and Precision Polymer. The Pottstown Hospital Center and the Pottstown School District are by far the largest employers, with 978 and 520 workers respectively.Pottstown, whose retired and laid-off steelworkers, machinists and tool and die makers have deep roots in the Democratic Party, is just the kind of place where Trump hopes his plan to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d will resonate and move voters to the Republican column.My interviews this week with Pottstown voters in working and middle class white neighborhoods showed almost no support for Trump among women, but steady support among men.\u201cI like him because he is to the point, and it\u2019s time for a change, I think he\u2019s got the oomph to rattle some cages,\u201d John Keyser, a nonunion employee at Universal Concrete Products Corporation, said. Universal Concrete is one of the few manufacturing facilities left in the area. Keyser told me that he usually votes for Democrats and thinks that Bill Clinton was \u201cone of the greatest and best presidents we ever had.\u201d But this year he supports Trump:I\u2019d rather have somebody who does get angry and has feelings than what we have had with politicians who don\u2019t care either way. I like the emotional involvement.In a number of cases, local support for Trump among white men was based as much on their animosity to Hillary Clinton as it was on their faith in Trump.\u201cI\u2019d vote for the devil before I would ever vote for that woman,\u201d said a man in his 60s who identified himself only as Keith. In a phrase repeated by at least three others, Keith said that Hillary Clinton \u201cbelongs in jail.\u201dStacey Weinstein, a 53-year-old psychiatric social worker, reflected the opposite side of the coin: she distrusts Clinton, but sees Trump as by far the worse choice.\u201cI\u2019m not terribly enthusiastic about her because I think she has done some very underhanded things,\u201d Weinstein said, but \u201cDonald Trump is a misogynist, and I don\u2019t like misogynists.\u201dWhat stood out in the interviews I conducted on June 13 here and in an upscale development in East Goshen, 24 miles south of Pottstown, was that the Trump supporters were male, with one exception; Clinton backers were decisively (but not exclusively) women.David, a computer programmer in Pottstown with strong libertarian leanings who didn\u2019t want to give his last name, said he is \u201cnot for Hillary for sure. The history of the Clintons is about corruption.\u201dSeemingly unaware of Trump\u2019s opposition to free trade agreements, David said that he believes that \u201cInternational trade is good, local trade is good, all trade is good.\u201dWhat makes the Trump campaign especially interesting in Pennsylvania is that Trump is going to be a crucial factor in the Toomey-McGinty Senate race.But for Toomey it is a major decision because of two conflicting strategic calculations.On the other, Trump threatens to provoke a level of animosity among voters in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia regions, both Democratic bastions, that could swamp all statewide Republican candidates.Initially, Toomey appeared prepared to stand up to Trump in a gamble that the presumptive presidential nominee\u2019s Pennsylvania voters will cast down-the-line Republican ballots no matter what.Trump was not my first, second, or third choice. I object to much in his manner and his policies. His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for Constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning. I disagree with his proposals to ban Muslims, to give government more eminent domain powers, to be neutral between Israel and its enemies, and several others. In short, I find his candidacy highly problematic.In order to win his support, Toomey wrote:It is up to Trump to make the case for himself in a way that reassures the millions of Republicans and non-Republicans who have grave doubts about him.Since then, however, even as Trump has offered no such reassurance \u2014 just the opposite, in fact \u2014 Toomey appears to be wavering.I\u2019m hoping that Donald Trump can say and do the things that will make me comfortable supporting him.Toomey went on: \u201cI\u2019m not there yet, I\u2019m hoping to be able to get there, but it\u2019s been problematic.\u201dIn a phone interview on Tuesday, Toomey asserted thatPennsylvania voters are entirely capable of ticket splitting and distinguishing between members of the same party. Voters are going to evaluate the Senate race entirely independently of the presidency.Toomey\u2019s hope that he can separate himself from Trump is not widely shared by Republican strategists.Christopher Nicholas, president of the Republican Eagle Consulting Group in Harrisburg, described Trump as \u201can anchor\u201d weighing down Republican candidates. The Democrats\u2019 key goal is \u201cto turn out the base in Philadelphia,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cTrump will serve as a lightning rod doing their work for them.\u201dIn a separate interview, McGinty, whose only previous statewide campaign experience was an unsuccessful bid for the gubernatorial nomination in 2014, welcomed Trump\u2019s presence.Toomey, she said, \u201cis as hard right as Ted Cruz, but he likes to work in the shadows,\u201d keeping his pro-Wall Street record out of the limelight. \u201cTrump forces Toomey out of the shadows.\u201dDespite Toomey\u2019s claim that voters will view him as distinct from Trump, three separate Democratic pollsters \u2014 who gave me numbers while insisting on anonymity because they did not want to interfere with their current client relationships \u2014 report a \u201cstrong overlap\u201d in support for Trump and Toomey, on one side, and for Clinton and McGinty, on the other.\u201cMcGinty is terrific on TV,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cShe came across very well on TV ads, she speaks well, she has energy and passion.\u201d He cautioned, however, that McGinty \u201cin person, gets distracted\u201d and can go \u201coff message. She is not into candidate discipline yet.\u201dToomey is a formidable candidate, according to Rendell, who described the senator as \u201ca very likable person, a pretty decent guy, a guy who isn\u2019t hateful or trying to divide the country.\u201d Rendell added that Toomey is \u201ca perfect blend \u2013 a conservative who appeals to the base, yet is moderate in tone and does not say dumb things.\u201dThe salience voters give to the two major issues of the election \u2014 first, the interlocking concerns over terror, immigration and security; second, the economy \u2014 will determine the outcome of both the presidential and Senate races in Pennsylvania. chronic budget deficits, are in danger of failing to pay employees, or face default on their bond payments.At the same time, population projections by the Census Bureau forecast that the lion\u2019s share of future growth in the state will be heavily concentrated in the highly Democratic precincts of metropolitan Philadelphia.The massacre in Orlando on Sunday morning by a self-proclaimed ISIS-linked gunman \u2013 an American citizen of Afghan descent with a history of Muslim religious observance \u2014 has for the moment raised the fear of terror, a development that Democrats in McGinty\u2019s camp privately acknowledge works to the advantage of Republicans.McGinty, for her part, said American policy toward Syrian refugees must be governed by \u201ctwo imperatives\u201d \u2014 primarily that there should be a \u201cthoroughgoing vetting process\u201d to prevent the entry of possible terrorists, but also that we should \u201cbe true to our values and principles to welcome those fleeing oppression.\u201dIt is fair to say that one key factor in the outcome of both the Pennsylvania senate race and the presidential election will be how many more, if any, armed-to-the-teeth Omar Mateen-type killers surface between now and Election Day. A volatile mixture of economic stress and globalization \u2014 including the globalization of terrorist attacks by nonstate actors \u2014 may determine both the near-term and the far-term course of American politics.Thomas B.

European leaders, looking at Spanish elections on Sunday and German and French elections next year, want the uncertainty around the British question resolved as soon as possible so they can try to show their own voters that Brussels is capable and on track.But the British have to decide what they want in a future relationship with the European Union, given the disagreement among the Brexit leaders, who are not a government. Mr. Cameron, humiliated and an opponent of leaving, clearly has no desire to bear the burden of those negotiations \u2014 both internally, within the divided Conservative Party, and externally, with other European leaders. His counterparts in Europe think he has damaged not only himself and his country, but also them, by energizing European populism and diminishing the bloc.The French are particularly impatient, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault saying on Saturday that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc should begin soon. He warned that Mr. Cameron will face \u201cvery strong\u201d pressure to accelerate the process when European leaders meet on Tuesday in Brussels, where Mr. Cameron is expected to be asked to leave the room when the others discuss their plans. The Europeans are also expected to cancel Britain\u2019s six-month presidency of the council, which was to begin in July 2017.There is confusion about Britain, too. Mr. Ayrault said Saturday that \u201cthey must designate a new prime minister, which would certainly require several days.\u201d In fact, the process will be considerably longer, because Conservative lawmakers must first agree on a leadership contest and decide when it will be. That contest will involve numerous ballots of Conservative legislators to winnow down candidates to two, and then the 150,000 or so registered members of the party (who had joined at least three months ago, to prevent infiltration) will vote by mail.Ms. Merkel, trying to be conciliatory in the face of facts, said that she was seeking an \u201cobjective, good\u201d climate in talks on Britain\u2019s exit, and that there was \u201cno need to be particularly nasty in any way in the negotiations; they must be conducted properly.\u201dShe said Scotland planned to enter discussions with European Union institutions and European governments to protect its place in the bloc. Ms. Sturgeon said she would establish an advisory panel on the legal, financial and diplomatic implications of the vote.As Mr. Cameron\u2019s announced resignation sank in, speculation abounded that Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the most visible leader of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign, was the favorite to replace him. But there were reports in British newspapers that Mr. Cameron and his deputy, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were eager to keep Mr. Johnson from profiting from what they considered to be his betrayal and that they were organizing support for Theresa May, the home secretary.In a speech in London on Saturday, Mr. Corbyn largely ignored the no-confidence effort. Instead, he told supporters that Labour would fight to ensure that its agenda was at the heart of discussions as Britain negotiated its exit from the bloc.He mentioned the importance of employment protections and human rights, said the referendum had laid bare divisions in the country over immigration and underlined the despair of those hit by austerity measures.\u201cToday it\u2019s important we learn from what has taken place,\u201d he said. Asked if he would run again if his leadership was challenged, he replied, \u201cYes, I am here.\u201dThe sense of shock was particularly acute in London, a cosmopolitan city and an important financial center, which reacted to the vote with anger, disappointment and even tears.\u201cI was crying yesterday,\u201d Camila Diehl, 26, who works for a cancer charity in London, said Saturday. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening. This is not the country I know.\u201dMs. Diehl, who has a Colombian mother and a British father, said she was worried about what the vote would mean for funding for scientific research. She is now questioning her future in Britain, she said.Mayor Sadiq Kahn, who supported \u201cRemain,\u201d took to Facebook on Friday, saying he wanted to \u201csend a clear message to every European resident living in London \u2014 you are very welcome here.\u201d\u201cThere are nearly one million European citizens living in London today, and they bring huge benefits to our city \u2014 working hard, paying taxes, working in our public services and contributing to our civic and cultural life,\u201d he wrote.And in the latest consequence of Britain\u2019s vote to withdraw from Brussels, Britain\u2019s highest-ranking European Union official \u2014 Jonathan Hill, the commissioner for financial services \u2014 resigned on Saturday.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, James Kanter from Brussels, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Sunderland, England.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Which Labor Market Data Should You Believe?", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byA Numbers GameWhen the unemployment rate falls below 5 percent, it usually means things are going pretty well. It was 4.7 percent in May, a level last seen in November 2007.A different measure of the economy\u2019s health, however, is beeping and flashing red. It says that labor market conditions have deteriorated with each passing month this year. In May, it fell to its lowest level in seven years.Let\u2019s do comfort first. It\u2019s possible we\u2019re not making progress because we\u2019ve more or less arrived at our destination \u2014 what economists call full employment. This somewhat misleading term doesn\u2019t mean that everyone has a job. It means that the reservoir of people seeking work has receded to a historically normal level.There is some evidence for this. Notably, the low unemployment rate.But there are also some pretty strong reasons for skepticism. My personal favorite: In 2007, about 88 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 were working. Now, roughly 85 percent of such men are working.The scary explanation? Job growth is slowing because the economy is losing steam.Fed officials, and other economists, have been grappling with the divergence between relatively weak reported economic growth and relatively strong job growth. Those at the Fed have largely taken the view that labor market data is more accurate, which has been true over time.But this time, some economists say, the broader economic data may be closer to the truth. \u201cOf course, the bond market understands this perfectly clearly,\u201d Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, noted recently. Investors have continued to discount the Fed\u2019s hints that it plans to raise rates this summer, and again later this year. They are betting the Fed will once again be forced to wait longer than it wishes.(It has not escaped the notice of these pessimists that the Fed\u2019s labor market index started showing weakness after the Fed increased rates in December.)The truth may be somewhere in between.The Federal Reserve introduced the new measure of labor market health a few months after Janet Yellen became the Fed\u2019s chairwoman in 2014. It created the index because the unemployment rate is too simple. Even the name is too simple. It doesn\u2019t actually measure unemployment; it counts only people who are actively looking for work. Moreover, a low unemployment rate doesn\u2019t tell you how many part-time workers would like full-time gigs. It doesn\u2019t tell you how many full-time workers would like a better job at higher pay.In short, particularly in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has improved much more quickly than the actual labor market.The Fed\u2019s corrective, however, is also imperfect. The central bank mashed together 19 kinds of labor data, including high-profile stalwarts like the unemployment rate and less familiar esoterica like the Conference Board\u2019s \u201chelp-wanted advertising index.\u201d And it tried to clean that data, scrubbing away the noise to reveal the underlying trends. But there is no perfect method for telling the difference, and a recent Goldman Sachs analysis suggests the Fed scrubbed too hard.Daan Struyven and Zach Pandl, economists at Goldman, concluded that the Fed is scrubbing away some of the economy\u2019s actual progress. But they caution that is only a partial explanation: Economic growth still appears to be slowing.\u201cThis is not to say that the labor market is still firing on all cylinders,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe labor market is still making progress, but at a meaningfully slower pace.\u201dSo there you have it.The economy isn\u2019t great. The economy isn\u2019t terrible. We\u2019re just chugging along, and apparently that\u2019s about as good as it gets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When Aaron Vincent Elkaim reached the Xingu River basin in Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amazon rain forest in 2014, he found a lush and humid green expanse that made him feel as if he were infinitesimally small, living \u00e2\u0080\u009cinside a single giant organism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The region is one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most biologically and ethnically diverse areas, home to about 25,000 indigenous people, many of whom live as their ancestors did in close relationship to the land.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was eye-opening to see what it\u2019s like to live in a mostly preindustrial world where people live off of the environment and are mostly content with work, family and a traditional identity connected to the land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said It is a way of life under threat.The Belo Monte dam, under construction on the Xingu, will soon be the third-largest hydroelectric complex in the world in terms of output. When completed, it will provide energy for Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urban boom and fuel further industrialization of the Amazon basin. The Belo Monte is just one of scores of dams that the government has planned for the rivers of the Amazon rain forest to propel the growth of Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.Although plans for the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex started in 1975, construction was delayed until 2011 because of fierce and persistent protests by several of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 16 indigenous tribes. The original project was changed so that tribal lands would not be directly flooded. But nearby forests where they hunted would be submerged, and the dam will most likely affect water levels and drinkability, transportation and fishing. Many Brazilians whose family roots in the area date to a century ago, when it had a booming rubber industry, are also affected. They mostly live off the land and still depend on fishing and tapping their own rubber trees. The story of the dam and its effects on the environment result in the kind of slow, subtle photo essay that is expensive to do and hard to fund. Mr. Elkaim recently received a $20,000 Alexia Foundation grant, which will enable him to pursue the story for the next year.His rain forest images will be displayed at the Look3 Photo Festival in Charlottesvile, Va., from June 13 to 19 as a part of an exhibit celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Alexia Foundation. Curated by Mike Davis, the exhibit will also include Mary Calvert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on homeless female veterans who have survived sexual trauma in the military.  This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exhibits also include work by Nick Brandt, Graciela Iturbide, Yuri Kozyrev and Frans Lanting as well as Olivia Bee, Sheila Pree Bright, Binh Danh and Radcliffe Roye, known as Ruddy. The festival also includes two daylong seminars for  emerging and midcareer photographers.Even before the Belo Monte dam project, the surrounding area had been severely damaged by the clearing of forests by outsiders for cattle grazing.While the tribal protests helped change the original plan for the hydroelectric complex, a new dam is planned nearby on the Tapaj\u00c3\u00b3s River. Mr. Elkaim recently spent time there with the Munduruku tribe, who are fighting to stop that dam. They have recently delayed construction by getting their territory officially recognized by the government as indigenous land. When Mr. Elkaim returned to the area around the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex earlier this year, even those people still protesting seemed resigned to the dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impending effects on their environment and way of life. While this story may be too nuanced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and remote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to inspire headlines in North America, Mr. Elkaim says he thinks it is critical because it is typical of what he sees as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgutting\u00e2\u0080\u009d of ecosystems around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to protect the people whose entire way of life, identity and culture are dependent upon these ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we protect their way of life, they will protect the environment around them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJames Estrin, the co-editor of Lens, will be participating in the educational programs on June 15 at the Look3 festival.

{"Headline": "Britain Votes to Leave E.U.; Cameron Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported by15 Photos\u201cI will do everything I can as prime minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cBut I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\u201dWithdrawing from the European Union is a lengthy process that Mr. Cameron will largely leave to his successor. It will mean pulling out from the world\u2019s largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britain\u2019s legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britain\u2019s economy.One reason the City, London\u2019s financial district, shuddered on Friday is that it is a hub for trading in euro-denominated securities, activity that may now shift to rivals like Frankfurt and Paris.It was also not clear that the United Kingdom could survive withdrawal from the European Union intact. There was immediate pressure for another referendum on independence from Britain for Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to stay with Europe.\u201cI think an independence referendum is now highly likely,\u201d said Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who said it would be \u201cdemocratically unacceptable\u201d for Scotland to be pushed out of the European Union when a majority of Scots want to stay in.Keith Vaz, a Labour legislator, said: \u201cThis is a crushing decision; this is a terrible day for Britain and a terrible day for Europe. In 1,000 years, I would never have believed that the British people would vote for this.\u201dEuropean leaders acknowledged that the British vote would further limit their ability to move forward with economic and political integration, a process that had all but stalled anyway.\u201cToday marks a turning point for Europe,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. \u201cIt is a turning point for the European unification process.\u201dIt was a remarkable victory for the country\u2019s anti-Europe forces, which not long ago were considered to have little chance of prevailing.Financial markets, which had been anticipating that Britain would vote to stay in, started plunging before the vote tally was complete, putting pressure on central banks and regulators to take steps to guard against a spread of the damage.Britons voted on Thursday to leave the European Union. The Leave side led with 17.4 million votes, or 52 percent, versus the Remain side\u2019s 16.1 million, or 48 percent, with a turnout of around 72 percent.Mr. Cameron had vowed before the vote to move quickly to begin the divorce process if Britain opted to leave. But he said on Friday that he would leave the start of the formal process to his successor, while seeking in the interim to calm the atmosphere before taking any action.Mr. Johnson, like a number of other leaders of the push to leave the European Union, said there was no need to rush to set in motion the legal procedure \u2014 invoking a provision known as Article 50 \u2014 that would formally sever ties between Britain and the bloc. He and other advocates of leaving the European Union have been taking a go-slow posture on the mechanics of the divorce, saying Britain can get a better deal on trade if it can avoid arbitrary deadlines on the negotiations.Britain is the second-largest economy after Germany in the European Union, a nuclear power with a seat on the United Nations Security Council, an advocate of free-market economics and a close ally of the United States.The loss of Britain is an enormous blow to the credibility of a bloc already under pressure from slow growth, high unemployment, the migrant crisis, Greece\u2019s debt woes and the conflict in Ukraine.\u201cThe main impact will be massive disorder in the E.U. system for the next two years,\u201d said Thierry de Montbrial, founder and executive chairman of the French Institute of International Relations. \u201cThere will be huge political transition costs, on how to solve the British exit, and the risk of a domino effect or bank run from other countries that think of leaving.\u201dEurope will have to \u201creorganize itself in a system of different degrees of association,\u201d said Karl Kaiser, a Harvard professor and former director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cEurope does have an interest in keeping Britain in the single market, if possible, and in an ad hoc security relationship.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.The campaign run by one of the loudest proponents of leaving, the U.K. Independence Party, flirted with xenophobia, nativism and what some of its critics considered racism. But the official, more mainstream Leave campaign also invoked immigration as an issue, and its slogan, \u201cTake control,\u201d resonated with voters who feel that the government is failing to regulate the inflow of people from Europe and beyond.The \u201cRemain\u201d side, citing scores of experts and elite opinion, warned that leaving the bloc, a so-called Brexit, would mean an economic catastrophe, a plunging pound, higher taxes, more austerity and the loss of jobs.The Leave side warned that remaining would produce uncontrolled immigration, crime and terrorism, with hordes pouring into Britain from Turkey, a country of 77 million Muslims that borders Syria and Iraq and hopes to join the European Union.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.In England especially, 85 percent of the population of Britain, many people fell back on national pride, cultural exceptionalism and nostalgia. Many English voters chose to believe the insistence of anti-Europe leaders like Mr. Johnson that as a great nation, Britain would be more powerful and successful outside the European Union than inside.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When You Dial 911 and Wall Street Answers", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 1Since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms have increasingly taken over public services like emergency care and firefighting, often with dire effects.Supported byA Tennessee woman slipped into a coma and died after an ambulance company took so long to assemble a crew that one worker had time for a cigarette break.Paramedics in New York had to covertly swipe medical supplies from a hospital to restock their depleted ambulances after emergency runs.A man in the suburban South watched a chimney fire burn his house to the ground as he waited for the fire department, which billed him anyway and then sued him for $15,000 when he did not pay.In each of these cases, someone dialed 911 and Wall Street answered.The business of driving ambulances and operating fire brigades represents just one facet of a profound shift on Wall Street and Main Street alike, a New York Times investigation has found. Since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms, the \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d of an earlier era, have increasingly taken over a wide array of civic and financial services that are central to American life.Today, people interact with private equity when they dial 911, pay their mortgage, play a round of golf or turn on the kitchen tap for a glass of water.In emergency care and firefighting, this approach creates a fundamental tension: the push to turn a profit while caring for people in their most vulnerable moments.For governments and their citizens, the effects have often been dire. Under private equity ownership, some ambulance response times worsened, heart monitors failed and companies slid into bankruptcy, according to a Times examination of thousands of pages of internal documents and government records, as well as interviews with dozens of former employees. In at least two cases, lawsuits contend, poor service led to patient deaths.Private equity gained new power and responsibility as a direct result of the 2008 crisis. As cities and towns nationwide struggled to pay for basics like public infrastructure and ambulance services, private equity stepped in. At the same time, as banks scaled back their mortgage operations after the crisis, private equity firms \u2014 which face lighter regulation than banks, and none of their rainy-day capital requirements \u2014 moved in there as well.The power shift has happened with relatively little scrutiny, even as federal authorities have tightened rules for banks. Unlike banks, which take deposits and borrow from the government, private equity firms invest money from wealthy individuals and pension funds desperate for returns at a time of historically low interest rates.\u201cThere is private equity \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 and it\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d said Vikram Pandit, a former Citigroup chief executive who is now head of the Orogen Group, which invests in financial businesses. Across the financial landscape, he said, \u201cNew champions will emerge.\u201dWarburg Pincus, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, and other major private equity firms have invested in emergency services, a business that routinely holds the lives of customers in its hands. While this represents one small corner of private equity, which traditionally used debt to seize underperforming companies, it captures the industry\u2019s newfound pervasiveness.K.K.R. \u2014 a firm memorialized in \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d a book that chronicled a defining 1980s Wall Street deal \u2014 also invested in public water services. Blackstone is now America\u2019s largest landlord of rental houses. And in the mortgage industry, until recently the province of banks, the Fortress Investment Group controls a huge bill collector.In many of the fields where private equity now operates, it has not necessarily performed better or worse than the banks and governments it replaced. In some cases it financed projects that others wouldn\u2019t fund and provided crucial public services, including emergency care. And because these firms do not rely on the government for loans, and are much smaller than Wall Street banks, they pose far less risk to the broader economy.\u201cOver 11 million Americans work for private-equity-backed businesses, and millions more rely on private equity performance for their retirement security,\u201d said James Maloney, a spokesman for the American Investment Council, the industry\u2019s leading lobbying group. Private equity, Mr. Maloney said, helps \u201cadvance both our economic and societal well-being.\u201dBut the Times investigation of emergency services shows that hasn\u2019t always been the case.Of the 12 ambulance companies recently owned by private equity, three filed for bankruptcy in the last three years, according to public filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, a research service that tracks over 1,100 major ambulance companies in the United States. Those three companies had problems that predated private equity. But no other ambulance company tracked by the research firm filed for bankruptcy during that period.The latest blowup came in February, when TransCare EMS, controlled by the firm Patriarch Partners, filed for bankruptcy, closing its doors forever. One day, cities and towns up and down the East Coast had TransCare services; the next, they didn\u2019t.\u201cPrivate equity has, in this case, threatened public safety,\u201d said Richard Thomas, the mayor of Mount Vernon, N.Y, which relied on TransCare. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way to treat the public.\u201dPatriarch\u2019s owner and founder, Lynn Tilton, said in a statement that she was \u201cdeeply saddened by the unfortunate circumstances that triggered the abrupt end to TransCare\u2019s operations and the heartache it has caused for many of its devoted employees.\u201d She noted that TransCare, like other ambulance companies, \u201cfaced the obstacles inherent to its business model.\u201dRural/Metro, long one of the nation\u2019s largest ambulance companies and one of the few operators of private fire departments, did a tour through bankruptcy, although it reorganized and stayed in business. One private equity investor took Rural/Metro into bankruptcy, and another helped get it out.During that period, Rural/Metro\u2019s response times slowed in certain towns and it instituted more aggressive billing practices across the board, records show. While under the control of Warburg, Rural/Metro once sent a $761 collections notice to an infant girl born in an ambulance.\u201cThe matter may be reported to a national credit reporting agency,\u201d the notice read, effectively threatening a baby with a bad credit report.\u201cObviously there were problems with Rural/Metro,\u201d said Ron Cunningham, a spokesman for Rural/Metro\u2019s new parent company, Envision Healthcare, which is not a private equity firm. \u201cWe are continuing to hire paramedics and E.M.T.s and what you are seeing is that the response times are improving.\u201dIn a statement, Warburg said it \u201cinvested in Rural/Metro with the objective of growing and strengthening the company\u2019s business.\u201d\u201cDespite several initiatives undertaken by the company\u2019s board and management team,\u201d the statement said, the \u201cchallenges Rural/Metro faced were too difficult to overcome.\u201dWhile private equity firms have always invested in a diverse array of companies, including hospitals and nursing homes, their movement into emergency services raises broader questions about the administering of public services. Cities and towns are required to offer citizens a free education, and they generally provide a police force, but almost everything else is fair game for privatization.\u201cWe\u2019re reaching new lows in the public safety services we will help provide, especially in very poor cities,\u201d said Michelle Wilde Anderson, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in state and local government. Private equity firms, she said, \u201care not philanthropists.\u201dA TransCare ambulance pulled into a hospital parking lot in Westchester County. Employees in windbreakers, \u201cEMS\u201d emblazoned on the backs, hopped out and headed for the emergency room door.They were there not to bring in a patient or sign paperwork, but to go \u201cE.R. shopping\u201d: swiping supplies to replenish critical items TransCare could not afford to replace in its ambulances.After an ambulance finishes a run, hospital staff members often restock medications as a courtesy. But TransCare emergency workers described pressure from supervisors to go further and raid supply carts, sometimes without the hospital\u2019s blessing. On occasion, one TransCare worker would act as lookout while \u201cthe other one would just be grabbing stuff,\u201d said Emanuel Almodovar, a former employee.Chez Valenta, an 11-year veteran of TransCare, said employees often had no choice. Medications in the ambulances were expired and supplies were depleted.\u201cThere\u2019s only a couple of things that terrify paramedics,\u201d Ms. Valenta said. \u201cBeing without your critical medications is one of them. I make no apologies.\u201dThe supply shortage \u2014 and the extreme measures taken to address it \u2014 was just one warning sign of TransCare\u2019s demise. In February, it became official: Employees received an email from a supervisor declaring, \u201cWe are being told to cease operations immediately.\u201dTransCare\u2019s unraveling, told through internal documents and interviews with former employees, provides a case study in private equity\u2019s ambulance experiment. The company\u2019s implosion followed the bankruptcies of two other ambulance companies owned by private equity, Rural/Metro and First Med.TransCare, an ambulance company owned by a private equity firm, recently went out of business. We obtained internal emails and minutes of executive meetings that lay bare the company\u2019s final year and its ultimate demise.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Private equity investors swept into the ambulance business with high hopes.\u201cTremendous growth potential,\u201d Warburg Pincus said in a statement in 2011 when it bought Rural/Metro with plans to acquire rival ambulance services and improve bill collection.\u201cIt didn\u2019t quite play out like they had hoped,\u201d said Mike Ward, executive director of the National EMS Management Association.So some private equity firms fell back on a time-tested moneymaking strategy: slashing costs. The case of TransCare shows the perils of that approach.In 2003, Patriarch helped rescue TransCare, which had previously been owned by other private equity investors, from another bankruptcy. For years the company, which once had 2,000 employees, showed signs of improvement, with ample resources and high morale.Patriarch\u2019s owner, Ms. Tilton, liked to put a friendly face on private equity, shunning the stereotype of Wall Street raiders out to strip companies of valuable assets or flip them for a quick profit. Ms. Tilton starred in a reality television show, \u201cDiva of Distressed,\u201d and has famously said, \u201cIt\u2019s only men I strip and flip.\u201dThe TransCare mess was a mere blip for Patriarch, which manages a sprawling portfolio of more than 70 companies, including the mapmaker Rand McNally.And Ms. Tilton, who said she \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to try to save the company, attributed TransCare\u2019s collapse to problems beyond Patriarch\u2019s control. The business requires costly investment in medical gear, she said. \u201cWith limited free cash flow, any disruptions in the business can cause unsustainable deterioration.\u201dYet Ms. Tilton was very much in charge of TransCare as it crumbled. She was the sole owner of the Patriarch Partners fund that had a controlling stake in TransCare. And although she never held an executive or management role, she was TransCare\u2019s sole board member \u2014 a situation almost unheard-of in corporate America. Only 3 percent of private companies have two or fewer board members, according to survey data from the National Association of Corporate Directors, which called a one-person board \u201clikely a recipe for governance failure.\u201dFormer TransCare employees described pressure to cut costs and increase billing as the company weakened in recent years. Patients were transported unnecessarily in ambulances, they said.And ambulances regularly broke down. On the day TransCare filed for bankruptcy, more than 30 percent of the company\u2019s vehicles were out of service, some for hundreds of days, according to internal documents.\u201cWe drove buses on the 911 unit where the brakes didn\u2019t work properly,\u201d said Rayshma Raghunath, a former TransCare employee, referring to her ambulance. She started feeling uneasy during the Ebola scare in 2014, when she said workers had trouble getting enough sanitary wipes to disinfect their ambulances.Caitlin Cannizzaro, another former employee, said that even starting the ambulances became tough. One morning, it took four hours to get some running, she said. \u201cYou really had to become a MacGyver in the field.\u201dBy early 2015, the company had racked up health department violations for failed ambulance inspections, internal documents show. Employees spotted bedbugs in the Brooklyn dispatch center. Suppliers refused to provide drugs or repair ambulances because of unpaid bills.\u201cWe were constantly having problems with the heart monitors,\u201d said Mr. Almodovar, the former emergency medical technician. \u201cIt started getting scary. The last thing we want is for a patient to die on us because the equipment is failing.\u201dBy February 2015, shortages became critical. According to meeting minutes reviewed by The Times, TransCare executives discussed how their New York locations would be \u201cunable to make it through the weekend with current medical supplies.\u201dSupervisors regularly paid for supplies out of their own pockets and hoped for reimbursement, emails show. Some workers said the ambulances carried expired medications. Others went \u201cE.R. shopping.\u201dIn March 2015, a new problem emerged: Some TransCare employees did not get paid on time. Then in July, it happened again.When it looked like payroll might be delayed another time, TransCare sent sample questions and answers to managers, \u201cto help you communicate\u201d with frustrated employees. It read in part:Q. When will we be paid?A. We do not know.In the first few days of 2016, the trouble accelerated. Eviction warnings had piled up. High levels of carbon monoxide in the Brooklyn office sent at least one employee to the hospital, according to medical records.The company lost a major customer, the city of New Rochelle, N.Y. Less than 48 hours later, employees learned the chief executive had stepped down \u2014 the third in four years to leave.\u201cRecent events have been a wake-up call,\u201d the chief operating officer wrote to the staff to announce the chief executive\u2019s departure. The note signed off, \u201cHere\u2019s to a great future together!\u201dA month later, the company filed for bankruptcy, leaving a mess for cities and employees alike. Workers rushed to the company\u2019s offices in Brooklyn to collect their final paychecks. Worried the checks might bounce, some piled into emergency vehicles and raced to a 24-hour check-cashing store.James Bradley, deputy commissioner of public safety in White Plains, blamed Patriarch for TransCare\u2019s woes. \u201cThat\u2019s where the problems lie,\u201d he said.The city of Mount Vernon, another former customer in New York, hired a new private company at a cost to taxpayers, and is developing its own ambulance operation within its fire department. In New York City, where TransCare had operated 27 ambulances, the fire department paid its own ambulance workers overtime to fill the void.\u201cI am highly upset with Patriarch. They lied to us,\u201d said Jay Robbins, a former director of operations at TransCare who was at ground zero after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\u201cI told my employees to come in and work, and now they won\u2019t be getting paid,\u201d he said soon after the bankruptcy, his voice shaking.The bankruptcy also disrupted litigation pending against the company, including a malpractice case that raises questions about TransCare\u2019s training procedures.During an Aerosmith concert at Madison Square Garden in 2012, Robert Albrecht, a 52-year-old businessman with a wife and three children, suddenly collapsed.TransCare arrived within minutes \u2014 it was stationed in the building. But a paramedic mistakenly inserted a breathing tube into Mr. Albrecht\u2019s esophagus, medical records and the lawsuit show, pumping air into his stomach instead of his lungs. He was pronounced dead minutes later.The case was scheduled for preliminary settlement talks, according to the family\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan C. Reiter, when TransCare went under. Today Mr. Albrecht\u2019s widow is a creditor in the bankruptcy, in line with medical suppliers and unpaid workers.In Loudon County, Tenn., another ambulance company was unnerving local officials.After 11 years of relying on Rural/Metro, the Tennessee county wanted to part ways in 2014. So it sent letters to the company outlining grievances: Rural/Metro employees slept through an emergency call. A Rural/Metro driver refused to transport a dead body because it would \u201cstink up\u201d his ambulance. Another Rural/Metro worker, who later said she offered to respond to an emergency even though she was off duty, had enough time to smoke a cigarette while the company scrambled to assemble a full crew. The patient later died.In the year since private equity had led the company into bankruptcy, Rural/Metro had endangered \u201cthe health and welfare\u201d of its citizens, Loudon County said in a letter to the company. It was, as the letter put it, \u201ca complete system failure.\u201dData on the quality of an ambulance company\u2019s performance is scarce at the national level and difficult to compare town-to-town or company-to-company. A basic metric \u2014 how often ambulances are late \u2014 is often defined differently, if it is measured at all.Still, data can show how one company changes over time, and a Times analysis of data obtained under freedom of information laws from five of Rural/Metro\u2019s major markets suggests that service in four areas suffered under private equity ownership. The Times examined where Rural/Metro operated exclusively, in or near cities.In one town, response times surged; in another, penalties skyrocketed. In a third, county officials time and again received a dreaded alert: no available ambulances.The first private equity investor to back Rural/Metro was Warburg Pincus. It was just one investment for a firm that manages roughly $40 billion.But the 2011 takeover was the sort of acquisition that tarred private equity firms in the public mind as corporate raiders out to make a fast dollar. Warburg financed its roughly $730 million purchase by adding more than $500 million in debt to Rural/Metro\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 a deep hole to climb out of.Initially, Warburg invested in the company and its ambulances. Rural/Metro acquired two ambulance companies, helping increase capital spending by 20 percent and payroll by 15 percent in 2012. But the deals added to overall debt, contributing to cutbacks that potentially affected patient care.Some ambulances weren\u2019t promptly restocked, employees said. In Arizona, the company\u2019s home state, it shelved a program that gave raises to senior staff. It also slashed pensions there.\u201cIt was a train wreck,\u201d said Aaron Chamney, a former Rural/Metro fire captain who said he was dismissed a month into Warburg\u2019s ownership after he was injured on the job.The financial results were also a mess. Rural/Metro, which operates ambulances in 20 states, told investors it would book higher revenue than it ultimately did, leading bondholders to sue Warburg for fraud, a case that continues. Warburg denies the accusations.As Warburg\u2019s investment spiraled toward bankruptcy, service suffered.In Arizona, just days before the August 2013 bankruptcy, the health department wrote to Rural/Metro demanding data on its 911 response times. Rural/Metro was failing to respond on time, state records show.Tacoma, Wash., waived almost all of Rural/Metro\u2019s fines for lateness in 2012 because the company was meeting overall standards. Then, however, performance collapsed. Rural/Metro paid fines for nine straight months. In the first half of 2013, average monthly penalties, both waived and not, nearly quintupled from the same period a year earlier.\u201cThroughout our ownership of Rural/Metro, Warburg Pincus always supported a high standard of customer care and the best possible results for all of the company\u2019s stakeholders,\u201d the firm said in a statement, citing \u201cincreased spending to improve operations and processes, increased capital investment and strategic acquisitions.\u201dBut as Warburg\u2019s investment was crumbling, something interesting happened: Other investors saw an opportunity and snapped up Rural/Metro\u2019s bonds. This is a classic strategy in which Wall Street firms hunt for investments (in this case, distressed debt), expecting them to bounce back.But Rural/Metro didn\u2019t recover. It filed for bankruptcy.Suddenly those bondholders had a choice: revive the company, or lose their money. The biggest bondholder was Oaktree Capital Management, an investment manager that specializes in distressed bonds and private equity deals. Oaktree invested $88 million in loans and stock, helping wipe out Warburg\u2019s stake in the company. By January 2014, Oaktree was the single largest shareholder in Rural/Metro.But Oaktree, which owned nearly 40 percent of Rural/Metro, did not halt the slide. In Rochester, monthly penalties averaged $58,950 in the first half of 2015, during Oaktree\u2019s tenure, more than double the average during the first half of 2013, when Warburg owned the company.In July 2014, the Mesa, Ariz., fire chief formally complained about Rural/Metro\u2019s \u201cunprecedented reduction of ambulances, which in turn delayed patient care.\u201d The fire chief of the Superstition Fire and Medical District, in Apache Junction, Ariz., accused Rural/Metro of appearing \u201cmore focused on cutting corners and canceling contracts than quality of care.\u201dIn Aurora, Colo., Rural/Metro awarded medals of valor to some employees for responding to the 2012 movie theater shooting. But the city issued increasing penalties to the company, on an average basis, for late responses and other problems after the bankruptcy. Last year, during Oaktree\u2019s tenure, Aurora chose to award its contract to a different ambulance company.In a statement, Oaktree said Rural/Metro\u2019s board was unaware of \u201cany contracts that the company lost due to deficient response times or supplies.\u201d\u201cThe board\u2019s foremost focus was patient safety,\u201d Oaktree said, adding that it \u201cnever contemplated any expense cuts that would have affected response time or patient care.\u201dNot everyone was displeased with Rural/Metro. In Wheat Ridge, Colo., the company has been considered compliant since 2011. When Rural/Metro suffered delays, \u201cThere were always reasonable explanations,\u201d said Daniel Brennan, chief of police.Similarly, San Diego considered Rural/Metro compliant under Warburg\u2019s and Oaktree\u2019s ownership. However, the city\u2019s records show that it excused several hundred late responses over the last five years for circumstances like bursts of emergency calls.Officials in Knox County, Tenn., said they started worrying in April 2015 when Rural/Metro alerted them twice that it had no ambulances available for emergencies, forcing them to rely on other providers. That is known as a \u201clevel zero,\u201d and it had happened only once before in recent years. In 2015, the county penalized Rural/Metro $110,000 for level-zeros.Rural/Metro also must tell the county if three or fewer ambulances are available. During the second half of 2015, it notified the county of such shortages an average of 106 times per month \u2014 quadruple the average of the same period in 2013.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been told is that their challenge is around staffing,\u201d said Dr. Martha Buchanan, director of the county\u2019s health department. She cited the bankruptcy and a new law requiring more worker certifications, making hiring tougher.Rural/Metro also reported increased lateness, defined as taking 10 minutes or longer to reach an emergency. In the second half of 2015, Rural/Metro was late, on average, about 9.4 percent of the time, up from 6.8 percent two years earlier. Though the company still met overall standards, the county said Rural/Metro \u201chad increased difficulty in doing so.\u201dSince Envision took over Rural/Metro in late 2015, replacing private equity, the company has shown signs of improvement, Knox County officials said. It has purchased new ambulances and raised salaries.In neighboring Loudon County, officials noticed response time problems after the bankruptcy, when Oaktree was the largest shareholder. The final straw came after an early-morning 911 call in August 2014. Donna Maher, 81, couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cThey\u2019re coming as quick as they can,\u201d the 911 operator promised.But Rural/Metro\u2019s ambulance had not yet left the station. Surveillance video showed an emergency worker standing beside her ambulance, smoking a cigarette.Ms. Maher eventually reached the hospital, but died 10 days later. Later that year, Loudon County negotiated an early exit from its Rural/Metro contract. And the ambulance worker, Cortney Bryson, was fired.Ms. Bryson sued Rural/Metro for wrongful termination, saying the company was \u201ccovering up improper scheduling, staffing and response criteria\u201d in a way that \u201ccould have been shown to be a direct factor in the death of a citizen.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Bryson said she had worked two 24-hour shifts back-to-back before the call about Ms. Maher came in. Ms. Bryson was technically off the clock, she said, but a replacement hadn\u2019t yet arrived.Ms. Bryson said that she offered to go with another colleague, but that they needed permission because the colleague lacked full credentials. While waiting, she smoked.Jennifer Estes, the 911 center director, says it is difficult to link a delayed ambulance to a death. But this case, she said, \u201cleaves some room for someone to wonder, \u2018Could the extra time have made a difference?\u2019\u201dAfter private equity took over Rural/Metro, new posters appeared on the walls of ambulance and fire stations, featuring a caricature of a uniformed employee delivering a mandate: Get a signature.In other words, get patients to sign documents that can be used to bill them.\u201cAlmost always, if the patient is alert, they will be able to sign,\u201d he says.And if the patient can\u2019t sign? Then go to a family member, or a nurse. \u201cThey\u2019ll sign \u2014 because I don\u2019t give up.\u201dThe posters \u2014 just one element of Rural/Metro\u2019s aggressive billing practices while owned by private equity \u2014 promoted \u201cDo the Write Thing,\u201d a policy instructing employees to document every detail of a patient\u2019s treatment. It paired with another initiative, the \u201cCare to Cash\u201d checklist, also instituted during Warburg\u2019s tenure.Warburg Pincus said it was not aware of those specific initiatives.The policies, Rural/Metro said, would help patients by ensuring that bills were accurate. But employees complained that the process distracted them from caregiving and put them in the awkward position of seeking signatures from ill or medicated patients.Do the Write Thing \u201cdidn\u2019t sit well with the firefighters,\u201d said Nico Latini, who has worked at Rural/Metro for a decade. \u201cWe operate under a high level of integrity and we do the right thing every day \u2014 with an R, not a W.\u201dIn the four years that private equity led Rural/Metro, the company was fighting for financial survival. It raised its prices, but patients couldn\u2019t afford those bigger bills.Against that backdrop, the company intensified its collection efforts. And when people didn\u2019t pay, Rural/Metro took them to court.After Warburg left the company, Rural/Metro eliminated Care to Cash and Do the Write Thing. But even under its new non-private equity owner, it still sues to collect some unpaid bills from fire and ambulance customers. Rural/Metro\u2019s new owner said it \u201cwill continue to utilize the legal system to pursue payment when appropriate,\u201d but added that it first asks \u201ccustomers who need assistance to work with us to develop a payment plan that meets their needs.\u201dRural/Metro\u2019s fire departments sell homeowners an annual subscription for fire protection, often ranging from $100 to $500, depending on the property. If a nonsubscriber suffers a fire, Rural/Metro will still answer the call, unlike some other private departments. But then it sends a bill well above the subscription price.Even before private equity took over, the company sued to collect fire bills. Under private equity, this practice flourished.The Times examined court filings in the areas where Rural/Metro operates fire departments and identified dozens of lawsuits filed since 2011, when private equity took over. In these lawsuits, which are unheard-of at tax-funded public fire departments, the company pursued unpaid bills ranging from a few hundred dollars to $59,000.In Knoxville, Tenn., Lester Day faced one of those lawsuits. When his chimney caught fire in March 2013, he dialed 911.When firefighters arrived almost an hour later, 911 records indicate, the house had been reduced to ashes. That didn\u2019t stop Rural/Metro from charging Mr. Day for their response and then placing a $15,000 lien on his home, which he had since rebuilt.\u201cNow I\u2019m having to sell everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Day said in an interview. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201dRural/Metro also filed hundreds of lawsuits against ambulance patients in the same time period, including claims against families of people who died.Public providers are generally less aggressive than private ones, and some opt not to sue at all. The New York Fire Department said it sends letters to ambulance patients but stops short of suing.And yet, patients may not always have the chance to ride in a government ambulance. Private companies now represent about 25 percent of all ambulance providers, according to the National Association of State EMS Officials.The Times spoke with more than a dozen people who had been sued by the company after fires on their property. Many homeowners in Rural/Metro\u2019s jurisdiction did not realize they had to pay for fire protection separately, on top of their taxes. Some thought the subscription fee was unwarranted.\u201cI thought the fire department was paid out of taxes,\u201d said Alice Addie, who lives with her husband, LaVern, in Mesa, Ariz. In 2013, Rural/Metro filed a roughly $7,000 lawsuit against the Addies after their mobile home caught fire.Mr. Addie, a Navy veteran, at first disputed the charges, storming into his local Rural/Metro fire department to question the suit.Ultimately, the company allowed the Addies to pay off their bill in monthly installments.But in the backyard of his home, in the shadow of the rugged mountains of Maricopa County, he explained how they were still struggling with that debt.\u201cWe just eat two meals a day instead of three,\u201d he said.Jessica Silver-Greenberg, Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re, Peter Eavis and Nancy Sharkey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change High on Agenda as Obama and Trudeau Meet for Summit", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 When Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, appeared at the United Nations this spring to sign the Paris climate accord, the rapturous ovation he received was worthy of the celebrity he had become, a leader full of promise and of promises, especially on climate change.The leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada will announce a North America-wide climate partnership, syncing their national policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. They will pledge a joint goal of generating 50 percent of North America\u2019s electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2025, up from 37 percent today. White House officials said that power mix would include wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear energy and coal or gas power paired with carbon capture technology. They will also announce that Mexico will join an existing agreement between the United States and Canada to collectively regulate leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that escapes from oil and gas wells.But all of that will come with a note of caution. Unlike his Canadian counterpart, the American president\u2019s hair is now gray, his speeches wizened by his experiences \u2014 and his message is likely to reflect the hard lessons he has learned as he has tried for nearly eight years to curb the climate-warming emissions of Canada\u2019s neighbor to the south.\u201cTrudeau is facing the same fossil-fuel-lobby reality that Obama encountered,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton administration who now consults on climate policy. \u201cIn a way, Canada is a test case for the penetration of renewable energy in a fossil-rich country.\u201dThe parallels between the leaders are striking, even if the younger man\u2019s efforts have only begun. During his first eight months in office, Mr. Trudeau, 44, has put climate change at the heart of his agenda, after his predecessor, Stephen Harper, a Conservative, reneged on Canada\u2019s commitments under the first global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol.When President Obama, then new to office, attended the 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen, he too was cheered by environmentalists and many world leaders as a drastic departure from his predecessor, George W. Bush, a Texas oilman who had also pulled his country out of Kyoto.But both have learned that adulation on the world stage does not necessarily translate into action at home on a problem as intractable as climate change.After vowing in Copenhagen to make the United States a leader in the fight on global warming, Mr. Obama saw his climate change bill torpedoed in Congress. Only toward the end of his second term was he able to push through a climate policy that he had always thought of as a Plan B \u2014 a suite of regulations on coal-fired power plants \u2014 and those too are stalled, this time by a federal lawsuit.Mr. Obama sees something of a kindred spirit in the prime minister.But on the smaller stage here in Canada\u2019s capital, Mr. Trudeau is bumping up against the same opposing forces that stymied Mr. Obama in Washington.Mr. Trudeau has acknowledged the difficulties. \u201cClimate change will test our intelligence, our compassion and our will,\u201d he told the United Nations in April. \u201cBut we are equal to that challenge.\u201dCanada\u2019s economy relies heavily on oil and gas production, particularly in Alberta, where production of petroleum from the heavily polluting oil sands is a major source of government revenue, and the global collapse of oil prices has left the region suffering. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trudeau is experiencing pushback to efforts to reduce oil demand.It was Mr. Harper who submitted Canada\u2019s climate change plan to the Paris negotiations, a plan widely criticized as weak. But for all his passionate speeches about climate change, Mr. Trudeau can offer an alternative only after he works out a new pact with Canada\u2019s 10 provincial governments. So far, nothing has emerged.\u201cWe were excited by Trudeau in Paris \u2014 he took an opposite stand from the previous government,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to make policies happen.\u201dIndirectly, just the election of Mr. Trudeau helped Mr. Obama carry out a major environmental decision, the rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have carried nearly a million barrels of oil from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. While American environmentalists begged him to reject the project, Mr. Obama delayed his decision for years in part to avoid straining relations with Canada.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election in October 2015 changed the calculus. Although a Keystone supporter, the prime minister had put the pipeline much lower on his agenda than his climate change commitments. Less than a month after his election, Mr. Obama rejected the pipeline.The first time Mr. Obama called Mr. Trudeau after a congratulatory election-night call was to give him a heads-up about his Keystone decision. But the call grew into a broader discussion on joint climate change plans. \u201cThat call could have gone very differently,\u201d said Mr. Obama\u2019s senior climate change adviser, Brian Deese. \u201cBut instead of acrimony, they both resolved that there was a real opportunity for our countries to increase our partnership on climate change.\u201dThe two then met at the Paris climate summit meeting a month later. Then Mr. Trudeau set Canada\u2019s bureaucracy into motion, appointing Catherine McKenna, an international trade lawyer, as his minister of environment and climate change.\u201cCatherine and her team were warmly welcomed. Her message was essentially, \u2018Canada\u2019s back,\u2019\u201d said Todd Stern, the former United States climate envoy.But Mr. Trudeau\u2019s push for a national plan to tax carbon emissions is still a matter of negotiation. Some provinces, including Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, have put plans in place to tax or price emissions. Others have refused.Brad Wall, the premier of oil-producing Saskatchewan, has vowed never to sign any carbon tax agreement.Meanwhile, in the wake of Keystone XL\u2019s failure, politicians from western Canada are pushing Mr. Trudeau to support new pipelines to the United States.Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, said she believed Mr. Trudeau was warming to the idea. \u201cHe\u2019s become more aware of what it means for our economy, what it means to reposition and get our product to market, and get a better price for our product,\u201d she said.And climate change remains a sensitive subject on both sides of the border. When the Canadian Green Party leader, Elizabeth May, linked a huge wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, \u201cto the global climate crisis,\u201d she was rebuked by several other politicians, including Mr. Trudeau. Her comments were seen as a distasteful attempt to use the disaster for political purposes, a charge sometimes mirrored in the United States.Still, support is growing for climate measures in Canada. Ontario, the most populous province, introduced a package of climate change measures earlier this month that included joining Quebec\u2019s cap-and-trade system, which, in turn, is linked to California\u2019s program.Climate diplomats say that while Mr. Trudeau\u2019s international celebrity will not be enough to push through tough domestic climate policies, it will not hurt.\u201cIf you have Trudeau, who is a much more charismatic figure and gets press attention, then that amplifies what he says and gives a sense of momentum,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201dIan Austen reported from Ottawa, and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}

Trump are deadlocked less than a month before the Democratic and Republican presidential conventions, according to a new national poll of registered voters that shows the American electorate feeling disappointed in each candidate.A Quinnipiac University survey released on Wednesday found that 42 percent supported Mrs. Clinton while 40 percent backed Mr. Trump. The poll represents a slight improvement for Mr. Trump, who trailed by four points at the beginning of the month, and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.The numbers come as Mr. Trump has rebooted his campaign after a series of missteps, appointing a new campaign manager and sharpening his rapid-response operation. Mrs. Clinton has been aggressively taking on Mr. Trump with a series of speeches questioning his temperament and picking apart his policies.But the contentious tenor of the campaign is turning off voters, and most of them blame Mr. Trump. Quinnipiac\u2019s poll found that 61 percent think that the campaign is increasing hatred and prejudice in the United States, and 67 percent of those who think that attribute it to the presumptive Republican nominee.\u201cIt would be difficult to imagine a less flattering from-the-gut reaction to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. \u201cVoters find themselves in the middle of a meanspirited, scorched-earth campaign between two candidates they don\u2019t like.\u201dMrs. Clinton is the heavy favorite among women, black voters, Hispanics and younger voters. Mr. Trump leads with men, white voters and those who are over the age of 65.Voters view Mr. Trump as being stronger on the economy and better suited to handle terrorism, while Mrs. Clinton is seen as more trusted by voters on immigration and handling international crises. Mrs. Clinton also gets higher marks when it comes to being prepared to be president and for her intelligence, but Mr. Trump beats her on leadership and honesty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Threatened by Machines: A Once \u2018Stupid\u2019 Concern Gains Respect", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThey replaced horses, didn\u2019t they? That\u2019s how the late, great economist Wassily Leontief responded 35 years ago to those who argued technology would never really replace people\u2019s work.Horses hung around in the labor force for quite some time after they were first challenged by \u201cmodern\u201d communications technologies like the telegraph and the railroad, hauling stuff and people around farms and cities. But when the internal combustion engine came along, horses \u2014 as a critical component of the world economy \u2014 were history.Cutting horses\u2019 oat rations might have delayed their replacement by tractors, but it wouldn\u2019t have stopped it. All that was left to do, for those who cared for 20 million newly unemployed horses, was to put them out to pasture.\u201cHad horses had an opportunity to vote and join the Republican or Democratic Party,\u201d Leontief wrote, they might have been able to get \u201cthe necessary appropriation from Congress.\u201dAs the idea sinks in that humans as workhorses might also be on the way out, what happens if the job market stops doing the job of providing a living wage for hundreds of millions of people? How will the economy spread money around, so people can afford to pay the rent?What if, say, the bottom quarter of the population in the United States and Europe simply couldn\u2019t find a job at a wage that could cover the cost of basic staples? What if smart-learning machines took out lawyers and bankers? Or even, God forbid, journalists and economists?But that doesn\u2019t end the case for a universal income, as many of the brightest minds in Silicon Valley will tell anyone who asks. If we are facing a not-so-distant future of robot-fueled growth and rising potential for mass disemployment, maybe it\u2019s time to start thinking about how to provide a lot more income that isn\u2019t directly tied to a job.\u201cThe point for me is that these two scenarios \u2014 robots lead to nirvana and hell \u2014 can happen side by side,\u201d Professor Sachs told me. \u201cGenerally capital wins and all labor can lose. It shows up as a fall in the labor share of national income.\u201dIn that event, preventing a dynastic society of relentlessly growing inequality would require large-scale redistribution. It could even take the form of a universal income paid for with a hefty estate tax \u2014 using some of the vast profits accruing to the owners of robots to finance a living for everybody else.Since most paid human labor would be pointless, the disincentive to work produced by a monthly check would be unimportant. People could devote themselves to unpaid creative affairs.\u201cDon\u2019t destroy the robots,\u201d Professor Sachs said. But recognize that \u201cnot everybody would be better off as a result of market forces. With redistribution everybody could be made better off.\u201dIt concluded that only 9 percent of American workers faced a high risk of being replaced by an automaton. Austrians, Germans and Spaniards were the most vulnerable, but only 12 percent of them risked losing their jobs to information technology.And yet the nature of the new research, patiently counting how many jobs are likely to stay or go, suggests how far economists have come from the days when they simply dismissed popular fears of technological unemployment as ludicrous.He reminisced about his undergraduate days at M.I.T. in the 1970s, when the debate over the idea of technological unemployment pitted \u201csmart people,\u201d exemplified by the great economist Robert Solow, and \u201cstupid people,\u201d \u201cexemplified by a bunch of sociologists.\u201dIt was stupid to think technological progress would reduce employment. If technology increased productivity \u2014 allowing companies and their workers to make more stuff in less time \u2014 people would have more money to spend on more things that would have to be made, creating jobs for other people.But at some point Mr. Summers experienced an epiphany. \u201cIt sort of occurred to me,\u201d he said. \u201cSuppose the stupid people were right. What would it look like?\u201d And what it looked like fits pretty well with what the world looks like today.\u201cMaybe the stupid people weren\u2019t quite as stupid as I thought they were,\u201d Mr. Summers conceded. \u201cThis was at least a serious concern that had to be thought about.\u201dIn a world in which many Americans do not work during large chunks of their lives, we might have to conceive of Social Security and disability much more broadly than we do today.That, Mr. Summers said, \u201ccould start to look like a universal income.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019ve been charged, essentially, with interfering with the harvesting of one of the 21st century\u2019s most valuable resources: sand.Believe it or not, we use more of this natural resource than any other except water and air. Sand is the thing modern cities are made of. Pretty much every apartment block, office tower and shopping mall from Beijing to Lagos, Nigeria, is made at least partly with concrete, which is basically just sand and gravel stuck together with cement. Every yard of asphalt road that connects all those buildings is also made with sand. So is every window in every one of those buildings.Sand is the essential ingredient that makes modern life possible. And we are starting to run out.That\u2019s mainly because the number and size of cities is exploding, especially in the developing world. Every year there are more people on the planet, and every year more of them move to cities. Since 1950, the world\u2019s urban population has ballooned to over 3.9 billion from 746 million.To build those cities, people are pulling untold amounts of sand out of the ground. Usable sand is a finite resource. Desert sand, shaped more by wind than by water, generally doesn\u2019t work for construction. To get the sand we need, we are stripping riverbeds, floodplains and beaches.Extracting the stuff is an estimated $70 billion industry. It runs the gamut from multinational companies\u2019 deploying enormous dredges to villagers toting shovels and buckets. In places where onshore sources have been exhausted, sand miners are turning to the seas.This often inflicts terrible costs on the environment. In India, river sand mining is disrupting ecosystems, killing countless fish and birds. In Indonesia, some two dozen small islands are believed to have disappeared since 2005 because of sand mining. In Vietnam, miners have torn up hundreds of acres of forest to get at the sandy soil underneath.People are getting hurt, too. Sand mining has been blamed for accidental deaths in Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Gambia. In India and Indonesia, activists and government officials confronting black-market sand mining gangs have been killed.Stronger regulations can prevent a lot of this damage, and do in most developed countries. But there\u2019s a downside. Sand is tremendously heavy, which makes it expensive to transport. If you forbid sand mining in your backyard \u2014 as many American communities are trying to do \u2014 then it has to be trucked in from somewhere else. That drives up the price. Concrete is relatively cheap; if the cost of making a new building or road were to double, it could hit the economy hard.Not to mention the extra truck traffic and pollution. California state officials estimated that if the average hauling distance for sand and gravel increased to 50 miles from 25 miles, trucks would burn through nearly 50 million more gallons of diesel fuel every year.We can make more sand, but crushing rock or pulverizing concrete is costly, and the resulting sand is ill suited for many applications. We can use alternative substances for some purposes, but what other substance can we possibly find 40 billion tons of, every year?The fishing villages in the mangrove-rich estuaries of Cambodia\u2019s Koh Kong province might be the canaries in the global sand mine. For years, villagers have complained that rampant sand mining is wiping out the crabs and fish that provide their living. Locals told me on a recent visit that families have had to send members to work in Phnom Penh garment factories, or have simply moved away. The dredging also threatens endangered native dolphins, turtles and otters.Mr. Gonzalez-Davidson, who lives in Barcelona, is petitioning to be allowed back to attend his own trial. Meanwhile, the three jailed Cambodians have been denied bail for the past 10 months. Their trial has finally been scheduled for the end of June.There\u2019s an urgent question of justice for them. For the rest of us, there\u2019s a profound lesson. Hardly anyone thinks about sand, where it comes from or what we do to get it. But a world of seven billion people, more and more of whom want apartments to live in and offices to work in and malls to shop in, can\u2019t afford that luxury anymore.It once seemed as if the planet had such boundless supplies of oil, water, trees and land that we didn\u2019t need to worry about them. But of course, we\u2019re learning the hard way that none of those things are infinite, and the price we\u2019ve paid so far for using them is going up fast. We\u2019re having to conserve, reuse, find alternatives for and generally get smarter about how we use those natural resources. That\u2019s how we need to start thinking about sand.Vince Beiser, a journalist, is working on a book about the global black market in sand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Istanbul Airport Attack Leaves at Least 41 Dead", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosISTANBUL \u2014 Three suicide attackers killed at least 41 people and wounded dozens more at Istanbul\u2019s main airport on Tuesday night, in the latest in a string of terrorist attacks in Turkey, a NATO ally once seen as a bastion of stability but now increasingly consumed by the chaos of the Middle East.The attack began shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday, Turkish officials said, when two gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at a security checkpoint outside Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport, one of Europe\u2019s busiest. They then detonated their explosives, setting off two fireballs. A third attacker set off explosives in the parking lot.Turkey has faced a string of terrorist attacks over the past year, including several in Istanbul, as it confronts threats from both the Islamic State and Kurdish militants fighting a war with the Turkish state in the southeast.The Istanbul governor\u2019s office said on Wednesday morning that 41 people had died. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Tuesday that 147 people were wounded.Most of the dead were Turks, although some were foreigners, Mr. Yildirim said. The three attackers were killed when they detonated their explosives, he said.Outside the terminal on Tuesday night, as calls went out on local news channels for blood donors and the Turkish authorities imposed a ban on publishing images of the scene of the attack, ambulances streamed in, while hundreds of dazed and scared travelers sat on the sidewalk waiting for information. And more travelers, many in tears, were streaming out of the airport.\u201cThere were blood splatters everywhere,\u201d said Eylul Kaya, 37, sitting outside with her 1-year-old son. \u201cI covered my boy\u2019s eyes and we ran out.\u201dAs Turkey has faced several deadly terrorist attacks over the past year, Ms. Kaya said, she never thought she would find herself in the middle of one. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched these attacks on TV for months, but I never imagined it would happen with so much security in an airport,\u201d she said.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan noted that the bombing came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and he called for global unity in the fight against terrorism.\u201cDespite paying a heavy price, Turkey has the power, determination and capacity to continue the fight against terrorism until the end,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a statement.Mr. Erdogan added: \u201cThe bombs that exploded in Istanbul today could have gone off at any airport in any city around the world. Make no mistake: For terrorist organizations, there is no difference between Istanbul and London, Ankara and Berlin, Izmir and Chicago, or Antalya and Rome.\u201dTurkey has held itself up as an exemplar of a Muslim democracy and has sought to influence the region by reaching out to its Muslim neighbors. Early on, when Syria slipped into civil war in 2011, Turkey pushed for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad and began helping Syrian rebel groups, allowing the transit of fighters and weapons across its territory.Turkey\u2019s Western allies, including the United States, blamed the country\u2019s open-border policy for allowing extremist groups like the Islamic State to become powerful inside Syria, and the chaos has increasingly spilled over into Turkey, with terrorist attacks and waves of refugees.Turkey, a NATO member, has often been at odds with its Western allies over its approach to the region. The United States and others believe that Turkey\u2019s early policy on Syria enabled the growth of the Islamic State, and they have long felt that Turkey was a reluctant partner in fighting the terrorist group. Turkey, in turn, has grown angry over American support for Syrian Kurdish rebels that it sees as terrorists because of links to Kurdish militants inside Turkey.An explosion near a courthouse in Izmir was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in Turkey.Some of the recent terrorist attacks in Turkey \u2014 including a car bombing in Ankara, the capital, in February \u2014 have been attributed to Kurdish militants, which has heightened tensions between Ankara and Washington over the support the United States has given to Syrian Kurdish militants fighting the Islamic State.Judith Favish, a South African who was heading home, said she was at the counter checking in for her flight when she heard gunfire and then an explosion.\u201cSo I jumped across and hid under the counter and then someone told us to run, so I ran and hid in a cafeteria,\u201d she said, standing outside the terminal. \u201cWe waited there for an hour and then we were told to get out, but no one has given us any information. I have no clothes, phone, money, nothing. Haven\u2019t called my family. No one is telling me anything.\u201dShe paused, and then said that she had seen blood everywhere near the entranceway.Flights out of Istanbul were immediately canceled Tuesday night, and ones on their way were diverted. The airport, the third busiest in Europe and the 11th busiest in the world, was closed after the attack, but Mr. Yildirim, the prime minister, said early Wednesday that it had reopened. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded flights between the United States and Ataturk airport after the attack, but lifted the order late Tuesday.Although no group claimed responsibility for the attack, initial speculation centered on Turkey\u2019s two main enemies: the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and Kurdish militants linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has waged war with Turkey for more than three decades. Last year, peace talks with the P.K.K. broke down, and the two sides have been at war since. But hours after the attack, Turkish officials turned their attention toward the Islamic State.\u201cThe terrorists arrived at the airport in a taxi,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said. \u201cWe will share more details about the attack later. There was no security lapse at the airport.\u201dTurkey has been rocked by a series of bombings since 2014, and the attacks have been increasing in frequency. In some cases, Kurdish militants have claimed responsibility, but in others, including ones this year in Istanbul\u2019s old city and on its main pedestrian boulevard, Turkish officials have blamed the Islamic State.\u201cOfficial claims of responsibility for most attacks the Islamic State has been accused of executing in Turkey have been notable by their absence,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an email. \u201cHowever, during the past year, a significant increase in focus on the Erdogan government\u2019s policies within Islamic State propaganda has been used to build expectations the group will expand its terrorism operations into Turkey.\u201dMustafa Akyol, a prominent Turkish columnist, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening, \u201cThe fact that the attack came right after the Turkish-Israeli deal might be not an accident \u2014 if ISIS is that fast in response.\u201dOther analysts, though, noted that attacks involving multiple suicide bombers take time to prepare and are not typically attempted on very short notice.\u201cUnfortunately, we see the side effects of a disastrous Syria policy that has brought terrorism into the heart of Istanbul and Ankara,\u201d said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker who is now chairman of the Center for Strategic Communication, a research organization, in Ankara. \u201cThis is obviously intended to create an atmosphere of chaos and hit the economy and tourism.\u201dWhen the attack happened, Asli Aydintasbas, an analyst and writer on Turkish affairs, was on a plane bound for Istanbul but was rerouted to Ankara, where the airport was filled with stranded and confused tourists, double-checking with airport workers that they had in fact landed elsewhere.\u201cOur world is turned upside down,\u201d said Ms. Aydintasbas, who has chronicled Turkey\u2019s descent in to chaos in recent years in her columns.Referring to Istanbul, and the stature it attained in recent years as a global tourist destination, she said: \u201cIt was a happening town, cutting edge in arts and culture. It\u2019s the kind of place that Cond\u00e9 Nast would write about. Now this is a Middle Eastern country where these things happen.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of dead, using information from The Associated Press. At the time the article was posted, the authorities said that at least 36 people had been killed, not 50. The same error appeared in the headline.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the American university that the sister of Ahmet Samanci, a graduate student, attends. It is the University at Buffalo, not the University of Buffalo. Safak Timur contributed reporting from Istanbul, Rukmini Callimachi from Paris, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buybacks by Companies Like Apple May Signal Danger, Not Growth", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut Apple and the stock market would probably be in worse shape now if not for an important factor: Companies like Apple have been buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of their own shares at a record-breaking pace, returning money to shareholders even as earnings lag.At the moment, corporate America is sitting on an enormous cash hoard. Many companies have been using the money in an epic share-buying spree \u2014 one that has increased in intensity even as earnings have declined. In the 12 months through March, operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped to $854.9 billion from $989 billion, but buybacks increased to $589 billion from $538.1 billion. That is the largest total for buybacks ever in a 12-month period, according to a report from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.While Apple ranked second in buybacks to Gilead Sciences in the first quarter, it has been the undisputed king of buybacks over some longer periods. Apple spent $36.8 billion on buybacks in the 12 months through March, more than double the $16.6 billion spent by Microsoft, the next-ranking company. And over the five years through March, Apple bought back $116.6 billion worth of its own shares, followed by Microsoft with $45.7 billion, Pfizer with $44.9 billion and Oracle with $43.7 billion.A recent surge in buybacks may have been stimulated by problems in the stock market, which fell sharply at the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said, \u201cthe pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn.\u201d More than three-fifths of the S.&P. 500 companies bought back at least some of their own shares in the quarter, he said, and 139 bought enough over 12 months to reduce their share count by at least 4 percent.As a matter of simple math, reducing the number of shares by 4 percent will increase earnings per share by 4 percent, too, and will tend to bolster short-term prices.Buybacks are a critical part of Goldman\u2019s positive stock market outlook for the remainder of 2016: \u201cWe maintain our forecast that net buybacks will equal $450 billion in 2016 and remain the largest source of U.S. equity demand this year,\u201d the company said.Low and even negative interest rates resulting from the sluggish global economy and from the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been enabling big corporations to borrow money cheaply, even when those companies\u2019 earnings have declined, and even when they have had no immediate productive use for the funds.Such maneuvers often produce good results for stocks over the short term. Over longer periods, however, unless earnings grow substantially, financial engineering like this will take you only so far.For now, buyback authorizations by American companies continue to increase, and there is so much cash on hand that the current trend can easily continue for many months. At some point, buybacks won\u2019t be an elixir for share prices. They will be a symptom of an overextended market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Chapter for Classic Paris Bookstore: Books Printed on Demand", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Gauthier Charrier, a graphic design student, stepped inside one of Paris\u2019s newest bookstores and wondered, \u201cWhere are all the books?\u201d\u201cI saw this empty, open space \u2014 just a couple of stools \u2014 and I wondered, \u2018Did someone mess up?\u2019\u201d Mr. Charrier, 20, said.No one messed up.The pronounced stock shortage inside the Librairie des Puf, run by the publisher University Press of France, or Les Puf for short, is not the result of an ordering mistake, but the heart of the shop\u2019s business model.There are books, but they are not delivered in advance from wholesalers. They are printed on request, before the customer\u2019s very eyes, on an Espresso Book Machine. On Demand Books, the American company that manufactures the machine, chose the name as a nod to an activity you can complete in the five minutes it takes to print a book: Have a quick coffee.Labeled, not so modestly, the \u201cGutenberg press of the 21st century\u201d by its creators, the machine sits in a back corner of the shop, humming as it turns PDFs into paperbacks. Customers use tablets to select the titles for print \u2014 adding, if they want to, their own handwritten inscriptions \u2014 while sipping coffee in the light and airy storefront in the Latin Quarter of Paris. \u201cThe customers are all surprised,\u201d said the shop\u2019s director, Alexandre Gaudefroy. \u201cAt first, they\u2019re a little uncomfortable with the tablets. After all, you come to a bookshop to look at books. But thanks to the machine and the tablets, the customer holds a digital library in their hands.\u201dFrom a business standpoint, Mr. Gaudefroy said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about space for the stock. We\u2019re in a space which measures less than 80 meters squared, and I can offer readers as many titles as I want.\u201d And that is a lot of titles. All 5,000 books published by Les Puf are available, as well as an additional three million books compiled by On Demand Books, including titles from 10 large American publishers and the public domain.Les Puf\u2019s prestige in the industry has helped it secure even more titles \u2014 a group of French publishers are expected to hand over PDFs of their titles in a few weeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting is that, thanks to the on-demand model, we can revive old titles, which we previously hadn\u2019t bothered with because they\u2019d only sell five or 10 copies in a year,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cOn-demand, it\u2019s a new economy for us.\u201dAbout 2,000 out-of-print Puf titles will be made available to customers in the coming months, Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cWe\u2019re completely revising the chain of book production because we\u2019re a bookseller, a publisher, a printer and also a distributor,\u201d he said.It is a radical reinvention of a store that first opened its doors in 1921. The original Librairie des Puf occupied a far larger, multilevel space in the corner of Place de la Sorbonne, and had packed window displays and a bustling intellectual crowd from nearby universities. It was long a cultural and academic symbol, until it was forced to close because of falling profits and soaring rents. Then, about 10 years ago, the site was sold to a men\u2019s-clothing chain, much to the chagrin of locals.But its closing was no exception. From 2000 to 2014, 28 percent of Paris bookstores closed, according to a 2015 report from the Paris Urban Planning Agency, a body assembled by the City Council in 1967 to chart social and economic evolution in the French capital. Crippling rent increases in Paris\u2019s densely populated center were mostly to blame, as well as growing competition from e-commerce sites that are able to offer far more titles than a cramped city bookstore. The decline in sales of newspapers and magazines also contributed, since these are often sold alongside books in French bookstores.The Latin Quarter, which has the highest concentration of bookshops in the city, was among the worst-hit areas. In an effort to protect the neighborhood\u2019s unique character \u2014 and prevent so-called blandification \u2014 the Paris City Council in 2008 made it the center of its Vital\u2019Quartier program. The program buys retail spaces across Paris, renovates them and rents them to small culturally significant enterprises at far below market rates. Les Puf was leased one of these spaces on Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, allowing it to reopen in March just a few blocks from where it closed.\u201cWe\u2019re already thinking about opening in other big cities in France \u2014 in university towns like Lille, Bordeaux and Lyon,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cAfter a few weeks of business, there\u2019s a real commercial motivation for doing so because, well, we\u2019re selling a lot of books. A lot more than predicted. We thought we\u2019d sell 10, 15 books in a day, but it\u2019s been more like 30 or 40.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an investment, but if it\u2019s well managed, it can be very profitable,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. Along with the low rent for its retail space and the elimination of the cost of overproducing books that may not sell, Les Puf benefits from an affordable two-year lease on the Espresso Book Machine from the French printing association Ireneo. And France\u2019s fixed-book pricing law, which prohibits anyone from selling books at a discount, means Les Puf can charge the price set by the publisher for each book. \u201cA lot of publishers I know are interested in the idea, especially when we tell them how little it costs us,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said.So far, the store has relied on foot traffic and the pull of the machine\u2019s novelty to draw customers, but a social media and leafleting campaign aimed at students \u2014 Les Puf\u2019s original demographic \u2014 is planned.Les Puf\u2019s success is not an anomaly. Times are still tough for brick-and-mortar shops, but signs of a recovery are widespread. In the United States, sales in physical bookstores rose by 2.5 percent last year, the first increase since 2007. In Britain, the largest chain bookseller, Waterstones, announced a return to profitability at the end of last year after the arrival of the indie book-selling success story James Daunt as managing director.Mr. Daunt decentralized control of the chain\u2019s 275 stores, encouraging individual managers to modify their stores\u2019 layouts for the local book-buying audience, thus scrapping an ingrained industry practice that had effectively allowed publishers to dictate which books appeared in best-seller sections.Independent bookstores, too, are beginning to carve a path out of their business\u2019s decade of decline. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry which is very much starting to rebound,\u201d said Nick Brackenbury, one of the founders of NearSt, a mobile application created in London that is helping to wean customers off buying books on Amazon.com, encouraging them to return instead to their local stores.\u201cBookshops are starting to do lots of little innovative things and getting people to come back into them,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said. For many bookstores that have the space, like Gogol & Company in Milan, La Fugitiva in Madrid and Java Bookshop in Amsterdam, remaking themselves as hybrid bookstore-coffee shops has become a reliable way to attract customers. Other shops are emphasizing something unavailable online \u2014 the experience of visiting a bookstore.The Society Club in London\u2019s Soho district is as much a cocktail club and members\u2019 lounge as a bookstore. Books for Cooks \u2014 a store in Notting Hill entirely devoted to cookbooks \u2014 offers a sensory experience by cooking up one of its books\u2019 many recipes in an open kitchen at the back of the store every morning.Mr. Brackenbury and his team are allowing bookstores to innovate on a more fundamental level: convenience. \u201cThe main feedback we get from our users is: \u2018I buy from Amazon reluctantly because it\u2019s so easy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone will say, \u2018I want to support my local shops.\u2019 But few people actually do today because it\u2019s so much hard work.\u201dNearSt aims to help local shops adapt to the needs of the modern customers by making local shop inventories \u201cshoppable\u201d from a smartphone, allowing customers to search for titles, find local stores that sell them and see routes there. \u201cWe just want local stores to be able to offer customers something which is just better than Amazon,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said.Advertisement"}

It also allows you to waste hours scrolling through Facebook or looking for the latest deals on Amazon.More powerful computing systems can predict the weather better than any meteorologist or beat human champions in complex board games like chess.One place to look at this disconnect is in the doctor\u2019s office. Dr. Peter Sutherland, a family physician in Tennessee, made the shift to computerized patient records from paper in the last few years. There are benefits to using electronic health records, Dr. Sutherland says, but grappling with the software and new reporting requirements has slowed him down. He sees fewer patients, and his income has slipped.\u201cI\u2019m working harder and getting a little less,\u201d he said.The productivity puzzle has given rise to a number of explanations in recent years \u2014 and divided economists into technology pessimists and optimists.The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait.Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity.Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its \u201cdigital potential,\u201d the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records.The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors\u2019 offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government.\u201cThe government funding has made a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs.\u201dThe electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. \u201cPeople confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish,\u201d said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd so little has gone into changing work so far.\u201dThe government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive.Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules.Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging.Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers\u2019 revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealth\u2019s cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealth\u2019s share is less than 5 percent of the group\u2019s revenue.Today, Dr. Sutherland\u2019s personal income and the medical group\u2019s revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014.Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact.Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes.Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records.Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients.He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss.He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, aren\u2019t everything. \u201cMy patients are better served,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happier.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect of digital technology on productivity growth rendered incorrectly the name of a medical technology provider. It is Athenahealth, not Athena Health.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1,200 for Coach? How to Beat the New Airfare Rules", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayA few months ago, the nation\u2019s three major airlines quietly tweaked their fare rules. The result? Travelers encountered notably higher prices for certain multicity round-trips (visiting several cities by plane) and open-jaw trips (flying into one city, traveling to another by, say, car or train, then flying home from that city).So what exactly is going on? How widespread is this pricing discrepancy? And are there ways to avoid getting fleeced?Additionally, much to my surprise, when running a multicity search among New York; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Chicago on United\u2019s website, a note appeared: \u201cUsing multiple one-way searches may return lower fares,\u201d it said. A helpful (and most unexpected) tip.But not all searches go quite so well. On the American Airlines website I ran a search starting in San Francisco and flying to Portland, Ore., then flying from Seattle back to San Francisco. American priced that trip as $2,081.20 nonstop in economy. Priced instead as two one-way flights for the same dates on AA.com (from San Francisco to Portland and then from Seattle to San Francisco), it was $334 nonstop in economy, nearly $1,750 cheaper.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is testing in limited numbers of markets,\u201d he said, adding that it took the airlines a little while to catch on to the fact that the changes they made to solve one problem unintentionally created another: eye-popping multicity fares. \u201cIt was taking a jackhammer to swat an ant.\u201dAll of this means that when flight shopping on an airline\u2019s website you must take time to price your trip in different ways, as well as make use of the various search options.Make sure to set your search preferences for the lowest available or best fare, not a refundable fare (which will be higher). All three major United States airlines allow you to adjust that. To be sure you\u2019re getting the best price on a multicity trip, run a search for the trip as a round-trip ticket as well as separate one-way fares. In some cases you may want to consider a round-trip ticket between the cities where you plan to start and end your trip, along with a couple of one-way tickets in between.If sticking to your budget is the priority, you may find that it makes more sense to fly with an ultra low-cost carrier, even for part of your trip.Just keep in mind that there\u2019s no hard and fast rule when it comes to fares. Sometimes it will pay to book each leg as a separate one-way ticket; other times a round-trip will be cheaper. A recent search on Delta.com for a multicity trip in June with flights in the main cabin from New York City to Miami and then from Orlando back to New York City wasn\u2019t just cheaper than booking each leg separately: It was nearly half the cost, approximately $320, in contrast to about $630.Mr. Leff thinks the high prices that are turning up for certain trips as a result of the fare rule tweaks will ultimately go away, though it may take some time.\u201cIn the meantime people need to spend extra attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more work for the consumer to make sure they\u2019re getting the best deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Jersey Senate Passes $15 Minimum Wage, Setting Up Clash With Christie", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byDemocratic lawmakers in New Jersey set the stage on Thursday for another showdown with Gov. Chris Christie over the state\u2019s minimum wage.The State Senate in Trenton passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to more than $15 an hour by 2021. That would amount to an increase of 80 percent over four years from the state\u2019s current minimum wage of $8.38 an hour.If Mr. Christie, a Republican, signs the bill, which has already passed the State Assembly, New Jersey would join New York and California as the only states scheduled to raise their minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. Some cities outside those states, including Seattle and Washington, have adopted plans to reach $15 minimums. (The national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.)Mr. Christie did not comment on the Senate\u2019s passage on Thursday, but he has made his position clear in the past. He spoke in April of \u201cthe reckless effort to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour\u201d and said it could have a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on the state\u2019s economy.Democratic leaders have indicated that they would respond to a veto by seeking a public referendum next year on raising the wage to $15. That effort would be a replay of what they accomplished in 2013, when they circumvented Mr. Christie\u2019s veto of a more modest increase in the minimum wage.In November 2013, voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution that raised the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014 and allowed for annual increases based on the rate of inflation. But that plan backfired in a way this year when the official measure of inflation was negative, leaving the minimum wage at $8.38 for a second year.In the meantime, the movement known as the Fight for 15 gained momentum. Several cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, adopted plans to raise their minimums to $15 an hour, and California and New York followed suit.Those moves left New Jersey as one of the country\u2019s most expensive places to live that had not accepted a $15 minimum. A study published in September 2014 by the United Way of Northern New Jersey found that the average household budget necessary to support a single adult was $27,552\u2014 a sum that equates to year\u2019s salary at nearly $14 an hour.The National Employment Law Project estimates that an increase to $15 would result in raises for about one-fourth of all workers in New Jersey. It would also increase the share of workers in the country covered by a $15 minimum wage to more than one in five, said Paul K. Sonn, program director of the employment law project, which advocates for low-wage workers.\u201cThe $15 minimum wage is roaring across America and delivering the first big raises for workers at the bottom in decades,\u201d Mr. Sonn said in an interview. \u201cGovernor Christie will have a chance to show which side he is on, the side of the struggling middle class or the side of low-paying corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Walmart.\u201dStephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and president of the State Senate, said he expected that \u201cthe governor will more than likely flat-out veto\u201d the bill, which passed 21 to 18. If that happens, Mr. Sweeney said, the Democrats plan to pass legislation calling for a question on the statewide ballot in November 2017, when Mr. Sweeney could be running to succeed Mr. Christie.Mr. Sweeney said he believed that there was broad public support for a $15 minimum and that the measure would easily be approved. He admitted that he had sponsored the 2013 amendment and that \u201cwe just didn\u2019t get it right.\u201dMr. Sweeney said that the last increase in the minimum wage did not hurt the state\u2019s economy as some business leaders and Republican officials had predicted. But, he added, \u201cWe thought it was going to work out better than it did.\u201d Still, he said, the state had gained 91,000 jobs since then.\u201cThe reality is where they\u2019ve done this, the economy has actually gotten better,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cThis gives people an opportunity to have more buying power.\u201dAn article on June 24 about a vote by the New Jersey Senate to eventually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour referred incorrectly to the figure $27,552 cited in a study by the United Way of Northern New Jersey. That amount is the average household budget necessary to support a single adult, not the average household income of a single adult. The article also misstated the year the study was published. It was 2014, not 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Standing Up for Democracy in Venezuela", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialAs growing lawlessness, looting and hunger threaten to plunge Venezuela into a state of anarchy, its neighbors remain strikingly reluctant to confront President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.There have been unabashed enablers, a shrinking but resolute camp of left-wing governments that have served as apologists for the despotic president. There are the co-opted, a pack of Caribbean and Central American nations that have turned a blind eye to Mr. Maduro\u2019s abuses in exchange for subsidized oil. And there are the ambivalent, a large and powerful group of nations that only gently criticize the government of Venezuela, if at all, for its mounting human rights violations.On Thursday, diplomats from across the hemisphere are scheduled to convene in Washington at the request of Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, to discuss Venezuela\u2019s descent into chaos. Key members of this organization, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the United States, should demand that the Venezuelan government start allowing the delivery of humanitarian aid and permit the opposition to hold a referendum on whether Mr. Maduro\u2019s term should end early.Clearly, the Maduro government has failed to govern democratically, a commitment required of all O.A.S. member nations. Mr. Maduro has packed crucial state institutions, including the Supreme Court, with loyalists and has stymied the opposition-run Parliament at every turn. His government has kept political opponents arbitrarily jailed for years.In the long run, Venezuela will most likely need help from international financial institutions to start addressing its runaway inflation, avoid defaulting on its loans and diversify an economy that has been perilously dependent on oil and vulnerable to its price fluctuations.None of this is likely to happen unless the political opposition succeeds in its push to oust Mr. Maduro through constitutional means. But without firm international pressure, Mr. Maduro, whose term ends in 2019, may find a way to sabotage the recall vote.If regional leaders fail to take a strong and united stand against Mr. Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s crisis can only be expected to grow. That would lead to more violent political confrontations and, quite likely, an exodus into neighboring countries. Leaders in those nations should realize that this disaster is now very close to becoming their problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers\u2019 Wages Rebound, While Wall Street Squirms", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byStrategiesWall Street hasn\u2019t had much to cheer about lately. But there are some signs that rank-and-file workers do.Where the economy is heading now isn\u2019t clear. But consider the overall picture since the recession ended in 2009. Until about a year ago, big businesses and investors prospered, despite extremely slow economic growth, while wages for most employees languished.As the Federal Reserve and other central banks pumped out money, corporations racked up handsome profits, and those fortunate enough to hold shares in big companies made fortunes. If you had invested $10,000 in a Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fund at the end of February 2009, it would have more than tripled by the end of last year, including dividends.Rising corporate profits provided fuel for the sizzling stock market. By the fourth quarter of 2011, pretax corporate profits reached 14.5 percent of national income, the highest level since 1950, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data compiled by Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher.What was good for business wasn\u2019t great for workers, however. By 2012, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie had dropped to the lowest level since 1951, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, found. Companies bolstered profits by cutting costs \u2014 including the cost of labor \u2014 and they got away with it because unemployment was high and jobs were scarce.Almost imperceptibly, the recovery entered a new stage. Over the last year or so, conditions appeared to have changed \u2014 for business, investors and workers.For many rank-and-file workers, the labor market improved significantly, even if the gains have been uneven. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent from 5 percent in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, a bright spot in a report filled mainly with grim numbers. For example, job creation slackened sharply, with a net gain of a mere 38,000 jobs. But the report also confirmed that hourly wages have been rising, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the year.On Wednesday, in the survey known as the \u201cbeige book,\u201d the Federal Reserve reported that \u201ctight labor markets were widely noted,\u201d and pay raises were \u201cconcentrated in areas of labor tightness.\u201dPurchasing power for many workers has finally climbed back to prerecession levels. By March, using inflation-adjusted figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that median weekly wages had at last surpassed their 2009 peak.Mr. Bivens cautioned that the real-wage improvement last year was at least partly because of unusually low inflation, and not entirely because of monetary wage increases. Oil, gas and other commodity prices plummeted last year, making wage growth, after adjusting for inflation, look relatively high. \u201cIt\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not clear whether that growth rate for real wages is sustainable,\u201d he said.Still, labor\u2019s share of the corporate income pie has unquestionably been growing, though it hasn\u2019t regained the prerecession levels of 2007. Reaching that modest goal will require further economic growth. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly making headway, but we have a while to go before I\u2019d say conditions were normal,\u201d Mr. Bivens said.On the other hand, from the standpoint of corporate executives and stock market investors, conditions have worsened considerably over the last year. The market has struggled to hold its own. The S.&P. 500 hasn\u2019t reached a new peak since May 2015. Corporate profits, which had supported the long bull market in stocks, have been weak. In the first quarter of 2016, earnings declined 5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimated.On Tuesday, Mr. Yardeni summarized the year this way: \u201cLabor compensation is up 5 percent while profits are down 5.8 percent. Workers finally may be gaining income share as the labor market has tightened, boosting both employment and hourly pay. This development is squeezing profit margins.\u201dRising incomes spurred consumer spending, which grew in April at its fastest rate since 2014. Inflation remains very low but has been rising. Investors are betting that on the heels of the latest jobs report, the Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise interest rates this month.Further wage increases and a sustained uptick in inflation could induce the Fed to act later on. But unless such developments are accompanied by much stronger economic growth, neither workers nor businesses nor investors are likely to celebrate very loudly.An article last Sunday about signs of rising wages as the labor market tightens misspelled the surname of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s director of research and policy, who tracks wage trends. He is Josh Bivens, not Bevins.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Bunk Beds", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationThe punishing rents of New York City breed unusual compromises. Sophomore year of college, I snagged a one-bedroom at the top of a seventh-floor walk-up in Lower Manhattan. The week I moved in, a neighbor pulled me aside and offered wisdom on the climb: \u201cYour legs will get used to it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut your heart never will.\u201d How literally she meant this, I was never sure.The apartment was tiny \u2014 I had to shuffle sideways like a crab to get into my bathroom \u2014 and I was intent on justifying the unreasonable rent. So the day before I moved in, I ordered a bunk bed on Amazon. I figured that with an extra berth, I could effectively double the apartment\u2019s holding capacity, allow out-of-towners to avoid hotels and offer refuge for friends, whether locked out of their own homes or weary of the slog back to Brooklyn.The bed arrived as a sprawl of metal poles, each embalmed in white lacquer. I had picked a model with a full-size bed on bottom and a twin on top. While a traditional twin-on-twin evokes the accommodations of childhood and camp, prison and the military \u2014 a sign, somehow, of both playfulness and austerity \u2014 the twin-over-full variety signals something entirely different, and possibly even transgressive. Instead of two sleepers, the bed seemed to beckon heterodox groupings of three or four.Most evenings, the bunk bed offered itself up as a choice. Did I want to transcend worldly concerns, swaddled and suspended in a criblike twin bed that enveloped my lanky build? Or did I prefer to brave the open expanse of the full bed like a taxpaying adult? The decision involved a touch of foresight. The bed was wedged against three walls, and waking up on the twin meant either shimmying down the ladder (and having my ribs played like a xylophone by the rungs) or taking a morning death-leap from the top, more invigorating than a cup of coffee.During the trial run, close friends took the bottom, and I, rather religiously, took the top. I was convinced I would be horribly maimed should the contraption collapse \u2014 \u201cPlease! You take the bottom,\u201d I insisted, shrouding my dread in panicked largess. But once the lights were off, youthful exchanges about life, love and the cosmos raged. We were recumbent along an intimate vertical axis, and our words, unmarred by dubious glances, spilled into the air. All night, the whoosh of cars outside echoed through the room like waves against a hull; until sleep finally took us, we were out at sea together, stowed away safely.The bed swiftly earned its claim to being one of my most prized possessions. Then, my parents came to visit.One evening, I left the apartment to pick up milk for the morning\u2019s cereal. When I returned, they were absent from the living room, and the bedroom door was closed. I opened the door, and I regret it, as those who open doors so often do. My parents, stumbling through a defense, confessed that the bunk bed had sparked dormant passions \u2014 the bed\u2019s latticework of metal poles both the kindling and the match that ignited their love aflame. Freud\u2019s \u201cprimal scene\u201d is supposedly a trauma specific to childhood, but I am now no longer sure.In the years to follow, the bed exerted something like a centripetal force on the space. Nearly all memorable activity in the apartment spiraled around it. Regardless of how close any two (or more) people are beforehand, on bunks they fall asleep together, they wake up together, they hear each other sleeping (snoring, babbling, rolling around). Each person is made to be vulnerable before the other, and in doing so bonds in an unusual and meaningful way. The twin-over-full arrangement did not militate against the orgiastic, as my parents had proved, but much more often, it fostered friendship.In the summer, small, boozy gatherings in the apartment migrated to the air-conditioned bedroom. As many as six of us would distribute ourselves across the beds, and occasionally someone would be dispatched to the bottom bunk if the metal moaned too much under our weight. Treasured memories of childhood mischief and sleepaway camp inevitably surfaced, cementing new friendships and shedding light on old ones.Each morning when visitors were below, I craned my neck over the side of the safety railing to check on them. Some consulted my eyes, as if inquiring about what was in store for breakfast; others instinctively reached out a hand to meet mine halfway. Even though the bed proved to be reliably sturdy, I was always delighted to find that no one perished in the night, that no limbs and organs were compromised by loose screws or buckled metal.Word eventually got around campus, and the questions kept finding me: Is it true that you have a bunk bed? Does it really have a full and a twin? I had bought the thing in the name of economy, but it had become an attraction in itself. Perhaps bunk beds, in an age of individuation, tap into our latent desire to share a world \u2014 they urge us, after all, to cohabitate, and to explore the pleasures and challenges of unfamiliar intimacies.Zachary Fine is a writer based in New Orleans.

{"Headline": "The Anti-P.C. Vote", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byWe know that resentment is driving much of Donald Trump\u2019s success \u2014 resentment of elites, of the political class, of illegal immigrants, of protesters, of the media \u2014 and perhaps most particularly of changes in the demographic makeup of the country that Trump and his followers find unwelcome.Part of the explanation for the triumph of resentment is political and economic, but one question has nagged at me. What is the psychological mechanism underpinning this resentment?More to the point:Opposition to the surge of non-European, nonwhite immigration is a bedrock of the Trump campaign, a crucial element of his attack on political correctness and a key component of the loyalty he elicits from noncollege, middle- and lower-income voters opposed to liberalized immigration \u2014 voters who believe they have been dispossessed.In an email, Anastasopoulos writes thatpolls conducted by large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context. Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the \u201cUnited States\u201d overall rather than, say, Dayton, Ohio, or Wilmington, North Carolina, places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years. This kind of abstract framing tends to push respondents toward giving more \u201cpolitically correct\u201d answers to standard poll questions about immigration.The result isa significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the public.The refusal of Democrats and the American left to hear \u2014 or to grant some legitimacy to \u2014 the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature to ascendant minorities and to waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement. In the zero sum world of immigration politics, it has proved impossible so far to convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sides.The quest by American liberals and progressives for support, or at least tolerance, of diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely to prevail \u2014 particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailed.the feeling you get when people try to stop you from doing something you\u2019ve been doing, and you perceive that they have no right or justification for stopping you. So you redouble your efforts and do it even more, just to show that you don\u2019t accept their domination. Men in particular are concerned to show that they do not accept domination.Psychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy. This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged to adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior. Specifically, a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state, called psychological reactance, that elicits behaviors intended to restore this autonomy.Haidt applies this to the 2016 election:Translated to the Trump phenomenon, I would say that decades of political correctness, with its focus on \u201cstraight white men\u201d as the villains and oppressors \u2014 now extended to \u201cstraight white cis-gendered men\u201d \u2014 has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white men.In both the workplace and academia, Haidt argues,the accusatory and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men to say and do un-PC things.In this atmosphere, according to Haidt,Trump comes along and punches political correctness in the face. Anyone feeling some degree of anti-PC reactance is going to feel a thrill in their heart, and will want to stand up and applaud. And because feelings drive reasoning, these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone to present arguments to them about the downsides of a Trump presidency.Trump\u2019s anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks to the resentment of many American men and their resistance to being instructed, particularly by a female candidate, on how they should think, speak or behave.I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak. \u2026 I am not going to deal with their temper tantrums, or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less.\u201cI don\u2019t think a nation can be great that turns its back on the poor and the unfortunate.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do more to raise families\u2019 incomes. We can start by raising the federal minimum wage.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls.\u201dTrump has made Clinton his foil of choice.On Dec. 21, 2015, Trump told an audience in Grand Rapids:Even a race with Obama, she was gonna beat Obama. I don\u2019t know who would be worse, I don\u2019t know, how could it be worse? But she was going to beat \u2014 she was favored to win \u2014 and she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost.I really deplore the tone of his campaign, the inflammatory rhetoric that he is using to divide people, and his going after groups of people with hateful, incendiary rhetoric.Nothing really surprises me anymore. I don\u2019t know that he has any boundaries at all. His bigotry, his bluster, his bullying have become his campaign. And he has to keep sort of upping the stakes and going even further.I\u2019m answering him on what I think voters care about. I\u2019m answering him on the differences between our records, our experience, what we want to do for our country, how important it is to try to unify the country.Jesse Graham, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, suggested that the fact that Clinton is a woman plays a role in this dynamic, noting that many Trump followers respond to Clinton in a fashion similar to that of8th grade boys reacting to their homeroom teacher. But I think this has more to do with her gender than with any particular behaviors on her part \u2014 in other words, there are some who would respond to any woman running for president as an 8th grader in homeroom who resents the teacher.Simon Hedlin, a public policy researcher, noted thatsince reactance is driven by perceptions rather than by facts, this works well in Trump\u2019s favor, considering his often cavalier relationship with the truth.In other words, reactance can foster a totalizing loyalty that does not respond to reasoned fault finding. This might help explain Trump\u2019s seeming immunity to criticism from his adversaries. His followers feel that they have experienced a \u201cdiminution of freedom\u201d and believe that Trump can \u201crestore their autonomy.\u201dHe has won a unique admixture of support, based in part on what might be called an anti-rational or irrational loyalty but also in part on his recognition of legitimate grievances among his adherents that many other politicians belittle or deny. This loyalty, as Republican candidates found during the primaries, is far wider and deeper than anyone not sharing it expected.Clinton remains the favorite, but she faces five months of treading water in a shark tank. She has yet to discover a compelling rebuttal to Trump on political correctness, and it will be difficult for her to placate opponents of immigration while holding her advantage with her base. Nonetheless, although her bite is not as lethal as Trump\u2019s, she will soon have almost the entire Democratic Party in her corner, including a cadre of operatives whose specialty is drawing blood.Thomas B.

People who are lucky enough to have some bank savings or receive regular salary deposits often cannot withdraw the money to pay bills.Enter \u201cbond notes.\u201d Unable to print the real thing, Zimbabwe\u2019s central bank recently announced that it would introduce a kind of ersatz American money for citizens to use in its place. The new notes (which have nothing to do with bonds) will be issued in denominations of $2, $5, $10 and $20, and to ensure their value, the bank says it will print only $200 million worth, backed by the Africa Export and Import Bank.Not surprisingly, there has been a strong backlash. Economists, opposition politicians and many ordinary Zimbabweans say the bond notes are a maneuver by President Robert Mugabe\u2019s government to reintroduce a local currency.The inevitable next step, critics say, will be to issue the bond notes far too liberally. That is what happened with the old Zimbabwean dollar, which the government printed without restraint a decade ago.Hyperinflation was the result, rendering the currency nearly worthless. Before the government finally gave up and switched to the American greenback, it was churning out a denomination so absurdly large that it has become a favorite among currency collectors: the $100 trillion note. That\u2019s 100,000,000,000,000 Zimbabwean dollars. (Or about 35 American cents.)Officials are calling on Zimbabweans to show their patriotism by embracing the bond notes, which are expected to hit the street in a few months. The notes won\u2019t be accepted outside the country, so their success will depend entirely on how much faith Zimbabweans have in their government.Economists predict that the bond notes are in for a rough time. After all, lack of confidence in the government is what prompted Zimbabweans to hoard or stash their American dollars to begin with.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen : Apr\u00e8s le Brexit, le printemps des peuples est in\u00e9vitable !", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 S\u2019il est bien une chose qui chatouille l\u2019orgueil d\u2019un Fran\u00e7ais, c\u2019est qu\u2019un Anglais vienne lui voler la vedette. Mais devant la valeur du courage, m\u00eame le Fran\u00e7ais le plus fier ne peut que s\u2019incliner : il ne lui reste qu\u2019\u00e0 tirer son chapeau. Et c\u2019est bel et bien un acte de courage que la d\u00e9cision que vient de prendre le peuple britannique, le courage de ceux qui assument leur libert\u00e9.Le Brexit l\u2019a emport\u00e9, d\u00e9jouant tous les pronostics. Le Royaume-Uni a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de larguer les amarres de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne et de reprendre son ind\u00e9pendance parmi les nations du monde. On disait que l\u2019\u00e9lection se jouerait sur le seul terrain \u00e9conomique, et pourtant les Britanniques ont compris le v\u00e9ritable enjeu du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum avec plus de perspicacit\u00e9 qu\u2019on veut bien l\u2019admettre.Ils ont compris que derri\u00e8re le cours de la livre sterling et derri\u00e8re les d\u00e9bats d\u2019experts financiers, une seule vraie question \u00e9tait pos\u00e9e, \u00e0 la fois simple et fondamentale : voulons-nous laisser un pouvoir non d\u00e9mocratique r\u00e9genter nos vies ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons-nous reprendre notre destin en main ? Le Brexit est avant tout une question politique. C\u2019est le choix libre d\u2019un peuple d\u00e9cidant de se gouverner par lui-m\u00eame. M\u00eame mise en valeur par toute la propagande du monde, une cage n\u2019en reste pas moins une cage, et elle est insupportable \u00e0 l\u2019homme \u00e9pris de libert\u00e9.L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est devenue la prison des peuples. Chacune des 28 nations qui la composent s\u2019est vue progressivement priv\u00e9e de ses pr\u00e9rogatives d\u00e9mocratiques par des commissions et des conseils sans aucune repr\u00e9sentation populaire. Chaque pays doit appliquer des lois qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas voulues ; il ne d\u00e9cide plus de son propre budget ; il est somm\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir ses fronti\u00e8res contre sa volont\u00e9. La situation des pays de la zone euro est encore moins enviable. Par id\u00e9ologie, on force des \u00e9conomies diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 adopter une m\u00eame monnaie, quitte \u00e0 les saigner \u00e0 blanc : version revisit\u00e9e du lit de Procuste. Les peuples n\u2019ont plus voix au chapitre.Et le Parlement europ\u00e9en, me dira-t-on ? Il n\u2019est d\u00e9mocratique qu\u2019en apparence, car il est fond\u00e9 sur un mensonge : faire croire qu\u2019il existe un peuple europ\u00e9en homog\u00e8ne, et qu\u2019un d\u00e9put\u00e9 polonais aurait la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de voter une loi pour le peuple espagnol. On a voulu nier l\u2019existence des nations. Il est naturel qu\u2019elles ne veuillent pas se laisser faire.Le Brexit ne fut pas le premier cri de r\u00e9volte des peuples europ\u00e9ens. En 2005, la France et les Pays-Bas ont organis\u00e9 un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur le projet de Constitution europ\u00e9enne : l\u2019opposition fut massive dans les deux cas, et les autres gouvernements d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de cesser net l\u2019exp\u00e9rience pour \u00e9viter la contagion. Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, la constitution europ\u00e9enne \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e aux peuples sous le nom de trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne. En 2008, l\u2019Irlande refusait elle aussi par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d\u2019appliquer ce trait\u00e9. On balaya une nouvelle fois d\u2019un revers de main cette d\u00e9cision populaire.Quand la Gr\u00e8ce d\u00e9cida par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum en 2015 de refuser le plan d\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 de Bruxelles, la r\u00e9action antid\u00e9mocratique de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne n\u2019\u00e9tonna plus personne : nier la volont\u00e9 des peuples \u00e9tait devenu pour elle une habitude. Le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission europ\u00e9enne, Monsieur Jean-Claude Juncker, eut \u00e0 cette occasion un \u00e9clair de franchise lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9clara sans honte : \u201cIl ne peut y avoir de choix d\u00e9mocratique contre les trait\u00e9s europ\u00e9ens\u201d.Si le Brexit ne fut pas le premier cri d\u2019espoir, il se pourrait n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il soit la premi\u00e8re vraie victoire des peuples. Les Britanniques ont mis l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne devant un dilemme dont elle va avoir du mal \u00e0 sortir. Soit elle d\u00e9cide de laisser tranquillement le Royaume-Uni prendre le large, et alors elle court le risque de cr\u00e9er un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent : la r\u00e9ussite politique et \u00e9conomique d\u2019un pays sorti de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne serait une preuve manifeste de son caract\u00e8re n\u00e9faste. Soit, mauvaise perdante, elle d\u00e9cide de faire payer le peuple britannique par tous les moyens, et alors elle montre au grand jour la nature tyrannique de son pouvoir. Le bon sens incline \u00e0 choisir la premi\u00e8re option. Je pressens que l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne choisira la seconde.Une chose est certaine : le d\u00e9part de la Grande Bretagne ne rendra pas l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne plus d\u00e9mocratique. La structure hi\u00e9rarchique des institutions supranationales va souhaiter se renforcer car comme toutes les id\u00e9ologies mourantes, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne ne conna\u00eet que la fuite en avant. Les r\u00f4les sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 connus : c\u2019est l\u2019Allemagne qui m\u00e8nera la danse, et la France sera bonne suivante.Signe des temps qui courent : Messieurs Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi et Mariano Rajoy vont aujourd\u2019hui directement prendre leurs ordres chez Madame Angela Merkel, sans passer par la case Bruxelles. La remarque de Henry Kissinger, \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d a maintenant une r\u00e9ponse claire : il faut appeler Berlin. Il ne reste alors plus qu\u2019une alternative aux peuples europ\u00e9ens : rester pieds et poings li\u00e9s dans une union qui trahit les int\u00e9r\u00eats nationaux et la souverainet\u00e9 populaire, ouvre grand nos pays \u00e0 l\u2019immigration massive et \u00e0 la finance arrogante, ou d\u00e9cider de retrouver leur libert\u00e9 par le vote.Des appels au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum r\u00e9sonnent aux quatre coins du continent. J\u2019ai moi-m\u00eame propos\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident Hollande d\u2019organiser une telle consultation populaire en France, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de refuser. Le destin de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne ressemble de plus en plus \u00e0 celui de l\u2019Union sovi\u00e9tique, qui est morte de ses propres contradictions.Le printemps des peuples est maintenant in\u00e9vitable ! La seule question qui reste \u00e0 poser est celle de savoir si l\u2019Europe est pr\u00eate \u00e0 se d\u00e9faire d\u2019elle-m\u00eame de ses illusions ou si le retour \u00e0 la raison se fera dans la douleur. Pour ma part, le choix est fait depuis longtemps : j\u2019ai choisi la France, j\u2019ai choisi les nations souveraines, j\u2019ai choisi la libert\u00e9.Marine Le Pen est pr\u00e9sidente du Front National.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018From Afar,\u2019 a Tale of Desire and Repression in Venezuela", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byThe masterly feature debut of the Venezuelan filmmaker Lorenzo Vigas, the movie looks at the world through the icy stare of Armando, who is first seen cruising and picking out his prey. He sidles up behind the young man without speaking or making eye contact. Following him onto a bus, Armando takes an adjacent seat and signals his intentions by flourishing a wad of cash. The young man who ends up in his apartment is instructed to take off his shirt and pull down his pants while Armando masturbates, and that\u2019s the extent of their connection.\u201cFrom Afar\u201d initially appears to be a docudrama about furtive gay desire in a Latin American culture with a powerful taboo against homosexuality. But Armando\u2019s next encounter with another young man, Elder (Luis Silva), is more complicated and evolves into a diabolical power struggle in which Armando is beaten up, verbally abused and robbed. The stoical Armando accepts these punishments as inevitable risks and hardly seems to mind; he might even like them.The unlikely friendship that develops between Armando and Elder seems based on Armando\u2019s financial largess. But when Armando writes a check for Elder to refurbish a junkyard vehicle, the young man softens. Elder confesses that his father, now dead, used to beat him to teach him the cruelty of the world.Armando is also alienated from his father (seen briefly and from a distance), who he says he wishes were dead for reasons that are never given, but they are easy to imagine. That father has just returned to Caracas (from where it is not said) after a long absence. These fractured father-son relationships become the closest thing to a bond between Armando and Elder, who na\u00efvely begins to regard Armando as a surrogate father and lowers his guard.Long-distance shots are used to convey Armando\u2019s chilly vigilance. He is frequently filmed with only one eye visible, as if he were a voyeur, peeking through a keyhole. The closest thing to warmth he exhibits, even when attending a birthday party at which he meets Elder\u2019s mother, is a tight, wary half-smile. At moments, he is practically a dead ringer for Martin Short in a grim mode.Yet \u201cFrom Afar\u201d musters enough compassion to suggest the degree to which homophobia and rejection have shaped Armando\u2019s cynical view of life in a violent, anti-gay environment. Scenes of Armando drilling dentures make you think of mouths, and the images of two sets of prosthetics, one being repaired, the other a loathsome facsimile of rotten teeth, are played off against shots of Elder\u2019s voluptuously puffy lips.\u201cFrom Afar\u201d never lets you relax and heave a sigh of relief in hopes that a happy ending may be in sight. Reality is too cruel for that.\u201cFrom Afar\u201d is not rated. It is in Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Travelers on Where to Go After Orlando", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byAs lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people make summer travel plans, or even plans to attend pride celebrations in our own cities, how important is safety when deciding where to go in a post-Orlando world? And how do we balance the need for visibility as a means of social change with the need for fellowship within the community that accepts us? I talked to people who form a loose-knit L.G.B.T. travel collective, and explored how a sense of nervousness and, as there has been since the beginning of the gay rights movement, a powerful feeling of defiance, may shape where we go.But the unfortunate truth is that this feeling that our havens are not actually snug enclosures insulated from a potentially dangerous world is hardly new.Even before the Orlando shooting, the decision about what to do this summer was more charged than usual, because of a presidential campaign and state laws in North Carolina and Mississippi exposing a divide on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights issues. The number of places where you could morally defend spending your tourist dollars had already shrunk.The question of whether to avoid the state is indicative of a perennial issue we face as we choose where to go. The early ethos of the gay rights movement, which gave rise to the chant \u201cwe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it!\u201d doesn\u2019t jibe with now avoiding places that restrict lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.While the Orlando shooting might cause some lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to avoid big events, at least for awhile, the consensus, if there is one, among L.G.B.T. travel leaders is that attendance in most cases will only go up. \u201cIf you\u2019re visible and you\u2019re out, we\u2019re strengthened as a whole,\u201d Ms. Chauvin said.

{"Headline": "Behind the Cruel Attack on Turkey", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe world is once again stunned and grieving over a brutal terrorist attack. This time it was in Turkey, where three suicide bombers killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 200 others at the international airport in Istanbul. The timing on Tuesday was especially cruel for a Muslim majority country, coming during the 10 holiest days of the holy month of Ramadan.The assault, for which Turkish authorities blamed the Islamic State, is the latest evidence of how the chaos in the Middle East, in particular the Syrian war, has metastasized, spilling over borders and rattling countries that are crucial to regional stability. Few are more important than Turkey, a NATO ally and a strategic link with the West. The sharing of intelligence between Turkey and the West, already close, will need to be made even closer.That Turkey has become a target is not a surprise. For too long, the government in Ankara underestimated the ISIS threat, even as it focused on other groups in Syria trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.Turkish officials allowed great quantities of arms and thousands of extremist foreign fighters to pass through its border into Syria. Some of those fighters have found a home in Turkey and are likely to be a threat for some time to come. Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has allowed a more radical strain of Islam to flourish in Turkey.It wasn\u2019t until last year, under American pressure, that Turkey began carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State targets and allowing American aircraft targeting the terrorist group to fly sorties out of Turkey. Turkey also has been more rigorous in shutting down the Syrian border.This has clearly angered the Islamic State and made Turkey a more likely target. Further, American officials say that recent gains by the coalition fighting the Islamic State has inspired the terrorist group to move against soft targets like shopping areas and the airport.Over the last 18 months, the Islamic State has lost nearly half the territory it once controlled in Iraq and 20 percent of the territory it held in Syria, the officials say, while the group\u2019s access to financing and the number of foreign fighters entering Syria have been reduced. A major effort now underway to retake the town of Manbij in Syria could further restrict the Islamic State\u2019s access to the Syrian-Turkish border.The Islamic State, of course, is not solely Mr. Erdogan\u2019s problem. The growing threat to Turkey is only the latest reason for the United States and its partners to work more urgently to defeat the group in Iraq and Syria, while seeking to end the civil war in Syria, which has not only brought devastation to hundreds of thousands of civilians, but provided fertile ground for extremism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwean Pushed From Mugabe\u2019s Inner Circle Now Challenges It", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Joice Mujuru became a legend at 18.Everyone in Zimbabwe knows the story of her shooting down an enemy helicopter in her country\u2019s war of liberation. Spill Blood was her nom de guerre.\u201cInstead of showing she had come to mourn, she was now busy admiring the house,\u201d Ms. Mujuru said.\u201cEven my own mother came to ask me, \u2018When did you start practicing those things?\u2019\u201d she said.After ruling Zimbabwe, outwitting his opponents and crushing his rivals for decades, Mr. Mugabe, 92, is increasingly weakened by age. Political maneuvering has split his long-dominant ZANU-PF party, as factions jostle for control once the leader keeping them together dies.Amid the uncertainty, Ms. Mujuru sees a political opening, vowing to take power as president in the 2018 election under the banner of her own party, Zimbabwe People First.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Mujuru greeted a stream of visitors to her home, mostly allies who had been expelled along with her from Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party, some with military ties.Considered a moderate while in Mr. Mugabe\u2019s circle, she presents the biggest challenge yet to the governing party from a former insider.\u201cFor the first time, we have people who were in government and in the ruling party now outside and in large numbers,\u201d said Jonathan Moyo, the minister of higher education and one of ZANU-PF\u2019s most influential officials. \u201cWe have many of them to make a school. I don\u2019t know whether they will make a political party. But it is a new challenge for us, yes.\u201dThere are strong indications that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party, currently split in two, is taking the threat from Ms. Mujuru seriously. Mr. Mugabe has recently attacked the Mujurus at public rallies. Ms. Mujuru\u2019s supporters have become the most frequent target of physical assaults by the president\u2019s loyalists in rural areas, according to human rights organizations.And ZANU-PF officials now even dismiss as \u201ca lie\u201d Ms. Mujuru\u2019s celebrated claim of shooting down that helicopter decades ago.\u201cPeople are now trying to rewrite history,\u201d she said.As Ms. Mujuru tells it, helicopter gunships belonging to the former Rhodesian government appeared near her village in the country\u2019s northeast one day in February 1974 as she and others were looking for fresh recruits. With her father\u2019s approval, she had joined the liberation movement a few months earlier after finishing the ninth grade.\u201cAs they were trying to take a turn,\u201d she recalled of the helicopters, \u201cthis other comrade who was injured, whom I didn\u2019t want to leave, then told me just to shoot.\u201d\u201cI was surprised when it went down,\u201d she added.Whether her shots brought down the helicopter or not, the story of Spill Blood\u2019s heroism quickly spread. She rapidly rose to become one of the first female commanders in the liberation army and, in 1977, married one of its top leaders, Solomon Mujuru.Mr. Mujuru played a pivotal role in helping Mr. Mugabe \u2014 an intellectual who had spent a decade in prison and was held in suspicion by other rebel commanders \u2014 rise to become the movement\u2019s political leader.Upon independence in 1980, Mr. Mugabe named Mr. Mujuru army chief and made Ms. Mujuru the youngest minister in his first cabinet. The husband went into business and became one of the country\u2019s richest men.He played the role of kingmaker in politics and successfully pushed for his wife to become a vice president in 2004. To many, the Mujurus had set the stage for a succession.Mr. Mugabe, too, had taken notice.\u201cMrs. Mujuru told herself that she was now No. 2 in the party and in government and asked herself if it would not be possible for her to take the No. 1 job,\u201d Mr. Mugabe said at a recent rally at which he lashed out at the Mujurus.Ms. Mujuru rejected that view, saying she \u201cnever spoke about wanting to take anything from\u201d Mr. Mugabe.Her husband, though, was more outspoken. Perhaps because of the role he had played in securing Mr. Mugabe\u2019s leadership, Mr. Mujuru was known as the only insider who challenged Mr. Mugabe during high-level meetings. For what he said was the good of the country and the economy, he pressed Mr. Mugabe to groom a successor and retire.In 2008, Mr. Mujuru supported a new party, Mavambo, in an indirect move to weaken Mr. Mugabe.\u201cHe wanted Mavambo as a mere lever to force Mugabe to stand down,\u201d said Ibbo Mandaza, an academic and businessman who was one of the party\u2019s founders.Three years later, Ms. Mujuru got a phone call in the middle of an August night. Her husband had been found dead in their farmhouse an hour south of the capital, Harare.When she arrived, the body was still burning with a blue flame, a sign that an accelerant had been used, she said. Her workers used a shovel to scrape the body off a carpet.Later, at the morgue, the president came to offer his condolences on his way to the airport, she said.\u201cHe left me in my pajamas looking at the charred body and told me: \u2018You\u2019re the acting president. I\u2019m going to Angola,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mujuru recalled bitterly.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government pronounced the death an accident and later rejected Ms. Mujuru\u2019s call for a second, independent autopsy.

She was considered open to working with the opposition and Western governments.\u201cThat\u2019s partly why she became a target,\u201d Mr. Mavhinga said.But Rashid Mahiya, the executive director of Heal Zimbabwe, a human rights group, said Ms. Mujuru was one of the biggest beneficiaries of ZANU-PF\u2019s system of patronage and its widespread use of political violence. She, too, was rewriting history, exaggerating her reformist credentials, he said.\u201cWe want her to come clean with her past,\u201d Mr. Mahiya said. \u201cThe ZANU-PF color and paint that she is associated with does not go away.\u201dMs. Mujuru said she was sorry about ZANU-PF\u2019s use of violence, contending that she had always been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with it and wished \u201cshe had said more\u201d against it.\u201cIt\u2019s better I\u2019m here with them,\u201d she said of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s opponents. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that could not have been enough to them.

{"Headline": "Suzuki Chairman to Step Down as Chief Executive After Fuel Economy Scandal", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe move is the latest management reshuffle resulting from a wave of testing scandals in the auto industry.Suzuki Motor said on Wednesday that Mr. Suzuki, 86, would give up his position as chief executive but retain the title of chairman. It said the move was intended \u201cto make management responsibility clear\u201d over the testing problem, which it revealed last month.The company did not say who would replace Mr. Suzuki as chief executive, but his son, Toshihiro, is widely seen as a leading candidate. Toshihiro Suzuki became chief operating officer and executive vice president last year. The company will need to name its new chief executive before its annual shareholder meeting set for June 29, when Osamu Suzuki\u2019s resignation from the role is scheduled to take effect.Suzuki has said that although its testing procedures had deviated from government standards, they had not produced exaggerated mileage ratings, and there was no need to restate any published ratings.The issue was nonetheless a blow to Suzuki\u2019s reputation. The company said another executive, Vice President Osamu Honda, would resign his position and that board members would give up half their executive bonuses for the latest financial year. Senior managers, auditors and nonexecutive directors would also take cuts to their monthly pay, of between 10 and 40 percent, for periods of from three to six months, Suzuki said.Osamu Suzuki married into the carmaker\u2019s founding family in the late 1950s, taking his wife\u2019s family name, a not-uncommon practice among prominent Japanese families. He became president of Suzuki Motor in 1978.Suzuki\u2019s problematic fuel tests involve the way its engineers calculated what is known as running resistance, or the effect that tire friction and other factors have on fuel consumption under various driving conditions.Suzuki said last month that mileage tests at its development track in central Japan had produced inconsistent results, which engineers attributed to wind. Instead of running multiple tests to produce an average, the engineers cut corners by extrapolating running resistance from past tests. That was a violation of regulations, the company said, but did not distort results \u201cbeyond the standard margin of error.\u201dAn earlier version of the headline with this article misstated the type of scandal in which Suzuki has been involved. It is a fuel economy tests scandal, not an emissions scandal.Advertisement"}

The wait to get into his speech in Irvine, Calif., where 6,000 people packed into an amphitheater, stretched to five hours.One of those waiting was Al Pappalardo, 59, a school psychologist who brought his daughter Alix, 22, along to what he called Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201clast stand.\u201d\u201cIt is like a farewell tour,\u201d Mr. Pappalardo said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to think back and say: \u2018I actually participated. I didn\u2019t sit back.\u2019\u201dBut one would not know that from the enthusiastic supporters who still flock to hear Mr. Sanders call for a transformation of America\u2019s economy and for a political revolution.Some are there in solidarity with his message, and others because they believe Mr. Sanders when he says, against the odds, that he can still snag the nomination at the party\u2019s convention in July.And then there are many who, regardless of their outlook on the race, are streaming in for what they believe may be their last glimpse of a political phenomenon.Hafeez Alam, 26, a mechanical engineer from Irvine, said that his mother regretted not seeing Barack Obama in person in 2008, and that he was not going to have similar regrets.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you listen to your favorite band on YouTube and you watch their concerts and DVDs, but when you go to a live event, it\u2019s a totally different experience,\u201d Mr. Alam said last month at the Irvine rally.Diana Modica let her children, Charlie Baldwin, 15, and Harriet Baldwin, 14, skip school to attend the Palo Alto rally last week. She said she was holding out hope that Mr. Sanders would win but also wanted to give her children a lesson in political participation.\u201cThe last time I saw a presidential candidate was Jesse Jackson in \u201984 at Stanford, so you don\u2019t get a lot of chances,\u201d she said.Asked why she went to see Mr. Sanders last month in her hometown, National City, Calif., Angelica Arroyo said it was like watching a \u201csuperstar.\u201d\u201cI just feel like this is, like, for a bucket list,\u201d said Ms. Arroyo, 21.Mr. Sanders\u2019s rallies \u2014 he has held at least one virtually every day for the past couple of weeks \u2014 have not had the feel of a vanishing campaign. His fans recite well-known parts of Mr. Sanders\u2019s stump speech, chanting, \u201cHealth care is a right, not a privilege,\u201d and screaming the average size of a donation to his campaign: \u201c$27!\u201d They carry handmade signs: \u201cBernie or Bust.\u201d \u201cBernie Sensation.\u201d \u201cWake up America.

Lauren Steiner, 58, the lead organizer of Los Angeles for Bernie and one of several people selling T-shirts outside a rally in Santa Monica, Calif., said that Mr. Sanders had only a \u201cslim chance\u201d to win the nomination, but that a Bernie 2016 shirt was worth owning anyway, at least for sentimental reasons.\u201cI have a shirt that says \u2018Impeach George Bush\u2019 that I still wear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a poster. It\u2019s like a button. I\u2019ve saved posters and buttons from things that have been important to me through the years.\u201dMr. Sanders, who declined to be interviewed, has been effectively camping out in California, hoping a win in the state will help him persuade hundreds of superdelegates \u2014 party leaders who can change their votes at any time before the convention \u2014 to withdraw support from Mrs. Clinton and back him. There appears to be little chance of that happening, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s recent rallies have carried an angrier tone, punctuated with loud boos and insults at mentions of Mrs. Clinton or Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.Some of his supporters, like Mr. Sanders himself, refuse to concede. \u201cI think he has good chances,\u201d said Bianca Villegas, 28, a paralegal from San Diego who went to the rally last month in National City. \u201cHe is going to have a hell of a fight, but I think that his numbers are there.\u201dBut many realize that they may be seeing the last of Mr. Sanders on the campaign trail. Chuck Hollis, 69, of West Sacramento, who has attended three Sanders rallies in the past few weeks, said some friends had teased him for going to so many.But he said that being part of the crowd \u201cprovides a great deal of satisfaction\u201d and that he wanted to show his support for Mr. Sanders in \u201ca very concrete way.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s 74 years old and he could continue in the Senate, but because he\u2019s older, I don\u2019t know that there is a whole lot more that he can do,\u201d Mr. Hollis said. \u201cBut I think, hopefully, he\u2019s ignited a number of younger people to carry on and try to implement some of the proposals that he\u2019s made.\u201dAngela Collins, 48, of El Paso, does not believe Mr. Sanders has a chance. She is a Clinton supporter, but she attended a rally last month in Vado, N.M., because, she said, she did not want to miss seeing the senator.Ms. Collins stuffed her Clinton button in her pocket and waved a large Sanders sign the campaign handed out to be \u201crespectful.\u201d\u201cI know there\u2019s no way Bernie Sanders could ever be president,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he enjoys running so much.\u201dAmong the 3,000 other people at that rally was Antonio Gonzalez, 18, a high school senior from El Paso, who showed up despite his belief that it is \u201cunrealistic to think that Bernie is going to win.\u201d\u201cComing out here, it\u2019s more for supporting Bernie,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cHe\u2019s going out and kind of giving a farewell to the people, kind of giving us his last words of wisdom while he still has the mike in his hands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On average, it cost 16 percent (in Alaska) to 33 percent (in New Jersey) of their income in 2013, the latest year for which complete statistics were available for the report.Private institutions offered no relief. Of the states where at least 20 percent of students attended private nondoctoral colleges and universities, families earning $48,001 to $75,000 were required to pay, on average, 16 percent (Idaho) to 45 percent (Rhode Island) of family income to enroll in these institutions.Even the safety net of community colleges is fraying. Public two-year institutions, which used to provide affordable educational opportunities to many people, no longer do so. Families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay 11 percent (Mississippi) to 22 percent (Minnesota) of income to enroll in this sector.State policy makers often are pleased to promise improved educational attainment \u2014 for the sake of both a strong civic culture and a robust economy. If they are serious about this, they must make it a priority to lower the financial burden of higher education on students from low- and middle-income families to increase their chances of enrolling and graduating.Unless we make college affordable for people of all financial means, opportunity through higher education will be a false promise.Joni E.

{"Headline": "Saudi Oil Chief Khalid al-Falih Tells OPEC Changes Are Coming", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byVIENNA \u2014 The new oil minister in Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the OPEC countries, had a message for the global market: Don\u2019t expect us to influence the price of crude oil by adjusting supplies.\u201cI think managing in the traditional way that we tried in the past may never come again,\u201d the minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on Thursday. \u201cCertainly we will not go with certain price targets.\u201dThe message \u2014 which came after the decision on Thursday by the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain high levels of oil production \u2014 is central to the changing strategy of the Saudi crude-oil complex. And it could foreshadow a period of volatility for oil prices because OPEC\u2019s policies and the Saudis\u2019 sway have long helped guide the markets.While other OPEC members have been urging the freezing or lowering of oil production, Mr. Falih is pushing to keep it high and plow the money into other industries that might prove profitable for Saudi Arabia. He wants the cartel to rethink its longstanding approach and assumptions that it can manage global oil supplies and prices.It runs counter to the longtime stance of his predecessor, Ali al-Naimi, who presided over an era when OPEC was largely content to restrain production to try to drive prices up.The Saudis\u2019 shift is easier to justify because price pressures have abated of late. While oil initially dipped on Thursday, it recovered to around $50 a barrel, about twice what it was in January.Oil producers should \u201clet the market forces continue to seek and find that equilibrium price between supply and demand,\u201d said Mr. Falih, speaking to a small group of reporters in his penthouse hotel suite.The Saudis can increasingly afford to go their own way. Along with a wealth of oil reserves, Saudi Arabia invested tens of billions of dollars in building a competitive oil business at a time when other OPEC countries like Venezuela and Iran allowed their industries to deteriorate.Mr. Falih has been at the core of those moves.Mr. Falih a 1982 graduate of Texas A&M, jumped onto the international oil scene in the early 2000s. Hoping to inject life and competition into the economy, King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruler at the time, invited overseas companies to look for natural gas after shutting them out in the 1970s.To the surprise of Western oil executives, the king tapped Mr. Falih, then a young executive at Saudi Aramco, to manage complex negotiations for a series of joint ventures with Royal Dutch Shell of Britain, Total of France and Lukoil of Russia. Although the ventures didn\u2019t find much gas, Mr. Falih garnered credit for deftly juggling conflicting interests.\u201cAfter a year or so, I had to accept that he was really good at what he was doing,\u201d said Floris Ansingh, who was the head of Shell in Saudi Arabia at the time. \u201cHe understood the different trade-offs.\u201dMr. Falih\u2019s international focus set the stage for the evolution of Saudi Aramco.After he was named chief executive of the company in 2009, he pushed for modernization, trying to turn the state-run oil company into a global competitor that rivaled the private giants in the West. He expanded areas like oil trading and acquisitions and tried to lock up demand by investing in China and in other growing economies.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Saudi Aramco has recently developed three giant oil fields, sharply increasing the amount of oil it can produce. The company earned an estimated $200 billion from oil production last year, according to the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie.\u201cThe view in the industry is that Aramco is one of the best oil companies in the world,\u201d said J. Robinson West, a senior adviser on energy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research organization. \u201cKhalid has been important in building that.\u201dMr. Falih also seems unafraid to tread on sensitive ground.As the head of the national oil company, he warned that fast-rising domestic fuel consumption risked eroding the crude-oil exports that are the kingdom\u2019s main source of cash.Now, his warning is part of the new Saudi mind-set.\u201cHe is a very astute political player,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Marcel, author of \u201cOil Titans,\u201d a book about national oil companies. \u201cHe has been able to push back and create space to debate issues, while still keeping himself in good position with the ruler.\u201dMr. Falih also recognized early on that growing concern for the climate could reduce demand for Saudi oil, creating a risk that a large portion of those resources might be left in the ground.On Thursday, Mr. Falih said that Saudi Arabia was now preparing for the worst case by moving aggressively to spur growth of nonoil-based industries. While he said he thought that demand for crude would last for generations, Mr. Falih added that \u201cwe as human beings cannot be complacent and assume that oil will continue to fuel the world forever.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Falih has taken on the role of trusted confidant, serving as adviser and troubleshooter for Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In 2015, the prince put Mr. Falih in charge of the kingdom\u2019s troubled Health Ministry, which was struggling to contain a deadly respiratory virus called MERS.In his new role, Mr. Falih has significant oversight of a huge portion of the Saudi economy. The Oil Ministry absorbed the Ministry of Electricity and was renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. He has also been appointed head of the government-owned mining company, a state-run industrial fund, the geological survey, the atomic and renewable energy program and a number of other state-run economic bodies.Mr. Falih faces a huge set of objectives, some in areas where his predecessor came up short. Despite its oil wealth, the kingdom struggles to produce sufficient natural gas to meet the fast-growing needs of electricity generators and industry. Efforts to develop solar power and other renewable energy sources have also lagged some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s neighbors, like the United Arab Emirates.Mr. Falih is also in charge of the effort to sell a small stake in Saudi Aramco to investors with a target of 2018. He said the idea was to make the company more global as it looks to add investments in natural gas.A public listing might also improve the company\u2019s performance.\u201cIf you have to face the analysts every quarter,\u201d he said, \u201cit gives you a bit of competitive tension.\u201dTo make it all work, Mr. Falih will have to persuade the country\u2019s stubborn constituents to adopt a more commercial focus and to participate in joint ventures with international companies. While some doubt whether Mr. Falih is the right person to lead this transition, others say only an insider has the credibility to do so.Either way, the oil market will be watching.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the new oil minister in Saudi Arabia, Khalid al-Falih, misstated the time period during which the country issued a directive to diversify its economy. It was in April, not last month.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Advertisement"}

Per-carat prices for smaller stones have been declining \u2014 yet another indication of how the differential in wealth between the 1 percent and everyone else is affecting buying patterns in the world\u2019s economy.Prices for 1-carat polished stones have declined 4 percent in the last year because of a strengthening dollar and economic challenges faced by some of the pivotal consuming economies, noted Anish Aggarwal, a partner at Gemdax, a strategic consulting firm in the diamond industry.To get the broadest possible exposure for Lucara\u2019s record-setting find, while still promising buyers anonymity if they desire it, Mr. Lamb has been working with Sotheby\u2019s and Julius Baer, a Swiss bank that has many wealthy private clients around the world.This is not the first time Sotheby\u2019s has put a rough stone up for sale. In 2000, it put a purple-pink rough 12.49-carat diamond up for auction, but it failed to sell, according to Sotheby\u2019s.Whoever buys the Lucara stone will pay Sotheby\u2019s a 12 percent fee, known as the buyer\u2019s premium, on the hammer price for anything over the first $3 million, and a higher percentage of the first $3 million. Although there is a reserve price below which Lucara would not sell, that figure is not public. And of course, the hammer price does not include whatever the buyer would have to pay to have the stone cut, should he or she decide to do so.Top auction houses are eager to have high-quality objects for sale because doing so burnishes their images and appeals to a wealthy global audience. That may mean Lucara has negotiated privately to receive some of the buyer\u2019s premium.\u201cSales agreements are uniquely structured depending on the scarcity, prestige and value of the object,\u201d said Oliver Chen, head of retail and luxury goods at the financial services firm Cowen and Company, who noted that such terms are not necessarily disclosed.Mr. Aggarwal views the market as having two tiers of buyers, similar to the car industry. \u201cThere are the elite high-performance cars and there are the average Joe cars, and they are two different markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not much evidence so far of the elite market going down.\u201dThe Lucara diamond \u2014 named the Lesedi La Rona, or \u201cour light\u201d in Setswana, in a contest in which 11,000 people submitted entries \u2014 is not the biggest diamond ever found. That distinction goes to the 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, discovered at a mine in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1905. It was named for Thomas Cullinan, the chairman of the mining company.Martin Rapaport, whose Rapaport Group is an important source of information on diamond pricing, said the decision to auction an uncut stone would prove to be a savvy one.\u201cIf Lucara believed that the optimum way to maximize value was through consumer distribution, then the diamond would have been cut,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople with tremendous amounts of money are looking for a home for it. That is fueling the prices we are seeing for diamonds.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the country in which the Lesedi La Rona diamond was discovered. It is Botswana, not South Africa. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a caption. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Plan for the Financial World? Cross Your Fingers", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byAmong those who manage gobs of money, the possibility that Britain might actually disavow the European Union seemed until recently like a remote and even outlandish possibility.But about a week before voters go to the polls to determine their future, masters of finance are suddenly absorbing the prospect that Britain might really walk, unleashing anxiety and uncertainty throughout the global economy.Angst has seeped into the calculations. As investors digest the possibility that the largest marketplace on earth may be days away from a messy alteration, they have been yanking money out of riskier storehouses like stocks and putting it into safer instruments like bonds. The British pound and London stocks have been falling in frenzied trading.The conversation is now focused on managing the risks of Brexit. The trouble is that the worries are so diffuse and rife with unknowns that any attack plan amounts to an exercise in guesswork and hope. Executives, bankers and bureaucrats are grappling with something that could be minor or momentous and has never happened before.Maybe the Brexit \u2014 for British exit \u2014 would merely lop value from the pound before traders turned their attention to a more consequential plot twist elsewhere. Perhaps it would inspire separatist movements from Scotland to Spain, embolden anti-trade populists across the Continent and reinvigorate existential questions gnawing at the common euro currency. That could sow fear across world markets.A Brexit might spook investors into entrusting their money only to the safest repositories like American Treasuries. That could strengthen the American dollar and weaken American exports, while starving riskier emerging markets of investment.Whatever stories policy makers and businesspeople tell themselves, the only certainty is a surplus of uncertainty. Whatever provisional plans they sketch, they will find themselves mostly just wishing that nothing terrible happens.\u201cOn the financial markets, there is nothing they can do; it will just hit them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf my house is going to catch on fire, I can plan to have some water on hand, but there\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d\u201cThat kind of threw the cat among the pigeons and panicked everyone,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a London company that manages foreign exchange for multinationals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pickup in client hedging.\u201dA company that, say, imports goods from China to sell in Britain fears that the pound is about to drop, making those Chinese goods more expensive. So it buys contracts that essentially lock in today\u2019s exchange rate for the future.According to Laurence Wormald, head of research at FIS, which provides technology and market intelligence to financial services companies, British stocks would most likely fall 15 percent after a Brexit, with the pound dropping by a similar proportion.If a Brexit vote hurts the British economy, the central bank might feel compelled to lower rates to motivate businesses and households to borrow and spend. But the bank might well do the opposite, raising rates to stop a currency slide.The most nettlesome variable may be trade. Britain sells nearly half its exports within the European Union. Multinational corporations have set up headquarters in Britain, using those bases to serve customers across the Continent.Those campaigning for a Brexit assure that a vote to leave would change nothing right away. Britain would remain a fully fledged member of Europe\u2019s marketplace for two years as it negotiated a new arrangement with the 27 remaining members of the union.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut if Britain failed to secure a deal, commerce with Europe could be governed by the terms of the World Trade Organization, which gives member nations the authority to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports.The debate over the Brexit is full of references to sundry alternative models. Norway enjoys access to the European market although it remains outside the union. Switzerland has achieved similar status through a thicket of treaties. But in both cases, they must accept something supporters of Brexit want to eliminate \u2014 European rules that allow people to move liberally from country to country.Those urging a Brexit insist Britain can negotiate a tailor-made deal. Many economists describe that notion as somewhere between fanciful and delusional. Eager to discourage other members from considering an exit, Europe would seek to ensure that Britain paid a price.If Britain dumps Europe, \u201cthey are not going to say, \u2018Well, O.K., here\u2019s a good deal,\u2019\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London.Nowhere are preparations more intense than in finance. London has parlayed expertise in banking and inclusion in Europe to secure dominance over large areas of trading. As the referendum approaches, financiers are now consumed by a jigsaw puzzle of diabolical complexity: They are mapping out what assets they hold and where, seeking to anticipate what jurisdictions and rules might apply post-Brexit.\u201cInvestment banks and asset managers are pre-booking law firms, consulting firms and accounting firms for July,\u201d said William Wright, managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cIf we do vote to leave on June 23, no one is going to have the faintest idea what impact it will have.\u201dIf the sun rises on June 24 with Britain on its way out, such a shift could happen sooner rather than later. At a time of crippling uncertainty, banks would feel a compulsion to at least eliminate variables by quickly announcing their plans, moving people within the European Union \u2014 to Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris.In the end, contingency plans may be devised more as salves for frayed nerves than bona fide operational blueprints. Britain may be on the verge of refashioning the world map. If that happens, the vote will set off proceedings so complex that the only guaranteed winners are the lawyers.All plans will be subject to change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Watch for in Trading After Shock of \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byMarket TurmoilThe global financial system has in recent years managed to absorb rolling debt crises in Greece, military clashes in Ukraine, down-to-the-wire budget fights in Washington and a shock currency devaluation by China.But will it handle Britain\u2019s vote on Thursday to leave the European Union as well?The lesson of the financial crisis of 2008 is that problems in one country can spread around the world through the markets and the banking system. And so far on Friday, there have been some gut-wrenching moves in global markets.The British pound plunged to a level not seen in decades. The decline briefly meant that the British economy was smaller than France\u2019s, when measured in dollar terms.Italy\u2019s stock market was down more than 10 percent, and France\u2019s was off over 8 percent.The selling hit Japan, where stocks closed down nearly 8 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 459 points, or 2.55 percent, in late morning trading.Investors sought safety in government bonds. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped into negative territory. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)The yield on the United States 10-year note also sank, to 1.53 percent, after overnight trading that was eight times its normal volume, according to FTN Financial.The question now is how much more conditions could change in the next days and weeks. At times like this, it makes sense to focus on areas where the global financial system seems most vulnerable.In Europe, that means searching the markets for indications that investors are starting to bet that the European Union will fracture further.Worrying? Sure.Still, it\u2019s important to remember that the European Central Bank has in the past acted boldly to head off adverse movements in bond markets. And on Friday, it said in a news release that it would \u201ccontinue to fulfill its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.Europe\u2019s other weak point is its banking system. Much of the selling involved Britain\u2019s financial giants. Shares in Barclays, which has large trading operations, and which hoovered up much of Lehman Brothers after it crashed, had shed a fifth of its value on Friday. But Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, also plummeted \u2014 by 14 percent.At times like this, what really matters is whether banks can raise short-term money to finance their operations. The Bank of England said in a statement on Friday that it would make 250 billion pounds available to banks, and said it could provide \u201csubstantial liquidity in foreign currency.\u201dThe financial system overhauls introduced in the United States and Europe since the 2008 crisis, and the willingness to provide emergency support to the banks right now, will most likely stop the financial system from imploding.But a deeper test is whether the overhaul \u2014 which forced banks to have higher levels of capital and retain more liquid cash \u2014 has put the banks in a position in which they can continue lending to the real economy during this period of pervasive uncertainty. The Bank of England on Friday underscored that hope in its statement. \u201cThis substantial capital and huge liquidity gives banks the flexibility they need to continue to lend to U.K. businesses and households, even during challenging times,\u201d it said.One other thing to consider amid this selling and gloom: There is an optimistic scenario. Britain and Europe may work out a peaceful divorce, and Europe\u2019s policy makers may be able to stop the departure from deepening the Continent\u2019s economic problems. The economic pain in Britain may deter other countries from seeking to leave, or they may have votes and decide to stay.People who have bet on the world ending in recent years have lost a lot of money. But be very open to the notion that Brexit could be the event that finally makes them rich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Advice to Panicked Republicans: Man Up", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonDonald J. Trump has some advice for panicked Republicans in Washington who are melting down over his most incendiary statements: Man up.\u201cPoliticians are so politically correct anymore, they can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview Tuesday afternoon as fellow Republicans forcefully protested his ethnically charged criticism of a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit against the defunct Trump University.\u201cThe people are tired of this political correctness when things are said that are totally fine,\u201d he said during an interlude in a day of exceptional stress in the Trump campaign. \u201cIt is out of control. It is gridlock with their mouths.\u201dEven as he chastised Washington\u2019s political class for a lack of backbone, Mr. Trump exhibited modest signs later on Tuesday that he was getting the message that some remarks \u2014 such as questioning the fairness of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel because of his Mexican heritage \u2014 crossed a line.While he did not apologize, he issued a statement that his comments on Judge Curiel had been \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d In a final Republican primary night victory speech, he struck a more conventional tone \u2014 at least for him \u2014 giving a more disciplined address using the teleprompter he has mocked while promising to make the Republican Party proud in the general election campaign.But anyone thinking that Mr. Trump is going to suddenly adopt a more cautious, strategic approach yearned for by election-conscious congressional Republicans is likely to be disappointed. He wrinkled his nose in disgust at the mere mention of the word \u201cpivot,\u201d though he conceded he wants to get on to broader discussion of the economy.In his view, it is clear that his way has worked and the establishment\u2019s has failed. After all, he vanquished every senator, governor or former governor who challenged him for the party\u2019s nomination.\u201cI disagree with a lot of things I\u2019ve watched in politics over the years, that\u2019s why I\u2019m running,\u201d Mr. Trump said over a meatball lunch he barely touched in the restaurant of Trump Tower. \u201cAnd that may make me less popular with politicians. But I have to be honest. I didn\u2019t get there by doing it the way a lot of these people do it.\u201dCurrent polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.Mr. Trump, arms crossed tightly across his chest during lunch, was aggrieved and considered some of the Republican pushback inappropriate and unhelpful \u2014 though he did not want to address specific critics. He insisted that he is anything but a racist and, with his usual rebuttal by the numbers, stressed that voters have rewarded his outspokenness with a record haul of primary votes while Washington is held in dismal regard.\u201cPeople want people to represent them who are going to stick up for what they believe in,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPoliticians have been very weak and very ineffective over the last quite long period of time.\u201dMr. Trump is also unhappy with the media, and noted that he is nearing the ability to reach 20 million people by himself through his personal Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, providing an alternative way to reach the public, even if it\u2019s largely a one-way conversation.His is a campaign like no other, conducted out of a luxury office tower in Manhattan named for its most prominent occupant, the presumptive nominee himself. A few floors below his personal office with a Trumpian view of Central Park is unfinished space being leased to his campaign team, a relatively skeleton crew of 80 or so running a national campaign.He is flabbergasted by critiques that he is woefully undermanned compared to the hundreds working for Mrs. Clinton, many just over in Brooklyn.\u201cTo me, that is smart,\u201d Mr. Trump said about his lean team, though he says he will soon increase his work force.As the primary season came to an odd close with him under Republican fire in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 an unheard-of spectacle in the last half century of presidential politics \u2014 Mr. Trump took some time to huddle with his campaign team. His daughter Ivanka, a trusted adviser, was close at hand, as was his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, his press secretary, Hope Hicks, and his special counsel, Michael Cohen.As he headed to the Trump Grill for lunch, tourists and workers hailed him, congratulated him and urged him on as they lined up to take photos with their phones.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.He posed with some women and looked back at a reporter to point at the women and boasted \u201cHispanics!\u201d Afterward, he bragged: \u201cThey say \u2018We love you, Mr. Trump. We\u2019re from Mexico.\u2019 \u201dAfter he was seated, the Secret Service erected a temporary partition to shield him from other guests.\u201cLook,\u201d he said, amused, \u201cwe put up a wall!\u201dThe uneasy relationship he has with Republicans in Washington \u2014 not to mention the antipathy for him among Democrats \u2014 may have worked for him during the primary campaign. But in the White House, like them or not, he will need them to deliver on whatever agenda he would pursue.Mr. Trump, who has for years contributed to and glad-handed politicians from around the country, believes he can be successful.\u201cI think I will get along with the politicians actually,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get the government moving. I\u2019ve done a lot of work on the other side of politics and I\u2019ve always gotten what I want.\u201d\u201cWe will see how it shakes out but I think it is going to shake out very well. I think people are tired of what is going on.\u201dEven as they express alarm over his tone and positions, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell have yet to abandon Mr. Trump despite pressure from some Republicans to do so. The two congressional leaders say they still share more with Mr. Trump\u2019s ideology than with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.So how does it feel to be the lesser of two evils?\u201cI don\u2019t think I am, for many people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe for some politicians.\u201dClearly, the real estate merger between Trump Tower and the Capitol is going to take more time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tighter Rules on Money Transfers Put Squeeze on Businesses", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byFor years, Fernando Lopez\u2019s storefront money-transfer business in Atlantic City was a place where local residents could wire money to family and friends abroad. But that business, Interamericana Express, which handled a lot of transmittals to Mexico, is dwindling as banks and regulators take a stricter view of cross-border money transfers.Mr. Lopez\u2019s business accounts have been closed several times in recent years by three different banks over money-laundering concerns despite his state license, hours of compliance training and binders full of rules and regulations. Since being dropped by the banks, he has operated his money-transfer business as an agent of MoneyGram International and Ria Money Transfer, depositing transfers in accounts at those companies. Banks will not take any of his money-transfer business directly.Frustrated, he is trying to convert his shop, which also offers notary and bill payment services, into a by-the-pound parcel shipping center. The banks don\u2019t see a small business with a money-transfer operation \u201cin a good way,\u201d Mr. Lopez said.\u201cWe comply with all the regulations. We have to follow the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want to deal with us.\u201dBanks are refusing to do business with money transmitters, closing or freezing their accounts over concerns about money laundering and extra regulatory scrutiny.The affected businesses include mom-and-pop convenience stores such as Mr. Lopez\u2019s, potentially limiting options for the millions of people living in the United States who want to send money home or forcing them to send cash, which is risky. Over one-quarter of American households rely on nonbank financial institutions, including money transmitters, for everyday banking needs, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\u201cLarge banks are just walking away from the business completely,\u201d said Peter Ohser, an executive vice president of MoneyGram International in Dallas, one of the two biggest transmitters next to Western Union.AmeriMex Communications, a Roswell, Ga., company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with some convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, according to Don Aldridge, the chief executive of AmeriMex.Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash. Because it is nearly impossible for banks to know the identity of the final customer in a money transfer, remittance companies and their agents are being categorized as a high risk for money laundering and denied banking services. \u201cWe are part of the collateral damage,\u201d Mr. Aldridge said.He added he had considered buying three convenience stores in the Atlanta area and getting a money-transferring license, but he was told by his bank \u2014 First Citizens Bank in Raleigh, N.C. \u2014 that it would no longer be able to work with him if the stores were transferring money abroad.A spokeswoman for First Citizens Bank, Barbara Thompson, said that she was not aware of Mr. Aldridge\u2019s experience and that the bank did provide services to money-transfer companies that were registered with state and federal authorities.Wells Fargo is one bank that still offers services to money-transfer companies and their agents who send money from the United States to Mexico. But the bank provides such services only to companies or agents with which it has a relationship, and it puts them through tougher checks than it does with other customers, a bank spokesman said.A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment. JPMorgan and Citigroup did not respond to questions about their policy toward money-transfer companies and agents.Regulators are aware of the problems that money transmitters are facing; they say the situation is part of a wider trend of banks closing potentially risky accounts because of the costs of monitoring and compliance.\u201cAmong other factors, accounts may be dropped for very legitimate reasons, including suspicions of illicit activity or account holders not having the appropriate controls in place,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. \u201cThe fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants \u2014 which would not be a bad thing.\u201d\u201cWhat you don\u2019t see behind the scenes is that prices are going up,\u201d said Mr. Ohser of MoneyGram. A lack of banks willing to provide account services to any business that is transferring money to Mexico is causing friction and leading to increased costs, Mr. Ohser said.Regulators say they are growing concerned that people will resort to sending cash across the border, which is harder to track and riskier. \u201cMoney transmitters going out of business could lead remittance senders to use informal methods that are less detectable,\u201d according to a Government Accountability Office report published in January this year.Armored cars and courier services taking currency across the border have drawn the attention of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, which last year began investigating an increase in suspicious dollar currency shipments. FinCen investigators, along with Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have since tightened monitoring of border cash transit.The Treasury Department is working closely with Mexican authorities to address the difficulties that money-service businesses on both sides of the border are facing, Mr. Glaser said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for us that remittance channels remain open.\u201dVarious international organizations are also working on efforts to help the money-transfer industry get access to banks. The Financial Stability Board in Switzerland has been coordinating those efforts, since noting that the trend of banks withdrawing services to other banks \u2014 known as correspondent banking \u2014 \u201chas the potential to rise to a systemic issue.\u201dOpinions are not changing quickly enough for people like Mr. Lopez, however. He worries his accounts at Ria and MoneyGram could be closed, too. \u201cThat would be devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason I\u2019m trying to expand my shipping business. It\u2019s like Plan B.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Airbnb and Social Control in the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byBitsTechnology has all kinds of ways to make life easier \u2014 particularly for the tech companies themselves.When people sign up for the service, they waive the right to sue Airbnb, or join any arbitration or class-action lawsuit against the company. A few months back, Airbnb highlighted those terms, and older users were compelled to show that they were aware of the rights they were losing by listing with Airbnb.What Airbnb did not do was disclose how many clients it had who did seem to be renting out large blocks of real estate for long periods of time. That would have been simple for such a data-driven outfit, but that detail occupied little of the debate.The class-action waiver is particularly important where discrimination is concerned. Class-actions are a strong tool in discrimination cases, as the significance of the number of participants reinforces the idea that a systemic ill is being promulgated. It is the kind of thing that has helped ease discrimination by hotels and real estate brokers \u2014 Airbnb\u2019s old-economy counterparts.For its part, Airbnb says it is committed to ending discrimination, noting that it has kicked off hosts who discriminated against an African-American and a transgendered woman.What it hasn\u2019t done, yet, is show a policy that is superior to existing legal remedies, though an outside adviser to Airbnb tells Ms. Benner that it doesn\u2019t need the kind of pressures older companies needed to do the right thing. Apparently the new breed of companies are simply better, and don\u2019t do that kind of thing.Maybe. But Airbnb is hardly alone among tech companies in curbing the rights of the public on which it relies.Employees at tech companies are frequently bound by nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements that may follow them for years after they leave these companies \u2014 so, frequently, are contractors and government officials who work with the tech companies. While some of that may be understandable, nondisclosures in tech have few parallels elsewhere in the private sector.Tech is an industry supposedly built on the idea that transparency and information sharing make a better world for us all. Apparently not when the information involves things that might affect the company itself.It\u2019s enough to make you Google search the word \u201chypocrisy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cable Industry Mobilizes Lobbying Army to Block F.C.C. Moves", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In recent weeks, staff members for Bobby Rush, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, have asked fellow lawmakers to sign a letter opposing a Federal Communications Commission proposal to limit how broadband providers can share users\u2019 personal data.Last month, 60 lawmakers signed a separate letter voicing their objections to an F.C.C. regulation that would open the market for cable television set-top boxes.What the actions have in common: the financial connections and legwork of cable companies like Comcast.The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, an industry lobbying group, said it had edited the letter shared by Mr. Rush\u2019s staff. Cable industry lobbyists also helped gather the 60 signatures on the set-top-box letter; nearly all of the lawmakers who signed count cable and telecom companies as top campaign donors, according to federal disclosures.The behind-the-scenes activity by cable companies and their industry groups is part of the biggest lobbying push by the $115 billion industry in Washington since 2009, when the government drew up its net neutrality rules. These days, the cable and telecom industries are hiring more lobbyists, issuing warnings that they may sue federal agencies, and making speeches and writing scathing blog posts about policy makers.The trigger? A string of proposed regulations by the F.C.C. that has left cable companies feeling besieged.\u201cThe policy blows we are weathering are not modest regulatory corrections,\u201d Michael K. Powell, president of the N.C.T.A., said in a speech last month. \u201cThey have been thundering, tectonic shifts.\u201dThe cable companies\u2019 frustration has been compounded by concerns that the F.C.C. proposals punish them but reward tech companies like Google. The set-top-box proposal could give those companies access to cable and satellite television programming for their devices and let them track viewer habits for their ad businesses. The broadband privacy rules apply only to cable and telecom companies; tech companies are not included.The F.C.C. has largely adopted recommendations from Google on set-top-box reforms, the cable and telecom companies said. AT&T\u2019s senior vice president for external affairs, Jim Cicconi, has called the plan the \u201cGoogle proposal.\u201d The cable companies also said the F.C.C.\u2019s broadband privacy proposal would be much stronger than any restrictions placed on web companies.So the cable industry has harnessed its vast lobbying resources in Washington to fight back.AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and the N.C.T.A. are also practicing softer forms of lobbying \u2014 such as sponsoring studies and consultants who write op-ed articles \u2014 that cannot be easily traced, analysts and public interest groups like Free Press, which supports several broadband regulations, say.The industry\u2019s focus has been on helping members of Congress write letters of opposition to the F.C.C., including the critical letter shown by Mr. Rush\u2019s staff. The association said an employee contributed \u201cminor suggestions\u201d to the letter from Mr. Rush. Mr. Rush\u2019s spokeswoman, Debra Johnson, said the N.C.T.A. edits \u201cdid not change the substance of the letter\u201d and added that the congressman had a history of standing up for consumer protection issues.Mr. Waxman and other lawmakers who have been critical of the set-top-box plan said they were not financially motivated to weigh in on the issue.\u201cI don\u2019t represent clients on issues I don\u2019t believe in,\u201d Mr. Waxman said.Comcast and AT&T declined to comment on their lobbying activities. The N.C.T.A. declined to comment specifically on lobbying but said the set-top-box reform was widely unpopular and was also opposed by networks geared toward minority audiences as well as movie studios and labor unions.The F.C.C. said its proposals were aimed at creating more competition in the broadband market and protecting consumers.\u201cThese proposals are technology neutral and do not target any one company or sector of the telecommunications industry,\u201d said Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for the F.C.C. \u201cChairman Wheeler\u2019s proposals are about one thing: promoting meaningful competition among service providers so that consumers can have meaningful choices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another appetizer, ricotta gnocchi, came in a big bowl mingled with roasted tomatoes, sliced asparagus, garlic scapes, bits of lobster meat and saut\u00e9ed bell peppers, its flavors interesting and strong.Some entrees excelled. A misnamed \u201cclam bake\u201d consisted of an entire lobster, poached and shelled, the tail propped showily atop a custardy polenta studded with corn kernels, tricked out with two spears of asparagus and a single clam, in a luxuriously buttery broth. A trio of plump Georges Bay scallops was both tasty and pretty, pan-seared to a caramelized golden brownness and arrayed on a rectangular white plate atop an attractive spring risotto, with lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche lending a velvety richness and pea pur\u00e9e a brilliant green coloration. A New York strip, served with a cheesy bacon risotto and a Mexican mole, provided a hearty pleasure.Other entrees fell short. Some failed to exceed the sum of their parts, like a tuna fillet plopped in a bowl with two dumplings and two baby bok choi in an uninspired ginger-soy broth. Prominent flavors sometimes vanished: I picked up no hint of the Sichuan pepper rub on the tuna, and, try as I might, I tasted neither orange nor thyme in a bland \u201corange-thyme infused\u201d lamb loin.The menu at Fire at the Ridge fairly bristles with foie gras, caviar, truffles and other classic fine-dining items. This approach may need rethinking. With the scallop entree, for instance, I would ditch the caviar beurre blanc and add a fourth scallop. I would forget about the pomegranate arils on the \u201cvanilla-infused pineapple carpaccio.\u201d In fact, I would forget about the carpaccio altogether.Part of the problem is cost. On one visit we shared an appetizer and salad, two entrees and the cheapest bottle of wine on the list \u2014 no dessert \u2014 and the bill with tip came to $150. But there is also the nature of the setting. One winter evening we sat at a window booth, while a bunch of children were having a loud, fun apr\u00e8s-ski time on the snowy deck outside. A successful restaurant perfectly aligns place, cuisine, price, ambience and audience. Sometimes that means relaxing a bit and finding the sweet spot of your clientele.Mr. Cottle described the restaurant as part of a larger, ambitious plan to turn Powder Ridge into a major year-round destination. For that more expansive future, Fire at the Ridge might turn out to be perfect.

They are also calculating that it would be better off financially as part of the European Union than as part of an independent Britain.Scotland will push for negotiations to leave the country inside the single European market, and Ms. Sturgeon can use the threat of the referendum as leverage in dealing with the British leadership.Ms. Sturgeon sent a clear message by speaking to the Scottish people while standing in front of Scottish and European Union flags.In sharp contrast to England and Wales, Scotland voted for Britain to remain in the bloc by 62 percent to 38 percent, with all of its 32 council areas in favor. Northern Ireland also voted overwhelmingly to stay.\u201cIt is a significant and material change in circumstances,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said, speaking to reporters just hours after the referendum results were officially announced. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.\u201dA referendum should be held within the two-year time frame of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, she added, which will be enacted when the government in London invokes Article 50 of the bloc\u2019s governing treaty.\u201cIf Parliament judges that a second referendum is the best or only way to protect our place in Europe, it must have the option to hold one in that time scale,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said. \u201cI can confirm today that in order to protect that position we will begin to prepare the legislation that would be required to enable a new independence referendum to take place if and when Parliament so decides.\u201dThe Scottish cabinet will meet on Saturday to discuss further measures, she said, and the government plans to hold urgent talks with the European Commission and members of the European Union to make clear Scotland wants to remain in the bloc.While making clear that Scotland is taking a second hard look at independence, Ms. Sturgeon acknowledged the voters who voted against it two years ago, saying they were now more in favor.\u201cI know that they would not want me to simply assume their support or hear me talk about the challenges we face as if they are straightforward,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would want me to be straight and honest with them.\u201dAcross Scotland, people were stunned by the results of the referendum, but there were mixed reactions over the possibility of a second bid for independence. (The first one was described at the time as a \u201conce in a generation opportunity.\u201d)David Grey, 58, who voted for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 and in the European Union because of economic security, said he would \u201cvote for independence tomorrow if I could.\u201d England and Scotland \u201chave now diverged significantly,\u201d he said.Steven Murchie, 29, who works in a whisky shop, said he thought differently.

{"Headline": "For Boston Seaport, G.E. Was Just a Start", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet9 PhotosBOSTON \u2014 When General Electric decided to leave its longtime home in Connecticut and chose the waterfront district here for its new headquarters, it thrust a once-windswept province for fishermen and dock workers into the spotlight.Thomas M. Menino, a city mayor who died in 2014, had envisioned the area, just across the Fort Point Channel from downtown as an \u201cinnovation district,\u201d with state-of-the-art office space, plenty of walk-to-work apartments, numerous restaurants, and pedestrian-friendly streets and parks. Since 2000, the area has gained 10 million square feet of development and more than 4,000 residents. And in recent years, the appetite for a Seaport address has only increased, such that 2,700 residential units and 1.3 million square feet of office space are now in some stage of construction, according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority.From upstart technology companies to cutting-edge biomedical firms to traditional corporate giants, the Seaport is attracting businesses to both brick-and-beam style office space in old industrial buildings and to new glass office towers overlooking Boston Harbor.Among the more notable newcomers is Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which moved its global headquarters into twin glass towers on the waterfront in 2014. PricewaterhouseCoopers took 13 of 17 floors in an environmentally friendly office tower, 101 Seaport, last year. And this year, G.E. will move its headquarters into temporary Seaport space as the company begins rehabilitating two brick warehouses and constructing a new building in the Seaport\u2019s historic, industrial-era Fort Point neighborhood to make permanent offices.\u201cG.E. is not buying a place or a location,\u201d said Dennis Frenchman, a professor of urban design and planning at the Center for Real Estate, part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cG.E. is buying into a culture that they want their employees to be a part of.\u201dMr. Frenchman chose a barren stretch of parking lots in the Seaport as a study site this year for students in his real estate development studio program. The students were tasked with creating mixed-use proposals for the 22-acre site (which is not actually for sale), inspiring visions of robotics production spaces beneath apartment houses, waterfront \u201cmaker\u201d spaces, like breweries and chocolatiers, and co-working spaces for entrepreneurs.\u201cThe city really has developed this concept of an innovation district. We wanted students to think about what it means to innovate,\u201d said Peter Roth, a lecturer in real estate development who helps run the program. \u201cAnd there\u2019s so much activity in the Seaport right now that the students had a lot of projects to reference.\u201dOther crucial public investments included a new sewer treatment plant to help clean up Boston Harbor, new mass transit service via the Silver Line of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and construction of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.In devising a master plan for the area, the authority has taken care to \u201cavoid mega-blocks\u201d by requiring building frontages to be active with retail and local services, Mr. McGuinness said. In addition, the plan integrates the street grid system that was part of the historic district into the new district and requires developers to build public parks that connect with pathways to the waterfront.One of the most active developers in the Seaport (and an alumnus of the M.I.T. Center for Real Estate) is Shawn Hurley, the chief executive and president of Skanska U.S. Commercial Development in Boston. The company claims three projects totaling 1.3 million square feet on Seaport Boulevard, facing the harbor. In addition to 101 Seaport, Skanska recently completed the residential tower Watermark Seaport, which has about 280 luxury apartments and 65 loft-style units. Rents range from $2,300 to more than $7,000.Skanska is now building another office tower with an unusual elliptical design and two floors of retail space at 121 Seaport. That project is scheduled for completion in 2018.Mr. Hurley cited the infrastructure developments in the Seaport and the strength of the existing Fort Point neighborhood, home to many artists, as catalysts for the investment by Skanska, which is based in Sweden.\u201cIf you walk around Fort Point, at least 80 percent of those old buildings have been repositioned to new residential, retail, office, but it\u2019s kept the historic nature of the area,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people are the anchor for the seaport. We\u2019re building off of that. It\u2019s a great juxtaposition of old versus new.\u201dOther global investors agree. This year, Skanska sold 101 Seaport to a German real estate fund for $452 million, a price comparable to values in Boston\u2019s pricey downtown financial district.\u201cInvestors are trying to find yield, and the Seaport, with all that it has to offer, is one of the hottest submarkets in the country,\u201d said Glenn Verrette, an executive managing director in the Boston office of Cushman & Wakefield. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing capital from all over the world trying to invest in the Seaport and downtown Boston.\u201dAlexander Shing, the chairman and founder of Cottonwood Management, in Los Angeles, says his company drew on an international investor base to purchase two blocks in the Seaport for development of three 20-story towers. Just approved last month by the redevelopment authority, Cottonwood\u2019s project will include roughly 450 condominiums, 285 rentals and 125,000 square feet of retail space around a central courtyard.Directly on the harbor on Pier 4, known to longtime Bostonians as the former home of Anthony\u2019s restaurant, a local landmark, Tishman Speyer is teaming up with two Chinese insurance giants to build a 13-story office tower and a nine-story condominium building, both with ground-floor retail. Located next to the Institute of Contemporary Art, the development will also include a one-acre public park at the tip of the pier.With so many more people moving in and out of the Seaport now, additional infrastructure investments are again being eyed, this time for transit. Mr. McGuinness said the city was considering expanding its largest transit hub, South Station, as well as adding water transportation and increasing public awareness of the area\u2019s highway access points.Mr. Shing said the transportation crunch should not be a big concern. Solutions will evolve over time, he said, adding that, given what it signals about the Seaport\u2019s vibrancy, \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent problem to have.\u201dAn earlier version of this article used an outdated title for Shawn Hurley of Shanska. He is chief executive and president of U.S. Commercial Development for the company, no longer executive vice president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Capitol Hill, Yellen Finds Partisan Heat, Not Economic Light", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Year after year of disappointing growth in the United States. Disappearing middle-class jobs. Turmoil overseas, including the looming possibility that British voters will decide on Thursday to part ways with Europe. Urgent economic issues all.But what did some lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee want to talk about on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, was called before them for her semiannual testimony to Congress? Whether the Federal Reserve, which has the power to create money at will, is solvent.Ms. Yellen\u2019s final appearance before the presidential election in November was a master class in how many members of Congress have allowed real debate about the country\u2019s economic challenges to be subsumed in the broader political din.Wednesday\u2019s hearing followed a more sober session on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, where Ms. Yellen laid out a cautious view of the economy\u2019s prospects, playing down the risk of recession while reiterating that near-term weakness may prompt the Fed to hold off on any imminent rate increases.With that message dominating the headlines, it was the turn of House members to pressure the central bank, which has become a b\u00eate noire for the right, just as it once was for the left in years past.For the most part, Ms. Yellen didn\u2019t fall into any traps, echoing the academic, even remote tone adopted by predecessors like Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan in the face of congressional gadflies and firebrands.There were moments during the three-hour hearing when the Kabuki-type theater briefly abated and Ms. Yellen was asked to address the economic questions that many ordinary Americans are wrestling with, too.Representative Denny Heck, a Washington Democrat, noted that the government\u2019s best-known yardstick for unemployment stands at a healthy 4.7 percent.But he pointed out that a broader measure of joblessness, which includes part-time workers who can\u2019t find full-time work, is still more than twice as high, an unusually large gap by historical standards that underscores the paucity of gains in the current recovery for many workers.\u201cI agree with you,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, before acknowledging that the higher rate shows just how much slack remains as the economic recovery approaches its seventh anniversary.And Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican, queried Ms. Yellen on the impact of negative interest rates in Europe and Asia even as the Fed considers an interest rate increase in the coming months.That spread in rates could have major implications for the dollar, Ms. Yellen explained, noting how exchange rates are sensitive to monetary policy and affect things as varied as inflation and overall economic conditions.But the insights from Ms. Yellen, who taught economics at the University of California, Berkeley, for many years, were soon drowned by the dog whistles and dubious political point-scoring.Representative Scott Garrett, a senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee, accused Ms. Yellen of unfairly aiding Wall Street and worsening income inequality.That\u2019s a serious issue, subject to intense debate among economists, but Mr. Garrett made it partisan by accusing Ms. Yellen of making statements that were \u201ceerily similar to what the administration has said,\u201d and then giving her little opportunity to explain her position.\u201cWhy do you see a need to benefit Goldman Sachs?\u201d he asked.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we are not trying to benefit the rich,\u201d Ms. Yellen responded, before trying to interject that more than 14 million jobs had been created since the recession ended in 2009.\u201cExcuse me, I have the floor,\u201d said Mr. Garrett, not long before the chairman\u2019s gavel brought the unenlightening exchange to an end.Representative Frank Guinta, a New Hampshire Republican, was more polite. But he noted that the Great Depression, stagflation of the 1970s and most recently the Great Recession had all taken place since the Fed\u2019s creation more than a century ago, apparently confusing correlation with causation.He then wandered off on a tangent to inquire how often Ms. Yellen consults with Richard Cordray of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and what thoughts she had on the agency\u2019s budget.An apparently puzzled Ms. Yellen pointed out that it is her staff that deals with Mr. Cordray, a longtime Republican target, before waving off how the new agency is funded as a matter for Congress, which holds the government\u2019s purse strings, not the Fed.Using an unusual metaphor not found in economic textbooks, the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, compared the central bank\u2019s tradition of charging banks interest on reserves at the Fed to how his son chases his daughter around the house with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.Then it was the turn of Representative Sean P. Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican, to cite the imposition of hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations in recent years. He wanted to know if that was among the \u201cheadwinds\u201d Ms. Yellen has cited as hurting growth.\u201cAre you referring to our regulations?\u201d she asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about government regulations,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you cite it as a headwind?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to quantify the extent to which regulations is headwind,\u201d she said. \u201cBusinesses certainly cite regulation as a factor.\u201dAfter a fruitless attempt to get Ms. Yellen to call health insurance costs for Wisconsin manufacturers a headwind, Mr. Duffy gave up in a fit of pique.\u201cI\u2019ll accept that as a nonanswer,\u201d he said.Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, and other members peppered Ms. Yellen with questions on whether the Fed itself is too big to fail, wondering aloud whether the central bank was a threat to global stability and needed to be subject to the kind of \u201cstress tests\u201d it forces commercial banks to go through.\u201dOur balance sheet is very different,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe Fed is very different from a commercial bank.\u201dStill, at least one committee member, Representative Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, stepped in to defend Ms. Yellen, turning attention back to her fellow lawmakers.\u201cThe failure is Congress\u2019s failure, not the Fed\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cStop derailing us with nonsense.\u201dA news analysis article on Thursday about politically inspired questioning of the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, at a House hearing misstated the given name of a member of Congress from Washington State. He is Denny Heck, not Danny.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Republicans Draw District Boundaries, They Can\u2019t Lose. Literally.", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Most Americans are probably familiar with the, ahem, vibrant title of this book thanks to a copy (print or DVD) of Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d a term employed equally by conniving frat boys and Nixon-era political strategists to denote fraudulent election shenanigans.But the practical implications of the word today would make the very same Watergate baddies blush. In his new book, David Daley, the editor in chief of Salon, describes what the Republican strategist Ben Ginsberg has called \u201cProject Rat_____\u2009\u201d: the strategy of shadowy (but thus far legal) packing, splicing and dicing of congressional districts to secure Republican domination and, in turn, subvert the will of the American voter.In its more modest form of gerrymandering, the practice has been in play for decades and used by both parties alike. But Daley proposes that this particular strain of manipulation is unprecedented in its sophistication, its permanence and its virulence. Of the myriad theories about why, precisely, American democracy seems so broken \u2014 increasing socio-\u00adeconomic divides, media bifurcation, voter suppression efforts \u2014 Daley points to this Republican-led district distortion as the truly original sin, and the one from which our democracy is unlikely to recover anytime soon.He illustrates this using the examples of six grossly manipulated states: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Wisconsin, where the drawing of district lines has been rigged to such a perverted degree that the resulting congressional delegation bears little resemblance to the actual votes cast. Along the way, the reader is introduced to a league of largely unknown but nonetheless hugely influential local politicians and strategists who, beginning mostly in 2010, on the heels of the last census, engage in a variety of nefarious and oftentimes comedically crooked practices to subvert electoral reality. There are off-site \u00adbunkers, duped innocents and wild smear campaigns, including one that accuses a Democratic rival of trying to build a $600\u202fmillion \u201cTaj Mahal library\u201d in honor of former Senator Arlen Specter.Assisted by increasingly sophisticated technology (there is a brief but intriguing chapter on mapmaking) and mountains of voter information data (including party affiliation, education levels and commute times), these (mostly) men have collected and analyzed the figures to draw preferential maps, funded by post-Citizens United dark money, and supported in their efforts by Republican governors and conservative courts.Democrats and likely Democrats have been systematically packed together to ensure landslide victories in a handful of districts, sometimes with the help of underrepresented Democratic minorities looking to secure a seat in Congress \u2014 a shortsighted strategy of tragic \u00adproportions.Republican voters and those leaning conservative, in turn, have been spread out to maximize their voting power across as much territory as possible. Sandra Day O\u2019Connor referred to the separation by race, which often amounts to separation by party affiliation, as \u201cpolitical apartheid,\u201d and indeed, the carve-outs are exotic and pernicious. Pennsylvania\u2019s Seventh District, thanks to this manipulation, is drawn in such a way that it looks like \u201cDonald Duck kicking Goofy.\u201d While the metaphor is funny, it\u2019s also devastating: This is not what the founders meant by \u201ca more perfect union.\u201dAs for the results? In the election of 2012, Barack Obama won the state of Pennsylvania with 52 percent of the vote. Democratic House candidates won 51 percent of the vote. But Democratic House candidates won only 28 percent of the state\u2019s seats. In North Carolina, Democratic House candidates won 50.6 percent of the vote, but Republicans seized 9 of the 13 congressional seats. By 2014, they would have 10. The list goes on.Beyond the partisan distortion, this mutilation has had the secondary but no less cancerous effect of making congressional districts deeply homogeneous. The \u00adRepublican-favored landscape has given rise to the phenomenon of disruptive primary challenges from within the Grand Old Party. With no reward for work conducted across the aisle, Congress has turned from a place of compromise to one of extremism, as representatives fight to protect their right flanks.Daley argues that this is the reason our legislative branch refuses to act on issues including gun control, climate change and college debt \u2014 issues with broad national support, but ones that offer little reward for Republican representatives seeking to hold their own in a hostile, conservative environment back home.The book is disheartening and enraging in equal measure \u2014 and also occasionally dull, as when the numerous stories of electoral manipulation seem to repeat themselves. But where should the reader channel his or her anger? Certainly the Republican Party\u2019s audacity is worthy of indignation, but its strategic expenditures and long-term focus are impressive, enviable even \u2014 especially in comparison with the bumbling Democrats, who seem to have been blindsided by the G.O.P.\u2019s takeover. One Ohio-based election scholar says: \u201cI\u2019m not being partisan here. I\u2019m just making an observation that the Democrats have been dumb about all this for a long time.\u201dDaley would seem to agree and suggests that the left remains ill equipped to counterattack \u2014 and ill disposed toward what would be better yet: to remove the drawing of congressional lines entirely from political hands and be done with the whole sordid mess. Instead, these distorted, Rorschachian districts are likely to continue to plague our democracy until the next census in 2020, and possibly for some time thereafter.While the work is extraordinarily timely and undeniably important, Daley\u2019s \u00adargument is perhaps a bit too zealous. No doubt this sinister practice has effectively destroyed congressional cooperation, but one has to wonder, especially this election year, whether America\u2019s partisan divide really is simply the result of nefarious mapmaking. The rise of an angry, inchoate political force \u2014 one that has not only bucked party orthodoxy but maintained widespread grass-roots support \u2014 would seem to lend credence to the idea that progress on big-ticket issues relating to the environment and economy is not stalled just because of this miserable redistricting process, but indeed because of a growing and seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the haves and have-nots, urbanites and \u00adruralists, insiders and outsiders. Then again, come Nov. 8, someone will be tasked with trying to put the country back together, and perhaps these warped districts are exactly the place to start.Alex Wagner is a senior editor at The Atlantic.

{"Headline": "Would America Have Fewer Missing Workers if It Were More Like France?", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhat if the very thing that is often viewed as one of the United States\u2019 sources of dynamism \u2014 flexible labor markets \u2014 is the driving force behind the economy\u2019s greatest weakness: millions of people who are neither working nor looking for a job?These missing workers are predominately less educated men, and their numbers have been mounting for decades. The White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates that in 1964, 97 percent of men with a high school degree or less in the so-called prime-age working years of 25 to 54 were working or seeking work. That is now down to 83 percent.In the United States, there is less standing in the way between an employer who wants to hire someone and a person who wants to work than in most Western European countries or Japan.In theory, this flexibility should create more opportunities for anyone who wants work to find it, in contrast with European countries where companies are more reluctant to add jobs because regulations and union rules make it costly to fire people or sometimes even change their jobs.Yet a higher proportion of working-age men are in the labor force in many of these countries with inflexible labor market policies. In the United States, 12 percent of 25- to 54-year-old men were neither working nor looking for work in 2014. That number was 7 percent in Spain and France, and 4 percent in Japan. And that\u2019s despite a more generous social safety net in those countries that would, you might think, make it easier to drop out of the work force.In other words, whatever the costs and downsides of European-style labor markets, they don\u2019t seem to inhibit the number of prime-age men who work. They may even make less educated men more likely to remain part of the work force.Perhaps men without much education are more likely to seek work when positions offer job security and when regulations and unions push wages higher than they would be on a more open market. And perhaps that effect counteracts the economic negatives of these policies in terms of fewer jobs and less dynamic businesses.\u201cOne traditional defense of American-style labor market arrangements is that though they may result in more inequality, the labor market will function better as a result,\u201d the White House economists write. But the international comparisons \u201csuggest that a successful labor market requires, at the very least, more than just flexibility but also policies or institutions that help connect workers with jobs or facilitate their taking jobs through subsidized child care or flexible workplaces.\u201dThe data, they add, \u201csuggests that the American labor market has room to improve when it comes to creating conditions for meaningful employment.\u201dWhat would those be? The Obama administration emphasizes policies to increase \u201cconnective tissue\u201d in the job market. Those include improving community college and job training programs. The report also advocates improved unemployment insurance, and wage insurance programs that would provide income to people whose pay gets cut.The economists also note some other factors that could explain the United States\u2019 poor showing, particularly astronomical incarceration numbers. The male population in the United States includes many more former prisoners than in other advanced democracies, and they are disproportionately likely to be out of the labor force.\u201cThe analysis in this report has shown that simply making labor markets more \u2018flexible\u2019 is, at least, not sufficient for effective functioning and that making labor markets more \u2018supportive\u2019 is essential,\u201d the report said.There is no guarantee that a more European-style labor market would solve America\u2019s missing male worker problem, let alone solve those much bigger problems. But the international comparisons suggest less flexible labor markets might have some advantages.Advertisement"}

A mountain of tires burned. Roads were blocked. Young men poured into the streets of a slum in Nairobi, gleefully carrying huge, jagged pieces of concrete.In Kisumu, a city on Lake Victoria, witnesses said police officers had fired on a crowd. A 5-year-old boy was in critical condition after being shot in the back. A demonstrator was killed.Now, with another election scheduled for next year and the opposition already mobilizing thousands of people, many Kenyans are worried about recent economic gains\u2019 being reduced to char blowing in the wind.\u201cIt\u2019s getting very nervy,\u201d said Aly-Khan Satchu, an investment adviser in Nairobi. \u201cThe economy crashes and burns when we fumble these elections. What\u2019s worrying is that this is happening so early, that we already have this degree of contestation.\u201dEach Monday, now known as Tear Gas Monday, many businesses close. Parents do not send their children to school. Motorists stay off the streets, afraid of rocks being thrown through their windshields.The opposition leaders are aware of this; part of their leverage is the ability to slow down the economy. A watchman in Nairobi spoke of his \u201cinside fear\u201d of even coming to town on Mondays.The opposition\u2019s rallying point has become Kenya\u2019s election commission. Raila Odinga, a former prime minister who has been angling for president for much of the past two decades, has demanded that the government disband the commission, which is widely viewed as biased and corrupt.This is another problem in Kenya. Almost all corruption cases against powerful people languish for months. Then they quietly disappear.\u201cThe government needs to throw out that commission,\u201d said Paul Shida, a welder in the Kibera slums in Nairobi, where the protests began Monday. \u201cStreet protest is the only language the government understands.\u201dBut as the protests grind on, a cat-and-mouse game is being played between Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s government and Kenya\u2019s judiciary, which many Kenyans regard as independent.Last week, police officials banned an opposition rally in the city\u2019s historic Uhuru Park; a court promptly overturned that ban.This weekend, police officials declared again that it was illegal for the opposition to protest and warned that they were ready to use lethal force. They did so in Kisumu on Monday. Witnesses said the police fired indiscriminately at a crowd, hitting the 5-year-old boy and leaving him in critical condition, and killing a middle-aged protester.Also on Monday, a court ruled that the opposition had a right to protest and that the police had a duty to protect demonstrators.Though the violence in the past few weeks has been nothing compared with the paroxysm of bloodshed that swept the country in 2007 and 2008, the dynamics are similar. The nation, and especially its economy, are being held hostage by the relationship between Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga, who will most likely face off in the election next year.Last week, tensions suddenly lifted after the two met and a picture of them walking together, smiling, appeared on the front pages of the leading newspapers.But the two were soon at loggerheads again, and the protests were back on. Mr. Satchu estimated that at least $5 million was lost every Monday because of interruptions, closed businesses, property destruction and petty crime.On Monday afternoon, Bharat Shah, who runs a Nairobi curio shop, held up a pad of paper with the number 360 scribbled on it, for 360 shillings, less than $4.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve sold today,\u201d he said with a wry laugh. \u201cOne packet of beads.\u201dJust as in 2007-8, business leaders have been discreetly meeting with government and opposition leaders, urging them to compromise, for the sake of the economy.\u201cAmong international investors, there remains a strong commitment to Kenya as a gateway to this region, and that hasn\u2019t been shaken yet,\u201d Mr. Satchu said. \u201cBut surely it will be shaken if this malarkey continues.\u201dAn earlier version of the capsule summary with this article misstated the location of the shooting of a 5-year-old boy.

{"Headline": "Looking at Timber and Seeing the Future of Home and Business", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byBuilding in wood is not unusual, though until recently it was widely considered unsuitable for high-rise or large-scale residential and commercial projects. This was predominantly because of the potential fire risk but also because of the higher sensitivity of wood, compared with concrete, to stresses such as wind and temperature changes.Over the past 10 years, however, the emergence of an engineered product known as cross-laminated timber, or CLT, has made wood a viable option for wider-scale construction.The production process involves gluing pieces of timber into panels, which are then cross laid to form larger sections, strong enough to withstand being used at greater heights and volume. CLT has significant fire retardant qualities and the potential to be a flexible, lower-cost option for the construction industry.It may also be more sustainable. According to reports from environmental, timber industry and academic analysts, it is estimated that the production and use of CLT generates about half the carbon footprint of concrete.\u201cCross-lamination establishes a new level of quality control and fire protection,\u201d said Kevin Flanagan, a partner with PLP Architecture in London. \u201cIt brings a new structure and form.\u201d Timber is now being used at increasing heights, from 10 to 20 stories, he said.PLP recently presented the concept of Oakwood Tower, an 80-story building in timber and glass, to members of the London Assembly. The elegantly tapered structure was designed with capacity for 1,000 residences. Though not yet included in any definite construction plan, it forms part of a research project by the University of Cambridge into the potential scale and uses of timber in dense urban environments.One benefit of CLT is that panels are made to the specifications needed at the factory, then assembled on site. It means the process of construction is quicker than using standard materials such as concrete and steel, industry experts say.\u201cFaster construction is less disruptive to the local neighborhood, and timber is also lighter, so could conceivably be used to extend existing concrete buildings upwards,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. \u201cPlus, it puts less stress on underground infrastructure, such as transport tunnels.\u201dMr. Flanagan also said that timber has a higher aesthetic appeal for humans than concrete and a softer visual impact on the landscape, encouraging a sense of well-being among residents. Though CLT has existed for about 10 years, it use has widened only recently. One early adopter was Andrew Waugh, a London architect who lives in a seven-story timber apartment block he designed. His company, Waugh Thistleton, began using CLT in 2003 for small projects, scaling up in 2009 with Murray Grove, a 29-unit residential block in east London for Telford Homes. Since then, he has also designed timber office blocks and a large-scale residential site for the developer Regal Homes, currently under construction in east London, with 121 rental units.Mr. Waugh said that CLT was less costly than concrete but that soundproofing and energy efficiency in the built product were comparable or better. \u201cWood is very underrated as a building material, but you have to understand how it works and design with timber in mind from the start,\u201d he said. The use of wood makes sense in locations that have access to large timber resources. The eight-story Carbon12 building was recently approved in Portland, Ore., a state that has significant forestry reserves. It will have commercial premises and 14 residential units, and is one of several timber projects of five stories or taller underway in the city.In Australia, Lendlease, a developer, has also explored options in wood. In 2012 it completed the Fort\u00e9 building, a 10-story apartment complex in Melbourne. At the time, the building was the world\u2019s tallest timber structure, with 23 residences. Since then, the firm has rolled out CLT projects in London and been appointed to a government-backed research program to explore the potential for the material in Singapore.In France, too, wood is being introduced as an elegant, practical option for housing. This year, the authorities in Bordeaux commissioned Hyp\u00e9rion, a 183,000-square-foot, multi-use complex of residential and business units.The design, by the architect Jean-Paul Viguier, has three towers, one of which will be in wood and reach 18 stories to become the world\u2019s tallest timber building when it is completed in 2020. Each floor will have five or six apartments or duplexes with glass balconies and a series of garden and outdoor areas.Timber has also begun to make noticeable forays into the residential markets of Scandinavia. In Norway, the 14-story Treet tower in Bergen offers 62 apartments. Half of the units, priced from about 3.3 million kroners, or $404,000, were sold before the start of construction in 2014, though units are still available.Cities in Sweden have also embraced the trend. Folkhem, a Stockholm developer, plans to build projects on 22 sites in the Swedish capital, with 6,000 apartments in total. One of these is Strandparken, a waterfront site where two eight-story timber blocks, with 64 apartments, have been completed and sold.\u201cUsing wood makes sense in Scandinavia, where timber grows fast and is an endless natural resource,\u201d said Martin Videgard, director of Tham & Videgard, a Swedish architect practice. \u201cWe see timber not as a trend but as a way of dealing with sustainability issues.\u201dThe firm has submitted designs for a proposed mixed-use waterfront development in Stockholm, also for Folkhem. The project will have four 20-story timber towers with more than 200 residential units, as well as commercial space on the lower floors. The towers were designed to allow maximum light to pass around and through the structures.Economies of scale may make CLT increasingly cost-effective, but at the moment it is still a niche material. \u201cIt\u2019s early stages for the industry,\u201d Mr. Videgard said. \u201cA lot of firms are waiting to see how it works on the ground, but it\u2019s nice that we are at the forefront.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stewing as she tries to make sense of her predicament and prepares for her impeachment trial, Ms. Rousseff compared her rivals to the strangler figs that envelop trees in the jungle, slowly choking them to death.And yet, she has relished a few unexpected glimmers of hope.On Monday, Brazilian news organizations reported that the country\u2019s chief prosecutor was seeking to arrest several leading figures in Mr. Temer\u2019s party \u2014 including the head of the Senate, a former president and the former speaker of the lower house \u2014 after recordings suggested that they had sought to interfere with the Petrobras investigation.\u201cI am perplexed, indignant and revolted,\u201d the former president, Jos\u00e9 Sarney, said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s a provisional government of rich white men,\u201d Ms. Rousseff, a self-described leftist who was an operative in an urban guerrilla group in her youth, said about the administration of her adversary. \u201cI never thought that I would see in Brazil a government as conservative as this one.\u201dMs. Rousseff and her allies hope that the recent blows to Mr. Temer\u2019s legitimacy can tilt the impeachment vote in her favor. She pointed out that all she needs is a handful of senators to change their votes for her to be reinstated as president.Still, for every misstep by her adversaries, Ms. Rousseff and her own top confidants have also found themselves caught off-guard by new revelations in federal graft inquiries, reflecting the challenges that her Workers\u2019 Party faces in its ambition to win her impeachment trial and return her to the presidency.Ms. Rousseff remains rare among major political figures in that she has not been accused of stealing for personal gain. Instead, she faces charges of manipulating the budget in order to hide the depths of Brazil\u2019s economic woes.But a former Petrobras executive has also testified that Ms. Rousseff lied about her knowledge of a bribery-fueled refinery deal when she was the chairwoman of the company\u2019s board. She denies the claim.Potentially even more damaging, the Brazilian magazine Isto \u00c9 reported in recent days that a construction magnate testified that Ms. Rousseff negotiated an illegal $3.5 million donation for her 2014 re-election campaign.Josias de Souza, a prominent political columnist, described the latest revelations tarnishing the camps of both Ms. Rousseff and Mr. Temer as \u201ca classic power struggle between criminal factions\u201d taking place before a recession-weary society.Despite such grim assessments, Ms. Rousseff is avidly preparing her defense. She consults with aides, bounces strategies off lawyers. Sometimes, her legal team convenes in the quiet chapel on the grounds of the palace.\u201cThey\u2019ve always wanted me to resign, but I won\u2019t,\u201d she said, arguing that her rivals were carrying out a coup, albeit one with the Supreme Court\u2019s stamp of approval. \u201cI really disturb the parasites, and I\u2019ll keep on disturbing them.\u201dDilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s president, is facing removal from office. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings.Senate leaders said on Monday that the impeachment trial was expected to conclude sometime in early August, potentially producing embarrassing street protests as the Olympic Games get underway, regardless of how the Senate rules.In the meantime, Ms. Rousseff expresses irritability, if not resignation, over the toll that the political upheaval has had on the young democracy established in 1985 in Brazil after a long military dictatorship.\u201cThis is a turning point,\u201d she said about the rupture producing Mr. Temer\u2019s ascension. \u201cA pact that existed has broken.\u201dGlossing over criticism that her policies laid the groundwork for Brazil\u2019s economic crisis, she argued that the economy would already be on the mend if congressional leaders had not thwarted measures aimed at restoring confidence.Cicero, the orator and constitutionalist, denounced Catiline in a series of speeches before the Senate, and Ms. Rousseff, smiling as she recalled her schoolgirl Latin, said: \u201cQuam diu etiam furor iste tuus eludet?\u201dThe sentence was from one of the speeches, which questioned how much longer Catiline would continue abusing the republic\u2019s patience. In the question repeated by Ms. Rousseff, Cicero asked, \u201cHow long is that madness of yours still to mock us?\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of Brazil\u2019s president.

{"Headline": "Conservative to Fund Republicans Who Back Climate Change Action", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A self-described conservative North Carolina businessman has promised to spend at least $5 million through his political action committee to back five Republican congressional candidates who have supported taking action to curb climate change.Even as his party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee denies the existence of global warming, the businessman, Jay Faison, and his ClearPath Action Fund will spend at least $2 million on digital media campaigns to defend Senate incumbents running in two of the tightest races in the country, Rob Portman in Ohio and Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, a recognition of the senators\u2019 support for clean energy, Mr. Faison said Wednesday. The advertisements are expected to start running this week.ClearPath is also spending several hundred thousand dollars on digital advertising campaigns to support Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Tom Reed and Elise Stefanik of New York, all Republicans running for re-election in similarly tight races.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is prove to the party, through these races, that clean energy wins races, to build a political safe space for the Republican Party to talk about this,\u201d Mr. Faison said in an interview. \u201cIt is difficult for a politician to consistently act in an area with no reward. We have their back.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re also making that case to the Trump campaign.\u201dThe spending comes as Republican leaders have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change and attacked President Obama\u2019s climate change policies. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, has mocked climate science and vowed to cancel the Paris Agreement, the 2015 global accord committing nearly every country on earth to taking action to fight climate change.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, calls Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d But some Republican members of Congress who hope to carve out careers that could outlast Mr. Trump\u2019s have begun to quietly consider how to address climate change, which they believe resonates with a growing segment of voters, particularly young people.Political strategists are paying attention to polls that show Americans expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening. A March Gallup poll found that 64 percent of American adults worry \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d about global warming, the highest number since 2008, and it found that a record 65 percent of Americans attribute global warming to human activity.However, most polls asking voters to rank the importance of issues find that environmental concerns trail far behind concerns about jobs and the economy.Still, in many campaigns, Democrats are attacking Republicans as climate deniers.Some moderate Republicans hope to use their views on climate change to draw a contrast with Mr. Trump.\u201cAll of them need to demonstrate a level of independence from the national party in order to survive,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, speaking of the five lawmakers backed by Mr. Faison\u2019s group. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to declare independence from Donald Trump.\u201dIn 2015, Ms. Ayotte broke with her party to vote against a measure written by Mr. McConnell that would have blocked Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules. She also voted for a program to establish grants to schools for climate change education, against a proposal to block the Obama administration from signing on to the Paris climate change accord, and in favor of a federal fund to respond to the threat of climate change.Mr. Portman voted with his party on most of those measures, but also voted in favor of the fund to respond to climate threats. He has worked for years with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a bill to improve energy efficiency in buildings. He is a former board member of the Nature Conservancy and is a co-author of legislation to support cleanup of the Great Lakes.The three House members backed by Mr. Faison\u2019s group are among just 13 Republicans who have signed on to a resolution, offered by Representative Chris Gibson, Republican of New York. \u201cThe resolution was a vehicle to find out which Republicans were willing to step up and take some action,\u201d said Steve Valk, a spokesman for Citizen\u2019s Climate Lobby.In Miami, Mr. Curbelo\u2019s opponent, Annette Tadeo, a Democrat, has slammed his climate positions as hypocritical. \u201cBig oil and gas lobbyists have been filling his campaign coffers with thousands of dollars in cash, in exchange for his advocacy for offshore drilling,\u201d she said in a statement.In Ohio, Mr. Portman is fighting to keep his seat against a former governor, Ted Strickland, who notes his support of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate plan and slams Mr. Portman for voting against it.In upstate New York, a local newspaper, The Post-Star, noted that Ms. Stefanik\u2019s support for the climate change resolution was paired with votes against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change plan. \u201cWe were especially interested in how she could acknowledge climate change in one stand, yet vote to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan (new standards for coal-burning power plants), especially while representing a region that was devastated by acid rain from those plants in the Midwest,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote.Some political observers have drawn comparisons between Mr. Faison and Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic donor whose political action committee, NextGen Climate Action, has spent heavily to push candidates who champion climate change issues. Mr. Steyer emerged as the single biggest political donor of the 2014 cycle, spending $74 million to influence voters, far more than the $5 million pledged by Mr. Faison\u2019s group. Mr. Steyer, whose group has already laid out plans to spend at least $25 million in 2016, disavowed the comparison to Mr. Faison.\u201cFrom what we can tell by the people he is supporting, he is grading Republicans on the curve,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in an interview. \u201cWe have fairly objective standards for grading people, and none of the them come close to meeting our standards.\u201d Mr. Steyer said his group planned to support the Democratic Senate candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire.And while the ads run by Mr. Faison\u2019s group note the candidates\u2019 support of clean energy, showing lush green fields and sparkling blue skies, they never explicitly mention the term climate change. Mr. Faison acknowledges that while he supports Republicans who have supported climate change policy, it is still too politically divisive to actually use the phrase.\u201cClimate change is a divisive term on the Hill and it\u2019s a divisive term among the electorate,\u201d said Mr. Faison. \u201cBut \u2018clean energy\u2019 tells a voter you care about the environment, and deflects attacks about climate change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wyeth, a Temple of Midcentury Modern Design, Seeks New Wallets", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byWhen the actress Kate Hudson needed a sofa, she headed to Wyeth in SoHo for a vintage blue Dunbar by Edward Wormley.When the designer Tomas Maier needed a coffee table, he went there, too, and plunked down his credit card for a safety glass and stainless-steel coffee table from Joe D\u2019Urso.With its sky-high prices and enormous selection of Danish modernist pieces, the store is arguably the premiere midcentury-modern emporium in the United States. Its owner, John Birch, is also one of the most elusive, and talked about, dealers on the high-end furniture scene: a Larry Gagosian for the interior-decorator set, with strong taste that did not just mirror the market but helped set it.Mr. Birch \u2014 a trim, square-jawed 53-year-old with blue-green eyes and salt and pepper spackled hair \u2014 hobnobs with the Olsen twins (who featured an assortment of his furniture at the most recent presentation of their line, the Row), introduced Helmut Lang to his assortment of Wegner furniture and has recently been giving Jimmy Fallon advice on his Gramercy Park home.Yet as movers came in and out on a recent afternoon, and a team from Sotheby\u2019s prepared to photograph pieces for the catalog, Mr. Birch looked less like a furniture mogul than a boy whose toys were being taken away from him.\u201cI don\u2019t understand the empty tables,\u201d he said, peering around the room. \u201cNothing\u2019s ever empty at Wyeth.\u201dA bulb in one of Noguchi ceiling lanterns had gone out and was becoming a source of real irritation. \u201cI\u2019m glad I have employees who realize the bulb has been blown out for two weeks,\u201d he said sarcastically, climbing on top of a Hans Wegner desk so he could replace it himself.As can be surmised, Mr. Birch is a glass-half-empty sort of guy. He\u2019s not mean, although he says so little and charges so much for things that people often presume he must be. But he is painstaking, meticulous and so focused on achieving a kind of aesthetic perfection that he can drive himself (and everyone around him) crazy.And in recent months, it\u2019s not just neurosis keeping him up at night.\u201cIt\u2019s a last stand,\u201d Mr. Birch said, reflecting on the current state of the high-end furniture market. \u201cRetail is a terrible business.\u201d In fact, he sees his new showroom as a way of weaning himself away from 1stdibs. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with them anymore,\u201d he said.But how did it come to this, that one of the country\u2019s leading purveyors of midcentury modern design should find himself in retrenchment, just as the market finds a wider audience thanks to sites like 1stdibs, not to mention knockoff manufacturers that hawk cheap imitations?John Birch (no relation to the Baptist minister who has a right-wing group named after him) was born in Brigham City, Utah, the oldest boy in a Mormon family of nine children. \u201cWith only one mother!\u201d joked his younger brother Paul, who as Wyeth\u2019s principal woodworker builds many of the original pieces and oversees restoration of vintage finds.In the early 1980s, after attending Brigham Young University for a semester (\u201cmaybe half,\u201d he said), Mr. Birch arrived in New York City, fell into the fashion business, and spent a decade bouncing around the display departments of Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Giorgio Armani.\u201cHe had an incredible eye and very defined taste,\u201d said Gabriella Forte, who was his boss at Armani before becoming president at Calvin Klein and then chief executive of David Yurman. \u201cHe positions things with real talent. It\u2019s pure simplicity. Is it minimalism? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it. It was just perfection.\u201dBy 1994, Mr. Birch had had enough. So he leased a 3,500-square-foot space on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, named it for his then 3-year-old son, Wyeth, and filled it with his favorite things. (Wyeth graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design last year and now works for the family business. Mr. Birch and Wyeth\u2019s mother, Daphne, separated over a decade ago, though they never divorced. \u201cIt\u2019s cordial,\u201d Mr. Birch said.)Back then, TriBeCa was still in its infancy. Nobu had just opened and the majority of big antiques dealers had fairly narrow specialties like Biedermeier and Art Deco, which befit an earlier, fussier era.\u201cHe would take objects that were somehow considered less valuable, that didn\u2019t necessarily have pedigree, and reassemble them in unexpected ways,\u201d Ms. Standefer said. \u201cHe certainly educated American consumers to a kind of Danish design. But what I found most interesting is what he paired those things with. That\u2019s what was different. That\u2019s what was unusual.\u201dSoon, word spread about the midcentury-loving Mormon who talked little to his customers and charged a fortune for the coolest stuff in town.Around that time, a woman with long blond hair began coming in regularly without ever saying hello or goodbye. \u201cAfter five visits, she handed over her credit card,\u201d Mr. Birch said. \u201cIt was Annie Leibovitz.\u201dMany of his famous customers did not even get discounts or a friendly smile. \u201cHe was not a pleasure to buy from,\u201d Diane von Furstenberg said. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t.\u201dBut instead of walking away, she (like many others) became a repeat customer, part of an elite circle that kept coming back even as they complained about the store\u2019s outrageous prices and the way its owner barely seemed to grunt in their direction.As with most myths, the legend may not have been totally in sync with reality. Mr. Birch, it turns out, is actually shy, the sort of person who is more comfortable with beautiful things than beautiful people. And those that did try negotiating often got a bargain, particularly when he sensed a fellow design worshiper.Still, his untraditional approach to salesmanship had a reverse playback among a subset of people used to being doted upon: His lack of solicitousness made customers desperate to buy from him.\u201cPart of his mystique was that he was elusive,\u201d said Wendy Goodman, the design editor of New York Magazine. \u201cWhen you went in and had an audience with him, it was a big thing. Because it was a question: \u2018Were you worth it?\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s more or less how Jessica Seinfeld, another person who came to Wyeth over the years, described the experience of shopping there. \u201cTheir taste is impeccable,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery piece in their shop is \u2018important\u2019 in one way or another, so I respect their consistency, even their condescension. I find myself charmed by their lack of interest in human contact.\u201dWyeth did go through rough patches, which often coincided with its expansion. It moved out of Franklin Street and into its current 10,000-square-foot home on Spring Street around the September 2001 attacks. And it opened a space in Sagaponack, N.Y., in 2008, just after the financial crisis hit.Casual customers presumed that Mr. Birch cared only about selling things at the highest price, but as Wyeth\u2019s trove grew and grew, a different theory emerged among those who knew him best. Mr. Birch, they said, could not bear to be separated from his favorite things, so he began pricing them as high as possible so they wouldn\u2019t sell.\u201cHe\u2019s putting together a continuum of a design aesthetic, and to do that, he needs to own these things, touch them and feel them,\u201d said Richard Barrett, his friend and landlord at 533 Canal. \u201cSome might say he\u2019s a hoarder.\u201dMr. Birch didn\u2019t exactly deny the thesis. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I was never focused on money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even get sales reports. I don\u2019t ask for them.\u201dHis idiosyncratic approach to business also extended to the new Canal Street store.\u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cEven the typeface looked like Wyeth.\u201d (Restoration Hardware did not respond to a request for comment.)\u201cWhen you educate people too well, which in a sense is what he did, they discover ways to sleuth the same objects,\u201d said Ms. Standefer of Roman and Williams.That more-competitive market led Mr. Birch to call Sotheby\u2019s this winter, and people there were happy to help Mr. Birch divest of what they viewed to be one of the best modern design collections in the world.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few sales I\u2019ve conducted in my career where I wanted to buy half the things in it,\u201d said Jodi Pollack, the auction house\u2019s head of 20th century design.Perhaps predictably, Mr. Birch worked all the way to the wire, fussing over every imaginable detail; the last furniture shipments arrived at the Canal Street showroom mere minutes before a party there on May 17 celebrating its opening and the coming Sotheby\u2019s sale.Well-dressed aficionados and fellow dealers began arriving around 7 p.m., streaming into a room of Kjaerholm tables, Finn Juhl chairs and new biomorphic, brass-accented mirrors by Mr. Birch.Longtime customers remarked on the high auction prices (including two Wegner easy chairs expected to fetch $60,000 to $80,000 each), while tattooed staffers told stories about the poor Sotheby\u2019s photographer tasked with getting Mr. Birch\u2019s portrait (he wouldn\u2019t sit still, kept rearranging the furniture and smoked the entire time).True to form, Mr. Birch was hard to find. Wearing a pair of RRL jeans, a charcoal Comme des Gar\u00e7ons sweater and a dark Jil Sander blazer, he huddled in the back with the Olsen twins.They made a fitting trio, this reclusive furniture-world character and two women whose public personas have been built largely upon doing lots and saying little. But it was impossible to know what they were talking about because Mary-Kate Olsen quickly shut a reporter down. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving any interviews.\u201dNearby was Mr. Birch\u2019s son Wyeth.\u201cIn my family, we don\u2019t often express our appreciation for each other,\u201d Wyeth said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put it because right now, I\u2019m exhausted. But this is the first time in my adult life we\u2019ve celebrated Wyeth. It\u2019s tough love with my dad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm Salaries Jump for the First Time in Nearly a Decade", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byIn a move sure to bring cheer to junior associates at major law firms, one of the industry\u2019s most elite, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, on Monday said it had increased the annual salary for its first-year lawyers to $180,000, from $160,000.Salaries for other associates have also been increased by $20,000 to $35,000 annually, up to $315,000 for associates in their eighth year. The news, which came in a memo from the firm\u2019s partners, is a signal to other big law firms to fall in line or potentially lose the best new law school recruits.The salary increases are likely to be matched quickly by high-earning firms including Davis Polk & Wardwell; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; and Sullivan & Cromwell \u2014 if for no other reason than to make it clear that they all play in the same prestigious league.It has been nearly a decade since entry-level lawyer salaries were last increased. Law firms, buffeted by a changing economy, have been struggling to adjust to corporate clients who are increasingly demanding billing discounts and refusing to pay steep rates for junior associates to learn on the job.At the same time, partner profits have rebounded as corporations continue to turn to experienced lawyers to handle their high-stakes matters. The seven-figure salaries at the top of the law firm pyramid were stirring some dissatisfaction among the lower-paid lawyers closer to the bottom.Still, few law school graduates are likely to turn down a spot at a big law firm, leaving competition for those coveted positions as keen as ever. While changes to associate compensation at big law firms are closely watched, in reality only a small slice of the nation\u2019s law graduates begin their practices earning salaries in the mid-$100,000 range.The salaries, however, are a benchmark of how major law firms are faring; the most prestigious firms pay the best. And top firms like Cravath that have demonstrated winning expertise in areas such as litigation or intellectual property are doing very well, with partners richly remunerated for their work for top clients like IBM and JPMorgan Chase.According to The American Lawyer, an industry publication, Cravath partners each earned, on average, $3.56 million in profits last year.Cravath\u2019s move, announced in a memo signed by C. Allen Parker, the firm\u2019s presiding partner, and two other partners, increased pay for associates through their eighth year, by which time most of these lawyers are either clearly going to become partners or leave the firm. The increase, which does not take into account any bonuses that are awarded separately, will take effect July 1, and will be reflected in paychecks starting July 8.One point they raised was that since the last associate pay raise in January 2007, the cost of living has risen greatly in New York City, where most of Cravath\u2019s lawyers work. Health insurance costs and student loan debt have also risen since that time, when the starting salary at big firms was increased to $160,000 from $145,000.An article on Tuesday about a salary increase for first-year associates at Cravath, Swaine & Moore misstated the date the raises will take effect. It is July 1; they were not effective on May 1, and they will be reflected in paychecks starting July 8, not July 9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Not Alone in Flouting Pollution Limits", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 One diesel car tested by the German government emitted more than 12 times as much poisonous nitrogen oxide as allowed. Another was five times over the limit, and yet another six times over.The cars were not produced by Volkswagen, the company at the center of a widespread emissions scandal. They were a Jeep, a General Motors sedan and a Mercedes-Benz.A growing stack of recent government and private studies has made increasingly clear that Volkswagen was hardly the only company to flout pollution limits. While Volkswagen illegally manipulated test results, the other carmakers in Europe just took advantage of a loophole that allows them to throttle down emissions controls whenever there is risk of engine damage \u2014 which in some cases is nearly all the time.Such information has awakened Europeans to the real environmental cost of diesel, with far-reaching reputational and financial consequences for the auto industry. Companies are now on the defensive in their core diesel market of Europe, as environmental groups push for tougher regulations, authorities haul auto executives before hearings and politicians call for an end to favorable fuel taxes.\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of who\u2019s cheating legally and who\u2019s cheating illegally,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the auto industry. \u201cThey\u2019re all bad.\u201dIn an attempt at damage control, the German government this week submitted a proposal to European Union transport ministers that would narrow, though not close, the loophole that allows carmakers to deactivate emissions equipment to protect the engine. Carmakers would be allowed to take advantage of the exception only if they had already deployed the best emissions control technology available.Environmental activists have complained for years that nitrogen oxide levels in major cities like Rome, Paris or Stuttgart were much higher than they should be because of diesel emissions, with grave effects on human health. Now the activists feel vindicated.\u201cIt\u2019s not just fraud \u2014 it\u2019s physical assault,\u201d said Axel Friedrich, a former official in the Umweltbundesamt, the German equivalent of the E.P.A. Mr. Friedrich was a co-founder of the International Council on Clean Transportation, which commissioned the tests that exposed Volkswagen\u2019s cheating.Tighter limits on tailpipe emissions and more rigorous testing, being debated in Brussels or in some cases already agreed to, will raise the cost of cars with diesel motors. Diesel vehicles produce far more nitrogen oxides than gasoline cars and require more emissions equipment.Price-conscious buyers of small cars may decide diesel is no longer worth paying more. If so, companies like Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Volkswagen would suffer most. Profits on small cars already are slim.\u201cThe biggest challenge will be emissions treatment for small cars, simply because of the cost,\u201d said Matthias Wissmann, a former German transport minister who is the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry.The changing diesel calculus is a potentially significant blow to carmakers in Europe. Because of fuel subsidies, diesels account for nearly half of all cars on European roads. Elsewhere, diesel\u2019s overall market share ranges from zero to minuscule.Diesels are also a crucial source of profits for automakers, particularly for luxury and sport utility vehicles that use more fuel. More than two-thirds of the cars sold by Audi and BMW in Europe are diesels.Diesel\u2019s market share in Europe has held steady since the Volkswagen scandal broke in September. But there are tentative signs that some Europeans are falling out of love with diesel.The share of diesels sold in Germany by BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, including its Porsche and Audi units, fell 3 percent in the first four months of 2016 compared with the same period of 2015, according to figures compiled by Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer. Germany is the largest market for diesel cars in the world, and its carmakers are particularly vulnerable to a slowdown.In Europe, Volkswagen led the way in civilizing diesel for mass-market passenger cars in the 1990s. The company produced engines that were less noisy and less smelly than diesels of old, yet offered excellent acceleration and fuel economy.Volkswagen used diesel as a competitive advantage against rivals like Toyota or General Motors\u2019 Opel, which were slower to invest in diesel. \u201cThe market shares over the years changed drastically, mostly on the back of diesel,\u201d said David J. Herman, the former chairman of Opel.Now that diesel is under attack, German carmakers are being forced to put more emphasis on hybrid vehicles, a technology pioneered by Toyota. Volkswagen has promised to invest in clean technologies as part of a legal settlement in the United States, though the details of the investment are still being determined.Rivals like Daimler, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler sell diesels in the United States but in much smaller numbers. However, Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, is also in the cross hairs of federal enforcers. It has said it is conducting an internal investigation in response to questions from the Department of Justice about its emissions in the United States.Recent studies by the German and British governments found no proof that any carmakers other than Volkswagen had equipped cars with illegal software intended to fool emissions tests.The other manufacturers simply took advantage of rules allowing them to reduce emissions controls to protect the engine under certain conditions, such as colder weather. The carmakers argued that lower temperatures could cause condensation and a buildup of soot in a major component of the emissions control system, causing it to fail.In the case of a Jeep Cherokee sold in Europe by Fiat Chrysler, according to the German government study, \u201ccolder weather\u201d meant temperatures as high as 20 degrees Celsius, or about 68 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 not exactly arctic conditions.The Jeep emitted more than 12 times as much nitrogen oxide on the road as allowed, according to the German study, which provoked an indignant response from Italy. The Italian minister of transport, Graziano Delrio, said the government\u2019s own tests showed Fiats were legal and that Germany had no standing to maintain otherwise. Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.The German study also found that an Insignia sedan made by G.M.\u2019s Opel unit, a car similar to the Buick LaCrosse sold in the United States, emitted more than five times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide. A Mercedes van was six times over the limit.A British government study of about 40 cars found that they spewed an average of six times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide under normal driving conditions.Opel and Mercedes said in statements that their vehicles complied with regulations but that, nevertheless, they were acting to improve the performance of emissions equipment.More embarrassment could lie ahead for the carmakers. Hearings on diesel are underway in the European Parliament. In Germany, opposition parties in Parliament are convening a special committee that has the power to call government officials and auto executives.\u201cIt won\u2019t just be about Volkswagen,\u201d said Oliver Krischer, deputy chief of the Green Party in Parliament, one of the parties that called for the committee. \u201cIt will also deal with negligence of the whole auto industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once the designation process is completed, however, all executive-branch agencies and departments \u2014 which make up a large portion of state government \u2014 as well as public boards, authorities, commissions and all public-benefit corporations will be required to divest themselves of any company on the list.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signed the executive order just before he marched in the Celebrate Israel parade in New York.With the largest population of Jewish residents outside Israel, New York has outsize symbolic, and political, value in the debate over the Middle East. For his part, Mr. Cuomo has shown increased willingness in recent years to get involved in international issues, including a short trip to Israel in 2014 with a state delegation.Omar Barghouti, a founder of the movement, said he did not find the actions by states like New York surprising, calling such proposals part of Israel\u2019s \u201clegal warfare against B.D.S.\u201d\u201cHaving lost many battles for hearts and minds at the grass-roots level, Israel has adopted since 2014 a new strategy to criminalize support for B.D.S. from the top,\u201d he said in an email, adding that such actions were meant to \u201cshield Israel from accountability.\u201dMr. Barghouti added that Israel was supporting efforts by states to try to \u201cdelegitimize the boycott, a time-honored tactic of resisting injustice in the U.S. and a form of protected speech.\u201dMr. David said in an interview that the executive action was meant to send a clear message that \u201cthe B.D.S. movement is deplorable.\u201d He added that the governor\u2019s order was not meant to be interpreted as \u201copining on actions taken to empower Palestinians,\u201d or meant to discourage debate over Israeli actions in the Middle East. Rather, it intends to stake a position on a movement that \u201cthe State of New York unequivocally rejects,\u201d as the order puts it.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say I want to engage in political speech,\u201d Mr. David said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to say I\u2019m going to sanction you or penalize you for engaging in commercial activity.\u201dHe added that although he did not know how many companies that do business with the state had endorsed or engaged in the B.D.S. movement, \u201cwe anticipate it\u2019s going to be quite significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ms. Sharif, who does not hold elected office but is believed to be the heir to her father\u2019s political dynasty, is also playing a role in overseeing the government and the party\u2019s affairs.The Pakistani Constitution does not have a provision for a deputy or an interim prime minister, and Mr. Sharif\u2019s prolonged absence has met with criticism from the political opposition. On Monday, Mr. Sharif presided over a cabinet meeting via Skype, which government officials insisted was done through a secure connection, to approve the country\u2019s coming budget.Some analysts here say that Mr. Sharif is expected to weather the political storm over the revelations of his family\u2019s offshore wealth, as the opposition is fractured, and claims of corruption have tainted most politicians equally. The so-called Panama Papers \u2014 the leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm \u2014 disclosed that three of Mr. Sharif\u2019s children controlled shell companies through which they owned expensive residential properties in London.As the next election, in 2018, draws closer, the national focus is likely to shift to issues like the economy and regional stability.\u201cAllegations of corruption have swirled around Nawaz Sharif and pretty much every other politician since the 1980s. None have resulted in a conviction that stuck,\u201d said Tom Hussain, a political analyst in Islamabad, the capital. \u201cUnless a definitive paper trail emerges that can result in such a conviction, the Panama Papers will generate a lot of political noise but otherwise have little real impact.\u201d\u201cLike voters in most parliamentary democracies, Pakistanis are driven by their economic circumstances, not rhetoric, and after years of Taliban insurgency, what they want most is peace and stability,\u201d Mr. Hussain said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Sharif is selling.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Struggles to Shake Off Legacy of Corruption", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The text message to Ukraine\u2019s minister of economy and trade was as unwelcome as it was unexpected. The sender, a stranger, wrote that he wanted to be the new deputy minister.The minister, Aivaras Abromavicius, a former investment banker from Lithuania, had joined the government amid promises by the new Western-backed leaders to clean up the country\u2019s corrupt economy. Having no need or desire for a deputy, particularly someone he knew nothing about, Mr. Abromavicius tried to brush off the applicant.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the possibility to create a new position,\u201d he wrote back.\u201cI think they will make one,\u201d the man replied in another message, this one saved on the phone and released after Mr. Abromavicius resigned, in part over this exchange.\u201cI got this offer from the team of Petro Oleksiyovych,\u201d the man wrote, referring to the country\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko. \u201cWho specifically?\u201d the minister asked.Ihor Kononenko \u2014 a former army pal and business partner of the president \u2014 the applicant replied without hesitation.This case of possible influence-peddling is under review by Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau. But it is hardly the only worrying sign for a government swept into power in 2014 on a wave of popular anger at the egregious corruption of the previous president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, with promises of cleansing Ukraine of its endemic corruption and establishing a modern, Western-oriented democracy.But over the winter, with Kiev, the capital, buzzing with claims of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s people cutting back-room deals to control state assets, the I.M.F. quietly suspended disbursements. When the fund\u2019s board convenes in Washington this summer, it will have to decide whether to resume the payments. To reopen the financial spigot, it must certify that the money will be used to help Ukraine overhaul its economy, rather than line the pockets of the country\u2019s politicians and the powerful class of ultrawealthy businessmen known as the oligarchs.The decision will revolve in great part around Mr. Poroshenko and the men around him. Alarmed Western officials, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have traveled to Kiev in recent months to plead with Mr. Poroshenko to stay on track, but few close observers expect significant changes.\u201cThey are like bad students, always saying, \u2018Professor, just wait until Monday; I will do better,\u2019\u201d said Tymofiy S. Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cNothing changed. The same elites are there. The same oligarchs.\u201dMr. Poroshenko, he said, had fallen into the old habits of rule through associates and negotiations with the oligarchs. \u201cThe disappointment is very widespread,\u201d Mr. Mylovanov said.Mr. Poroshenko, who took the helm of a country at war and in deep recession, has asked for patience and says he is overhauling the government and the economy. He points to his formation of a capable army as the principal achievement of his tenure.\u201cFighting corruption is priority No. 1,\u201d the president\u2019s press office said in a statement. It said that the National Anti-Corruption Bureau planned to train with the F.B.I. and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish prime minister and NATO secretary general, was appointed on Friday as a special adviser to the president.The post-Soviet titans of business have always held sway over state policy in Ukraine through, among other means, the figures known as the smotryaschi, or the watchers. These are loyal politicians and functionaries ostensibly working for the state but in fact keeping an eye on state assets, to ensure that their true bosses win a share of the spoils.Despite its Western leanings, the Ukrainian government is seeded with these watchers, who hold midlevel positions in Parliament and various ministries, frustrating efforts to overhaul and clean up their practices, which would limit opportunities for payoffs.Mykola V. Martynenko, for example, who was believed to have been the watcher for energy sector businesses, was forced in December to resign his seat in Parliament and his position as deputy head of the People\u2019s Front, the party of the former prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. The resignation came after it emerged that Swiss prosecutors had opened an investigation into whether Mr. Martynenko, while working in government, had helped an equipment supplier win padded contracts from the national nuclear power company Energoatom, in exchange for a $29 million bribe.Mr. Abromavicius resigned in February to protest what he characterized as pressure from the man widely understood to be Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s watcher, Mr. Kononenko. Mr. Abromavicius and other former officials said in interviews that executives from the president\u2019s business empire and allied politicians had quietly been tightening their grip on power this year, while technocrats like Mr. Abromavicius and the former finance minister Natalie A. Jaresko, a Ukrainian-American, have been forced out.Mr. Kononenko, for his part, is first deputy chairman of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s political faction in Parliament, the BPP group, and was a co-owner, with the president, of a Ukrainian bank.In 2014, state-owned companies lost about $9.7 billion, mostly because of energy subsidies but also because of embezzlement and abuse. It was a sum covered by I.M.F. lending and American and European bilateral aid.In his resignation letter, Mr. Abromavicius accused Mr. Kononenko of maneuvering to control one such asset, a state-owned ammonia shipping company, Ukrkhimtransamiak.But critics wonder whether things will ever change, at least under Mr. Poroshenko. Even the simplest and seemingly least divisive step \u2014 prosecuting those responsible for theft of state property and other corrupt acts under Mr. Yanukovych, the former president \u2014 has never materialized.Vitaliy V. Kasko, a prominent Kiev lawyer who defended protesters pro bono during the Maidan revolution, was appointed director of the internal affairs bureau in the prosecutor\u2019s office, the General Inspectorate, with the task of sorting out why the incumbent prosecutors had shown no interest in pursuing obvious corruption cases. But soon enough, he hit a wall.The Ukrainian authorities asked the European Union to impose sanctions on 22 Yanukovych-era officials, yet none of them have faced prosecution at home.\u201cThere\u2019s an unstated agreement,\u201d Mr. Kasko said in an interview at Tr\u00e8s Fran\u00e7ais, a popular lunch spot off Maidan Square, where dozens of protesters were killed in 2014. \u201cThe prosecutor will look the other way if it\u2019s in the interest of the leadership.\u201dRevealing the criminal origins of these former officials\u2019 money, Mr. Kasko said, would inevitably also reveal and destroy lucrative corruption strategies.\u201cThe simplest scheme is to siphon money out of a state company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same schemes used under Yanukovych are used today.\u201dMr. Abromavicius, the minister of economy, had made a priority of cleaning up state companies \u2014 of which there are 1,824 in Ukraine, some as small as a single apartment building owned and rented out by the government. To cut down on graft, he created an electronic tender system, called ProZorro, and convened an independent panel to appoint chief executives on merit for every company.\u201cThat is when all my problems started,\u201d he said. He came under intense pressure from the president\u2019s office to have Poroshenko loyalists appointed to key positions in the state companies.Mr. Kononenko has denied wrongdoing. The applicant, Andriy P. Pasishnik, an executive at the state oil and gas company, later said he did not have the backing of Mr. Poroshenko or Mr. Kononenko, and said he was just bluffing.\u201cThe guy, out of the blue, sends me a text saying, \u2018I want to be your new deputy minister,\u2019\u201d Mr. Abromavicius recalled in an interview in Kiev. \u201cI have no reason to believe what this guy said was not true.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Won the Keys to Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byChina Rules10 PhotosSHANGHAI \u2014 Disney had pushed China too hard, putting the company\u2019s plans for a new theme park here in limbo. Now, Robert A. Iger wanted to kick the yearslong negotiations into high gear.Mr. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, took a corporate jet to Shanghai in February 2008 to meet with the city\u2019s new Communist Party boss, Yu Zhengsheng. Over dinner at a state guesthouse, Mr. Iger offered a more conciliatory approach, setting the tone for the next phase of talks.After that, Disney substantially dialed back its demands. In addition to handing over a large piece of the profit, the control-obsessed company would give the government a role in running the park. Disney was also prepared to drop its longstanding insistence on a television channel.For Disney, such moves were once unthinkable. Giving up on the Disney Channel meant abandoning the company\u2019s proven brand-building strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to get everything we want,\u201d Mr. Iger recalled saying at the time.Mr. Iger\u2019s trip and the new attitude in the talks that followed appeased Chinese officials. Before long, they had struck a landmark deal to build the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, opening China to a singularly American brand and setting the pace for multinational companies to do business in the country.But Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with the Communist Party. While that partnership has made it easier to get things done in China, it has also given the government influence over everything from the price of admission to the types of rides at the park.Worried that importing classic rides would reek of cultural imperialism, Disney left out stalwarts such as Space Mountain, the Jungle Cruise and It\u2019s a Small World. Instead, 80 percent of the Shanghai rides, like the \u201cTron\u201d lightcycle roller coaster, are unique, a move that pleased executives at the company\u2019s Chinese partner, the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, who made multiple trips to Disney headquarters in California to hash out blueprint details.Disney then ran with the idea, infusing the park with Chinese elements. The Shanghai resort\u2019s signature restaurant, the Wandering Moon Teahouse, has rooms designed to represent different areas of the country. The restaurant is billed as honoring the \u201crestless, creative spirit\u201d of Chinese poets.Such accommodation is becoming increasingly common. A growing number of multinationals have agreed to cooperate with the Chinese state through alliances, joint ventures or partnerships, all in the hopes of garnering more favorable treatment and gaining access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States.\u201cThis is part of the China trade-off,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cIf your market is so big, we\u2019ll accept rules and regulations we wouldn\u2019t in other parts of the world.\u201dFor Disney, if all goes as planned, the Shanghai park will create an ecosystem of demand in China for movies, toys, clothes, video games, books and TV programs. Mr. Iger has called Shanghai the \u201cgreatest opportunity the company has had since Walt Disney himself bought land in Central Florida\u201d in the 1960s.That site, of course, became Walt Disney World, a group of four theme parks that attracts roughly 40 million visitors annually. About 11 million visitors are expected next year at the Shanghai park, with annual attendance estimated to reach 20 million within a few years, according to Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If all doesn\u2019t go as planned, Disney will suffer the wrath of Wall Street, which expects the resort to offset slower growth at ESPN, the company\u2019s longtime profit engine, and some of its other theme parks. The last thing Disney wants is another Disneyland Paris, a money pit that suffered from cultural miscues and, after 24 years, is still struggling to turn a profit. Hong Kong Disneyland, which is relatively small, has had mixed financial results since opening in 2005.While he delegated certain duties to lieutenants, Mr. Iger has been the guiding force. He pre-tasted the food, which will include items like pork knuckles and Donald Duck-shaped waffles, and decided which characters would appear in the parade. He has held face-to-face talks with Chinese presidents, prime ministers and propaganda officials.Mr. Iger, 65, has sought a personal relationship with China\u2019s paramount leader, President Xi Jinping. After Mr. Iger learned that Mr. Xi\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader, had visited Disneyland in 1980, he pressed his staff to find a photograph. A color photograph shows the president\u2019s father, who died in 2002, wearing a Mao suit, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Mr. Iger presented it to the Chinese leader as a gift and a symbol of their partnership.When Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle last September, Mr. Iger was among the American executives on hand to welcome him. At the White House state dinner a few days later, Mr. Iger was seated at Mr. Xi\u2019s table. Just last month, Mr. Iger flew to Beijing to meet the president at the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the fruits of efforts over the years,\u201d a smiling Mr. Xi told Mr. Iger at a public meeting between the men at the Great Hall of the People in early May. \u201cAnd I believe the new cooperation will continue to yield new outcomes.\u201dIt may be all smiles now, but Mickey Mouse knows all too well what can happen when the Middle Kingdom gets mad.The year was 1997, and Disney had finally found a bit of success in China. \u201cThe Dragon Club,\u201d a Disney cartoon series, was popular in Chinese homes, and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d had given Disney its first big hit in Chinese cinemas. But then came \u201cKundun.\u201dAs part of a now-defunct effort to make films for more sophisticated audiences, Disney agreed to back the director Martin Scorsese, who wanted to make \u201cKundun,\u201d about China\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Chinese government, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, denounced the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.In the end, Disney decided that it could not let an overseas government influence its decision to distribute a movie in the United States. \u201cKundun\u201d was released, and China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling \u201cThe Dragon Club.\u201d\u201cAll of our business in China stopped overnight,\u201d Disney\u2019s chief executive at the time, Michael D. Eisner, recalled.Although \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was screened in Shanghai in the 1930s, Disney really had no measurable business in China until decades later, when Mr. Eisner secured Sunday evening placement for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons on the country\u2019s biggest state-run broadcaster. That led to Mickey\u2019s Corner kiosks that sold consumer goods like Minnie Mouse-branded shampoo, and to more television shows.By the time of the \u201cKundun\u201d debacle, the demand was clearly there. Mr. Eisner just needed to undo the damage.Disney hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and mounted an intense lobbying effort. In October 1998, Mr. Eisner met Zhu Rongji, who had just been named prime minister, at China\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Mr. Eisner apologized for \u201cKundun,\u201d calling it a \u201cstupid mistake,\u201d according to a transcript of the meeting.\u201cThis film was a form of insult to our friends, but other than journalists, very few people in the world ever saw it,\u201d Mr. Eisner said during the meeting. (\u201cKundun\u201d bombed, taking in just $5.7 million against a production budget of about $30 million.)Mr. Eisner said the company had learned a lesson. And he introduced Mr. Iger, then Disney\u2019s international president, as the person who would carry on negotiations for a theme park. The Chinese prime minister responded favorably. Land in Shanghai, he said, had already been set aside.And just like that, the door to China started to reopen.The negotiations that followed were slow and painful. Disney had to navigate a thicket of agencies, bureaucrats and officials. At one point, Disney essentially had to start over in Shanghai, after a senior Chinese official was abruptly arrested on corruption charges unrelated to the park.There were sticking points large and small. Who would control the park? What kind of transportation infrastructure would support it? How were Disney\u2019s nightly fireworks shows going to work in smoggy Shanghai? There was also the not-so-minor matter of introducing Disney characters to a country whose icon, since the Communists took power in 1949, was Mao.\u201cDisney had to educate the Chinese government on how they operate, and the government wanted to persuade Disney that they needed a local partner to make this thing work,\u201d said Tang Jun, one of Mr. Iger\u2019s former lieutenants in China.By 2009, the Chinese government was finally on board. It took a 57 percent stake in the Shanghai resort, which includes revenue from hotels, restaurants and merchandise sold on the grounds. Disney also gave the government a 30 percent piece of the Disney management company that runs the property.It was in stark contrast to the deal with Hong Kong. Desperate to end a tourism slump, Hong Kong had given Disney breathtaking terms, including providing a majority of the construction funds. Disney gave up no management control.Confetti was blasted into the air. A 50-member children\u2019s choir sang as Chinese dancers and drummers paraded onstage. Mickey and Minnie Mouse frolicked in traditional Chinese costumes.\u201cThis is a defining moment in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cAlong with our partner, the Shanghai Shendi Group, today I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Shanghai Disney Resort.\u201dWhen the Communist Party first invited overseas companies into the country in 1979, global businesses had to team up with the state. It wasn\u2019t pretty.As commercial interests clashed with socialist principles, there were wage disputes, allegations of intellectual property theft and conflicts over corporate strategy. To put it in the parlance of a Chinese proverb, it was like two people sleeping in the \u201csame bed, dreaming different dreams.\u201dPepsi found itself managing a tanning factory, as part of its Chinese partnership. McDonnell Douglas claimed that some machine tools had been diverted to a factory that made missiles, in violation of United States rules. The American and Chinese partners in Beijing Jeep disagreed over quality control.\u201cI now tell people, \u2018If you don\u2019t have to do a joint venture, don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Don St. Pierre Sr., an American businessman who worked for Beijing Jeep.After the blowups, China started to allow some companies to go it alone. But Disney didn\u2019t have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the park\u2019s front gate.The partnership is \u201cstructured so that it will work,\u201d said Mr. Iger. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount riding on it.\u201dBut Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade China\u2019s economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the city\u2019s easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disney\u2019s site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises \u201cperformances\u201d by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.\u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201dThe partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disney\u2019s new resort.The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the world\u2019s largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the park\u2019s television and advertising budget, since it controls the city\u2019s biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.\u201cThe more partners you have, the more potential conflicts,\u201d said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.\u201cEach of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations,\u201d he added. A multinational must then \u201ccontend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.\u201dWhen Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesn\u2019t require a ticket.\u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wang\u2019s criticism as \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. \u201cWe made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and there\u2019s a cost to that,\u201d he said.Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of China\u2019s political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disney\u2019s expansion and growth.\u201cI suggest that we shouldn\u2019t allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built\u201d in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. \u201cIf children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.\u201dDisney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with China\u2019s propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the company\u2019s global platform to \u201cintroduce more about China to the world.\u201d And he has done just that.\u201cWhen global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China,\u201d said John A. Quelch, who teaches at Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in China. \u201cThey need to demonstrate that they are willing to promote things the government is interested in.\u201dMr. Iger is trying especially to give Shanghai Disney some Chinese flair. He instructed park designers to infuse as many Chinese elements as possible.Builders collected indigenous trees from all around China, including a 59-foot chestnut oak from Zhejiang Province, to adorn the grounds. A \u201cTarzan\u201d show was directed by Li Xining, an acrobatics expert who once worked for the Chengdu Military Area Command under the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The Broadway version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will be performed entirely in Mandarin \u2014 a first.Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.\u201cWhat are we doing here that will make this park successful in China?\u201d Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. \u201cOne of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that it\u2019s theirs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would a Trump Presidency Mean Economic Disaster? Let\u2019s Take a Look", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceSo what should a properly skeptical person think of the new report?Is it an accurate projection of what will happen to the economy if Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred policies become law, or partisan fear-mongering? Given that a presidential campaign is a contest of competing forecasts, here\u2019s how to think about the many predictions you\u2019ll hear between now and November.A careful reading of the Moody\u2019s report shows this: Its underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works. But the report also offers a big helping of false precision, giving exact numerical forecasts on effects that have vast amounts of uncertainty.It\u2019s worth being skeptical about Moody\u2019s projection that Trump\u2019s policies would cause a 1.5 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2019. After all, forecasters aren\u2019t even sure what G.D.P. growth will turn out to be in the second quarter of 2016, which ends in nine days. To forecast growth three years from now under an unknowable set of policies is more an intellectual exercise than anything exact.It\u2019s not as useful to look at numerical projections that are almost certain to be wrong. Instead, let\u2019s examine the analytical judgments underlying those numbers \u2014 and what they say about the direction of the economy in a Trump presidency:These actions would stimulate the economy at first \u2014 the Moody\u2019s projection has stronger growth in 2017 in a Trump administration than in a baseline case. But over time they would translate to higher deficits that would push interest rates much higher and crowd out other activity in the economy, given that they forecast the economy will be near its full potential when the next president takes office in January 2017.Moody\u2019s predicts that Trump policies would push 10-year Treasury bond yields to 8.6 percent in 2018, compared with 1.6 percent today and 3 percent in their base case \u2014 leading to a contraction in business investment, housing and consumer spending. The money the government would need to borrow to fund a much larger deficit would squeeze out business investment, housing and consumer spending.As immigrants leave, the Moody\u2019s researchers write, employers will struggle to fill the vacated jobs. \u201cMany of these positions will go unfilled, because, by the time the Trump administration is underway, the U.S. is expected to be at full employment, meaning there will be no slack labor out of which to hire workers.\u201d Some businesses that are heavily reliant on immigrant labor would close. To the degree the labor shortage drives up wages, it would be counteracted by Federal Reserve interest rate increases to try to slow the economy and combat inflation.Meanwhile, they figure that a retaliatory response from China and Mexico would result in new tariffs and lower American exports to those countries, reducing economic activity. And higher interest rates in the United States and a sense of global uncertainty around a potential trade war would drive up the dollar, making all United States exporters less competitive.These underlying assumptions, while built on a large body of economic research, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.But while the predictions of a recession and slower long-term growth got all the attention in the new report, understanding why these particular economic forecasters see these effects is more useful.And there\u2019s a lesson there in making sense of any forecast or analysis of a candidate\u2019s policies: Focus less on the conclusion, and more on how the researcher got there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populist Anger Upends Politics on Both Sides of the Atlantic", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 From Brussels to Berlin to Washington, leaders of the Western democratic world awoke Friday morning to a blunt, once-unthinkable rebuke delivered by the flinty citizens of a small island nation in the North Atlantic. Populist anger against the established political order had finally boiled over.The British had rebelled.Asked where public anger was greatest, Mr. Trump said: \u201cU.K. U.S. There\u2019s plenty of other places. This will not be the last.\u201dEven as the European Union began to grapple with a new and potentially destabilizing period of political uncertainty, the British vote also will inevitably be seized upon as further evidence of deepening public unease with the global economic order. Globalization and economic liberalization have produced winners and losers \u2014 and the big \u201cLeave\u201d vote in economically stagnant regions of Britain suggests that many of those who have lost out are fed up.Time and again, the European Union has navigated political crises during the past decade with a Whac-a-Mole response that has maintained the status quo and the bloc\u2019s lumbering forward momentum toward greater integration \u2014 without directly confronting the roiling public discontent beneath the surface.But now the question is whether the dam has broken: Before breakfast on Friday, anti-Europe leaders in France and the Netherlands were rejoicing and demanding similar referendums on European Union membership.From its outset, the European Union was a project of elites, one that, at times, moved forward without a clear popular mandate from the masses. Adopting the common currency was deeply controversial in some places, including Germany. The issue of democratic legitimacy has always hung over the unification project, since many significant steps were achieved through treaties that stirred considerable resistance in some countries.European unity remained popular, particularly as the bloc delivered undeniable economic and social progress. But the class frictions beneath the project worsened in the past decade, as the European economy has been battered by recession and an uneven recovery.It is not clear whether the message is getting through to more establishment leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, or what lessons they are taking from the shock of the British exit.European leaders were under pressure to reassure the European public, and the world, that the bloc was not at risk of unraveling. For decades, the European Union had moved forward, always expanding in size and influence. Britain has now reversed that trend.\u201cWe\u2019re completely in uncharted territory,\u201d said Hans Kundnani, a Berlin-based expert in European politics at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Mr. Kundnani said the British vote exposed a contradiction at the core of the European project. European leaders define success as steering member states toward greater political and economic integration. And many of the bloc\u2019s inefficiencies and dysfunctions can be traced to the unfinished work of strengthening European institutions and achieving greater integration between member states in areas such as banking, finance, security and defense.But public opinion is deeply skeptical of this \u201cmore Europe\u201d agenda. Far-right populist leaders have stoked public anxieties and resurgent nationalism by lashing out against immigrants, while portraying the European capital, Brussels, as a bastion of political elites out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people. Far-left populists have demanded a re-examination of the neoliberal economics of free trade and limited regulation, while resisting efforts to deconstruct the social democratic welfare state.\u201cThe E.U. robs us of our money, our identity, our democracy, our sovereignty,\u201d said Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom. \u201cThe elites want more E.U. They think they know better than the people. They look down on the people and want to decide in their place. They want us to be ruled by undemocratic, unaccountable bureaucrats in a faraway place like Brussels.\u201dAnd permeating everything is the weak Continental economy and the crippling debt burden across Southern Europe.\u201cThe E.U. is kind of trapped,\u201d Mr. Kundnani said. \u201cOn the one hand, the instinct will be to move ahead with further integration and reassure the rest of the world that the European Union is not unraveling. But that is very difficult because of the fault lines that exist.\u201dThe British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.He added: \u201cThey are trapped because moving ahead is very difficult. Moving backwards is the last thing they want to do. And the status quo is unsustainable.\u201dBritain has always been a skeptical member of the European household. During the 1990s, Britain chose to keep the pound and not to join the countries sharing a common European currency, the euro. Many of the British concerns about the euro proved true, undermining the bloc\u2019s credibility, even as Britain has remained mostly insulated against the Continent\u2019s still unresolved euro crisis.Before the referendum, some European officials portrayed Britain as an idiosyncratic case that should not be seen as a bellwether for the Continent. But that is a hard argument to make. In France, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front party is experiencing steadily rising popularity as the country prepares for national elections next year. In Germany, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany polled strongly in recent state elections.Donald Tusk, one of the European Union\u2019s top leaders, has started to talk about the risks facing the political establishment. At a speech last month before Europe\u2019s coalition of center-right political parties, Mr. Tusk cautioned his fellow political elites.Britons will make a momentous choice on Thursday that could matter more for their future than any ordinary election.\u201cObsessed with the idea of instant and total integration, we failed to notice that ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our euro-enthusiasm,\u201d said Mr. Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of all the 28 member states in the bloc. \u201cDisillusioned with great visions of the future, they demand that we cope with the present reality better than we have been doing until now.\u201dYet taking action may be difficult, since most analysts say the European Union is paralyzed by the coming national elections in 2017 in France and Germany, the two most powerful countries in the bloc. Neither the French nor the German government is eager to endorse sweeping initiatives for more European integration before the elections out of fear of a populist whipping at the polls.\u201cEurope is very divided and the main European country, Germany, has no will or skills to lead the union \u2014 and is approaching important national elections,\u201d said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes. \u201cFrance is a country in crisis, while Italy has its own problems. I can\u2019t see who would assume a European leadership capable of producing a deeper integration process.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere is a very widespread rejection of politics everywhere. There is a similar mood in the United States, an antipolitical sentiment.\u201dFew industries in Britain are likely to be more directly hit than the financial services industry in London. Damon Hoff, a hedge fund manager, said that he had voted to stay in the European Union, but that he understood the sentiments of those who had voted to leave.\u201cEuropeans don\u2019t feel more prosperous,\u201d he said. \u201cEuropeans don\u2019t feel more empowered. And certainly the British don\u2019t.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou want to be part of something that continuously evolves. Does the European Union feel like it is evolving? No.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting from Turnberry, Scotland; Gaia Pianigiani from Rome; and Milan Schreuer from Paris.Advertisement"}

Croatia could face another election if a government has not formed within 30 days.The convoluted power-sharing plan saw the two party leaders \u2014 the Democratic Union\u2019s Tomislav Karamarko and MOST\u2019s Bozo Petrov \u2014 sharing deputy prime minister roles. Mr. Oreskovic, an outsider who was raised in Canada, cited his business experience and executive know-how as qualities that would help him guide the economy out of the doldrums. At the same time, the country was also grappling with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants.The small nation of 4.2 million people emerged from a six-year recession last winter and showed promising signs of growth. Mr. Oreskovic proposed a battery of changes. The economy has continued to improve, and the tourism season has begun, but unemployment remains stubbornly high, about 15 percent.During the no-confidence vote on Thursday, the prime minister\u2019s business background and political inexperience, once welcomed, were used against him. \u201cCroatia isn\u2019t a corporation,\u201d said Domagoj Ivan Milosevic, a Croatian Democratic Union member who had been one of Mr. Oreskovic\u2019s supporters.Yet his downfall came about not because of economic or migration policies, but rather through a rupture in the government partnership over a scandal. Mr. Karamarko stepped down as deputy prime minister on Wednesday, after an ethics committee found that he had a conflict of interest over his wife\u2019s business dealings with a lobbyist for a Hungarian energy company that has a controlling stake in Croatia\u2019s national oil company, INA.The Hungarian company, MOL, has been locked in an arbitration suit with the Croatian government over accusations of corruption in INA\u2019s sale. Mr. Karamarko had suggested that Croatia pull out of the arbitration hearings, which was opposed by Mr. Oreskovic.The dispute led to a falling-out between Mr. Karamarko and Mr. Oreskovic, which the latter claimed led to his downfall as members of the Croatian Democratic Union, Mr. Karamarko\u2019s party, turned against Mr. Oreskovic.\u201cI did not expect this.

{"Headline": "Obama Wades Into Election Debate With Indiana Speech", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byELKHART, Ind. \u2014 President Obama on Wednesday forcefully inserted himself into the 2016 presidential campaign, assailing Donald J. Trump and the Republican Party for peddling economic policies that he said would benefit the rich and connected at the expense of a still-struggling middle class.Mr. Obama framed this year\u2019s presidential contest as a choice between a Democratic Party committed to working families and a Republican Party he said was beholden to China, \u201cbig oil,\u201d \u201cbig banks\u201d and the wealthiest Americans. White House aides cast the speech as the president\u2019s first major attempt to influence the race to succeed him.\u201cIf what you care about in this election is your pocketbook; if what you\u2019re concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a fiery, campaignlike speech, \u201cif what you\u2019re concerned about is the economy, then the debate is not even close.\u201dAides said the president, who is expected to ultimately endorse Hillary Clinton, was eager to jump into the carnival-like political debate between Mr. Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, and the Democrats\u2019 choice.Railing against one of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 that he would roll back rules imposed on Wall Street \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s voice grew louder as he declared, \u201cThat is crazy!\u201d Sleeves rolled up and his finger wagging, the president asked the supportive crowd, \u201cHave we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago?\u201dThe president said that when he heard that working families were voting for the Republican economic agenda, \u201cI want to have an intervention!\u201dMr. Obama knows his legacy is at stake \u2014 eight years of effort in the Oval Office will be at risk if Mr. Trump succeeds him \u2014 but his eagerness to get back into campaign mode is partly personal. In 2011, the year before Mr. Obama ran for re-election, Mr. Trump became the most vocal advocate of the \u201cbirther movement\u201d conspiracy theories that falsely held that the president was born in Kenya. Mr. Trump has also hurled crude epithets at many of Mr. Obama\u2019s allies and constituent groups.Although Mr. Obama did not mention Mr. Trump by name during his speech, there was no mistaking the meaning of his words or that the remarks will serve as the framework for a stump speech the president intends to take on the road in the months ahead.\u201cIf we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey-doke just because it sounds funny or its tweets are provocative,\u201d the president said, \u201cthen we won\u2019t build on the progress we\u2019ve started.\u201dMr. Obama used Elkhart, which is the first American city he visited as president, as a backdrop for his economic message. The city\u2019s manufacturing-based economy cratered faster than those of most communities during the 2008 recession, when unemployment reached almost 20 percent. In the years since, the recovery has been just as rapid: Unemployment is now at about 4 percent, and the city\u2019s decades-old recreational vehicle industry is once again growing.Speaking at a high school on the outskirts of the city, Mr. Obama claimed credit for the reversal of fortunes here, but also suggested that the improvements were fragile and reversible if the country turned away from economic policies championed by his administration and Democrats.Mr. Obama sharply criticized what he called the \u201cmyth of crazy, liberal government spending\u201d and urged the crowd to support Democratic politicians who favor higher wages, equal pay, support for unions, better education and fair trade.Mr. Obama\u2019s critics in Elkhart say the credit for the recovery goes to the grit and determination of the people who live there, not politicians in Washington. Kyle Hannon, the president of the Greater Elkhart Chamber of Commerce, said he was \u201chonored\u201d to have Mr. Obama back in his town, but said he found it difficult to connect the president\u2019s policies to the recovery.The crowd of about 2,100 people in the Concord High School gymnasium greeted Mr. Obama with the kind of enthusiasm the president often saw during rallies he held at the height of his own campaigns. Several times, the crowd gave him standing ovations.Top aides say the president is waiting to make an endorsement until the Democratic nominating contest is finished. But with Mr. Trump already claiming the Republican nomination, and Mrs. Clinton far ahead in delegates as the Democratic race nears an end, the president decided to weigh in aggressively.Before Wednesday, Mr. Obama largely contained his political attacks to responses to questions at news conferences.In April, he questioned the Republican front-runner\u2019s fitness for office, saying that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the use of nuclear weapons shows he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.\u201dReporters prodded Mr. Obama at another news conference in May, when the president criticized the \u201cspectacle and the circus\u201d in reporting about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. A few weeks later in Asia, Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump knew little about the world.\u201cA lot of the proposals that he\u2019s made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure,\u201d Mr. Obama said.During the speech in Elkhart, Mr. Obama was less direct in his criticism of Mr. Trump. Instead, he sought to build a broader case against the party that Mr. Trump is set to lead in the general election.He said the \u201cprimary story that Republicans have been telling about the economy is not supported by the facts; it\u2019s just not.\u201d But he said that narrative was being distributed across the country by conservative news media, talk radio and Republican politicians.\u201cIf you\u2019re hearing that story all of the time, you start believing it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. His mission, he told the crowd, was to try to counter that story as the general election campaign gets underway: \u201cI\u2019m here to say, Elkhart, we\u2019ve got to challenge the assumptions behind this economic story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Publisher in Exile Gets the Big Scoops on China\u2019s Elite", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileBut Mr. Ho, a native of Mao Zedong\u2019s home province, Hunan, is not the least bit worried about meeting the same fate. Now 50, he has spent three decades cultivating close ties with Chinese officials, business executives and scholars, producing some spectacular scoops. And should he ever run afoul of the Communist Party, he has a sound strategy for staying out of the clutches of China\u2019s police: his address.Nassau County, Long Island.\u201cAmerica will not send me back to China,\u201d Mr. Ho said in an interview in Flushing, Queens, a favorite meeting spot of his not far from his office in Great Neck, N.Y.By the early 1980s, at 17, he was an editor at the provincial state radio broadcaster. By the time he was 21, he was the news director for a paper in the southern city Shenzhen.It was there that he started talking to some of the most powerful people in the country. Some leaders came through the subtropical city to escape the harsh Beijing winters. Others came to learn more about capitalism: Adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen was a special zone with the freest economy in the country.Those contacts paid off four years later, when Mr. Ho set off to Beijing, this time as a special correspondent for Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, to write about the Tiananmen Square protests. Every official, it seemed, was aghast that the government had declared martial law, and all of them wanted to talk to the young reporter from the south.\u201cThese officials provided me a lot of very special details,\u201d Mr. Ho recalled, speaking in Mandarin with a slight Hunanese accent.After the bloody crackdown on June 4, 1989, Mr. Ho became a wanted man, as the authorities sought to find out who had spoken to him. Warned by friends of his imminent arrest, he slipped across the border to Macau, then a Portuguese enclave, and later moved on to Canada, where he began his career in publishing.Mr. Ho was soon drawn to Long Island, where a Taiwan-based paper had an office. He has been in the United States for nearly a quarter-century now, but rarely speaks English.There\u2019s not much need in Flushing, one of the epicenters of a thriving Chinese \u00e9migr\u00e9 community that is making New York what Paris was to White Russians in the 1920s, with all the intrigue.Some of that intrigue centers on Mr. Ho, as scholars and publishers wonder how he manages to walk a fine line between China\u2019s contentious interest groups.\u201cUnlike his competition, Ho Pin has an impressive track record of accurately forecasting leadership successions and breaking important stories,\u201d said Prof. Minxin Pei, who studies Chinese elite politics at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cThe only concern I have is whether he is being used by his sources inside the Chinese regime. If he is, he could get into serious trouble because the rivals of his sources must not be very happy about what he has been doing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether they contributed to freedom of speech or if they spoiled it,\u201d Mr. Bao said of Mirror.But if Mr. Ho is an agent of his sources, it is hard to tell who they may be. On the one hand, he can be complimentary of China\u2019s politicians, saying, for example, that Mr. Xi still has the chance to become a great leader. He is also highly critical of people who say Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties are in grave danger from Beijing, arguing that many people in the former British colony exaggerate the threat. The greatest danger to liberty in Hong Kong lies with the tendency of Hong Kong\u2019s media toward self-censorship, he says.Mirror\u2019s flagship bookstore in Hong Kong, up one floor from a busy city street, is still in business, unlike so many of its competitors, which are falling victim to a relentless long-term campaign by the Communist Party to stifle the supply of and demand for publications critical of the country\u2019s leadership.But if Mr. Ho speaks of some leaders and policies with respect and circumspection, his critique of the Chinese Communist Party is scathing. He likens China today to a virus, saying it will increasingly use its financial power to undermine democracy around the world.Despite his critique, Mr. Ho has chosen not to become a United States citizen. By his reckoning, if he did, his well-placed sources in China would then think he was representing America.\u201cI have a country,\u201d he said. \u201cChina.\u201dKiki Zhao and Charlotte Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3.5 Billion Cash Infusion", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor.Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom\u2019s main investment fund, in one of the largest-ever investments into a privately held start-up.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known for venture capital investing, though some members of its royal family have made some deals. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, for instance, has invested in Lyft, a competitor of Uber.\u201cWe appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,\u201d Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders and its chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cOur experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.\u201dThe investment came together after David Plouffe, an Uber board member, traveled to the Middle East in March and was invited to the Saudi fund for a briefing. The discussions heated up thereafter, culminating in the deal.Uber has drawn capital from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds, like that of Qatar, have also invested.Other tech darlings have been busy raising money from private investors as well, pushing back any need to join the public stock markets.Uber has been spending not only to expand but also to defend its territory \u2014 which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries \u2014 against incumbents in regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country.The Middle East is among Uber\u2019s increasingly important overseas markets; the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million there. Uber has rolled out its service in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.The start-up said that it now has over 395,000 active riders in the Middle East, up fivefold from a year ago, and 19,000 drivers.Uber said expanding its service may be a boon for Saudi Arabia, a country where women are not allowed to drive because of fatwas, or religious edicts, issued by conservative Muslim clerics that uphold a distinct segregation between the sexes. There is no formal law prohibiting women from driving in the region.\u201cOf course we think women should be allowed to drive,\u201d said Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman. \u201cIn the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn\u2019t exist before \u2014 and we\u2019re incredibly proud of that.\u201dStill, Uber did not say that it planned to hire women drivers in the country, unlike in most other regions where the company operates.Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, who sits on Uber\u2019s public policy advisory board, has worked with Uber to usher the service into the country and has the support of female users of the service, said in an interview that the investment was a clear sign of change coming to the region.Saudi Arabia has looked for ways to expand its economy beyond oil, with the Public Investment Fund \u2014 which is expected to grow to $2 trillion under management after the country\u2019s state-owned oil company goes public \u2014 serving as a crucial part of that strategy. The $3.5 billion investment in Uber is out of the Saudi fund\u2019s roughly $750 billion in total United States assets.Part of Uber\u2019s possible attraction in bringing in a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia\u2019s is that such investors have far longer investment horizons than venture capitalists, who generally seek to cash out their investments after seven to 10 years.As part of the investment, the managing director at the Public Investment Fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, will take a seat on Uber\u2019s board, joining Mr. Kalanick and other directors, including Arianna Huffington.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand how this company has improved urban mobility around the world, and we\u2019re looking forward to being part of that progress,\u201d Mr. Al Rumayyan said in a statement.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Optimistic, So What\u2019s Your Excuse?", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsHas the election made you anxious about the future of the United States? Do you feel as if your job is not secure in this lukewarm economy? Are you just generally in the dumps?If so, take a look at the stock market. After a couple of steep sell-offs since last summer, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has risen to within a whisker of the record high it hit in May 2015.The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 18,000 on Wednesday, putting that benchmark up 3 percent for the year.Still, when stocks have moved higher for several years, notching the second-longest bull run in Standard & Poor\u2019s records, the market\u2019s optimism should be taken seriously.The latest rally, which has lifted the market more than 16 percent from the low point it hit in February, suggests that investors do not believe that the bad jobs numbers are an early signal of a slowdown. They are also probably betting that the Federal Reserve will not be in such a hurry to raise interest rates.Investors may also be seeing less political risk in the United States. The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump favors combative trade policies that, if put into place, might disrupt global commerce, unsettle the markets and unnerve investors. A trade war could harm the earnings of American exporters if other countries retaliated. After watching a difficult few days in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, investors may have bought more stock this week in the belief that his chances of becoming president have weakened.But there is good reason to believe that investors have become too optimistic. This turbulent presidential campaign will no doubt disquiet investors in other ways.All politics aside, the stock market\u2019s rise has made stock prices look expensive when compared with corporate earnings. In aggregate, the companies in the S.&P. 500 were trading at 22 times their earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. That is considerably higher than the average of 16 times earnings for the five years through the end of 2015.Stocks are also expensive when their prices are compared against expected future earnings. The S.&P. 500 is trading at 18 times projected 2016 operating earnings, above the average of the last five years.That high level of optimism can also be seen in how much profit growth analysts are expecting. They project 14 percent this year, and a scorching 17 percent in 2017.Here\u2019s the problem: When investors are this sanguine, they are prone to dash for the exits at small signs of trouble. The impetus might come from a hawkish remark about interest rates from an influential Federal Reserve policy maker or a vote from Britain on June 23 to exit the European Union. Or something else that catches most investors by surprise.But this is not necessarily a reason to feel gloomy. When an expensive stock market sells off, it\u2019s not a given that the economy will also dive. In the last 10 months, stocks sold off heavily on two occasions. The United States economy kept chugging along.It\u2019s when the economy stops chugging that it will really be time to avoid the stock market.Advertisement"}

A look at its own data suggests that its policies have led to financial imbalances that place it under pressure to raise rates, as it has repeatedly said it will do.One problem is that the purchases of trillions of dollars of bonds by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in a strategy known as quantitative easing have contributed to the extraordinarily low yields in much of the bond market.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s policies are largely responsible for creating a wealth cycle,\u201d said Joseph G.

The British pound, Britain\u2019s global trade, the status of the City of London as a world financial capital \u2014 all could be threatened, and so could the stability of the rest of the European Union. In merely two days, Monday and Tuesday, the VIX index, a measure of expected volatility in the stock market, leapt 20 percent. Yields of bonds of troubled countries on the eurozone periphery, like Greece and Spain, rose to levels not reached in months, as investors demanded more rewards for the risks of holding them.What\u2019s more, the yields of sovereign bonds in core countries like Germany and France plummeted as global investors sought a semblance of safety. This has produced some strange results: For the first time in history, the yield on the 10-year German bond moved into negative territory on Tuesday.Yields on numerous sovereign notes of shorter maturities of, say, five years have been negative for some time. The list includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. A saving grace, for investors in such bonds, is that if yields keep dropping, prices, which move in the opposite direction, will rise, and handsome profits can be made when the securities are sold.The United States Treasury is not selling bonds with negative interest rates, but yields on 10-year Treasuries have plummeted as well, dropping close to 1.5 percent on Thursday. Since 1981, such securities have yielded more than 6.3 percent, on average, a staggeringly large gap. The current ultralow Treasury yields make sense only when compared with the even lower yields available elsewhere around the world.While the Fed influences the entire fixed-income market, it directly controls only short-term yields through the Fed funds rate, which it raised to 0.25 percent, from nearly zero, in December. The Fed has repeatedly said it would increase that rate further, only to backpedal. On Wednesday, it did so again, forecasting that the rate would reach only 1.6 percent next year, down from a projection of 1.9 percent made in March; and only 2.4 percent in 2018, down from a March projection of 3 percent.While wage inflation appears to be on the increase, and the unemployment rate is quite low at 4.7 percent, some recent data on the labor market and on inflation has been disappointing, gross domestic product has been growing slowly, and the Fed has decided to be extremely cautious in setting rates.Yet from the perspective of household wealth and asset prices, the dangers of Fed inaction are readily apparent. By keeping interest rates low for so many years, the Fed has not merely reduced fixed-income yields. It has increased the value of other assets, to spectacular effect.Growth of household wealth has outstripped income, enriching those lucky enough to have houses and financial investments and leaving those who rely solely on wage income far behind. Asset prices may not be high enough to call them a bubble, but they are high enough for ordinary people to exercise caution. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2009, when the Fed embarked on its loose monetary policy, deliberately encouraging people to buy riskier assets.In Mr. Carson\u2019s view, it\u2019s past time to raise rates, both to stay ahead of inflation and rein in speculative excess.Higher interest rates would even have a stimulative effect for a while, he says, because people with savings would benefit from higher interest payments.Yet with the threat of disruptions abroad, and economic growth tepid at best in the United States, arguments for waiting longer prevail. Central banks are in a tough spot, dealing with economic problems for which quick remedies are not readily apparent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Panama Canal: A Risky Bet", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "PANAMA CITY \u2014 On July 8, 2009, the champagne finally flowed.After an intense two-year competition, a consortium led by a Spanish company in severe financial distress learned that its rock-bottom bid of $3.1 billion had won the worldwide competition to build a new set of locks for the historic Panama Canal.The unlikely victors toasted their win at La Vitrola, a sleek restaurant in an upscale neighborhood east of downtown Panama City. Within days, executives of the four-nation consortium, Grupo Unidos por el Canal, flew to Europe to begin planning the project.This time, there would be no champagne. Disputes quickly erupted over how to divide responsibilities. Some executives appeared not to fully grasp how little money they had to complete a complex project with a tight deadline and a multicultural team whose members did not always see things the same way.Internal arguments soon gave way to bigger problems. There would be work stoppages, porous concrete, a risk of earthquakes and at least $3.4 billion in disputed costs: more than the budget for the entire project.Seven years later, and nearly two years late, the locks have finally been declared ready to accept the new generation of giant ships that carry much of the world\u2019s cargo but cannot fit in the original canal. To mark the occasion, Panama has invited 70 heads of state to watch on Sunday as a Chinese container ship becomes the first commercial vessel to attempt the passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific through the larger locks.For more than 100 years, the canal has been a vital artery nourishing the world economy, a testament to American engineering and one of the signature public works of the 20th century. The new locks, built by Panama without help from other governments, were sold to the nation and the world as a way to ensure that the canal remained as much of a lifeline in the hyperglobalized 21st century as it was in the last.AtlanticOceanSHIP TYPECol\u00f3n\u00a0CargoTankerPassengerPanama CityPACIFICOceanPANAMAAtlanticOceanSHIP TYPECargoCol\u00f3n\u00a0TankerPassengerPanama CityPACIFICOceanPANAMAAtlanticOceanCol\u00f3n\u00a0SHIP TYPECargoTankerPassengerPanama CityPACIFICOceanPANAMAAtlanticOceanSHIP TYPECol\u00f3n\u00a0CargoTankerPassengerPanama CityPANAMAPACIFICOceanAtlanticOceanSHIP TYPECol\u00f3n\u00a0CargoTankerPassengerPanama CityPANAMAPACIFICOceanBut when the speeches and the celebrations end, one inescapable fact will remain: The expanded canal\u2019s future is cloudy at best, its safety, quality of construction and economic viability in doubt, an investigation by The New York Times has found.In simple terms, to be successful, the new canal needs enough water, durable concrete and locks big enough to safely accommodate the larger ships. On all three counts, it has failed to meet expectations, according to dozens of interviews with contractors, canal workers, maritime experts and diplomats, as well as a review of public and internal records.The low winning bid, a billion dollars less than the nearest competitor\u2019s, made \u201ca technically complex mega-project\u201d precarious from the outset, according to a confidential analysis commissioned by the consortium\u2019s insurer. \u201cThere is little room in the budget for execution errors or significant inefficiencies,\u201d the analysts, from Hill International, wrote in 2010, adding, \u201cThis is a high-risk situation.\u201dAmong the biggest risks is the concrete that lines the walls of the six mammoth locks punctuating the path between the seas.Last summer, water began gushing through concrete that was supposed to last 100 years but could not make it to the first ship. The Hill analysts had warned that the consortium\u2019s budget for concrete was 71 percent smaller than that of the next lowest bidder. The budget also allotted roughly 25 percent less for steel to reinforce that concrete.Then there is the lock design. Tugboat captains say they cannot safely escort the larger ships because the locks are too small with too little margin for error, especially in windy conditions and tricky currents. In fact, in a feasibility study obtained by The Times, the Panama Canal Authority had earlier concluded that the tugs needed significantly more room.The tugboats themselves are a problem, especially the 14 new boats purchased from a Spanish company, mostly for the expanded locks. To maneuver safely, they must be precisely controlled, but according to captains, they are so unstable that they operate best going backward, something that cannot be done while towing ships through the canal.\u201cThe Spanish tugs are perfectly awful,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n de la Guardia, the head of the tugboat captains\u2019 union. Confidential documents obtained by The Times show that the canal authority bought the tugboats for $158 million from a company later represented by the son of Jorge L. Quijano, the canal\u2019s administrator.The new locks exist for one reason: so that huge \u201cneo-Panamax\u201d ships can move far greater quantities of cargo through the canal. For them to do that, the waterway must remain deep enough so that fully laden ships do not hit bottom. But canal officials discounted warnings that they needed new sources of water, and during a recent drought, shippers had to significantly lighten their loads.Canal officials had assured the country that no new reservoirs were needed. Later, Mr. Quijano took to scolding Panamanians for using too much tap water, which comes from the same freshwater lake that supplies the canal.Ships are elevated by locks to the level of the artificial lake and glide across on a 50-mile water bridge.Existing locksgatun LAKEAveragesea levelAtlanticOceanPacificOcean0 miles1020304050Ships are elevated by locks to the level of the artificial lake and glide across on a 50-mile water bridge.Existing locksgatun LAKEAtlanticOceanPacificOceanAverage sea level0 miles1020304050Ships are elevated by locks to the level of the artificial lake and glide across on a 50-mile water bridge.Existing locksgatun LAKEAtlanticOceanPacificOceanAveragesea level0 miles1020304050The consequences will be wide-ranging if the canal does not deliver as promised. American grain and soybean farmers and producers of liquefied natural gas, for example, may find it harder to sell to Asian customers. Asian manufacturers may forsake the struggling ports on America\u2019s East Coast for those in the West. Or they, and ultimately consumers, will shoulder the added cost of going the long way around, through the Suez Canal.At the same time, the canal\u2019s success may be undercut by external forces: chiefly the slowdown in global trade, especially from China.At the center of the story is the Panama Canal Authority, which oversaw the design of the new locks and chose the winning bidder. In a small country dominated by an old-money elite, where the very lifeblood is the canal, the authority is a power center unto itself, a government within a government.The canal authority says that while any large, complex project is bound to encounter unexpected problems, the new locks are sound and safe.\u201cWe can have a difference of opinion over one point or another,\u201d said Roberto Roy, the president of the canal\u2019s board of directors. \u201cThe one thing over which we cannot disagree is that the canal is a project that will bring an enormous amount of benefits to the public.\u201dMr. Quijano said that in tests this week, canal workers were \u201cperforming the lockages with a high grade of precision and have maintained the highest standards of safety.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is one of Panama\u2019s finest hours. The country is elated.\u201dThe consortium\u2019s chief executive, Giuseppe Quarta, said tests had proved the group\u2019s \u201ctechnical ability in delivering a high-quality, fully functioning project.\u201dEven residents who privately criticize canal management are reluctant to speak up for fear of appearing unpatriotic.Eldon Gath, a geologist based in the United States, discovered quickly just how sensitive some Panamanians are about the canal. After Mr. Gath prepared a report for the canal authority noting the earthquake risk from faults under the canal, he recalled, Panama\u2019s president at the time, Ricardo Martinelli, went on the attack.\u201cPresident Martinelli told us we had insulted the republic,\u201d Mr. Gath said. \u2018Panama in Mourning for Justice\u2019Grand in scale and beautifully imagined, the original Panama Canal is an engineering marvel. Ships glide through on a 50-mile water bridge. The lock gates, some weighing more than 700 tons, are watertight and buoyant, so finely balanced that should the power fail, a single person can manually open and close them.Built by the United States after a failed attempt by the French left thousands dead, the canal operated with hardly a false note for 100 years using this procedure: As a ship approaches the locks, cables are attached to electric locomotives that run on rails alongside each of the lock walls.They draw the ship into the chamber, bring it to a stop, then draw it into the next chamber. Their constant tension winches keep the ship centered, ensuring safe and timely passage.Three locks raise the ships 85 feet to Gatun Lake, which supplies water for the canal and drinking water for much of the country. Three more locks lower them back to sea level. All of the locks are filled and emptied by gravity, without pumps.Water-saving basinsPacificOceanAtlanticOceanWater-saving basinsPacificOceanAtlanticOceanWater-saving basinsPacificOceanAtlanticOceanWater-saving basinsPacificOceanAtlanticOceanWater-saving basinsPacificOceanAtlanticOceanOver the decades, the canal made Panama, with few natural resources, a key square on the economic chessboard: a major banking, trading and airline hub, not to mention a transit zone for drug dealing and money laundering.Contractors faced some of the same challenges that the Americans did a century before: tides up to 19 feet on the Pacific but only two on the Atlantic, unstable soil, and torrential downpours. They also had to excavate and dredge without disturbing the original canal operating alongside.So serious is the risk, Mr. Harris warned, that his consulting company \u201cprohibits any of its employees working in Panama from living above the first floor in any building,\u201d according to the cable.The next month, the American Embassy heard similar warnings from Mr. Gath. Based on what he said, Panama\u2019s earthquake risk was equal to San Francisco\u2019s.Even so, three consortiums \u2014 including one led by Bechtel, an American company with an international reputation for taking on big, difficult projects \u2014 pursued the contract. The financially weakest consortium was led by a Spanish company, Sacyr Vallehermoso, which American officials called \u201cnearly bankrupt\u201d in one cable and \u201ctechnically bankrupt\u201d in another.Sacyr\u2019s consortium included a Panamanian company owned by the family of the canal administrator at the time, Alberto Alem\u00e1n Zubieta. The company, Constructora Urbana, in which Mr. Alem\u00e1n himself previously owned stock, had already done millions of dollars in business with the canal. The other two members were Impregilo, a large Italian contractor, and Jan De Nul, a Belgian company that specializes in dredging and excavation.In March 2009, after 15 months of contentious negotiations, the three consortiums submitted their sealed bids before a packed auditorium, with the president and diplomatic corps as witnesses. To heighten the drama, a motorcade delivered the envelopes to a vault at the National Bank for safekeeping. The one with the best price and design would win.That July, with the nation watching on television, the bids were opened, and the result was a shocker: The underdog Sacyr group had won.Bechtel and American diplomats were incredulous. Sacyr could not even \u201cpour the concrete\u201d for that amount, a Bechtel representative told the embassy, according to a diplomatic cable.While Sacyr\u2019s low offer meant Panama received a bargain on price, some viewed it as too good to be true.A few days after Christmas in 2009, at lunch with Barbara J. Stephenson, the American ambassador, Panama\u2019s vice president, Juan Carlos Varela, confided his fears. He elaborated in another meeting with an embassy official several weeks later: \u201cYou don\u2019t mess around with something as important as the canal. When one of the bidders makes a bid that is a billion dollars below the next competitor, then something is seriously wrong,\u201d he said, according to a diplomatic cable.Given the canal\u2019s importance to American commerce, the embassy assured Washington that it would closely monitor developments.And it had another concern: the increasingly bizarre behavior of Panama\u2019s president and former canal minister, Mr. Martinelli. By the end of his term in 2014, he would appoint most of the canal\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Martinelli is now best known for something else: presiding over an administration that is the subject of roughly 25 corruption investigations.The heading on another cable to Washington captured the moment: \u201cPanama in mourning for justice.\u201d \u2018I Think Something Awful Is Going to Happen\u2019Karen Smits arrived in Panama the day the Sacyr group won the contract. She was 27 and had grown up on a farm in the Netherlands. While her gender, blond hair and blue eyes made her stand out among the male construction workers, few people knew who she was or why she was hanging around their lunchrooms, hallways and in the field.That would soon change. Ms. Smits, an organizational anthropologist, had come to the canal for her Ph.D. thesis on the cultural dynamics within the consortium as it set out to build the new locks. But after 85 interviews over a year, she came away with much more: a contemporaneous account of the tension and conflict emanating not just from cultural clashes, but also from the stress of completing a huge project on a rock-bottom budget.\u201cThe top management of the European companies had not been entirely involved in the final stage of the tender process,\u201d one consortium official told Ms. Smits, adding that when told the size of the winning bid, they were incredulous.Carlos F\u00e1brega, a senior official at the consortium\u2019s Panamanian company, Constructora Urbana, attended some of the early meetings in Europe. \u201cEverybody had their own issues,\u201d Mr. F\u00e1brega said in an interview. \u201cFour partners. Different cultures. Different ways to approach a project.\u201dSome officials said the collaboration was like being trapped in a war or an arranged marriage. One Belgian manager told Ms. Smits that he had been instructed \u201cto get rid of his Anglo-Saxon management skills, because those were too organized and too structured for operating in this company.\u201d The manager promised to change immediately and, with a smile, ordered a few glasses of wine at lunch.Concern over costs quickly escalated into heated exchanges over who was going to do what and for how much. \u201cIt is difficult to be flexible if you don\u2019t have a budget to adjust some things, and you know the project is never going to go as planned,\u201d Ms. Smits said.Time was another issue. The contract called for the work to be completed in 1,883 days so that the opening would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the canal\u2019s 1914 inauguration.The canal authority would be a stern master. \u201cThey know what they want to be built,\u201d the consortium\u2019s consultants wrote. \u201cThe contract documents are thorough and very strict.\u201dThey made one fact abundantly clear: The new canal would operate very differently from the old one.This change weighed on Mr. de la Guardia, the stocky chief of the tugboat captains\u2019 union, as he sat in a Panama City cafe one afternoon last December. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it is going to work,\u201d he said.His opinion carries weight. A native Panamanian who graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Mr. de la Guardia has spent 20 years running tugboats in the canal. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a real mess,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something awful is going to happen.\u201dHis concern stems from the canal authority\u2019s decision to abandon locomotives to guide the ships. Tugboats will now push and pull vessels that are more than three football fields long and stacked with up to 13,000 containers, nearly three times as much as the old, smaller ships.Tugboat captains fear that their boats will be overmatched.Officials chose the new method after studying canals around the world, particularly Belgium\u2019s Berendrecht Lock, which uses tugboats to move neo-Panamax ships. Not only is it cheaper, the canal authority said, it is more practical, given the ships\u2019 immense size. The authority excluded canal workers from much of the planning, according to union representatives.\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone thought of Berendrecht as a model for the new locks here,\u201d said Londor A. Rankin, the head of the union of canal pilots, who board transiting ships and direct them, along with the tugboats. \u201cTo begin with, it\u2019s huge.\u201dBerendrecht also uses only freshwater, whereas Panama tugboats must contend with currents that result when saltwater and freshwater meet. The saltwater dives under. \u201cThey fight each other until they reach equilibrium,\u201d Mr. de la Guardia said. \u201cIt creates a current 20 to 30 feet below the surface.\u201dgatesgatesnew locks1,400 ft.100 ft.1,200 ft.100 ft.TugboatTugboatneo-panamax shipgates100 ft.Tugboat1,200 ft.1,400 ft.neo-panamaxshipnew locks100 ft.Tugboatgatesgatesgatesnew locks1,400 ft.100 ft.1,200 ft.100 ft.TugboatTugboatneo-panamax shipBut the locks\u2019 size is the captains\u2019 biggest concern \u2014 and they illustrate it on napkins, sheets of paper and blackboards. The new locks are 1,400 feet long and 180 feet wide. Big container ships are 1,200 feet long and 160 feet wide. Tugboats fore and aft measure nearly 100 feet each. Do the math, they say.The current size, the captains noted, leaves little or no bailout room for the tugboats at either end should a problem arise.\u201cThe mass of a ship, 122,000 tons coming at you \u2014 it\u2019s going to run me over,\u201d one captain, Manuel Ceballos Loaiza, said. With such a large surface exposed to the wind, the stacked cargo also acts as a sail, magnifying the tugboats\u2019 challenge.\u201cWe are five months away from inauguration, and I don\u2019t know what I am going to do,\u201d Mr. Ceballos said in December. \u201cI haven\u2019t been trained. They haven\u2019t discussed the procedures. We have been asking them.\u201d Five months later, captains said little had changed.In late May, Mr. Rankin and two fellow pilots traveled to Europe at union expense to research how ships might move more safely through the locks.Mr. Rankin said his union members were especially worried about the black plastic buffers, or fenders, attached to the canal walls to protect ships and the canal itself. \u201cWe feel they are not good enough,\u201d he said.The pilots studied cushioning methods used in Europe and concluded that large, floating fenders would be more effective.\u201cWe know how to get ships through this set of locks,\u201d Mr. Rankin said, referring to the old canal. \u201cBut the new locks are a different ballgame.\u201dSeveral years ago, the canal authority quietly tested its new method in the original canal, using smaller vessels.\u201cThat didn\u2019t work out too well, to be honest with you,\u201d said Mr. Rankin, who did not participate in those tests but monitored them. \u201cTo my understanding, all of them had to use locomotive wires to avoid impact with the walls.\u201dThe pilots now train on a small artificial lake, using miniature ships and tugboats scaled to one twenty-fifth of their actual size. They also use simulators.But, as Mr. Rankin pointed out, the pilots\u2019 success also depends on tugboat captains\u2019 ability to get ships in and out of the locks. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been trained properly, and that needs to be corrected by the administration,\u201d Mr. Rankin said late last month.Mr. Quijano said the captains had received proper training, including classes and simulations, and called their complaints a contract-negotiating ploy. He added that the locks could be made longer by using a backup gate; that would not, however, increase their width.To assess the safety and efficacy of the canal authority\u2019s plan, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation hired experts to conduct simulations involving neo-Panamax ships. The study, released this year, concluded that the ships could pass through the locks under perfect, windless conditions, but would have trouble on windier days.\u201cWe face a situation where those working on the canal, and those passing through it, are potentially at risk,\u201d said the union\u2019s general secretary, Stephen Cotton.The canal authority said the study was seriously flawed. Mr. Rankin said his union had recommended using more tugboats to position ships before they entered the locks. New Responsibilities for Suspect TugboatsOn a thick, overcast morning in April, Eric Viluce, a captain with 36 years of experience on the canal, climbed aboard the Cerro Santiago, a bulbous Spanish tugboat nesting just inside the canal\u2019s Pacific entrance.Mr. Viluce passed a lounge and kitchen before climbing a steep, winding staircase to his glass-enclosed captain\u2019s aerie. A large color monitor showed ships moving through the nearby locks.He was in good spirits. \u201cYesterday we had our first big shower,\u201d he said, aware that the canal was short on water. \u201cWe desperately needed it.\u201dThis day had been set aside to demonstrate the capabilities of the Santiago, one of 14 \u201ctractor\u201d tugs purchased primarily for the new locks. Mr. Viluce slowly backed the Santiago from its mooring and into the open canal before directing it toward the Celebrity Infinity, a white cruise ship heading for the old canal\u2019s first set of locks.This was when the Santiago\u2019s navigational peculiarities became apparent. \u201cI\u2019ll go stern first,\u201d Mr. Viluce announced. Easier to handle that way.The Santiago is no outlier. Each Spanish tugboat can do a 360-degree spin. Each can move sideways, as Mr. Viluce demonstrated by positioning his boat perpendicular to the moving cruise ship and keeping it there. But to go confidently in a straight line, bow first \u2014 that\u2019s another matter.When it came time for the new tugboats to cross the Atlantic to Panama, all made the journey backward, Mr. Viluce said, adding, \u201cThey tried bow first, and it wasn\u2019t working.\u201dThe tugboat captains say precise control is necessary to maneuver a massive ship in and out of the new locks. It is akin to threading a needle while fighting wind, currents and waves. And moving backward is not an option when pulling a ship with a line tied to the stern. Shippers will pay an estimated $800,000 to send a neo-Panamax vessel through the canal, and dents and delays are not good for business.The tugboat manufacturer, Astilleros Arm\u00f3n, did not respond to requests for an interview or to written questions.But confidential documents obtained by The Times show a close business relationship between Arm\u00f3n and Jorge Alexander Quijano Richard, the canal administrator\u2019s son, a lawyer who worked for MLS & Associates.\u201cOur law firm sent Mr. Quijano to Spain to visit Astilleros Arm\u00f3n, given that one of his main duties was to do marketing abroad to look for new business opportunities for the firm,\u201d MLS said in a confidential response to a legislative inquiry in Panama.Mr. Quijano joined MLS three days after the canal authority awarded the $158 million tugboat contract to Arm\u00f3n, records show. When he left for another law firm in 2013, he took Arm\u00f3n with him, MLS told investigators.In an email, Mr. Quijano said he had not been involved in the bidding process, had not spoken to his father about the contract and had visited several companies on his trip to Europe.His father said that captains had participated in the selection of the tugboats, and that the contract had been awarded to the bidder offering \u201cthe best value.\u201dCanal workers said they had also experienced problems with other tugboats, specifically Chinese boats with inferior clutches. The canal authority replaced the clutches for close to $10 million, but that did not fix the problem, according to several captains.\u201cThe result has been worse,\u201d Mr. de la Guardia said. He added that on any given day, no more than 30 of the fleet\u2019s 46 tugboats are operational: not enough, he said, to operate the old and new locks. Hundreds of Millions in Disputed CostsIt is no small undertaking, making concrete: good, solid concrete that will last 100 years and withstand the corrosive effects of saltwater in the locks. It requires cement \u2014 a pasty concoction of various chemicals \u2014 plus sand, rock and water. Too little cement, and the mixture will be porous and difficult to place. Too much cement, and it will be smooth and easy to place but susceptible to cracking.The challenge is to find the correct combination of all components. Which was where the problems began.Concrete manufacturing plants were built on both ends of the canal, but the raw materials, known as the aggregate, were excavated from the Pacific side. The aggregate, though, was not especially suitable for concrete.Bechtel, the losing bidder, had suspected as much. \u201cThere was an enormous issue with concrete,\u201d said Paul Gibbs, who led Bechtel\u2019s effort to win the contract. \u201cWe realized the aggregate on the Pacific side of the locks did not have sufficient integrity to make concrete.\u201d So Bechtel planned to import the aggregate. Expensive, but necessary, Mr. Gibbs said.Early on, the winning consortium, with its small concrete budget, also found the rock quality poorer than expected, but it made adjustments. Then came a standoff.Consortium officials said they had waited and waited for the canal authority to approve their concrete mix. The canal authority accused the consortium of simply refusing to pour the concrete. Mr. Alem\u00e1n, the canal administrator before Mr. Quijano, told the local newspaper La Prensa, \u201cThey tried to show that they couldn\u2019t do it, to the point where we said that we wouldn\u2019t talk any more about concrete.\u201dWhen the consortium finally did pour, canal officials faulted its concrete management, including \u201cconcrete covering or lack of covering on reinforcement steel and the repeated lack of protection of concrete during rainfalls.\u201dConcerns over concrete would figure in the resignations of two prominent consortium employees. One was Anthony De Vos, a geologist with the Belgian company, Jan De Nul. In July 2013, Mr. De Vos announced his departure in an email to colleagues, saying he was happy to be free of \u201cdictatorial managers.\u201d He singled out \u201cnumerous erroneous decisions\u201d involving concrete.\u201cIt is a big pity for Jan De Nul that we ended up in such a mess, but the damage is irreversible,\u201d Mr. De Vos wrote. He declined to elaborate when reached recently by telephone.Johnson Spratt, an excavations manager on the Pacific side, said he, too, had resigned in part because of concerns about concrete. When asked for details, Mr. Spratt quoted an old Spanish saying, \u201cLo barato sale caro\u201d: That which is cheap comes out expensive. \u2018It\u2019s Not That We Weren\u2019t Going to Make It Public\u2019Work eventually resumed, but when Mr. Quarta, the consortium\u2019s new chief, arrived in Panama in early 2015, he found \u201cvery low morale\u201d and a financial crisis.\u201cYou don\u2019t have credit from suppliers. You ask for materials and they don\u2019t come,\u201d Mr. Quarta said. \u201cYou live check by check, so it\u2019s very difficult to plan.\u201dHe said he had rallied his workers and gotten the project back on track, and by the middle of last year, the end was in sight.Then, suddenly, during water tests in the canal, a public relations disaster: photographs and video showing water gushing from concrete in one of the Pacific locks \u2014 the same locks near the earthquake faults.The problem had remained a secret for more than a week. But the images, posted anonymously on Aug. 23 by a canal worker, seemed to confirm everyone\u2019s worst fears. This was no small leak. Water spurted from cracks extending across nearly the entire width of the lock, according to Ilya Espino de Marotta, the executive vice president for engineering at the canal authority. The breach occurred in a concrete block separating the lower and middle chambers.For the canal authority, the delayed disclosure only magnified the embarrassment.Asked by a legislator if he had tried to hide the leak, Mr. Quijano acknowledged only that he had taken too long to inform the public. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we weren\u2019t going to make it public, because we make everything public,\u201d he said, explaining that he had been waiting for the consortium to determine whether the problem was the design or the quality of the concrete.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to have them give us an answer, and they haven\u2019t given us one,\u201d he complained.Some days later, a consensus emerged: The design, not the concrete, was at fault. Ms. Marotta said in an interview that the leak had occurred only because the concrete was subjected to extreme pressure when one chamber was empty and the next was full. During normal operations, both chambers would contain water.To fix the problem, the authority had two options: Tear down the concrete and rebuild it, an expensive remedy that would cause further delays, or drill holes and insert steel reinforcement bars. The decision was made to reinforce. Ms. Marotta said there had already been reinforcement in the affected areas, just not enough.A nagging question, however, remained. If this chamber leaked, how about the others? And, indeed, a smaller leak was soon found on the Atlantic side.A month after the first leak was discovered in the Pacific lock, further cracks were found during a new test. In one spot, water was not flowing, although the cracks were wet. But water was flowing from a much longer crack, measuring about 82 feet, according to a structural engineer\u2019s report.Now, the locks are patched up, their christening near. But in the Panamanian circles where people talk and worry about the canal, there is little unanimity about what exactly went wrong and what should have been done about it.\u201cThe structural engineers inside the canal, who don\u2019t want to give their names out of fear of being persecuted, have pointed out that those locks need to be knocked down and built again,\u201d said Zulay Rodr\u00edguez, a lawyer and the chairwoman of a legislative subcommittee created to investigate possible irregularities within the canal authority.Humberto Reynolds, a concrete expert, was not involved in investigating the leaks, but has monitored the situation and discussed it with fellow civil engineers at meetings of the Panamanian Society of Engineers and Architects. \u201cThe work hasn\u2019t even been inaugurated, but it\u2019s already being repaired,\u201d he said.Mr. Reynolds, who voted against the canal project, said he believed the problems stemmed from the wrong mix of concrete ingredients and substandard pouring practices. He called the work full of \u201cintolerable anomalies\u201d and criticized what he said was a trial-and-error method of fixing them.Canal officials said all the problems had been properly repaired. \u201cWe are confident the concrete will last 100 years,\u201d Mr. Quijano said. \u2018The Lowest on Record for This Time of the Year\u2019In good times \u2014 and in Panama, that means when it rains \u2014 Gatun Lake is 85 feet above sea level. From its shore, you can see the Atlantic Ocean spreading out to meet the horizon. Without Gatun, Panama would be barely a footnote in history. Without Gatun, there would be no Panama Canal or the 10,000 people it employs, or the cash that pours into the national treasury, or the audacious skyline that speaks of money and power.Once the world\u2019s largest artificial lake, Gatun floats the ships that cross the canal and fills the water glasses of many, if not most, of Panama\u2019s residents.And that is why, on Feb. 17 of this year, the commercial world took careful notice of \u201cADVISORY TO SHIPPING No. A-05-2016\u201d: a warning that Gatun was not in good health.\u201cGatun Lake\u2019s level is currently at 81.75 feet, the lowest on record for this time of the year,\u201d the advisory said. The canal\u2019s watershed runoff, it noted, was the second worst in history. Rainfall last year was 36 percent below normal.One month later, the canal authority instructed shippers to lighten their loads so their vessels did not hit bottom. A week and a half later, they were told to lighten them more. And 10 days later, even more.Like the leak, the water shortage hit at an inopportune time. Just one day after the last load warning, the canal authorities issued instructions for neo-Panamax vessels seeking to use the new locks after they open. The large ships would not be able to carry much more than the smaller vessels in the old passage \u2014 hardly a good return on investment for shippers or the canal.Load restrictions are not new, but these came after Gatun had been dredged to collect more water for the new locks. When they open, Gatun will have to supply nearly twice as much water for the old and new locks combined. Mr. Quijano declined to answer questions about water availability.Canal officials blamed El Ni\u00f1o for the drought, and the load restrictions were eventually lifted after several days of heavy rain. But this weather pattern was no more unexpected than the prospect of more shortages due to global warming and increased public water consumption.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have some problems on the dry side,\u201d said Jorge Espinosa, a former manager of the canal authority\u2019s water resource unit. \u201cThis El Ni\u00f1o was pretty tough on the canal.\u201dIn fact, two international banks had questioned the wisdom of expanding the canal without a new water source. In 2008, the Inter-American Development Bank called water availability \u201cthe principal project risk,\u201d according to a consultant\u2019s report last year.The World Bank raised similar concerns in a 2008 report, citing, among other factors, faster-than-expected growth in Panamanians\u2019 water consumption. If this trend continues, the bank said, it \u201cmay result in a reduction in the level of confidence at which the canal could operate.\u201dCanal officials, too, recognized the need to find more water as they began planning for the new locks. But their solution ran into a political firestorm.In 1999, Mr. Alem\u00e1n, the first canal administrator, had helped secure passage of a law giving the canal authority control over the western watershed, where dams could create a new reservoir.The impoverished people who would have been displaced were not pleased, and with the help of a Roman Catholic Church activist group, they protested. It was morally wrong, the local bishop, Msgr. Carlos Mar\u00eda Ariz, wrote in a letter to Panama\u2019s president, to destroy the farmers\u2019 \u201clifestyles and traditions\u201d for the sake of the canal.The government pushed back. Under pressure, the church appointed a new bishop and fired the activist group\u2019s leader, H\u00e9ctor Endara Hill, after 20 years of community work. Another leader of the protests, Francisco Aperador, whom the church had sent to Panama to work with the indigenous population, was expelled from the country, Mr. Endara said.The new bishop \u201cconfessed in a team meeting that he was named to \u2018chop heads,\u2019 and mine was the first one to roll,\u201d he said. \u201cLater, after much mistreatment, harassment and persecution, a great majority were fired.\u201dThe canal\u2019s chief engineer, Thomas Drohan, was forced out around 2000, after criticizing the watershed plan, Mr. Endara said. Mr. Drohan declined to comment for this article.But ultimately, fearing the loss of a national referendum on canal expansion, the legislature reversed itself in 2006 and rescinded the law. The canal authority switched positions, as well, and said it did not need a new reservoir. Water-saving basins were built so the canal could reuse 60 percent of the water that fills the locks as ships pass through, according to canal officials.The basins, said Frank C. Townsend, a retired University of Florida civil engineering professor who grew up in Panama, are a \u201cpretty savvy bit of engineering work.\u201d\u201cIf the new system ends up working,\u201d said Ariel Rodr\u00edguez, a biologist formerly at the University of Panama, \u201cthey\u2019ll discover in the next year that they are in crisis, that there isn\u2019t water, that the ships can\u2019t go through because there is no water. And what are people going to say? \u2018Bring me water from anywhere and at whatever cost.\u2019 \u201d \u2018We Are Determined to Make This Thing Work\u2019On the morning of June 9, the training wheels came off as the first neo-Panamax ship, the Baroque Valletta, entered the first of three locks on the Atlantic side. With the official opening just two weeks away, canal officials wanted to be sure their locks worked as planned.The Italian consortium member, now called Salini Impregilo, had invited foreign journalists to fly in and watch. But the canal authority had other ideas.\u201cThey told me they don\u2019t want journalists to see,\u201d said Fabio Dal Boni, an Impregilo spokesman. \u201cI said it is crazy. They are totally wrong.\u201dImpregilo told the authority that the crossing would not remain a secret because hundreds of canal workers would be watching, cellphones in hand, taking pictures. Canal officials relented. The journalists came.Under a mostly sunny sky, history was made, as the Baroque passed through all three locks before anchoring in Gatun Lake. Leading the way was a familiar boat, the Cerro Santiago. A second Spanish tug was in the rear. The applause on shore was acknowledged with blasts from the ship\u2019s horn.The canal authority rushed out a news release heralding its accomplishment \u2014 though not without a bit of a linguistic faux pas. The completed project, the release said, is another example of the authority\u2019s \u201cmyopic focus on customer service.\u201dThe degree of difficulty for Baroque\u2019s passage was actually quite low. The ship fit easily in the 1,400-foot lock because it is only 836 feet long, roughly two-thirds the length of the larger vessels. And it presented a small profile in the wind because, as a bulk carrier, it had no stacked containers.Jan Kop, the project manager for Jan De Nul, the consortium\u2019s Belgian member, watched the careful, slow procession. \u201cWe have seen that it is working,\u201d he said with a smile.Asked about the delayed opening, Mr. Kop said it was not unusual for a project of this size but added, \u201cYes, it would have been better had there been no delays.\u201dGerry Wang, the chief executive of Seaspan Corporation, which charters large container ships, said not opening on time was \u201cterrible\u201d since ships had been built to take advantage of the bigger locks. \u201cSome of those ships were delivered two or three years ago,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThey still have not been able to go through the new Panama Canal.\u201dThe canal authority\u2019s plan to move about 12 neo-Panamax ships a day now appears unrealistic \u2014 at least for the time being, according to shippers, given that many East Coast ports are still preparing the infrastructure to accommodate the big ships.The shippers are uncertain as well. \u201cThe Panama Canal situation has been very murky for a long time,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know whether the new Panama Canal can really handle the big vessels.\u201dLast week, after the reporters had departed, a lock gate malfunctioned during a trial with the Baroque. \u201cThat is the reason we do testing \u2014 to debug the works,\u201d said Jorge de la Guardia, a senior official with the canal authority.The authority now says that, during the rollout period, it expects the new locks to handle no more than three ships a day.There are other loose ends, including assessing the project\u2019s final cost. A spokesman for Salini Impregilo said the contractors were seeking at least $3.4 billion from the canal authority in excess expenses.Mr. Kop recently told a Dutch news organization, De Volkskrant, that the canal authority had a very rigid attitude. \u201cWe rowed six years against the current,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very small chance we survive this without any damage.\u201dThere will be winners and losers in Panama as well. Important national issues such as infrastructure improvement and education have been set aside, said Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the Panamanian professor. \u201cNot a single group in the country has decided that those are a priority,\u201d he said.Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional law professor at the University of Panama and an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Panama City in 2009, said no one dared speak out against the canal. \u201cThe only thing that makes the canal Panamanian is its name, because it belongs to the entrenched oligarchy,\u201d said Mr. Bernal, who also represents the tugboat captains\u2019 union.Adolfo Ahumada, whose term on the canal board just expired, said serious public discussion was needed about earmarking canal income for social purposes. At the same time, he praised the board\u2019s oversight of canal funds. \u201cThere is not a public institution whose finances are more monitored than the Panama Canal Authority,\u201d he said.While there have been no substantiated allegations of corruption in the expansion of the canal, the authority\u2019s image has not been helped by the fact that most of the board members were appointed by Mr. Martinelli, the disgraced former president. Among the matters being studied by investigators is a public contract, not involving the canal, given to a company owned by a canal board member, Nicol\u00e1s Corcione. Mr. Corcione declined to comment.Mr. Martinelli is waiting out those investigations in Miami. He may be gone, but he is not out of touch.This month, he sent a mocking Twitter message to the canal board\u2019s chairman, Mr. Roy, and to Mr. Varela, who is now Panama\u2019s president: \u201cI haven\u2019t received invitation to the canal expansion.\u201dIt is entirely possible that the canal will work as intended: that water will be found, that the concrete will last, that the big ships will come, and that the Panamanian people will celebrate their historic accomplishment. That is certainly the hope, even among those who have privately or publicly expressed concern about the canal\u2019s future.\u201cWe are determined to make this thing work,\u201d the pilot union leader, Mr. Rankin, said he had told Mr. Quijano. \u201cWe have a compact with the country to make this thing work.\u201dWalt Bogdanich and Ana Graciela M\u00e9ndez reported from Panama City, and Jacqueline Williams from New York.Produced by Larry Buchanan, Aaron Byrd, Hannah Fairfield, Matt Ruby, Jeremy White and John Woo.

{"Headline": "Scapegoat or Spy? Vatican Consultant Commands Attention at Leaks Trial", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Her accusers call her an ambitious schemer, even a spy. The presiding judge has wondered aloud whether she is \u201cfull of hot air.\u201d Vatican prosecutors want her in jail for as many as 15 years, charging that she stole and leaked state secrets.She calls herself a scapegoat, claiming she is the target of a vendetta and a plot by her enemies to discredit her with Pope Francis.Whatever the truth, Francesca Immacolata Chaouqui (pronounced CHOW-kee) has emerged as the central protagonist in what is being billed here as the \u201cVatileaks 2\u201d trial, and become a lightning rod of intrigue and criticism.A hero to some and a villain to others, Ms. Chaouqui \u2014 Calabrian born, 34 years old and more than eight months pregnant \u2014 stands accused with two others of leaking confidential documents to two journalists who wrote separate tell-all books about Vatican mismanagement and corruption. The trial follows the pattern of the first Vatileaks trial, in which Paolo Gabriele, the butler to Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, faced similar charges.The journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi, face up to eight years in prison in a case that has raised widespread criticism that the Vatican is trying to muzzle free speech and squelch embarrassing revelations. One of the most secretive states, the Vatican has defined the disclosures as a threat to its security.Over more than six months of testimony, Vatican watchers hoping that the courtroom revelations would blow the lid off Dan Brown-like intrigue and Machiavellian machinations inside the guarded halls of the Holy See have been disappointed. Instead, the trial, which is expected to end this month, has produced still more embarrassments. Testimony has revealed serious weaknesses in the Vatican\u2019s security system: Unknown intruders were able to enter into what were supposed to be secure offices and break open a safe, as well as breach protected internet connections.Several witnesses called by the prosecution exposed an array of human foibles, nurtured by workplace rivalries, petty jealousies, recriminations and thwarted ambitions. Not least, the trial has raised critical questions among some Vatican observers about Francis\u2019s staffing choices, Ms. Chaouqui foremost among them.A communications consultant, Ms. Chaouqui was part of an eight-member commission established by Francis in July 2013 to review the Vatican\u2019s economic and administrative structures and draft recommendations for reform. His decision to appoint Ms. Chaouqui to the group raised eyebrows because she was seen as too much of an outsider. She now says that she is being set up by her enemies inside the Vatican and that the case against her is \u201cpolitical.\u201d\u201cI am a scapegoat,\u201d she said in a recent interview at the home of her Vatican lawyer, Laura Sgro\u2019, in Rome. \u201cThe prosecutors haven\u2019t produced one single bit of evidence that shows that I gave a document from A to B.\u201dWhen a Vatican gendarme testified that Ms. Chaouqui admitted in November, when she was briefly arrested, that she had given documents to one of the journalists, she retorted in court that the \u201cdocuments\u201d had been tickets to a Vatican event.She says she believes that she worked only for the good of the church, and that the mandate and recommendations of her commission have been thwarted by inaction.\u201cMy commission discovered and denounced very serious crimes\u201d to Vatican prosecutors and financial regulators that were never acted upon, she said in the interview.\u201cI imagined that Vatican justice would take action against these people who committed financial crimes that are really serious, far more than those written up\u201d in the Vatileaks books, she added. \u201cBut until now nothing has happened, at least as far as I know.\u201dSeveral other members of the commission, which was disbanded after 10 months, having completed its mandate, did not respond to emails or declined to comment.The recommendations of the commission led to the creation in February 2014 of the Secretariat for the Economy, which oversees all of the Vatican\u2019s economic and administrative activities.It also recommended the reorganization of the Vatican\u2019s media operations, which has begun.Prosecutors insist that Ms. Chaouqui conspired with another member of the committee, Msgr. Lucio \u00c1ngel Vallejo Balda, and his secretary, Nicola Maio \u2014 both also facing 15 years in prison \u2014 to form a secretive lobby that leaked documents to journalists.But Ms. Sgro\u2019, Ms. Chaouqui\u2019s lawyer, said the prosecution had not yet explained \u201cwhat advantage her client would achieve\u201d from this arrangement.Critics say that Ms. Chaouqui, through Monsignor Vallejo Balda, was attempting to cement her position within the Holy See even after the commission she was part of had been disbanded. Ms. Chaouqui called the theory laughable. \u201cEmployees of the curia make around 2,000 euros a month, which is what I earn in less than a week,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that wouldn\u2019t be my aspiration.\u201dThe swirl of innuendo whipped up around her has been as compelling as it is contradictory. When he took the stand in March, Monsignor Vallejo Balda recounted that Ms. Chaouqui had told him that she was a top Italian spy. He also spoke of a night in a Florentine hotel during which \u2014 \u201cacting seductively\u201d \u2014 Ms. Chaouqui \u201cwanted to conquer me at any cost.\u201d\u201cI understand that this night of love was the thing that most scandalized public opinion, but it\u2019s all very false,\u201d Ms. Chaouqui said in the interview, rolling her eyes. Her encounters with Monsignor Vallejo Balda were part of a \u201cnormal working relationship\u201d between members of the same commission, she said. \u201cI never wanted a job in the curia. I wanted to bring my reforms forward.\u201dAfter working for several prestigious Italian law firms managing their public relations, and then for the professional services firm Ernst & Young, Ms. Chaouqui set up her own communications strategy company. It counted top entrepreneurs, private security companies and governments as clients, she said.Her credentials do not seem to have impressed the Vatican court.\u201cDid you have the impression that she was full of hot air?\u201d the presiding judge, Giuseppe Dalla Torre, recently asked a witness. The witness responded that, in fact, Ms. Chaouqui had made good on her promise to bring a government minister to visit a project.Soon after her selection, the Italian media published a series of disparaging messages, purportedly from Ms. Chaouqui\u2019s Twitter account, including one suggesting that Benedict had leukemia, and that a former Italian government minister was gay.She claims that her account was hacked, and that the messages were part of a larger dossier put together by her enemies to discredit her with the pope. She repeated the assertion in court in May, and again on her Facebook account, to explain why she had been unjustly brought to trial.The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the director of the Vatican Press Office, warned in a statement in May that her accusations were \u201ccalumnious affirmations \u2014 they are absolutely unacceptable, and subject to legal action.\u201dMs. Chaouqui dismissed criticisms that she has been too flippant on her social media accounts in trying to refute the accusations that have been raised in court, which she sees as part of a defamatory campaign against her. \u201cI am not a nun. I am a communicator,\u201d she said. \u201cVatileaks has become the most important communications strategy of my life.\u201dAn article on June 5 about Francesca Immacolata Chaouqui, the central protagonist at the \u201cVatileaks 2\u201d trial in Vatican City, who has become a lightning rod of intrigue and criticism, misstated the given name of one of the two journalists to whom she is accused of leaking state secrets. He is Emiliano Fittipaldi, not Emanuele.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Trade Stances Toward China, Clinton and Trump Both Signal a Chill", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byPresidential candidates vow every four years to do more to help American workers facing competition from abroad. After taking office, they have consistently pursued more conciliatory trade policies toward China, seeing a strategic benefit to warm relations with Beijing.But broad political distress this year over the loss of well-paid working class jobs to global competition, coupled with mounting concern about China\u2019s increasingly assertive military posture, suggest that the next president could actually follow through on the pledges. If they do, the policies could pose a real predicament for China, and for other Asian countries that depend on its economy.Millions of jobs in China and across the region require the continued willingness of the United States to rely overwhelmingly on imports to supply American families with everything from the clothes they wear to the smartphones they carry.Rapid economic growth in China and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country\u2019s need for huge exports to the American market. But China\u2019s economy has recently slowed, hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers.Weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for China to maintain a large trade surplus with the United States, selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys. For years, China has exported four times as much to the United States as it imports, and it continues to do so.\u201cIf there are tougher trade policies from the United States,\u201d said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, \u201cthat will dampen Chinese exports.\u201dThey want to label China as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets. They want to file more trade cases against China and impose more tariffs. They want to investigate how the Chinese government subsidizes businesses. They also want to rethink big trade deals.The Asian countries involved in the trade pact, notably Vietnam and Japan, made significant concessions to American negotiators because they felt threatened by China\u2019s rise. Now, the presidential candidates are lumping them together with China, holding them responsible for killing American jobs.With few exceptions, Chinese officials have tried to steer clear of commenting on the American candidates. Even Chinese academics, the usual pipeline to Beijing\u2019s thinking, have been wary of doing so, to avoid being accused of violating China\u2019s policy of not interfering publicly in other countries\u2019 politics. To the extent that Chinese experts say anything, it is to express hope that this year\u2019s talk of getting tough on trade will not be a harbinger of policy shifts ahead.\u201cThere is no big difference from previous presidential campaigns, only more emphasis, due to the poor world trade performances\u201d and weak global economic prospects, said He Weiwen, a co-director of the China-U.S.-E.U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade in Beijing.The uncertainty for China, and much of Asia, is whether the candidates will sing the same trade tunes once in office. Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational approach would seem to indicate some follow-through. Mrs. Clinton seems less likely to change American policies, given that she supported President Obama\u2019s free trade efforts during his first term of office, when she was secretary of state.Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Mr. Obama, at least initially, all tried to help China become more involved in the world economy. They hoped that more enmeshed trade and financial relationships would mean a more democratic China with closer diplomatic ties to the West.It seemed to work for a while. But in the last three years, China, under President Xi Jinping, has shifted toward more authoritarian rule.Those geopolitics have left American policy makers with two choices, neither of them appetizing. Further trade with China and additional investments there by Western multinationals could strengthen the Chinese economy and help Beijing afford even more ambitious territorial and military policies. Discouraging trade and investment could cause lower economic growth that might slow China\u2019s military rise but also might feed anti-Western sentiment and foster public demands for more assertive foreign policy.If the candidates\u2019 ideas became policy, China would almost certainly retaliate in some fashion. American exports, while sharply smaller than those China sends in the other direction, are a potential focus. Beijing has proved especially adept in the past at targeting American exports from swing states in presidential elections and closely fought congressional districts, maximizing its leverage in the political process even if the economic effects were limited.Mr. Trump denounced the pact again on Tuesday, saying that it would force American workers to compete with low-paid Vietnamese workers. Mrs. Clinton, after supporting the early negotiations as secretary of state, has come out against the pact since the fall, saying that the deal does not go far enough to address issues like currency manipulation.Yet canceling the trade pact could actually cause more problems, by pushing American allies in the region into China\u2019s arms and preventing American companies from developing in emerging Asian markets.\u201cIf America kills the T.P.P.,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, \u201cthen China becomes the main center of economic gravity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aloha and Welcome to Paradise. Unless You\u2019re Homeless.", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Honolulu responded to what the governor called a state of emergency, passing tough criminal laws aimed at ridding sidewalks, streets and parks of homeless people.Supported byHONOLULU \u2014 Anna Sullivan is prohibited from sitting on a sidewalk. She cannot wander off to find food without worrying that the police might seize her shopping cart. She cannot sleep on Waikiki Beach without fear of being rousted.Ms. Sullivan, 45, has been homeless for eight years since she got out of prison. But these days \u2014 after run-ins with the police over where she sleeps, sits or leaves her belongings \u2014 she tries to keep away from Waikiki, the bustling tourist district whose sidewalks and beaches she once used as her home.\u201cTickets, tickets, tickets,\u201d she said, already looking weary at the start of her morning, sipping a cup of iced coffee as she sat on a bench by the beach. \u201cThe cops give you a ticket to keep you moving. And then you have to pay the ticket for sleeping in the park. It gets to you.\u201dTwo years ago, Honolulu, for all its opulence and appeal to tourists, was a nationally known hub of homelessness: people sprawling on benches and sidewalks, panhandling, guarding piles of tents and clothes, sleeping in doorways and moving around aimlessly. Business leaders described the atmosphere as a fundamental threat to the tourist-based economy.But these days, the homeless who had crowded large parts of this city are, to a considerable extent, gone.Honolulu\u2019s mayor, Kirk Caldwell, coined the phrase \u201ccompassionate disruption\u201d to describe what the city is doing, because the measures are accompanied by outreach programs.But there seems little doubt among city officials and the homeless themselves that the change on the streets is primarily a result of the laws that permit the authorities to tell people to stop sitting on sidewalks, and to seize belongings that are illegally piled on public land.The crackdown comes amid the gentrification that is transforming cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Honolulu, contributing to higher housing costs and increased homelessness. \u201cYou know what they say the state bird of Hawaii is?\u201d asked Eric John Odegaard, 44, who has been homeless most of his life, gesturing to the growing Honolulu skyline. \u201cThe crane.\u201d Mr. Odegaard sleeps in the nearby mountains.In Honolulu, the most recent homeless law made it illegal to sit or lie on sidewalks, with criminal penalties if warnings are ignored in Waikiki, the tourist district, and in Chinatown. That followed laws that let the authorities seize the belongings of homeless people left in public spaces, and that closed down many parks and beaches at night. So far, there have been only a handful of arrests; the strategy here is to use the threat of tickets and jail to prod homeless people to go someplace else.\u201cI would tell you emphatically that it\u2019s working really, really well,\u201d said George Szigeti, the head of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. \u201cThe No. 1 reason that people were saying they would not come back to Hawaii was because of homelessness.\u201dSome social workers say that the specter of enforcement makes it easier to persuade the homeless to try a night in a shelter bed or enter a drug treatment program. Other advocates have sued the city over some of its approaches.While homeless people have largely vanished from the areas that were the focus of the crackdown, many have just gone elsewhere, into the dense greenery up Diamond Head Road, to out-of-the-way alleys and remote corners of public parks.In interviews, homeless men and women displayed a mastery of the intricacies of state and city laws, of how some sidewalks are covered and others are not and of how beaches open at 5 a.m., allowing a few hours to sleep before it gets too hot. They know not to smoke a cigarette on a beach or push a shopping cart along the sidewalk in Waikiki, prohibited activities which will draw the attention of the police.\u201cWe had to go from the state side of the street to the city property,\u201d said Brian Bowser, 36, who has been homeless since 1995. \u201cWe just do our best.\u201dErnie Martin, the chairman of the Honolulu City Council, said he voted reluctantly for the sidewalk law, known as the sit-lie measure, and saw it as a stopgap. \u201cAt the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter: We can sit-lie the whole island if we want,\u201d he said. \u201cThe population has to go somewhere. We can\u2019t push them into the ocean.\u201dThe sidewalk ordinance took effect at the end of 2014, and through March 1 of this year the police had issued 16,215 warnings and written 534 summonses, according to city officials.\u201cPeople moved because they were being harassed,\u201d said Dan Foster, 49, who has been homeless since coming from Oregon more than a year ago. \u201cBetween dealing with cops and legal authorities, they\u2019d rather just go so they don\u2019t have to deal with it. I think it\u2019s a violation of our constitutional rights, our right to sit places and sleep where we choose. But you know what? I understand. There\u2019s a lot going on out here.\u201d\u201cSit-lie is not about homelessness,\u201d Mr. Caldwell said, as he took a visitor on a tour around the city, pointing out the new high-priced condominiums rising over boulevards where tents and homeless outposts once lined the street. \u201cSit-lie is about commerce. It\u2019s about keeping sidewalks open for people to do business.\u201dMoments later, Ms. Abelaye looked up as two officers approached on Maunakea Street. She peered up the empty sidewalks and rose unsteadily. By now, she knew where to head when the police came. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Aala Park,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019ll sleep.\u201dKaka\u2019ako is a retail neighborhood two miles up the shoreline from Waikiki, and not a place where tourists tend to stray.Last summer it became a flash point in Honolulu\u2019s campaign to rid the streets of the homeless. Sidewalks and patches of grass were covered with tents, sleeping bags, shopping carts, folding chairs and piles of belongings. Merchants and residents in Kaka\u2019ako complained that the influx was a result of the campaign to push people out of Chinatown and Waikiki.And so, a week after Labor Day, teams of city sanitation workers showed up, carrying brooms and shovels. They were followed by garbage trucks. As the police and the homeless looked on, the workers cleared the sidewalks and streets, throwing tents, blankets, clothing and refuse that had been left behind into the trucks.The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit in the United States District Court in Hawaii, charging that Honolulu was violating the constitutional rights of people struggling to survive. \u201cWe are very concerned about laws that criminalize the status of indigency,\u201d said Daniel M. Gluck, the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Hawaii. \u201cWe have seen some very aggressive laws here.\u201d\u201cIt was a good opportunity for us to make very clear that jurisdictions like Boise can\u2019t make it a crime for people who are homeless to sleep in public places when there aren\u2019t enough beds in the city,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the principal deputy assistant general with the department\u2019s civil rights division. \u201cPunishing someone for sleeping in a public place would basically be punishing someone for being homeless. Criminalizing conduct that is integral to one\u2019s status is equivalent to criminalizing status.\u201d\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d Mr. Phillips asked, taking out a packet of baby wipes to clean the wounds on the man\u2019s face.\u201cAnother bottle of vodka,\u201d Mr. McCarroll said with a cackle.\u201cI can\u2019t do that for you,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, leaning in to whisper another idea.\u201cIf I wanted detox, I would have been there already, Justin,\u201d Mr. McCarroll replied.Mr. McCarroll has maintained his perch on his corner, law or no law, for as long as he can remember. Few authorities would want to be in a position of rousting a battered, 64-year-old man from his wheelchair. Not that they have given up. \u201cI have 30 tickets,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to pay them and they know that.\u201dYet that does not appear to deter Mr. Phillips, who is trying to persuade people whose plight he once shared to break out of this life. \u201cWe come out here, we try to get them into the shelter, cleaned up,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cAt that point, we\u2019ll try to do an intervention: \u2018Hey, you want to go to detox? By the way, we have an outpatient program for alcohol and drugs. Can I sign you up?\u2019 \u201dWhile punitive laws have drawn criticism from federal officials, they are applauded here by some advocates of the homeless. \u201cA lot of people say these laws don\u2019t work,\u201d said Kimo Carvalho, the director of community relations with the Institute for Human Services. \u201cBut as a service provider, we advocated for these laws because our homeless outreach teams need to motivate clients to take action.\u201dThere were 559 men and women living on the streets of Waikiki and Chinatown when the program began in November 2014. As of early March, that population had been slashed by 392, Mr. Carvalho said: 219 had been placed in temporary or permanent housing, and another 173 had been flown out.Still, enforcement is a fraught subject in Hawaii, whose allure is built in no small part on marketing itself to the world as the Aloha State, with a welcoming atmosphere. Mr. Caldwell recoils at the use of words like \u201csweep\u201d and \u201cconfiscation.\u201d Leland Cadoy, a police corporal walking the streets of Waikiki with a reporter, kindly addressed every homeless person he saw, and spoke only of \u201cR.C.P.s.\u201d\u201cResidentially challenged people,\u201d he said, when asked about the acronym. \u201cYou call someone homeless, it sounds derogatory.\u201dEven as he applauded the changes in Waikiki, David Ige, the governor, said the crackdown was not the answer to the homeless crisis that has become such a part of life here. He said that what Honolulu needed was affordable housing, a goal that has stubbornly eluded this island.\u201cHomelessness has reached every community in the island \u2014 in areas where you didn\u2019t see them five years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are just enforcing and moving people from location to location you are not really reducing or solving the problem. It\u2019s just making it someone else\u2019s problems. It\u2019s not like they can leave the state.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They had gathered into the you\u2019ll-never-have-this-level-of-good-taste-so-don\u2019t-even-try apartment of Ms. Lyons, the president and creative director of J.

At United Nations functions, for instance, he would draw foreign dignitaries into discussions of the gross domestic product of the Galactic Republic.Last year, he told her of his plan to liken the blockbuster film franchise to constitutional law in a speech he was about to give at the graduation ceremony for the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Her worries increased.\u201cHe informed me he was going to talk at commencement about \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and the law, and I thought he had lost his mind,\u201d Ms. Power said.Professor Sunstein\u2019s talk turned out to be a success, and his wife was on board when he decided to give book-length treatment to the ideas rattling around in his brain.Professor Sunstein developed a new interest in \u201cStar Wars\u201d after introducing the series to his son, Declan, 7, and witnessing how it became a touchstone for them. He wrote in celebration of this bond with his son and in homage to his father, who died when Cass was 26.The book party was in the very spot where the seed for the project was planted. One night last year, the Sunstein-Powers were watching an awards show at the Crangi-Lyons apartment when Ms. Crangi suggested to Professor Sunstein that he rewatch \u201cStar Wars\u201d with Declan. She even sent him home with a DVD.Ms. Crangi has seen the various films some 150 times. \u201cIt sent me on a path of being obsessed with science fiction and an intergalactic economy,\u201d she said at the party.Nearby, Dr. Kissinger was holding forth on something or other as the biographer Mr. Isaacson told Ms. Brown, making a reference to her husband, the author and editor Harry Evans, \u201cI remember seeing you on the back of Harry\u2019s motorcycle.\u201d Ms. Brown laughed gaily.Rory Lyons, a former insurance broker at Lloyd\u2019s of London (and the father of the party\u2019s co-host Ms. Lyons), paused in the middle of the room to say: \u201cI\u2019m hoping to challenge Dr. Kissinger to a game of who\u2019s been to more countries.

A hush fell over the room, except for an insistent low rumble that you could hear above the hum of the air-conditioner.\u201cWho is still talking?\u201d she called out.It was Dr. Kissinger.He took the admonishment diplomatically, and Ms. Lyons said of Professor Sunstein, \u201cHe actually has managed to write a book in the time that I \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe painted my nails.\u201dProfessor Sunstein stood before the guests.

Trump delivered a blistering attack on Wednesday against Hillary Clinton, calling her unreliable and more concerned with herself than with the American people as he sought to regain his footing after a tumultuous month that imperiled his candidacy.\u201cThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Since securing the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump has allowed himself to be pummeled by Democrats, doing little to fashion an overarching message or even to frame his view of the race. But on Wednesday, he moved to regain the offensive, making a forceful case that he chose to enter public service because of his concerns for the country, a contrast he tried to draw with Mrs. Clinton.\u201cShe believes she is entitled to the office,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHer campaign slogan is \u2018I\u2019m with her.\u2019 You know what my response to that is? I\u2019m with you, the American people. She thinks it\u2019s all about her. I know it\u2019s all about you.\u201dThe remarks were welcomed by Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who have fretted that he is turning the campaign into a referendum on himself instead of President Obama and Mrs. Clinton.Carl Paladino, a Trump ally who was in the room for the speech, said that the candidate \u201clikes to speak extemporaneously\u201d but that his more scripted approach on Wednesday was necessary.\u201cHe told everybody why Hillary shouldn\u2019t be there, he gave a factual foundation for those statements,\u201d Mr. Paladino said. \u201cThat type of speech has to be scripted.\u201dMr. Trump has promised turnarounds in his undisciplined approach before, only to undercut his own remarks in a day or two with a Twitter blast or provocative public remarks. And on Thursday, he heads to Scotland, a business trip tied to his golf courses.\u201cAs we Methodists like to say,\u201d she told hundreds of supporters, pausing for effect and knowing applause, \u201cdo all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

Ford and George Bush. Mr. Trump explicitly blamed her for the death of United States Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens during the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya.Mr. Trump began his speech with a focused message about jobs and the economy, lamenting a lost era in the United States of bringing change on a grand scale, and the absence of his signature boastfulness added gravitas.But the address was denounced by Mr. Trump\u2019s critics as a patchwork of cable-news-ready sound bites as opposed to a presentation of new ideas. Mr. Trump did little to lay out specifics of his agenda beyond attacking trade deals and immigration. And his new, more sober approach was undercut by factual inaccuracies and embellishments, as well as flimsy claims \u2014 at one point, Mr. Trump suggested that Mrs. Clinton was probably the victim of blackmail from Chinese hackers who gained access to her email account while she was the secretary of state.Mr. Trump quoted extensively from the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d written by a Republican author who was forced to correct several inaccuracies after the book went to press. He said the United States was the \u201chighest taxed country in the world,\u201d which is not true. He said there might be five Supreme Court vacancies for the next president to fill, a number that has not been suggested before.Mr. Trump overtly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to back him instead of Mrs. Clinton, borrowing from the senator\u2019s own words to describe her as unfit for office. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to be president, but she doesn\u2019t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said, the judgment, to be president,\u201d Mr. Trump said.What\u2019s next for a campaign with a big fund-raising gap.\u201cWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cOnly by me.\u201dMr. Trump did use the speech to sand down the edges of his past remarks about Muslims, acknowledging that some people who follow Islam are \u201cpeaceful\u201d while never mentioning his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants.With the speech, Mr. Trump was trying to amplify Mrs. Clinton\u2019s high negative poll ratings with voters, a majority of whom view her as dishonest, as he seeks to alter the current trajectory of the presidential campaign. He seized on controversies surrounding the Clinton Foundation and her tenure at the State Department to accuse her of \u201ctheft,\u201d adding, \u201cShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund.\u201dBut Mr. Trump, who once lamented in an interview that the turn of the century was the last time America was \u201cgreat,\u201d provided a hopeful message, suggesting the advent of a second industrial revolution during his presidency. \u201cMassive new factories will come roaring into our country,\u201d he said, \u201cbreathing life and hope into our communities.\u201dThat theme, accompanied by his attacks on free trade, is one that Mr. Trump employed to great effect in the nominating fight, and some of his aides believe it could appeal to Sanders supporters in a general election.While Mr. Sanders has yet to endorse Mrs. Clinton, he balked at the idea that his followers would support Mr. Trump.\u201cI suspect he ain\u2019t going to get too many of those people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on C-SPAN when asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s courting of his supporters. \u201cI think the vast majority of the people who voted for me understand that Donald Trump, in a dozen different ways, is literally unfit to be president of the United States.\u201dAn earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly the name of the United States ambassador who was killed in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

Margaret Douglas was just 28 when her husband died, and Adam Smith still in utero. At the age of 2, Smith inherited his father\u2019s estate, and his mother saw that he got his dinner for the rest of her days.In her book, Mar\u00e7al does not just rail against an economy that disadvantages such women and discounts their work \u2014 and, oh, does the economy discount it. Anybody who has ever changed a diaper, bathed an aging parent or scrubbed a house clean knows that it is work, though work that comes without a paycheck, overtime or sick days, and work that women often end up doing even when perfectly capable men are available.Mar\u00e7al also rails against the study of that economy, meaning economics, our favorite latter-day science-religion. Because that care work often happens without any dollars and cents changing hands, it does not show up in G.D.P. reports or economic outlooks \u2014 and does not figure as prominently in our own minds as it arguably should. Canada\u2019s statistical office took a stab at figuring out the value of uncompensated care, and came up with roughly one-third of the country\u2019s annual G.D.P. Here in the United States, that would mean something like $6 trillion a year.Economics ignores those sums and that labor, and more broadly fails to capture the messy reality of life, Mar\u00e7al argues. She does so by tracing the history of Homo economicus from Smith all the way through the global financial crisis. This economic man is rational, selfish, profit-\u00adseeking, isolated, atomized, measured. He and the thinkers who built and worship him reject anything irrational, selfless, emotional, connected, uncounted, loving, female. In doing so, Mar\u00e7al says, they fail all of us. They think of gender inequality as just the way the world works. They put profit first, trust in crazed markets and even rationalize dumping toxic waste on poor countries. \u201cEconomic man dominates, even though for years research has been able to show that he has very little to do with reality,\u201d she writes.Here is where the book is most interesting but also least convincing. For one, many economists tackle irrationality, impulsiveness, inequality and gender discrimination \u2014 the famed development economist Esther Duflo leaps to mind, as does Harvard\u2019s Claudia Goldin, as does the entire field of behavioral economics, which gets only a quick mention. Moreover, the profession seems fully aware that it can study only what it can measure. That\u2019s a lot, but not everything. And it seems strange to blame the failures of economics for the injustices of the economy. Women do not perform so much unpaid care work because economists do not know how to measure its value, after all. They perform all that unpaid care work for a whole mess of reasons \u2014 cultural, historical and economic.More broadly, and despite its clearly feminist intentions, the book doesn\u2019t give women enough credit. It waves away the tremendous progress that women have made in the workplace and in the world of late, even with Homo economicus crashing markets and conspiring against them. Women might not have ideal choices when it comes to child care and jobs, but they have a lot more options than Margaret Douglas did.Annie Lowrey is a contributing editor at New York magazine and a former business \u00adreporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

We Hispanics have become a little closer because of this.\u201dFor Puerto Ricans here, the heartbreak is especially strong. Orlando was meant to be a haven for Puerto Ricans who fled the island because of its imploding economy and spectacularly high crime rate. The fact that so many young Puerto Ricans died in a spasm of violence during a night of dancing seems a particularly bitter twist.Ramona Nazario, 67, who arrived three years ago from Ponce, P.R., said the shooting reminded her too much of what she had left behind. \u201cThe same things are happening here \u2014 the killings, the drugs,\u201d Ms. Nazario said in Spanish. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel so well when these things go on.

Jobs are not always plentiful. Housing is pricey and getting pricier by the month. Social services are limited. And schools, particularly in the Kissimmee area, are bulging with new arrivals.In the last couple of years, some Puerto Ricans, unable to make ends meet, have returned to the island. Mr. DeJesus went on interview after interview and landed a few jobs, most recently in visual media.\u201cPuerto Ricans, when they come from Puerto Rico, they hear so much, \u2018You need to follow your dreams,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Hernandez said. \u201cIn reality, when they come here, they are lost.\u201dTheir presence has made the Orlando area a remarkably diverse place. So many Puerto Ricans arrived that the Puerto Rican government opened up a branch here to help islanders. And recently, the Hispanic Federation, long active with Puerto Ricans in New York City, set up shop as well. Not all of the Puerto Ricans in the area came directly from the island; many ventured here from New York and Chicago.Businesses that cater to Puerto Ricans \u2014 be it food, health care training, moving needs, travel, language instruction \u2014 have also opened and spread across the area. Valencia College is expanding to accommodate the growing numbers. Seven current students or recent graduates died at the club on Sunday.Puerto Ricans have also expanded their political foothold. In 2012, there was one Puerto Rican in the Florida House. Now, there are four in the House and one in the State Senate, and commissioners in Orlando and Kissimmee.State Senator Darren Soto, a Puerto Rican who represents this area and is running for a House seat, said the shootings had deeply shaken the community.\u201cTo see one of the staff members of Pulse waving the Puerto Rican flag on the stage,\u201d Mr. Soto said, recounting the Monday evening memorial service at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts here, \u201cit struck us quite deeply. It was recognition that our community was particularly hit.\u201dThe profound sense of loss clings to the community as relatives plan funerals or arrange to bring the dead back home. Ana Disla is reeling from the death of her nephew, Anthony Luis Laureano Disla, who loved to dance so much that he moved here from Puerto Rico three years ago to pursue a job as a dancer and choreographer. She wishes now that he had not come at all.\u201cHe came here to try to have a better quality\u201d of life, she said. \u201cAnd look what happened now.\u201dKim Severson contributed reporting from Atlanta, Kitty Bennett from St. Petersburg, Fla., and John Eligon from Orlando.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Secret Weapon: Letters of Love, Flattery and Revenge", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byIn one letter, Donald J. Trump ranted about the crisis of unsightly hot dog vendors on his beloved Fifth Avenue. \u201cHaving ketchup and mustard splattered all over the sidewalk,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis disgraceful.\u201dIn another note, he paid flowery tribute to his young wife, whom he referred to as \u201cmy little darling.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re everything I hoped for,\u201d he wrote.In a different missive, he offered a rare admission of weakness, declaring, \u201cI am nothing more than a frustrated writer of little talent.\u201dBut perhaps his most powerful and memorable form of communication is the old-fashioned ritual of a personal letter, written on embossed paper or scrawled across a newspaper clipping, signed by hand and sent from the 26th floor of Trump Tower.Churned out prolifically from a computer-free desk, they are letters of gratitude, hate, flattery and revenge, dispatched to teenage admirers and big-city mayors, professional athletes and magazine editors. The tone can range from florid to juvenile, pleading to poisonous.Tightly clutched and prominently displayed even by those who despise him, the epistles have become keepsakes and mementos for hundreds of people across the country. Viewed as a collection from the 1970s to now, they offer an unusual archive of his emotional ups and downs.\u201cPeople come by and immediately want to see it, touch it and hold it,\u201d Mr. Tollin said with pride.Today, as Mr. Trump tries to make peace with hostile figures in his party, the candidate renowned for his rhetorical flame throwing is deploying a conciliatory style of letter writing as his chief weapon.His handwritten overtures have started to arrive in the mailboxes of seemingly implacable foes, like Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host in Milwaukee, who has described Mr. Trump as a \u201cwhiny, thin-skinned bully.\u201d\u201cCharlie,\u201d began Mr. Trump\u2019s note, scribbled with a thick black pen on the front page of The New York Times, next to an article about skeptical Republicans warming to Mr. Trump, \u201cI hope you can change your mind.\u201d Ever attuned to incentives, the real estate mogul dangled an offer: \u201cLook forward to doing your show,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI will win!\u201dIt did not change Mr. Sykes\u2019s dim view of Mr. Trump. But he was, he conceded, impressed by the gesture. \u201cGive him credit that he\u2019s doing this,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do some things that might be somewhat at odds with his public image.\u201dThe letters \u2014 culled from personal and public archives \u2014 reveal Mr. Trump\u2019s insecurities, but also his perceptiveness about power, ego and what motivates people. From early on, he seemed to intuitively grasp the potency of his praise when lavished on like-minded men.In the 1990s, Mr. Trump occasionally fawned over New York\u2019s brash mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. In one letter, Mr. Trump tore out a page from a magazine interview in which he had called Mr. Giuliani \u201cthe greatest mayor that the city\u2019s ever had.\u201d In case Mr. Giuliani missed the homage, Mr. Trump drew two bold arrows, each pointing at the glowing passage, and reiterated the message in a handwritten note: \u201cRudy, you are the greatest!\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201csee you soon.\u201dThere is never any question about authorship: Mr. Trump\u2019s style of writing sounds virtually identical to his hyperbolic manner of speech, with a healthy sprinkling of the words \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201ctremendous,\u201d abundant displays of self-regard and over-the-top claims of success or doom.He could write with striking tenderness to Ivana, according to notes reviewed by The Times. \u201cI adore and love my little darling,\u201d he wrote to her in one. \u201cI truly believe that you are the greatest,\u201d he wrote in another.For years, Mr. Trump sent his letters the old-fashioned way, by mail. But over time, members of his staff dragged him into the internet era \u2014 sort of. He still writes by hand, brandishing the favored tool of teachers\u2019 corrections and athletes\u2019 autographs, a black Sharpie. Now his aides often turn the letters into digital files, scanning them and sending them by email.But he refuses to let anyone else do the writing. \u201cIf I had a secretary to do them,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t be nearly as effective, they wouldn\u2019t be nearly as sharp.\u201dMr. Abdul-Jabbar said he was flabbergasted. \u201cIt was such a petty and childish reaction, like a teenage boy responding to being turned down for a date by whining, \u2018Well, nobody likes you!\u2019 \u201d he said. He likened Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to write his reply on the original article to \u201ca dog urinating on a tree to mark its territory.\u201dMr. Abdul-Jabbar had to get rid of the letter. \u201cI crumpled it up real nice and tight and skyhooked it into my wastepaper basket,\u201d he recalled, invoking his trademark shot.Others cannot let go. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to keep it,\u201d Mr. Sykes, the radio host, said of his letter. \u201cProbably in a desk drawer.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ashley Parker, Kitty Bennett, Steve Eder and Jeremy B.

{"Headline": "With N.H.L. Expansion, Las Vegas Hits the Jackpot: A Pro Team", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 For decades, the country\u2019s top professional sports leagues were so fearful of game-fixing that they generally dismissed the idea of putting teams in Las Vegas, the country\u2019s gambling mecca.But the once unthinkable has quickly become a reality: Las Vegas has landed one big league team, and it may have two or even three in the future.On Wednesday, the N.H.L. added Las Vegas to its 30-team league, its first expansion in 16 years. With the stigma fading, the N.F.L. could follow if the Raiders, who have been unable to persuade Oakland, Calif., to help them build a new home, can get officials here to help pay for a new domed stadium.Indeed, according to the American Gaming Association, 19 N.F.L. stadiums are less than 20 miles from a casino, and daily fantasy companies allow fans to bet on a lineup of players of their design using a computer or smartphone.Leagues still bar players from betting on games, and some prohibit them from working at or with casinos, presumably to keep them away from bettors trying to recruit them to throw games. But some of the biggest game-fixing scandals have occurred far from Las Vegas, and players are better paid now \u2014 so they are less prone to taking money from gamblers.\u201cI never believed there was a taboo about Las Vegas,\u201d Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman said Tuesday. \u201cGambling is everywhere. Some people are provincial and don\u2019t want to change the status quo. But you have to get with the times. Pro sports are a natural here.\u201dEven without putting teams here, the leagues have embraced Las Vegas, which has hosted an N.B.A. All-Star Game and an N.B.A. summer league. The N.H.L. has held its annual awards dinner here for several years. Teams also accept sponsorships from casinos, and Major League Baseball and the N.H.L. have invested in DraftKings, one of the largest daily fantasy operators.\u201cI think Las Vegas is one of the real crown jewels of communities in the United States,\u201d the owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys told reporters in May. \u201cFor me, I think that certainly the fact that Las Vegas has a gambling aspect to it is far overshadowed by the entertainment value, if you will, the family appeal that you have, the convention appeal.\u201dSkeptics remain. Although the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, has said he is open to the possibility of a team moving to Las Vegas, he told ESPN in April that the league remained against anything that could sway games.\u201cTo me, where I cross the line is anything that can impact the integrity of the game,\u201d Goodell told ESPN. \u201cIf people feel like it\u2019s going to have an influence on the outcome of the game, we are absolutely opposed to that.\u201dSome observers believe Las Vegas will have a hard time supporting a pro team because so many residents are from elsewhere and root for the teams they grew up with. Many also work in the tourism industry and are busy on game days.\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much new population, because it\u2019s a 24-hour community, because it\u2019s so suburbanized, there isn\u2019t the same sense of community,\u201d said Michael Green, who teaches classes on the history of the city and the state at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.In particular, selling hockey in the desert can be tough, something the owners of the troubled Coyotes learned in Arizona, where the debt-laden team was taken over by the N.H.L.The N.H.L. has never voiced much concern about the gambling in Las Vegas because, as Commissioner Gary Bettman has said on a few occasions, the casinos\u2019 take on hockey games is quite small.\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about the integrity of our game,\u201d Bettman said Wednesday.The much bigger issue for the N.H.L. has been the financial viability of a franchise in a nontraditional hockey market (meaning not very cold).The N.H.L. is hoping this time is different.On Wednesday, the league\u2019s 30 governors, or owners, unanimously approved a new team for Las Vegas that will be owned by Bill Foley, a financial services tycoon, who will pay a $500 million expansion fee. The team, which has not been named yet, will begin playing in the 2017-18 season in the new T-Mobile Arena, built by MGM Resorts International and the venue operator, AEG. About 14,000 fans have placed deposits on season tickets.\u201cWe think this is a tremendously exciting opportunity not just for Las Vegas but for the league as well,\u201d Bettman said, pointing to the city\u2019s growing population and reputation for entertainment.Bettman dismissed concerns that an N.H.L. team cannot succeed in a desert city. He noted that the league\u2019s teams in California, Florida and Texas all made the playoffs this past season and that youth hockey participation had grown 37 percent in Nevada in the last decade.The N.F.L. may be an easier sell. Football is far more popular, and the Raiders are a local favorite because of their outlaw image and because they play in neighboring California.But in a chicken-or-egg scenario, the Raiders\u2019 owner, Mark Davis, will not move the team unless he has a new stadium for it to play in, and Las Vegas and Clark County will not help him build that stadium unless he has a green light from the league to move.Davis and the Las Vegas Sands are pushing a proposal to build a $1.4 billion domed stadium that includes $750 million in hotel taxes, but the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee is pushing a more modest plan with a reduced public contribution. Some rival casino and hotel operators in Las Vegas do not want to give the Sands an edge.By the end of July, the committee must send a final recommendation to the governor, who can call a special session of the state\u2019s Legislature so that lawmakers can vote on whether to authorize Clark County to raise its hotel tax.Like all debates over the use public funds for sports venues, the decision is fraught. Proponents say hotel taxes are primarily paid by the 42 million visitors to Las Vegas each year, not local residents, and the stadium will draw lots of out-of-town visitors.\u201cThe amount of publicity it will give Las Vegas around the world will be immense, and the funding will not be on Las Vegas or the state of Nevada, so it\u2019s a unique way to think of how to get this built,\u201d said Tim Leiweke, a consultant hired by the Sands Corporation to help get the stadium built.Opponents argue that money from the hotel room tax could be spent on other needs, like education and transportation, or to expand the convention center to attract more high-paying visitors. They also point to T-Mobile Arena, which was privately financed.\u201cLas Vegas is in a very unique position because it doesn\u2019t need an N.F.L. team to make the stadium work,\u201d said Ed Uehling, a longtime resident who has argued against using hotel taxes for team owners. \u201cYou can really build it, and they will come.\u201dBut significant questions persist. The $1.4 billion price tag does not include buying the land or upgrading the surrounding infrastructure. There are also concerns about building a stadium at a preferred site near McCarran Airport because it could interfere with air traffic. Buying land at other sites could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge appetite for football, but a lot of questions about a stadium,\u201d said Steve Sisolak, chairman of the board of Clark County commissioners. \u201cYou can\u2019t confuse the two.\u201dDavis, who declined to be interviewed, has promised to contribute $500 million toward the cost of a stadium. But he has to deliver on his promise to move his team. Prominent N.F.L. owners like Jones and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots have voiced support for a team in Las Vegas, but at least 24 owners would have to approve any relocation, and Davis would have to pay a sizable relocation fee.To protect Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, Steve Hill, who leads the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee, said the public would not contribute to a new stadium unless the Raiders were allowed to move. He added that taxpayers would not be on the hook for any unexpected increases in the construction cost or in the cost of running the building and said he wanted the Raiders and Sands to split any profits with the public if the stadium generated returns above a certain threshold.Even if the Raiders and Sands resist those demands, Hill said the possibility that an N.F.L. team will move to Nevada was as high as it had ever been, thanks to the melting concerns about the influence of gambling.\u201cIt is somewhat destined that Las Vegas will have an N.F.L. team,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have said that five or 10 years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why French Workers Are So Mad", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 Last month, Emmanuel Macron, a onetime investment banker who is now the Socialist government\u2019s young minister of the economy, visited Lunel, a small town in southern France. He was taken to task in the street for the \u201cloi travail,\u201d the labor law \u2014 recently pushed through by his government \u2014 that he was in Lunel to promote. A trade unionist wearing a T-shirt challenged him: \u201cYou, you\u2019ve got lots of cash, you buy yourself nice suits.\u201d Without missing a beat, Mr. Macron responded, \u201cThe best way to afford a nice suit is to work.\u201dThe overwhelming majority of the political class, big business, the news media and the intellectual elites have applauded the labor law. For them, the strikes offer yet more proof that France is \u201cunreformable.\u201dEven though no one knows precisely what effect the law will have, very few wage-earners in France, unionists or not, believe that making firing easier will create more jobs. Logically enough, they think it will create more firings. But more important, the French know recent history and can perceive trends.There are 5.7 million unemployed (including the partly unemployed) workers in France today, the equivalent of some 28 million Americans. Action is urgently required. But the great absence from the debate over the labor law in the government is any reference to the reality of the jobs that will supposedly be created. Most people fill that void with dread.The current round of strikes will probably come to an end soon. And Nuit Debout has already largely disintegrated. But its American cousin Occupy Wall Street left a legacy, the idea of the \u201c1 percent\u201d and of the noxiousness of ever-growing social inequalities. What\u2019s going on in France now is similarly clarifying trends: To work in the future, you\u2019ll have to settle for being less well paid, and for having worse health insurance and lower unemployment benefits. As for your children, they\u2019ll live in a world with much greater inequality than yours. That\u2019s the new rule.Sylvain Cypel, a former correspondent and editor for Le Monde, is at work on a book about immigration.

Berry also returns to his favorite plot device: resurrecting a long-buried historical secret upon which potential disaster rests. The secret this time is a scenario first understood \u2014 and then hidden \u2014 by America\u2019s oldest fraternal organization, the Society of the Cincinnati. Turns out the founding fathers made one very big planning mistake: If the president and the vice president die at the same time on Inauguration Day before taking the oath of office, the result is a leaderless government and a constitutional crisis. For enemies of the state, that can mean only one thing: opportunity.According to \u201cThe 14th Colony,\u201d the old Soviets discovered the oversight, and their rogue agents have decided to finally take revenge on the United States for what is presented as the subterfuge cooked up between Ronald Reagan and the pope that led to the fall of the U.S.S.R. (Anyone not a fan of the 40th president is hereby warned that in this book, he\u2019s a genius.) Their weapons: decades-old nuclear suitcase bombs, which were hidden on American soil long ago, and sleeper agents. The suspense: Who will get to them first?The fact that the book is being published during an election year when we are about to have a lame duck president should make the worst-case scenario feel especially relevant, particularly with recent revelations about the real White House\u2019s meticulous transition planning in response to terrorism. But compared with the terrorists of today, Berry\u2019s villains are so creaky, they seem less threatening than quaint.The big questions range from the \u201cwho done it?\u201d to the existential. Did the suicide victim actually kill himself, or did an evil force drive him to it? What is that force? What does God demand from his children? Unfortunately, Hall gives all of these questions equal weight, which tends to undermine the book\u2019s loftier philosophical aspirations, as does the presence of ye olde Devil-worshipping sex cult. In the end, this update is caught between its high and low impulses, and feels more like the rehashed \u201cExorcist\u201d than like the moody first season of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d Its demons are predictable, down to their growling voices and evil laughs, especially in comparison with devils that may be closer to home \u2014 or actually in your home, or at least the home you married into.Maya Stern is a former special-ops helicopter pilot, now a suburban flight instructor and mother, who was forced out of the military when the whistle-blower posted a video online of her ordering an airstrike that killed a number of unarmed Iraqi civilians. As is the wont in such books, death follows her home, and the story opens with the murder of her husband, scion of a wealthy Establishment family, by masked gunmen. (It turns out her older sister was also a murder victim, killed before the book begins, when Maya was still in combat.)Left a single mother with a small child and some residual PTSD, Maya installs a nanny cam in her den, and the next thing you know, her dead husband shows up, alive and on video. The twists begin there and don\u2019t stop until all the murders add up, company fraud is exposed, the rot at the heart of a twisted family is revealed and the rug is entirely pulled out from under the reader.The story begins, once again, with a death \u2014 a gruesome one, involving an ax in a young mother\u2019s head \u2014 then cycles backward in time to how it happened, playing peekaboo with the motivations and history of its cast: the grieving widower, a professor at a local college; his lovely wife, a.k.a. the victim; their young daughter; and the three damaged brothers who once lived in their home and act as their babysitters and renovation team, and whose parents committed suicide. All of the above are sympathetic and suspicious in equal measure, a result of Brundage\u2019s ability to peel away the onionskin layers of emotion that define any relationship. As the clues accumulate and the killer is revealed, the truth becomes both horrifying and inevitable.Travel writers of the National Geographic-meets-Departures kind populate the book, with Will as the exemplar. He is the employee of a magazine called (surprise) Travelers: a man with a big expense account, a small salary, a mysterious boss who keeps disappearing into a hidden back room, and a disgruntled wife \u2014 who was also a Travelers writer until she left her job for \u201cother opportunities,\u201d as yet unspecified. On a junket to French wine country Will meets a gorgeous Australian, and though he refrains from breaking his wedding vows, when he encounters her again on a trip to Argentina he gives in to temptation, an act that has some unexpected repercussions. Needless to say, no one\u2019s job is quite what readers might assume.Simply consider the fact that Travelers is a magazine where communications are delivered by hand, by couriers, in sealed envelopes, as opposed to email or mobile phone. And it seems to suffer not at all from the current economic malaise affecting its competitors, and for that matter old media in general. It\u2019s enough to make anyone raise an eyebrow.Turns out travel writing is great cover for all sorts of clandestine activity, both official and not, and Will gets sucked right in. He\u2019s almost determinedly na\u00efve (one of the reasons he was hired, apparently, and the reader will guess what everyone is up to long before our hero does), though he also proves surprisingly adept at learning the particulars of self-defense, surreptitious photography and other illicit skills \u2014 as do many of his colleagues, who turn out to be not so deskbound after all.It\u2019s all highly entertaining and more than a little fantastic. But it\u2019s easy to suspend your disbelief in sheer enjoyment at Pavone\u2019s use of language, not to mention a James Bond-worthy itinerary that takes the otherwise ink-stained wretch from Brooklyn to Paris by way of Dublin, a Russian billionaire\u2019s yacht and a remote village in Iceland, as he evades a variety of secret-service types, enforcers and that even more frightening contemporary golem, the megalomaniac businessman.The story of an outbreak that started as a military experiment gone awry, decimating the human population by turning it into vampires, and the heroic efforts of the few remaining survivors to remain human (literally and emotionally), it\u2019s pretty much \u201cTwilight\u201d meets the Bible meets \u201cThe Hot Zone.\u201d That sounds messy, but it has proved a surprisingly powerful formula. The final installment begins in the year 98 A.V. \u2014 After Virus \u2014 a time when the 12 original sources of infection, or apostles of destruction, have been killed thanks to a young Jesus figure named Amy, who sacrificed herself to save mankind. The surviving small community of humans, living in the Texas Republic, are beginning to feel complacent and let their guard down, clearly a sign that something is about to go wrong.Which, of course, it does. It turns out the vamps are not gone, merely biding their time, because the original carrier, the \u201cZero\u201d who brought the disease from the jungles of Bolivia and started it all, has been hiding out in the ruins of Grand Central Terminal, nursing his grievances and preparing for a final battle. His great love was taken from him when he was still human, and he wants everyone to feel his pain; though it\u2019s not the most original motivation, it is effective. When Amy returns for the final showdown, to stand for and then with her friends, the lines between good and evil are blurred.It would be unfair to reveal who dies and who lives, but chances are you can guess the outcome of the last battle \u2014 though said battle is not itself the end of the book. Instead there is an epilogue after a coda after a conclusion, as if the author could not quite bring himself to say goodbye to the world he had imagined. That\u2019s understandable: Lengthy as the book is, it is also compulsively readable.In the end, a subplot involving the transformation of a giant shipwreck into a usable ark meant to take a small slice of humanity to a virus-free island off the coast of Australia provides resolution \u2014 or at least a reason for Cronin to fast-forward to 1003 A.V. Amy herself has become legend, giving rise to a sect of \u201cAmmalites,\u201d scientists who study \u201cThe Book of Twelves\u201d and a mystical finale that is both manipulative and strangely moving. By the time you\u2019ve made your way through it, you\u2019ll never look at a bat in quite the same way again.Yasmin has brought her child to Fairbanks from England to visit her husband, who has been making a documentary on Alaskan wildlife and living with a native tribe, but immediately after they land they are told he has been killed in a fire that wiped out the village. Refusing to believe the local authorities, sympathetic though they seem, Yasmin and her daughter embark on what becomes an epic journey in a stolen truck into the wilderness \u2014 and the politics of fracking \u2014 to track him down. It seems like a fool\u2019s adventure, except the alternating voices of mother and daughter are so compelling, it\u2019s hard not to want to go along for the ride.As they drive, pursued by another truck and with warnings of dire weather ahead, the book skates smoothly over issues of environmentalism, tribal rights and the relationship of the deaf and hearing worlds, including the question of what it means to have a \u201cvoice.\u201d The temperature drops, the action heats up and the suspense builds with the storm, speckled by alluring scientific tidbits on the subjects of stars and species.

{"Headline": "What Do This Season\u2019s Political Books Tell Us About the Election?", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byEssayIs there a useful precedent for this most unpredictable of election seasons? Some have pointed to 1976, when Republicans were split in two and had to settle their differences at the national convention that summer. Others point to the chaos and violence of 1968. But a more pertinent example may be the election of 1936. The country was lifting itself out of the Great Depression, helped by the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, but the climb back to prosperity was long and slow, and a mood of populist unrest began to steal across the land. \u201cThe followers of the demagogues mostly came from the old lower-middle classes, now in an unprecedented stage of frustration and fear, menaced by humiliation, dispossession and poverty,\u201d Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in \u201cThe Politics of Upheaval,\u201d published in 1960. \u201cThey came from provincial and traditionally nonpolitical groups in the population, jolted from apathy into near-hysteria by the shock of economic collapse.\u201d Many also \u201ccame from the evangelical denominations; years of Bible reading and fundamentalist revivalism had accustomed them to millennial solutions.\u201d Outsider candidates became the vehicles of an existential protest, \u201cOld America in resentful revolt against both contemporary politics and contemporary economics.\u201dIf it all sounds distant and strange \u2014 well, so does the election of 2016. The demagogic spirit of the \u201cradio priest\u201d Father Charles Coughlin and the \u201cminister of hate\u201d Gerald L.K. Smith \u2014 together they would offer what Smith called \u201cleadership with guts\u201d \u2014 has been reborn in the candidacy of Donald Trump, just as the exhortations of the Louisiana boss and \u00adrabble-rouser Huey Long, who declared war on \u201cthe superrich\u201d and proposed a \u201cShare Our Wealth Society,\u201d all but predicted Bernie Sanders\u2019s attack on \u201cthe billionaire class.\u201d Then as now, the sharpest division in our politics seemed the one pitting the guardians of the political order against those whom that order was holding back or keeping down. Coughlin\u2019s \u201csomebody must be blamed\u201d and Long\u2019s \u201cevery man a king\u201d are enduring mes\u00adsages in our democracy.As citizens, not just voters, we demand to know: Why is this all happening now, and what does it mean? The questions are too big to answer at a time already dense with chatter \u2014 the instantaneous eruptions on social media, the daylong spectacle of cable news, the steady drone of talk radio. Worse, our diagnosticians themselves often sound like patients, shouting from the gurney as they\u2019re being rushed into intensive care, or like bemused visitors from another planet. With books, there is the added complication of faulty timing. Election-year analyses always seem to arrive too late or too soon. They are useful nonetheless. The mistakes and misapprehensions \u2014 what the authors thought they knew \u2014 mirror the broader thinking of their moment. They may not tell us exactly where we are, but they remind us where we seemed to be not so long before. They help measure the distance we\u2019ve traveled and illuminate the route we\u2019ve been inching or barreling along.Buckley, too, is befuddled by struggling Americans and their odd habits. Why, he wonders, do so many African-Americans sympathize with immigrants who are stealing low-wage jobs from \u201clow-skilled natives,\u201d and why do the leaders of organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. \u201ctug at their forelock\u201d and docilely support filibuster reform and other \u201coverclass issues that have little to do with \u00adAfrican-Americans as a group\u201d? The answer to the first is that views on immigration don\u2019t correlate only with job opportunities \u2014 as surveys showed in the early 1990s and as hard-\u00adliners in Alabama recently found when they chased out \u201cillegals\u201d and then had to recruit \u201cguest workers\u201d from Africa, Haiti and Puerto Rico to cover the night shift at vacant poultry plants. Immigration has become as much a matter of cultural alienation as of economic insecurity. The citizens of \u201cOld America,\u201d which includes groups \u201cbeginning to see themselves as part of the old immigration rather than the new\u201d (as Schlesinger wrote), feel increasingly \u201cmarginalized from mainstream social and political institutions\u201d and \u201care likely to blame immigrants,\u201d one study explained years ago. \u201cSuch voters are likely to support Ross Perot (or Patrick Buchanan).\u201d And they were overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, African-Americans tend to sympathize with new immigrants, fellow outsiders. So do Asian-Americans and Hispanics, as the Republican Party found in 2012. The old machine politics of group identity and group interests has given way to a new postmodern politics of \u201ccultural affinity.\u201d The answer to Buckley\u2019s second question begins with the long history of Southern Democrats using the filibuster to attack civil rights legislation.But it isn\u2019t seemingly unreasonable blacks who most agitate Buckley. It\u2019s the troublesome white proletariat. Buckley cites the \u201cmagisterial\u201d data-mining of the French economist Thomas Piketty and agrees with him that America has become \u201ca society of inherited privilege and frozen \u00adclasses.\u201d But his actual muse is Piketty\u2019s libertarian doppelg\u00e4nger, Charles Murray, whose book \u201cComing Apart\u201d has become the \u201cTobacco Road\u201d of the intellectual right, with its lurid picture of a giant white slum \u201cwhere children are brain-damaged because the latest live-in boyfriend makes meth in the kitchen sink.\u201d The grim kitchen tour isn\u2019t necessary, Buckley assures us. \u201cYou can also tell American classes apart just by looking at them. .\u2008.\u2008. The blotchy, red face of the problem drinker, the stumbling disheveled gait of the substance abuser.\u201d You can bet he\u2019s \u201ca member of the lower classes.\u201dIf this class warfare waged from above sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it is now the refrain of today\u2019s angriest Americans. No, not the supporters of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. They are simply shopping for new models, as impatient voters in our consumers\u2019 republic tend to do when no incumbent is running. The rage is coming from elsewhere, from the conservative elite, who feel betrayed by a base that used to fall in line behind whomever the party chose for them at election time, but now is rising up in childish or addled rebellion. Not so long ago, indeed as recently as the George W. Bush years, conservatives wrote odes to the hinterland masses, salt-of-the-earth yeomen and yeowomen filling the Nascar stands between heaping plates at Applebee\u2019s. The Great Recession ended that and introduced a new era of seething hostility. The rank and file have spurned party dogma, and the spurned dogmatists are fighting back. \u201cThe white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles,\u201d Kevin D. Williamson, National Review\u2019s \u201croving correspondent,\u201d recently wrote. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\u201d This is the voice of protest in 2016. Williamson has the raw emotion. Buckley\u2019s got the regression analysis.How different it all looked only a few years ago, in the aftershock of Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat, when the Republican National Committee withdrew for a period of spiritual healing and emerged with the \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project,\u201d better known as the \u201cautopsy report.\u201d It recommended trying a little tenderness. If only Republicans crayoned their principles in soothing pastels, new converts \u2014 blacks, Latinos, millennials \u2014 might flock to the tabernacle and add their voices to the small-\u00adgovernment chorus. At the time the autopsy was greeted as strong medicine, at least by liberals, since it parroted what they\u2019d been saying. But the hard-\u00adliner Rush Limbaugh responded with disdainful mirth.Why the fetish for message and tone? Perhaps because what George Will and others call our \u201cconservative party\u201d has little to attract voters not already grouped around the free-market campfire. Such policies as Republicans offer repeat the old slogans, even when those slogans contradict one another. On one page, Republican activists in Wisconsin tell Morrissey that anti-immigration fervor \u201cis going to be huge\u201d in the 2016 election. On the next, he reports that the Wisconsin dairy industry \u201cwould have to shutter its doors without immigrant labor\u201d since no one else wants those jobs (take note, Professor Buckley). In Virginia, too, employers turn to immigrants because \u201clongtime residents aren\u2019t willing to do hard physical work.\u201d Republicans can be either pro-or anti-immigrant, but not both at once, as Marco Rubio discovered.Niceness, in any case, has nothing to do with it, as at least one Republican knows. \u201cWhat was it Donald Trump said in his first debate?\u201d the evangelist Franklin Graham mused at the beginning of the campaign. \u201c\u2009\u2018We don\u2019t have time for tone!\u2019\u2009\u201d The quotation is exact and came during one of Trump\u2019s \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d verbal flood tides, in this instance the one that ran, \u201cWhen you have people that are cutting Christians\u2019 heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many \u00adplaces, that it is medieval times, we\u2019ve never \u2014 it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror.\u201dTrump\u2019s success with such voters caught many by surprise. How could this Manhattan libertine outperform Ted Cruz, the preacher\u2019s son with a command of biblical verse and brimstone oratory \u2014 and in the South, of all places? Jones has the answer, in his chapters on church attitudes on desegregation in the 1950s and same-sex marriage half a century later. A manifesto like James Dobson\u2019s \u201cMarriage Under Fire,\u201d published in 2004 and presaging later pleas for \u201creligious liberty\u201d \u2014 that is, church-sanctioned bigotry \u2014 echoes the hellfire screeds delivered by massive resisters, including clerics, after the Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954. The linking theme was ungodly carnal mixing. Race and sex were big themes in the 1970s too, when the Christian conservative movement was forming. Activists like Paul Weyrich got little traction until they changed the subject from abortion and school prayer to \u201cthe federal government\u2019s crackdown on Christian schools that banned interracial dating,\u201d Jones points out, drawing on the work of the religious historian Randall Balmer.Trump may stumble through \u201ctwo Corinthians,\u201d but he has mastered the more important scripture of the evangelical right. His suggestion that the world\u2019s most dangerous places include Oakland, Calif., and Ferguson, Mo., may not be the favored idiom of George Will\u2019s \u201cconservative party\u201d in 2016, but Strom Thurmond would have agreed with every word back in 1964, the year he converted to the Republican Party, new home to \u00adanti-civil-rights politics, guided by its presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater.In common with other political books this season, \u201cPeople Get Ready\u201d reflects pre-election funk. \u201cA profound and numbing pessimism\u201d pervades campuses, the authors write. Such gloom is symptomatic of what they call in their subtitle a \u201ccitizenless democracy,\u201d overseen by a \u201cweb of corporate-funded think tanks, policy networks, political action committees and media.\u201d All this seems less true today, thanks to Sanders and Trump, who for all their many differences have combined to expose the most decrepit of American \u201cinfrastructures,\u201d the Beltway \u201cestablishment.\u201d At this point it\u2019s worth remembering that the so-called guardians of the republic assess facts differently from many voters. \u201cFor Huey Long, for Father Coughlin and for the millions who were rallying to their banners, it was a season of fervent hopes and frenzied expectations,\u201d Alan Brinkley wrote in \u201cVoices of Protest,\u201d published in 1982. And something similar is happening today.Consider the giant millennial cohort, more than 80 million strong and 44 percent nonwhite, just about the same percentage of \u201clikely voters\u201d in the Iowa caucuses who said \u201cthey would use the word \u2018socialist\u2019 to describe themselves,\u201d according to The Washington Post. In this they sounded less like new flower children than like the skipped-\u00adgeneration offspring of the \u201clost generation,\u201d set adrift during the Great Depression and hoboing through the blighted landscape of a ruined economy until at last Roosevelt threw them the lifeline of the National Youth Administration. Of the 35,000 young people employed by N.Y.A.-funded projects in 1935, half had not been educated beyond the eighth grade, as Robert Caro wrote in \u201cThe Path to Power,\u201d the first volume of his epic cycle on Lyndon Johnson.Stern, himself a former union leader who is now a fellow at the Richman Center at Columbia University, urges a \u201cuniversal basic income,\u201d a proposal attracting wide support on the left. It sounds radical \u2014 Sanders has danced away from it in interviews; but its advocates over the years have included the free-marketers Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, as well as Martin Luther King Jr. and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. That the idea has resurfaced is yet more evidence that what some fear will be the end of responsible party politics \u2014 the presumed locus of the sane and sacred (with apologies to Walt Whitman) \u2014 may in fact be a return to an older style of civic engagement, the rumbling sound of citizens reasserting their sovereignty in defiant rejection of what \u201cthe party decides.\u201dAnd why not, since the parties have been steadily discrediting themselves at the same time that they grow increasingly captive to what populists once called \u201cthe interests\u201d? Schlesinger\u2019s contemporary Richard Hofstadter described this frustration in his classic \u201cThe Age of Reform,\u201d which argued that as far back as the 1890s citizens had become \u201cso completely shut out from access to the centers of power that they feel themselves completely deprived of self-defense and subjected to unlimited manipulation by those who wield power.\u201dSo what? Things are probably no worse today than in the days of Walter \u00adLippmann and the Alsop brothers, who acted as informal counselors to presidents but nevertheless told readers plenty they wouldn\u2019t have learned otherwise. The only question is whether chumminess compromises the work Fields and others do. In Fields\u2019s case, the answer comes when she leaves behind the overtilled subject of the spoiled press corps and instead reports on politicians \u2014 junketeering congressmen in both parties as well as beneficiaries of Clinton- and \u00adBush-family nepotism. If someone in Trumpworld had read Fields\u2019s \u00adpages on Jeb Bush\u2019s soft climb up the velvet rungs of the dynastic ladder (\u201cOnce again, he lobbied his father on behalf of one of his allies in South Florida\u201d), Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, might have thought twice before grabbing her arm at a news conference, one of the election season\u2019s tawdrier moments.It\u2019s too soon to make sense of the amazing, unfinished events of 2016, or to guess where they will lead. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was 19 in 1936. He lived through the trauma, felt the fresh pulse of its revelations. But when he settled in to tell his story, all those years later, he had the advantage of knowing how it all turned out \u2014 of knowing, for one thing, that Coughlin and Long and lesser \u201cfarceurs\u201d had been shooting stars whose sparks and nebulae had been absorbed into the galactic Age of Roosevelt. The waking \u201cdream of fascism\u201d was a dream, after all. We have no such luxury today. This isn\u2019t the Age of Obama \u2014 couldn\u2019t be, not in the era of the two-term limit, even if Obama remains the dominant figure of our time. What we can say, and it\u2019s time we did, is that this year\u2019s upheaval didn\u2019t come crashing into our politics like a meteor. It is our politics, for better and worse, and we had better get used to it.Sam Tanenhaus, a former editor of the Book Review, is the author of \u201cThe Death of Conservatism.\u201d He is writing a biography of William F.

Also, 1.5 million people visited last year compared with 650,000 in 2007; that same year, less than a half-million tourists came to Quito, but in 2015, the city had more than 706,000 tourists.\u201cTourists would fly through Quito to get to the Gal\u00e1pagos, but now that there is better infrastructure on the mainland, they are spending time there and appreciating the many sights,\u201d Ms. Jenkins said.Still, while the major tourist draws were spared by the April earthquake, there is a part of the country that was badly damaged, and Ms. Sommerfield said that travelers could contribute to a recovery by visiting Ecuador. \u201cThe best way to help Ecuador after the earthquake is to visit Ecuador,\u201d she said.Mr. Harteveltd agreed. \u201cTourism is a big help in recovering from a natural disaster because it brings in money to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, if you want to be more proactive, you can join the efforts of a nonprofit that\u2019s hands-on in helping with the recovery and make your trip a volunteering vacation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a statement, two other co-founders of Kleiner Perkins, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had helped define entrepreneurial venture capital.  Kenneth Lerer, the venture capitalist who helped found The Huffington Post and is the chairman at BuzzFeed, and Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial, are being considered, according to people briefed on the discussions. Also on the list are Judith McHale, the former Discovery Communications chief, and Thomas J. May, the chairman of Eversource Energy utility company, these people said. It is unclear whether these people have formally accepted the positions. The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 board being illegitimate. There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed. If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws. Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in. Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash, but because it is so hard for banks to know the identity of the final customer, remittances companies and their agents are being categorized as high risk for money laundering.

Last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering and shut down its Banamex USA Unit.

{"Headline": "Premier of Ukraine Urges Europe Not to Ease Russia Sanctions", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byThe new prime minister of Ukraine appealed to European countries to maintain economic sanctions against Russia, warning that those who might ease pressure would serve as the \u201caggressor\u2019s accomplices.\u201dThe prime minister, Volodymyr B. Groysman, said Friday that, \u201cany softening or removal of sanctions may take place only when the aggressor returns national borders and stops violations of international law.\u201dHis remarks in an interview at the Ukrainian Mission to the United Nations came as senior European officials and executives made a rare visit to Russia, apparently in a bid to temper the worst estrangement in relations between Russia and the West since the Cold War.In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, and the Kremlin\u2019s support for insurgents in Eastern Ukraine, the European Union and the United States imposed wide-ranging economic penalties against Russia.European officials on Friday extended sanctions on doing business in Crimea, and are scheduled to consider next week whether to extend broader sanctions. But some European officials appear keen for a thaw with Russia.On that, the Ukrainian prime minister was adamant. He said it was imperative to maintain the strictest penalties, and he repeatedly referred to Russia as an \u201caggressor\u201d that threatens the security and sovereignty of other countries.\u201cCountries that support the removal of sanctions will turn into the aggressor\u2019s accomplices,\u201d he said.Trade between Russia and Europe is still vital for both, but it has plummeted since 2014. The Western sanctions prohibited oil equipment exports to Russia and barred some of Russia\u2019s largest banks from European capital markets. Russia struck back by banning vegetable, dairy and meat from Europe.Mr. Groysman acknowledged the hit that European businesses had taken. But he insisted that moral and political stakes were higher.\u201cThe economic impact of the sanctions on the European economies is negligible compared to the damage from the encouragement of the aggressor,\u201d he said.Ukraine\u2019s bid to keep its conflict with Russia at the center of the Western diplomatic agenda has been frustrated. Ukraine has long wanted United Nations peacekeepers sent to its embattled east, but Russia, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council has blocked any consideration of that idea. Ukraine this year joined the Council as a temporary member.Ukraine has lobbied for the Council to visit the contested area in the east, but Russia has blocked that, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Island Tethered to Taiwan, but Leaning Toward China", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byLieyu Township JournalLIEYU TOWNSHIP, Taiwan \u2014 Cold War detritus scars the white-sand beach on this island. Concrete barriers meant to halt invading tanks stand sentinel, waiting for the invasion that never came.In the water, hundreds of rusting, sharpened steel barricades point menacingly toward the bustling Chinese city of Xiamen, whose skyscrapers poke through the midday haze just over three miles away.The soldiers who manned these coastal defenses are long gone, though some have been replaced by life-size statues for the benefit of the many tourists who flock to the site. The most imminent danger now is to beachcombers who fail to pick up after their dogs. Signs warn they face a stiff fine: payable in new Taiwan dollars.Lieyu Township, encompassing what is known as Lesser Kinmen Island, is not controlled by the People\u2019s Republic of China, nor is the much larger Kinmen Island nearby, even though both sit on the approaches to one of the mainland\u2019s busiest ports.The People\u2019s Liberation Army was never able to wrest control of the strategic islands from Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Republic of China who fled to Taiwan with his Nationalist forces in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists.Chiang, who died in 1975, still watches over the island. A statue of him, doffing his peaked cap, towers over an overgrown athletic field where cows graze. The basketball court and chin-up bars once used by front-line soldiers are slowly surrendering to the lush subtropical vegetation.Kinmen, also called Quemoy, was once a household name in America. The Nationalists and Communists engaged in huge artillery duels here in the 1950s, raising tensions among Washington, Beijing and Moscow as President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, vowed to defend Taiwan from attack.When John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon were running for president in 1960, their disagreement about Quemoy and Matsu, a neighboring archipelago, led to one of the most famous exchanges in their debates.Now, China and Taiwan exchange volleys of fireworks during Chinese New Year.These smaller islands are at a crossroads, borne out by the complicated interplay among the locals, the government in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, and the mainland.In fact, neither Kinmen nor Matsu is geographically part of Taiwan. They are portions of China\u2019s Fujian Province that the Communists never conquered. Their existence helps to make Taiwan the Republic of China, and people interviewed here, who have prospered as trade and tourism with China have blossomed, have deep ties to the mainland.\u201cKinmen people have a very clear sense of their identity,\u201d said Chou Yang-sun, a professor who focuses on mainland affairs at National Quemoy University in Kinmen. \u201cThey are Fujianese, but they are also part of the Republic of China, very different from most people in Taiwan, who support independence.\u201d\u201cWhen you say the Republic of China, there is the word \u2018China\u2019 in there as well,\u201d said Ms. Zhou, speaking during a lull between boisterous groups of visitors touring the cave. \u201cChiang Kai-shek came to Taiwan from the mainland, too. I think a good leader needs to seriously ponder if he or she wants Taiwan\u2019s economy to develop and its people to have stable lives.\u201dOn Taiwan, an hour\u2019s flight away, there has been a different narrative. The economy is contracting, and voters who cast their ballots in January, wary that closer ties with China were draining the island of some good jobs and giving Beijing more influence, rejected the party that brought better ties with the mainland, Chiang\u2019s own Kuomintang, or K.M.T. The newly inaugurated president, Tsai Ing-wen, leads a party swept into power partly because of concerns about China\u2019s growing shadow over Taiwan.Despite decades of being on the front lines, including an artillery bombardment that extended over two decades, people on Kinmen see the mainland not as a threat but as an opportunity.On tiny Lieyu, closer ties with the mainland have also had economic consequences, as the massive garrison has dwindled, diminishing a ready market for the island\u2019s shopkeepers.Soldiers, wearing camouflage uniforms and caps emblazoned with a white sun on a blue field, the national emblem of the Republic of China, mill about the small port where ferries run from Lieyu to the main island. But their small numbers, now in the hundreds, cannot make use of the extensive infrastructure built for the more than 10,000 troops based here decades ago.Tsai Shu-ta, 59, who, along with his wife drives a taxi around the fewer than six square miles that make up Lieyu, recalls the heady days when the thousands of soldiers supported a movie theater, whose American-made projector is now on display at a local museum.He is proud to live in the Republic of China, recalling the propaganda slogans soldiers here broadcast to the Communist troops across the water. But he fears a future when people on Taiwan may formally move toward independence, which could imperil Kinmen because Beijing has said that would be grounds for war.For now, the majority of Taiwanese agree with Mr. Tsai that it is best to maintain the status quo, the coexistence between the two sides that has kept the peace since the guns finally fell silent in the late 1970s.If that should ever change, Mr. Tsai says, joking and with a chuckle, he has a plan:\u201cWe\u2019ll return to the mainland.\u201dKiki Zhao contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jack Fuller, 69, Chicago Tribune Journalist Who Led Expansion, Dies", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byJack Fuller, who joined the The Chicago Tribune as a 16-year-old copy boy, went on to win a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing and ultimately presided over the Tribune Company\u2019s $8 billion acquisition of Times Mirror in 2000, died on Tuesday in Chicago. He was 69.The cause was lung cancer, his son, Timothy, said.Mr. Fuller had been The Tribune\u2019s editorial page editor, executive editor, publisher and chief executive. He was president of Tribune Publishing, the newspaper division of the Tribune Company, when he oversaw the purchase that brought The Los Angeles Times, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant and other Times Mirror publications under the Tribune umbrella, in what was described as the largest acquisition in newspaper history.He retired and left the board in 2004 before the investor Sam Zell bought the company, took it private, imposed cost cuts and later filed for bankruptcy protection.Mr. Fuller was editorial page editor from 1981 to 1987. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his commentary on constitutional and legal issues.In one editorial, he wrote that \u201cfor a person who has been accused and cleared of a crime, Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese shows a remarkable disinterest in the law\u2019s traditional presumption of innocence.\u201d (Mr. Meese was investigated in the Iran-contra arms deal and a Mideast pipeline negotiation, but was never prosecuted.)\u201cThere is plenty of room for disagreement about the legal rule requiring police to read a suspect his rights or lose the chance to use a confession against him,\u201d the editorial continued. \u201cA lot of people are uncomfortable with letting defendants go free simply because the police fouled up an interrogation or a search. On balance, this newspaper has not been persuaded that any other device can deter police misconduct; it has supported the so-called Miranda rule, despite misgivings about its consequences in certain cases.\u201dJack William Fuller was born on Oct. 12, 1946, in Chicago, the son of Ernest Fuller, a financial reporter and assistant editor at The Tribune, and the former Dorothy Voss Tegge. He worked at the paper as a copy boy while still in high school.\u201cMy father was a newspaperman, and so the fact is I had grown up with it,\u201d he once explained.Jack Fuller earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 1968. After serving in the Army as a Vietnam correspondent for the newspaper Pacific Stars and Stripes, he attended Yale University Law School, graduating in 1973. (At Yale he was a classmate of Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham and Robert Reich, who became the secretary of labor in President Clinton\u2019s administration.)His marriage to the former Alyce Tuttle ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Katherine Ryan, and his second wife, Debra Moskovits.Mr. Fuller was hired as a general assignment reporter by The Tribune in 1973 and left in 1975 to become a special assistant to the United States attorney general, Edward H. Levi, a former president of the University of Chicago. Mr. Levi was credited with restoring the Justice Department\u2019s credibility after Watergate.Mr. Fuller rejoined the newspaper in 1977 as a Washington correspondent. He was named executive editor in 1987, vice president and editor in 1989, publisher in 1994 and president in 1997.Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard and a former editor of The Tribune under Mr. Fuller, praised him for \u201cmaking the newspaper and later Tribune Company healthy environments for women.\u201dMr. Fuller published seven well-received novels on topics ranging from multigenerational tales of Middle America to computer hackers and jazz. Among them are his first, \u201cConvergence\u201d (1982), involving espionage and the C.I.A.; \u201cFragments\u201d (1984), a Vietnam War novel (\u201ca moving account of the war that purveys more than information \u2014 it gives the war a literary form,\u201d The New York Times Book Review said); and \u201cThe Best of Jackson Payne\u201d (2000), about a jazz musician with echoes of John Coltrane. (Beginning in the late 1980s, Mr. Fuller wrote frequently about jazz for The Tribune.)Another novel, \u201cOne From Without,\u201d published this month, is drawn from personal experience: It is about an executive trying to save a public company on the brink of disaster.He also wrote \u201cNews Values: Ideas for an Information Age\u201d (1996) and \u201cWhat Is Happening to News: The Information Explosion and the Crisis in Journalism\u201d (2010).In 2005, Mr. Fuller was named to the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which is based in Chicago. Marjorie Scardino, the foundation\u2019s chairwoman, said on Tuesday that he had driven its grantmaking agenda on global conservation, sustainable development and climate change.Mr. Fuller, she said, insisted that \u201cthere is not \u2018traditional\u2019 journalism and \u2018new\u2019 media, only good journalism and bad journalism.\u201dIn \u201cWhat Is Happening to News,\u201d Mr. Fuller wrote that the Times Mirror purchase was an attempt to compete with the internet on a national scale. He acknowledged that the effort to meld different news media cultures had been difficult, but added that the Tribune Company\u2019s creation of a nationwide web-based classified business had been more successful.Still, competition with online news sites for advertisers and readers, coupled with a business downturn, prompted chief executives at the Tribune Company and other corporate parents to demand even more draconian economies. Rather than impose them, Mr. Fuller, among other editors and publishers, quit.\u201cWhat has happened since I left haunts me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery newspaper company, even those led by people totally committed to striking a proper balance between the financial and social missions of journalism, has been beaten down.\u201cTime and again,\u201d he continued, \u201cpeople arguing about the future of news have made the distinction between what people want to know and what they need to know. If concentrating on what people want to know means succumbing to direct democratic rule of the sort you can find on the internet, it is a retreat too far. It abandons the social mission in order to serve it.\u201dHe added, \u201cFulfilling the social purpose of journalism requires us to give people what they need to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Going Dirty", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisOVER the course of the past two months, Donald J. Trump has assailed Hillary Clinton as \u201ca world-class liar,\u201d suggested that she had a role in the death of a White House aide while Bill Clinton was president, darkly referenced Mr. Clinton\u2019s marital affairs and said \u2014 in a 41-minute rip of a speech on Tuesday \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton had \u201cperfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\u201d Once again, the nation seems to be marching toward another brutally nasty presidential campaign, with Mr. Trump leading the parade.But in a year when so many staples of American politics have faltered \u2014 television advertisements, polling, big-ticket endorsements, to name a few \u2014 will the negative campaign, whether wielded by Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, be the reliable weapon it has proved to be in presidential campaigns over the course of American history? Is there anything left to say about two candidates who are so well known and so polarizing?And Mr. Trump, whom Mrs. Clinton hammered with a series of hard-hitting television advertisements about his temperament over the past week, is in even worse shape in that poll: 70 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him. He has been pelted with damaging information. That did not stop him from sweeping aside a packed Republican field and briefly leading Mrs. Clinton in some national polls.\u201cThis is probably just a different ballgame,\u201d said Deborah J. Brooks, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \u201cIt seems like they are at historically high levels of unfavorable ratings, and they are better known than other candidates. It makes it really hard to compare to past races.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s gone way beyond anything I\u2019ve seen over the past 40 years of campaigns,\u201d said Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution. \u201cCandidates typically worry about a backlash from going negative. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to worry about a backlash.\u201dMost candidates, concerned about voters turning on them for being negative, try to leave the toughest attacks to television advertisements or surrogates, such as a running mate. Not Mr. Trump. He has happily done them himself \u2014 in TV appearances, speeches and tweets. (That said, his anemic campaign finance report released last week suggests that he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for advertisements.)In the process, Mr. Trump has often barged past the boundaries of propriety and truth, and at no apparent cost, at least among his supporters. In recent years, presidential campaigns have made it a practice to release detailed documentation of the charges they make in negative advertisements or speeches: a list of votes, transcripts from interviews, legal documents. Media organizations have become increasingly rigorous in policing advertisements, calling out errors and falsehoods that could prove an unwanted embarrassment for the campaign making the accusation.This has not been the case with Mr. Trump. \u201cYou say, \u2018My opponent did this,\u2019 so you have to provide some evidence that they did something,\u201d said Richard R. Lau, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. \u201cBut Trump doesn\u2019t care what the truth is. Trump has gotten so much free advertising for saying outrageous things.\u201dHis approach, attention-grabbing and arguably entertaining, served him well in the crowded field of a Republican primary. But Mr. Trump is now competing for support among a much broader electorate, and against a candidate who has far more experience in presidential campaigns \u2014 and in being the target of all kinds of attacks.Indeed, many analysts said, there is a strong argument that he is vulnerable to a negative campaign in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. Opinions on Mrs. Clinton seem set in cement at this point; short of her being indicted, it\u2019s hard to imagine information that could dramatically change voters\u2019 opinions of her.By contrast, Mr. Trump may be one of the most famous people on the planet, but his life off the public stage has not received much scrutiny, as became clear with the revelations about Trump University, described by some of its students as a fraud.\u201cWhile people know who Donald Trump is, they do not know a lot about him,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who worked for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign and first presidential campaign. \u201cThere is very little awareness of his business record, or other aspects of his career. I think when a story runs about the number of lawsuits he\u2019s been engaged in or the number of people he\u2019s sued or the number of people he\u2019s stiffed payment, that\u2019s new information.\u201dNegative campaigning, as much as voters say they disapprove of it, tends to work. With its dark and detailed invocations of a candidate\u2019s votes and quotes, a negative campaign can provide voters with the type of information they need to make an informed choice.The most effective attacks portray a candidate as ideologically or culturally alien, unqualified for the job or a threat to national security or the economy.In 2004, President George W. Bush lampooned his Democratic opponent, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, with a video clip of Mr. Kerry in a wet suit that made him appear to be windsurfing back and forth across the water. It made Mr. Kerry seem slightly effete, while reinforcing a central Bush critique of Mr. Kerry\u2019s candidacy: that he was a flip-flopper.Four years later, during the Democratic primary in Texas, Mrs. Clinton broadcast an advertisement showing a young girl sleeping peacefully in bed as a telephone rings in the background at 3 a.m., presumably with bad news. Supporters of Mr. Obama were riled, but it raised legitimate questions about the ability of Mr. Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois, to deal with a breaking foreign crisis.No matter the obstacles, there are powerful incentives for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton to turn to negative campaigning. The sheer volume of attacks churning the political ecosphere \u2014 on Facebook, Twitter and cable news \u2014 means it takes a lot for a candidate to break through. \u201cThe news media love to cover the negativity,\u201d said John G. Geer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University. \u201cAnd the ad people know it.\u201dAnd with their high unfavorable ratings, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have considerable strategic motivation to go on the attack.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager until he was forced out last week, said in an interview before his departure there was still much left to tell voters about the former secretary of state.\u201cLook, if you remember during the first Clinton administration \u2014 when Bill was there \u2014 that was 16 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people forget what he was like as a president, and what his policies were. Particularly new voters. And I think many people overlook what Hillary Clinton\u2019s record was like as United States senator.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t started,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there is an opportunity to remind people that her career in public service goes well beyond secretary of state.\u201dJoel Benenson, who is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior strategist, was similarly bullish on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects for making the case against Mr. Trump. Mr. Benenson said Mr. Trump had largely been spared during the primaries.\u201cThey didn\u2019t take him on,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cThey were running in a primary, they were competing for like-minded voters. You have to draw meaningful contrasts and they didn\u2019t do that.\u2019\u2019\u201cEverything he represents and that he is showing day after day is how dangerous and divisive he is and how that undermines our national security and will crash our economy,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen we make a choice, you want to know the good and bad about who you are considering,\u201d Mr. Geer said. \u201cCandidates will only tell you that they are wonderful.\u201dAdam Nagourney is Los Angeles bureau chief and a former chief national political correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Hillary Clinton, a Risk of Excess Caution in Economic Policy", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWith the threat of terrorism dominating the headlines, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign advisers may not have stuck that slogan to the wall at their headquarters in Brooklyn, as James Carville did for her husband, Bill, in Little Rock, Ark., nearly a quarter-century ago.But they might as well have. For one thing, Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and strong favorite to win the presidential election come November, proposed to draft Mr. Clinton as an economic adviser. Moreover, she has hitched the economic strategy of her presidential bid to the animating principle that defined his presidency: jobs, jobs and more jobs.Her lodestar? The economy of spring 2000, when unemployment reached its lowest level since the inauguration of Richard Nixon 30 years before, and when the real earnings of American households in the middle \u2014 white, black or Hispanic \u2014 achieved a peak that has not been reached again to this day.\u201cYou can aim for a lot of targeted policies in life,\u201d said Gene B. Sperling, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and President Obama, who has offered advice to Mrs. Clinton during her two presidential campaigns. \u201cBut few come close to what you get from tight labor markets.\u201dTrue enough. Her general proposition \u2014 that creating economic conditions in which employers are desperate to attract workers to fill jobs is the best way to improve wages and benefits \u2014 is correct. And with today\u2019s jobless rate still close to 5 percent, who wouldn\u2019t like to see 3.8 percent unemployment?But the mantra that worked in the 1990s is nonetheless ill-matched to the momentous challenges posed by a nation split by vast inequities of income and opportunity; where the very idea of getting ahead has become an abstraction to tens of millions of Americans.\u201cShe needs one or two big ideas that are proportionate to the scale of the problems we are facing,\u201d said Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary during President Clinton\u2019s first term, yet endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. \u201cHer instinct is to be incrementalist.\u201dA big part of the problem is the erosion of America\u2019s working class. It has been hollowed out as trade and technology have done away with most of the well-paid jobs once available to Americans without a college degree, tipping many of them into a service economy of low wages, uncertain hours and little job security.Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals \u2014 such as tax incentives for businesses that share profits with their employees or invest in forlorn bits of the country like Appalachia, or a \u201cclawback\u201d of tax benefits when companies move jobs overseas \u2014 could help.With interest rates near zero, infrastructure amounts to a slam-dunk investment opportunity. Continuing to defer the maintenance of America\u2019s crumbling highways and water systems will certainly be more costly than fixing them now.Still, there is something anachronistic about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s focus.Her turn against the trans-Pacific trade agreement with Asian countries \u2014 a deal she once supported \u2014 makes sense within her overall strategy. Why waste time and political capital on an agreement that might make the economy more efficient but will not create lots of jobs? Still, this does not amount to a strategy about global trade.To be sure, Mrs. Clinton has been pushed to some of these positions by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Their show of force in politically crucial Rust Belt states underscored how important it was to strike a pro-manufacturing, trade-hostile stance.And yet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s careful collection of tweaks and prods is no match for the challenge.That might make her look judicious. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would raise $15.3 trillion in new taxes, mostly to pay for government-financed health care for all. Mr. Trump would cut tax revenue by $9.5 trillion, promising impossible growth in return. But excessive judiciousness can hamstring progress.What about dismissing the deficit scolds who shape the outdated Washington Beltway consensus and borrowing $1 trillion or so to sharply increase the spending on infrastructure, letting states and municipalities select the investments and manage the job?How about taking advantage of the cheapest oil prices in a very long time to propose a carbon tax? Or how about imposing a progressive wealth tax to tap into the good fortune of 160,000 American families at the very tip of the wealth pyramid, who are on their way to pass $12 trillion to the next generation, much of it untaxed.Mrs. Clinton, of course, is not the only candidate indulging in nostalgia. Witness Donald Trump\u2019s bombastic appeal to white working class men uncomfortable in an America where one must dial \u201c1\u201d for English.Still, she has a rare opportunity. If she wins, she may well come into office with the political wind at her back: a Senate returned to Democratic control and a divided Republican Party with only a tenuous hold on the House.Americans have just lived through perhaps the most progressive presidency since the 1960s. President Obama raised tax rates on the rich and expanded health insurance for millions of Americans. Facing stubborn resistance in Congress, he leaned on his executive powers to improve working conditions.Yet the nation\u2019s enormous inequities just got bigger. The income of the richest 1 percent grew 27 percent from 2009 to 2014. The average gain for everybody else barely exceeded 4 percent. A future projected along these lines does not look promising.Bernie Sanders talks about a revolution. Mrs. Clinton might want to try to deliver one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chrysler Hopes New Pacifica Can Make Minivan Cool", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byWheelsFor years, automakers have been stumped by this question: How do you make a minivan seem cool?Adam Silverleib, who has been selling Honda Odyssey minivans for more than 25 years at his dealership in Raynham, Mass., says it is not easy.\u201cThere are not many people who come in and are just dying to buy an Odyssey,\u201d Mr. Silverleib said. \u201cThey buy one because they have four kids and it\u2019s the easiest way to get around, and they bite the bullet, even though they don\u2019t want to be seen in a minivan.\u201dNow Chrysler, which invented the minivan in the 1980s, hopes it has the answer in the Pacifica, a new model that has just started to roll out of a plant in Windsor, Ontario.The Pacifica, which replaces the venerable Town & Country minivan in the Chrysler lineup, has promising attributes, including improved fold-flat seats in the back and high-definition video screens for the children. Its sculptured design softens the most scorned characteristic of any minivan \u2014 the boring, boxy shape. A hybrid model, a first among minivans, will arrive this fall and should go about 80 miles on a gallon of gas, Chrysler said.Beyond that, the Pacifica now has an unexpected, influential fan: Google. As part of its push to develop self-driving cars, the tech giant announced a partnership with Chrysler\u2019s parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, last month. Together they will install Google\u2019s automated driving sensors and computers in about 100 specially modified Pacifica hybrids.Could this give Detroit\u2019s new minivan some Silicon Valley sheen? \u201cHaving this high-profile of Google technology going into the vehicle does give the vehicle a little more forward-looking image,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the auto researcher Edmunds.com. \u201cI imagine, in the short term, it will get a bump in interest.\u201dStill, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Google connection will obliterate the stigma attached to minivans.\u201dSuccess is crucial for Fiat Chrysler. Its minivans are an important source of profit, with its Jeeps and Ram trucks. It cannot afford a misstep with the Pacifica because its small and midsize cars \u2014 the Dodge Dart, the Chrysler 200 and the Fiat line \u2014 have performed poorly. The company spent billions of dollars to develop those cars and retool plants to make them, but sales have been so sluggish that Fiat Chrysler plans to stop making the Dart and 200, and it is allowing dealers to close Fiat showrooms.Even with Google\u2019s help, the Pacifica faces an uphill climb, given the lowly standing minivans have in the automobile market. The minivan was created when Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan in 1983, just as many baby boomers were entering child-rearing years.The minivan\u2019s roominess and the ease of loading children and cargo through its sliding doors revolutionized family travel. Before long, minivans dotted suburban driveways across the country. In 2000, 1.37 million minivans, from more than 15 automotive brands, were sold in the United States \u2014 one-sixth of all new cars sold that year.But by then, minivans had come to symbolize utilitarian drudgery, and Americans began migrating to sport utility vehicles, with their brawnier, more adventurous image. Sales of minivans have declined steadily since. Ford Motor and General Motors stopped making them.In 2015, while total United States auto sales surged to a record high, minivan sales fell 9 percent to 507,217 vehicles, accounting for just 3 percent of the market.Only six manufacturers still produce minivans. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s main competition comes from Honda and Toyota. Nissan, Hyundai and Kia are smaller minivan players.Pacifica\u2019s price ranges from around $29,000 for a basic model to about $44,000 for a fully loaded version, about the same as large S.U.V.s with three rows of seats.For car buyers like Nick Fohr, a hockey coach in Dexter, Mich., weighing a minivan against an S.U.V. is part of the math of a growing family.With two young sons, Mr. Fohr and his wife decided they could no longer get by with her driving a Ford Focus. They really wanted an S.U.V., but last week they traded the Ford for an Odyssey.\u201cWe looked at the space, the ease of getting the kids in and out, the DVD player,\u201d he said. With a laugh, he added, \u201cSo far she likes it, but she\u2019s getting a lot of grief from her friends for having a minivan.\u201dBruce Velisek, director of product marketing for Chrysler vehicles, acknowledges that the company is taking a risk with the Pacifica. Chrysler is retiring the well-known Town & Country name, and going with the name it used for a slow-selling model that was on the market for just five years, from 2004 through 2008.The automaker has also invested heavily in the new minivan. It improved fuel economy by making lightweight doors from aluminum and the liftgate from magnesium, added a noise canceling system to quiet the cabin, built in wireless connectivity for iPads and games and developed a nine-speed transmission.But after years of declining minivan sales, the company is counting on getting a lift from demographics, Mr. Velisek said. The millennial generation, the 83 million Americans born between 1982 and 2000, according to some estimates, outnumbers the baby boomer generation and is now starting families. Mr. Velisek said the number of children 13 and younger is going to rise significantly between now and 2025.\u201cWe think we can win back some people who migrated to S.U.V.s,\u201d he said.There is also the Google effect, something Barbara Rigney has already experienced. A psychologist in Ann Arbor, Mich., she bought a Pacifica in April, one of the first sold \u2014 it came with a bottle of Champagne. She liked the Pacifica\u2019s looks, but her three sons and daughter, all 18 or older, were hoping she would pick something sporty\u201cThey were kind of horrified when they saw I got another minivan,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they heard about the Google thing, they were like: \u2018Oh, I get it. I see why you got that.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanders, the Windows 95 of Progressive Politics?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAs the Democratic primaries came to an end Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton met. Mr. Sanders presumably made a strong case that the ideas and ideological direction of his campaign should be incorporated into her campaign and, if she wins, her presidency.Mr. Sanders\u2019s achievement has been to show the leadership of his recently adopted party that Democrats and many independents under 35 \u2014 that is, those who weren\u2019t adults during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration \u2014 are eager for a full-throated progressive agenda and are unafraid of backlash. While Democrats in the 1990s \u2014 notably Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 worried about the party\u2019s mistakes of the 1970s, many in this decade worry more about triangulation and the cautious politics of the 1990s.What will a post-Sanders progressive agenda look like? The first stop will be the official party platform. But for all the work and squabbling that go into them, platforms have long been throwaway documents.The real progressive agenda will be written over the next few years, either to push the Clinton administration or to shape a challenge to a Republican president and Congress. But it\u2019s unlikely that this new progressive agenda will be Mr. Sanders\u2019s agenda, specifically, or that Mr. Sanders himself will be the leading advocate and arbiter of progressive policies in the way that Senator Edward M. Kennedy once was. Mr. Sanders is still running the Windows 95 version of progressive politics.For one thing, he has never had the kind of influence with his colleagues that he found with the grass roots this year, in part because he never defined himself as a Democrat. No one expects that he\u2019ll run for president again at 78 or 82, so he won\u2019t have the clout of a senator who is seen as a potential president. And any institutional power he may gain as chairman or a ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee sounds a lot bigger than it really is. The committee\u2019s main job is to produce a nonbinding budget resolution, and in many recent years, it hasn\u2019t even done that.But the biggest reason that Mr. Sanders won\u2019t shape the next progressive agenda stems from a little-noticed aspect of his campaign: His policy proposals were consistently out of step with the ideas that have been emerging from progressive think tanks like Demos or the Center for American Progress or championed by his own congressional colleagues.For example, many liberal Democrats would agree with Mr. Sanders, in theory, that single-payer health insurance could be fairer, more efficient and cheaper than our fragmented system. But the president and Congress made the decision in 2010 to build on the private insurance system, in the form of the Affordable Care Act, in part because single-payer wasn\u2019t politically viable. A Democratic administration\u2019s next moves will be to expand and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not start over.Like many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy proposals, single-payer is an all-or-nothing proposition that creates few openings for legislators who want to do something incremental that could lead to a bigger goal. Congressmen like Senator Kennedy or Representative Henry Waxman of California often put forward ambitious ideas, too, but with manageable steps to build a structure that could be expanded later or that could attract enough support to pass.Mr. Sanders\u2019s achievement in 2016 deserves respect: He has been the first insurgent Democratic candidate to emerge from the true left of the party since the Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s two campaigns in the 1980s, and by far the most successful. That success points the way toward a new and more vigorous progressive agenda.But he\u2019s shown in his campaign that he\u2019s unlikely to be the agent who fills in the details of that agenda. No doubt Senator Warren, with her ever-widening vision of economic fairness, will play a Kennedy-like role, whether she remains in the Senate or becomes Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate.Other Democratic senators, some almost as young as the Sanders enthusiasts, will play their part, as will outside organizations. If elected, Hillary Clinton will either join this new progressive wave or will be nudged and challenged by it. As Mr. Sanders finally steps back, the next era can begin.Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.Advertisement"}

They were referring to the humanitarian aid that Turkey plans to deliver to the Palestinian coastal enclave under the deal, and the promise of new residential buildings, a 200-bed hospital and infrastructure projects.As Turkish officials hailed the deal as a diplomatic victory, rivals of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel from the left and right called him to task.Gideon Saar, a former minister from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party, described the compensation as \u201ca national humiliation.\u201d Isaac Herzog, the leader of the center-left Zionist Union, called it \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d and criticized what he called the \u201cindifference and disregard\u201d shown toward the families of those missing in Gaza.\u201cThe world is in turmoil, the Middle East is in turmoil and my policy is to create centers of stability in this unstable and stormy region,\u201d he said in remarks broadcast live on Israeli television.The deal, Mr. Netanyahu said, will protect Israeli commanders and soldiers from criminal and civil claims by the Turkish government and victims, and it will allow Israel to maintain its naval blockade of Hamas in Gaza despite a Turkish demand for it to be removed. Turkey agreed to deliver goods for Gaza through the Israeli port of Ashdod.In addition, he said, the deal provided an opening for lucrative projects like the marketing of Israel\u2019s natural gas reserves to Turkey, and via Turkey to Europe.Mr. Netanyahu said that he could \u201cwithstand this criticism\u201d of those who complained of humiliation and the abandonment of those missing in Gaza, adding, \u201cI understand the suffering of the families.\u201dIn Ankara, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said, \u201cNormalization covers a variety of areas, but economic relations and regional cooperation will take place first.\u201d He said that a ship carrying 10,000 tons of humanitarian aid bound for Gaza would leave for Ashdod on Friday.Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Mr. Netanyahu in Rome on Sunday and Monday, said that Washington had encouraged the reconciliation between Israel and Turkey, two important allies of the United States. \u201cThis is a step we wanted to see happen,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.The deal comes as Israel and Turkey face tough challenges stemming from the meltdown of Syria and other states in the region.\u201cRenormalization of the relationship is more about security than energy,\u201d said Brenda Shaffer, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council research institute\u2019s Global Energy Center in Washington.Experts said they did not anticipate a return to the intimate alliance of past decades, when the navies of Israel, Turkey and the United States carried out joint exercises in the Mediterranean, and Israeli fighter jets trained in Turkish airspace.In Gaza, there was a sense that the deal offered some hope but fell short of what Hamas wanted. \u201cThey might not have lifted the blockade on Gaza, but at least they will ease restrictions,\u201d said Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to the Hamas leader Ismail Haniya.For many Israelis, who have fond memories of vacations at Turkey\u2019s coastal resorts, which attracted up to half a million Israeli tourists a year before the diplomatic rift, the fallout from the diplomatic deal was more emotional.The family of the second soldier killed in a different battle during the war in Gaza, Staff Sgt. Oron Shaul, set up a protest tent outside Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem.\u201cTwo years is enough time to show progress,\u201d said Racheli Gazit, a cousin of Sergeant Shaul, as she handed out stickers bearing the soldier\u2019s picture and got passers-by to sign a petition.

{"Headline": "Brexit Would Be a Colossal Blunder", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byBARI, Italy \u2014 The prospect that Britain might next week commit an act of national folly by voting to leave the European Union has politicians throughout Europe alarmed. Integration has been the Continent\u2019s leitmotif for more than six decades. Fracture would suddenly be underway. And what would be left?\u201cIf a British withdrawal were seen by Germany as opening the way to govern Europe as a Germanic federation, the European Union will fall apart,\u201d Michele Emiliano, the president of the southern Puglia region, told me in an interview. \u201cEurope can only function as a union of equal states. Under German dominion, it would contain the genes of its dissolution.\u201dGermany has already become what the postwar strategic architecture of Europe was designed to prevent: the Continent\u2019s most powerful nation. But Britain, through the size of its economy, has played an offsetting role. Absent Britain, Germany would loom larger still, a source of alarm to the economically weaker Mediterranean states.Postwar Italy was fragile, torn between the West and Communism, between \u201cscaling the Alps\u201d and succumbing to the Mafia-suffused inertia of the south, or mezzogiorno. European Union membership was the country\u2019s anchor and magnet, securing it in the free and democratic Western family, luring it toward prosperity. Now that role is played most conspicuously for newer members of the union. But its importance persists.Emiliano, a former mafia-combating public prosecutor, heads a region that is its own tribute to the union\u2019s quiet miracles. Puglia, long a languishing part of the chronically underdeveloped south, is now an area of fast-growing industry and tourism, the poster child of the generally depressed mezzogiorno. Like other outlying regions of the E.U., it has been slowly tugged through stability toward the living standards of the European core.In a Facebook post, Martin Fletcher, a former foreign editor of The Times of London, put these European Union achievements well. \u201cContrary to the cartoon caricature of the E.U. we read about in the national press,\u201d he wrote, the union \u201chas cemented peace in Europe. It allows younger generations to live and work anywhere in Europe in a way my generation could only dream about. It has vastly simplified travel across the Continent. It has brought Eastern Europe into the family of free, democratic nations after decades of Soviet control. It has broken up powerful monopolies and cartels in a way national governments acting alone could not. It has forced member states to clean up the environment.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe would be willfully removing ourselves from a single market of 500 million people without the faintest idea whether, or on what terms, we would be allowed to continue trading with 27 E.U. states who would want to punish us. Why on earth would we take such a monumental risk?\u201dThe answer is that this huge gamble would be taken for the chimera of restored \u201csovereignty.\u201d It would reflect petulant nationalism, base bigotry and laughable little England pretensions. Fletcher expressed the reality behind all this with laconic bluntness: \u201cAs a single country we would have minimal influence on world affairs. Does anyone seriously think the prospect of British sanctions would alarm Vladimir Putin, or have persuaded Iran to curtail its nuclear program?\u201dThe European Union has significant failings, many of them precipitated by the sudden end of the Cold War, the reach to embrace states formerly enslaved in Moscow\u2019s imperium, and the flawed attempt to contain a united Germany by integrating it into a common currency called the euro. It is, as an overarching European structure, short on democracy and long on bureaucracy. But, as Italy\u2019s postwar development demonstrates, its achievements far outweigh its problems, which Britain could play a leading role in addressing.\u201cPolitics is about seizing the moment, interpreting what history has given you the responsibility to do,\u201d Emiliano told me. \u201cThanks to the Americans who landed on Sicilian beaches, I have the freedom to speak and you the freedom to write. I never forget this. If politics is not about respecting the past to secure the future, it is merely a mirror you gaze in, a form of narcissism.\u201dSuch narcissism is rampant in Britain and America these days. For Britain to succumb to its delusions and leave the union would be a colossal blunder of historic proportions.When in Italy, I often think of my late uncle, Bert Cohen, who, as an officer of the 6th South African Armored Division, 19th Field Ambulance, fought the entire Italian campaign, moving up the peninsula from south to north. After the Allied victory, he visited Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps, on September 2, 1945, and went up to Hitler\u2019s mountain retreat, the Eagle\u2019s Nest. He etched his name on the F\u00fchrer\u2019s table. What sweet retribution to have \u201cCohen\u201d inscribed there!Later, he made his life in Britain \u2014 the home of a freedom that, to him, was not insular but European and universal. To vote out would also betray that inscription and all it stands for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Techno Elders, Aging Gracefully in a Youth-Oriented Genre", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byThe pair used Movement, over the Memorial Day weekend, to mark the live debut in the United States of \u201cTransport,\u201d the second album they recently released under the name Borderland. Over Skype in April, Mr. von Oswald called the LP an \u201caura event,\u201d a high-profile and often meditative reunion between two artists, whose relationship stretches back to before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It also poses a question: In a dance-music bazaar often driven by shiny musical thrills, mass market-oriented festivals and nighttime party economies, is there room for the ruminations of elder statesmen?\u201cIt is this image of an aging wine,\u201d said Dimitri Hegemann, founder of the influential Berlin club and record label Tresor, in a phone interview. He has known Mr. Atkins and Mr. von Oswald since their shared beginning and encouraged the two to record together again. \u201cThe young wine serves its purpose, but the older wine, when the plants are 80, 90 years old, it is better in a different, more profound way. This quality comes through. It\u2019s very peaceful.\u201dIn a phone interview from his Detroit home a week before Movement, Mr. Atkins said that he met Mr. von Oswald around 1988 or \u201989, explaining that the German musician came to Detroit along with his colleagues Thomas Fehlmann and Mark Ernestus (Mr. von Oswald\u2019s future partner in Basic Channel, the duo whose dub-heavy, minimal techno set a blueprint for the Berlin sound). \u201cThey went to all the pawn shops to buy up the analog gear \u2014 old ARP Odysseys, ARP Axxes, early drum machines, things like that.\u201d Eventually, they knocked on the door of a house Mr. Atkins was sharing with Mike Banks, the co-founder of Underground Resistance, a Detroit techno collective central to the ensuing dialogue.Mr. Atkins was already worth seeking out. He had been developing Detroit\u2019s new electronic sound since 1981: first, with Rik Davis, in the electro duo Cybotron, and after, under pseudonyms such as Model 500 and Channel One for his own label, Metroplex (initiating techno\u2019s ethos of aliases, of independence from the traditional music industry and of complete creative control).Mr. von Oswald also came with credentials. A classically trained percussionist, he had recently departed Palais Schaumburg, the Hamburg-based avant-garde band that helped start the career of, among others, FM Einheit (later the founder of seminal noise band Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten). He had just moved to Berlin to start making electronic music.By 1991, when Mr. Atkins took up an invitation to be a D.J. at Tresor and record with Mr. Fehlmann and Mr. von Oswald (credited to 3MB or Three Men in Berlin), Detroit artists were establishing a beachhead in the city \u2014 and deeply influencing its sound and vision. Mr. Atkins said that there was environmental empathy between the newly unified European capital with its vast postwar ruins and the Midwestern metropolis in postindustrial decay: \u201cI think the similarities made each of us feel comfortable in the other\u2019s city.\u201dFor much of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, the creative exchange between the cities was unrelenting, anchored by steady collaborations between Mr. von Oswald and Mr. Atkins, and others around the Tresor camp. At the same time, the music grew from being an underground phenomenon into what is now a global culture. \u201cSometimes I am really amazed how far my stuff got,\u201d Mr. von Oswald said.Yet, while both artists continued experimenting \u2014 \u201cForward ever, backward never,\u201d Mr. von Oswald said, quoting an old Jacob Miller reggae tune when asked for his creative mantra \u2014 the scene around them increasingly codified. Much of it has become a business aimed at the young, with techno tourism around the European Union (especially in Berlin and on the Mediterranean island Ibiza, Spain), Las Vegas and festivals across the world becoming the engines of its economy. Respect for techno\u2019s originators has remained unabated, but for many, the depth and tonality of their music aged in a way the mass audience did not.Everyone agrees that the recent collaboration \u2014 kicked off with a single 2012 session in Berlin that yielded much of Borderland\u2019s debut \u2014 was Mr. Hegemann\u2019s idea.\u201cI saw that my job was bringing together two personalities whose work I really admire, but have not worked together in a long time,\u201d he said, recalling that he told them: \u201c\u2018We are now in our 50s, not 22; half of life is behind us. You did all this work, you have this experience, you don\u2019t have to write a hit or anything, you can just concentrate on contributing to this old, historical connection between Detroit and Berlin.\u2019\u201d To his surprise, \u201cthey both agreed.\u201dThe duo said that the ease of their working relationship was the mutual regard built over many years: \u201cWe have a knack for going after and bouncing off each other\u2019s ideas,\u201d Mr. Atkins said.Mr. von Oswald added: \u201cIf he plays a bass line, I know what to do with the rhythm or the strings. It\u2019s not that complicated.\u201dWhere in retrospect Mr. von Oswald described Borderland\u2019s first album as \u201cstiff,\u201d \u201cTransport\u201d is \u201cmore full, more complex.\u201d At Mr. Atkins\u2019 insistence, it was partially recorded at his Detroit studio, \u201cto add more of the Detroit flavor, atmosphere into the music, as opposed to just my essence.\u201d The resulting track, \u201cRiod,\u201d is among the album\u2019s deeper, dubbier numbers, and the first one completed, setting the stage for an LP that sounds at once classic and thoroughly contemporary \u2014 full of propulsion, repetition and, at times, darkly ambient mystery, but nary a drop or a vocal in sight.Mr. Atkins cited a desire for a broader audience only in so much as \u201cto offer people alternatives,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about being relevant.\u201dAs for aging in what can at times seem like a youthful blood sport both on the dance floor and in the D.J. booth, Mr. von Oswald simply laughs it off: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who say, \u2018Never grow old,\u2019 but this is no problem for me.

The official declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.Mr. Ri\u2019s remarks were made during a meeting with Song Tao, who heads the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party in Beijing.Although the byungjin policy was hardly new, the meeting between Mr. Ri and Mr. Song was significant in that North Korea formally told China through a high-level governmental channel that it had no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons program.The news agency quoted Mr. Song as saying that the Chinese Communist Party and government supported North Korea\u2019s pursuit of \u201ca path to development that suits its reality.\u201d It did not specify what Mr. Song had said about the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.The visit left open the question of whether President Xi Jinping, who also serves as secretary general of the party, would agree to see him.But the former Chinese official said he thought it unlikely that Mr. Xi would meet with the North Korean visitor.Mr. Kim may have ordered Tuesday\u2019s missile test to coincide with Mr. Ri\u2019s visit, as a way of signaling to the Chinese that he would continue to cause trouble if Beijing did not help North Korea, according to Evans J.

{"Headline": "A Lesson From \u2018Brexit\u2019: On Immigration, Feelings Trump Facts", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThis was pretty much what financial analysts had predicted. And it is clear from polling data and interviews with voters that those who voted for \u201cBrexit\u201d had been well warned about the economic risks. They just cared more about something else: immigration.Most research has found that immigration has bolstered the British economy. But voters supporting the Leave campaign either were unpersuaded by the evidence, did not think it had benefited them or felt the downsides outweighed the upsides.Brexit is not just a blow to the British economy, but also strikes at a core assumption behind the modern liberal order: that voters will act in their self-interest.The progress of the last 50 years, particularly in Europe, has made it easy to buy into the idea that the forces of nationalism, xenophobia and prejudice are mere irrationalities, market distortions that will naturally fade away in the long arc of history.Last week\u2019s vote highlighted \u2014 not for the first time, but with unusual clarity \u2014 the hole in that theory. For many people, identity trumps economics. They will pay a high price (literally, in this case) to preserve a social order that makes them feel safe and powerful.That dynamic is not limited to Britain, or to this referendum. It is playing out in democracies around the world, and immigration has become its focal point.Many citizens, particularly those who have suffered under the economic pressures of globalization, express their anxiety over these changes by focusing on another form of change: foreigners in their midst. Halting immigration, even if the actual effect is to worsen their own economic situation, seems like a way of staving off those larger changes.Democratic governments have shown over and over that they have no answer for this anxiety, even as the stakes, in Europe and globally, continue mounting.The economist Michael Clemens has called immigration a \u201ctrillion-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk\u201d: a tremendous increase in wealth waiting to be seized by any country that is attractive to immigrants and willing to welcome them. Loosening restrictions on global labor flows, he argues, would offer a bigger boost to global economies than would dropping all restrictions on trade and capital.But evidence does not vote \u2014 people do. And it turns out that the gains of immigration often feel elusive, whereas the costs can be perceived as heavier than they really are.This suggests that economic anxiety might be expressed as anti-immigration sentiment even by Britons who have not lost jobs to foreigners.\u201cYou tend to see anti-immigrant sentiment in areas hit by changing economic circumstances or global crises,\u201d said Alexandra Cirone, a fellow at the London School of Economics. \u201cFraming this globalization problem as immigration can also tug on the heartstrings of potential voters, regardless of the actual facts.\u201dSo why do people take their economic anxiety out on faceless foreigners? The right answer is probably the simplest one: Immigrants do change their new countries in a million tiny but noticeable ways, even if taking local jobs may not be one of them. Those changes can still be unsettling, even though many changes are undeniably positive.For people who are already destabilized by economic strain, those social changes contribute to a feeling that something precious is being lost, that their country is turning away from the things they value and toward a new and unfamiliar future.That phenomenon is hardly limited to Britain. In the United States, net immigration from Mexico has been at zero since 2010, but Republican primary voters still cheered Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the southern border as though it would solve whatever was worrying them.Brian Klaas, also a fellow at the London School of Economics, said there were many parallels between supporters of Mr. Trump and the U.K. Independence Party, a prime backer of Brexit.Both might be \u201ca working-class person who has felt completely dislocated and left behind by the global economy,\u201d Mr. Klaas said. \u201cBoth feel that they have been left behind by globalization, and they have both determined that the problem is not just immigration, but also a shadowy government bureaucracy far away.\u201dIn Australia, rising anti-immigration sentiment has focused especially on refugees who arrive via Southeast Asia, often disparaged as \u201cboat people.\u201d The country\u2019s leadership, under growing popular pressure, created a system of offshore detention centers to warehouse them indefinitely rather than allow them onto Australian shores. These centers have been accused of abuses including rape, assault and child sexual abuse.Anti-immigrant backlash can play out in several ways. Immigrants may experience xenophobic attacks or be endangered by legal limbo. But the consequences can also be much broader.A relatively new body of social science research portrays a group of \u201cauthoritarians\u201d who are dispersed across demographics but desire conformity, order and social norms. These can be \u201cactivated,\u201d as the scholars describe it, when they feel threatened by social change, and then will seek harsh, punitive policies that target outsiders and restore the status quo.In other words, social change and economic stress \u2014 exactly what many pro-Brexit communities have been experiencing in recent years \u2014 often lead to a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.Globalization is not going away, and neither are the changes that it brings, including the rise in migration and the division of societies into economic winners and losers. The turmoil created by Brexit may itself become the source of more change, more stress, more instability.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Britain voted on a referendum on whether to leave the European Union. It was Thursday, not Friday.Advertisement"}

While describing the May jobs report as \u201cconcerning,\u201d she also emphasized that it was just one piece of data and that other economic indicators, including wage growth, paint a considerably brighter picture.\u201cI see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones,\u201d she told the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.Investors have all but written off the chances the Fed will increase rates at its next meeting on June 14 and 15, and Ms. Yellen did not try to change their minds. Her speech was the last public appearance by a Fed official before the meeting.But she added that she still expected economic growth \u2014 and she still expected rate increases.\u201cIf incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate,\u201d she said.Some Fed officials have delivered a similar message since the May report.Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has sounded relatively confident in recent months, indicating that the economy was ready for a rate increase. In Stockholm on Saturday, she said that the May jobs report, while disappointing, had not changed her overall economic assessment.Others have emphasized that there is no reason to rush, suggesting that the Fed should wait for stronger data before moving to raise rates.\u201cThere would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence,\u201d Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech on Friday. In her judgment, Ms. Brainard said, the risks of moving too soon significantly exceeded the dangers of waiting a little too long.Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor who shares Ms. Brainard\u2019s caution, said on Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg that he was still looking for \u201can affirmative reason to move.\u201dThe government estimated last week that the economy added 38,000 jobs in May, well below market expectations and the pace of hiring so far this year.The Fed entered the year predicting quarterly rate increases, only to back away from a first increase in March when the economy showed unexpected signs of weakness. Fed officials in recent weeks insisted they were thinking about raising rates in June. Now it seems that too has passed.Ms. Yellen did not offer a new plan, and that was intentional.\u201cI know market participants really want to know exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cThere is, as I said about 18 times, no preset plan.\u201dShe devoted much of her speech to the economic uncertainties confronting the Fed. Among them, she numbered the inconsistency of recent economic data and Britain\u2019s coming referendum on whether to remain in the European Union. She said a breakup would be economically disruptive.\u201cThe uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve,\u201d she said.But reasons for optimism were also on display Monday.After her speech, Ms. Yellen met with workers at a job-training program in West Philadelphia. During her first year as Fed chairwoman, round tables with workers in Chicago and Chelsea, Mass., brought together many attendees who were struggling to find jobs. The tone of Monday\u2019s round table was notably more upbeat \u2014 the seven people who met with Ms. Yellen all had jobs or, if they were in training programs, were optimistic about finding steady work.Mark Gay spent nearly two years looking for full-time work before he found a job with a landscaping business run by the University City District, the nonprofit group that hosted the meeting. Asked whether life was improving for people in his West Philadelphia neighborhood, he paused before answering.\u201cI would have to agree,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, a lot of people in my community have gained employment since 2012.\u201dSarah Davis, director of development for University City District, says its jobs-training program has about 110 graduates a year. She said the percentage of those finding jobs has climbed steadily over the last five years to about 95 percent, and demand from potential employers now exceeds the supply of workers the program can offer. \u201cWe\u2019re getting daily calls from potential employer partners,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Yet Ms. Yellen noted in her speech that unemployment remained widespread among minorities and lesser-educated people. There were also signs the labor market is no longer healing as quickly. The economy has added 125,000 jobs per month this year, compared with a monthly average of 229,000 last year.The Fed\u2019s in-house labor market conditions index, devised to summarize a wide range of labor market data, has declined each month since the Fed raised interest rates in December.\u201cThe Fed\u2019s current course is driven not by the state of the economy, but by a desire to get interest rates and its balance sheet back to what is considered normal,\u201d Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wrote in a Bloomberg opinion piece last week criticizing the Fed\u2019s desire to raise rates.Ms. Yellen responded indirectly to that critique during a question-and-answer session after her speech on Monday. She said the Fed was focused on its mandates of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation. Raising rates was not an end but a means, she said.She noted that the economy should benefit from a virtuous loop of increased employment and rising incomes. \u201cIf the May labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth should pick up and support further gains in income,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.On the other hand, she noted, \u201cthe less favorable possibility\u201d was that a slowdown in corporate investment had translated into a slowdown in job growth. How long will it take to tell the difference? On Monday, Ms. Yellen wasn\u2019t offering any predictions. \u201cMy colleagues and I will be wrestling with these and other related questions going forward,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Rattles Postwar Order and Its Place as Pillar of Stability", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byAccompanied by an upending of politics and middle-class assumptions in both the developed and the developing worlds, these forces are combining as never before to challenge the Western institutions and alliances that were established after World War II and that have largely held global sway ever since.Britain has been a pillar in that order, as well as a beneficiary. It has an important (some would argue outsize) place in the United Nations, and a role in NATO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2014 the postwar institutions invested with promoting global peace, security and economic prosperity.Now Britain symbolizes the cracks in that postwar foundation. Its leaving the European Union weakens a bloc that is the world\u2019s biggest single market, as well as an anchor of global democracy. It also undermines the postwar consensus that alliances among nations are essential in maintaining stability and in diluting the nationalism that once plunged Europe into bloody conflict \u2014 even as nationalism is surging again.The symbolism was pointed in China on Saturday morning, two days after the British vote. In the packed ballroom of a Beijing hotel, China\u2019s new international development bank held its first meeting of the 57 countries that have signed up as members. The new institution, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, is designed to give China a chance to win influence away from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\u201cHistory has never set any precedent,\u201d the new bank\u2019s president, Jin Liqun, once wrote of the United States and its Western allies, \u201cthat an empire is capable of governing the world forever.\u201dEven as European leaders held a flurry of meetings on Saturday to weigh a response to Britain\u2019s departure, President Xi Jinping of China welcomed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to Beijing for a brief state visit. More than China, Russia is an outlier to the American-led international system, and Mr. Putin \u2014 at best a wary partner of China, which itself has severe economic challenges \u2014 in recent years has worked to divide and destabilize Europe.Russia has nurtured discord inside the European Union by supporting an array of small, extremist political parties that foment nationalist anger in different countries. Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and meddling in eastern Ukraine directly challenged the rules-based international system of respecting national borders and led to a continuing political confrontation with the United States and Europe.The end of Pax Americana is not a new theme. Predictions of American decline were rampant after the global economic crisis in 2007 and 2008, amid parallel predictions of the dawning of a new Chinese century.But the American economy steadily recovered, if imperfectly, while China has unnerved many of its Asian neighbors with a newly aggressive foreign policy. Chinese overreach opened a path for renewed American engagement in Asia, the fastest-growing region in the world, as President Obama called for a \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia.Analysts disagree on whether this pivot signaled a declining American interest in European affairs and contributed to the Continent\u2019s current problems. Part of the Obama administration\u2019s rationale was to extricate the United States from decades of costly involvement in the Middle East at a time when that region was in upheaval.There, the breakdown of the postwar political order has been more fundamental and violent than in Europe. The uprisings of the Arab Spring erupted from widespread frustrations with stagnant, autocratic politics and economic lethargy. But these rebellions failed to yield stable governments, and the borders drawn by Europeans a century ago in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq have been rendered largely irrelevant.The nationalism surging in Europe is not the problem in the Arab world; rather, populations have retreated into greater reliance on sects, ethnic groups and militias. Jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have fought national armies and won, providing a religious alternative to the nation-state that has been embraced by some.Bassel Salloukh, an associate professor of political science at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, said the problems in the Middle East and Europe shared a common origin in the anxieties caused by tectonic shifts in the global economy. But while fear and frustration in the West have shown themselves through democratic elections, brittle Arab states lacked the flexibility to respond.\u201cHere, we have hyper-centralized, homogeneous, authoritarian states which, when facing these transformations, just exploded,\u201d Mr. Salloukh said.And those explosions were not contained within the Middle East. Refugees have poured out of Syria and Iraq. Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have absorbed several million refugees. But it is the flow of people into the European Union that has had the greatest geopolitical impact, and helped to precipitate the British vote. Stabilizing Syria and permanently curbing the refugee flow could be one of the critical factors in determining whether Europe can steady itself politically.Before the refugee crisis, the European Union was already an unwieldy and unfinished entity. Its contradictions and imperfections were exacerbated by the economic crisis. Yet it was the onset of more than a million refugees marching through Greece and the Balkans toward Germany that may ultimately prove to be the most destabilizing event in Europe\u2019s recent history.European countries erected border fences despite the bloc\u2019s system of open internal borders. Populist parties raged against immigrants. Britain was relatively insulated, yet British politicians campaigning to leave the European Union depicted an island under siege, mixing the very different issue of immigration from other European Union states with the perceived threat from an influx of poor Muslims. This anti-immigrant strain twinned with the economic anxieties of many Britons who felt left out of the global economy to drive support for the country going its own way.In the wake of Britain\u2019s choice, Europe faces the parallel challenges of holding itself together and of retaining its global influence.NATO has rediscovered its purpose in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. Yet the Baltic countries still worry whether the military alliance would truly defend them against Russian aggression, and the alliance has had trouble defining its role in fighting terrorism or dealing with the migrant flow.\u201cBritain leaving the E.U. now poses a challenge for Germany,\u201d said Nicholas Burns, a former top American diplomat who now teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cIt will need to provide even greater leadership to keep Europe united and moving forward.\u201dGermany, though, has been reluctant to play a diplomatic and military role commensurate with its economic heft. Ever mindful of its Nazi past, and its four decades as a divided country, Germany often wraps its policies in the mantle of Europe and has developed a pacifist instinct that is a poor fit with the expectations that it must now lead.\u201cThere is no point beating about the bush,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Friday. Europe has reached \u201ca turning point,\u201d and \u201cmore and more often, we encounter basic doubts\u201d about ever-greater union.The markers of European decline are not hard to find. For the first time in modern history, Asia has more private wealth than Europe, the Boston Consulting Group said last year. And China will account for 70 percent of Asia\u2019s growth between now and 2019, the group said.China\u2019s development of its own international bank partly derives from its frustrations over its role in the I.M.F. Policy makers in Beijing were infuriated that they were not granted a bigger share of power at the I.M.F. as a show of gratitude for helping stabilize world economies in 2008.Many Asian leaders have tended to view the European experiment at unity as a proposition that could not last. Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore, once called the European Union a motley crowd trying to march to a single drummer. He predicted it would fail.Jim Yardley and Alison Smale reported from London, Jane Perlez from Beijing, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon. Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Makes Dire Predictions for Economy if Donald Trump Wins", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Hillary Clinton pounded away on Tuesday at Donald J. Trump\u2019s business record and economic proposals, seeking to turn his claims of astounding financial success and genius against him and predicting a recession and global panic if he is elected president.In a stern but earnest-sounding 45-minute speech at an education center garage here, Mrs. Clinton took care to intermingle the policy proclamations of Mr. Trump and his professed image as a business success of the highest order.\u201cDonald Trump has said he\u2019s qualified to be president because of his business record,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cA few days ago he said \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m going to do for the country what I did for my business.\u2019 So let\u2019s take a look.\u201dThough she leveled predictable blows against various Trump-branded products, noting that many items \u2014 Trump ties, Trump steaks, Trump furniture \u2014 were made outside the United States, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most pointed refrains sought to depict Mr. Trump, her presumptive Republican opponent, as an enemy to the very people he had claimed to champion in the primary.Mrs. Clinton invoked her father, who owned a small drapery business in Chicago, as she described Mr. Trump\u2019s history of failing to pay painters, waiters, plumbers and other contractors who had completed work for him.\u201cMy late father was a small-businessman,\u201d she said. \u201cIf his customers had done what Trump did, my dad would never have made it. So I take this personally.\u201dShe added, \u201cThis is not normal behavior.\u201dAlthough polls often show that voters see Mrs. Clinton as more qualified than Mr. Trump on foreign policy, her economic views have not always been an easy sell. In the Democratic primary race, she was dogged by criticism of her support for trade deals struck during the administrations of her husband and President Obama.The Trump campaign, which has seldom engaged in rapid response, also sent a barrage of news releases to reporters in an effort to undercut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arguments. Their subjects included Bill Clinton\u2019s former position on the board of a for-profit college, the loss of manufacturing jobs since 1993 and a slew of negative headlines about economic indicators under President Obama.In one Twitter post, Mr. Trump seemed to embrace a label Mrs. Clinton had tried to make stick: that he had referred to himself as the \u201cking of debt.\u201dMrs. Clinton had taken Mr. Trump to task for suggesting that the United States might default on its debts under his leadership, arguing that Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, \u201cwould be rolling in his grave.\u201d\u201cThe full faith and credit of the United States is not something you just gamble away,\u201d she said, predicting that because the global economy \u201changs on every word our president says,\u201d even raising the possibility of a default \u201cwould cause a global panic.\u201dAt one point, she ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could \u201csell off America\u2019s assets\u201d if necessary.\u201cEven if we sold all our aircraft carriers and the Statue of Liberty, even if we let some billionaire turn Yosemite into a private country club,\u201d she said, \u201cwe still wouldn\u2019t even get close.\u201dMrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Trump on several other issues, including immigration and pay equality for women. She also ridiculed Mr. Trump for saying that climate change was a \u201choax invented by the Chinese,\u201d noting that it was \u201ca lot easier to say a problem doesn\u2019t exist than it is to actually try to solve it.\u201d\u201cWhat ever happened to Trump Airlines?\u201d Mr. Romney asks in one excerpt, taken from a speech he made in March that struck a similar tone to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s.In her next scheduled public appearance, on Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C., Mrs. Clinton is expected to shift to a more positive message, outlining her vision for what she has labeled a \u201cgrowth and fairness economy.\u201d Her plans include increasing the minimum wage, closing tax loopholes that encourage companies to move jobs overseas and expanding benefits for working families.Mrs. Clinton quoted from the report during her speech. But moments before her remarks, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign emailed reporters, noting Mr. Zandi\u2019s ties to Democrats. He has donated to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.As she wrapped up, Mrs. Clinton reiterated a campaign theme \u2014 \u201cStronger Together\u201d \u2014 that has become more prominent in recent weeks, and argued that Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves in the worst of us\u201d and cannot be trusted at the controls.Mr. Trump still seemed to be watching.Matt Flegenheimer reported from Columbus, and Amy Chozick from New York.Advertisement"}

America equals opportunity, entrepreneurship and success. That\u2019s not true in so many places anymore.\u201dIf T.P.P. falls apart, China wins. It\u2019s as simple as that. Nonratification would signal that Beijing gets to dictate policy in the region, and the attempt to integrate Vietnam comprehensively in a rules-based international economy fails.What the agreement will do, as Clinton noted when she backed the deal, is deliver \u201cbetter jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others.\u201d It obliges countries like Vietnam to allow workers to form independent unions; it requires a minimum wage and higher health standards; it bans child labor and forced labor. It binds Vietnam to countries where the rule of law is arbiter rather than authoritarian diktat.China and India, of course, are not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Developed economies face huge problems that have produced this season of rage.

{"Headline": "Central Banks Worry About Engaging World Markets After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAs global markets reel after an establishment-rattling vote by Britain to sever ties with Europe, investors are again expecting central banks to ride to the rescue.And that may be the problem.Or so believe a number of investors and economists who worry that another round of central bank intervention in the markets will compound the sense of alienation, frustration and anger at global elites that encouraged a majority of Britons to opt for leaving the European Union.Traditionally, market participants have tended to cheer central bank activism.In times of financial panic, wholesale bond buying, negative interest rates and disbursing cash directly to consumers (the yet-to-be-deployed weapon in the central banker\u2019s armory) have been seen as easy policy substitutes for governments unwilling or incapable of taking action themselves.But, as the world\u2019s leading central bankers finished a weekend of brainstorming in Basel, Switzerland, as to what their next move might be, some feared that this time around they might do more harm than good.\u201cPeople say that central bankers have not done enough, but they have done too much already,\u201d said Stephen Jen, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund in London.But the British referendum results and the sharp fall in the markets that followed brought an extra urgency to the two-day meeting.On Saturday, Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank and chairman of the bank\u2019s policy group that monitors the global financial system, said that committee members had \u201cendorsed the contingency measures put in place by the Bank of England and emphasized the preparedness of central banks to support the proper functioning of financial markets.\u201dAdding to global political tensions were parliamentary elections on Sunday in Spain, where the anti-austerity left-wing party Podemos was expected to continue its recent run of electoral success.While the sell-off in stocks on Friday was very sharp, market participants said over the weekend that they were heartened that major market makers were able to absorb the selling fairly well.Playing a central role were exchange-traded funds, which at one point on Friday accounted for close to 50 percent of overall trading volume in stocks. That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the funds were largely unknown a decade ago as an investment option for investors.The ability for investors to quickly and successfully buy and sell stocks and bonds, the crucial advantage that exchange-traded funds have over mutual funds, is seen by regulators as critical in times of acute financial stress.Part of the conundrum for central bankers is that the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like Lehman Brothers going bankrupt in September 2008, which provided authorities with an unassailable excuse to intervene. Lehman\u2019s failure caused markets to seize up and financial institutions to stop dealing with each other.But when the crises that rock global finance are social and political, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend any form of extraordinary intervention.And that is what worries analysts, who for some time now have been concerned that interventions by central banks were distorting markets by making them less liquid and creating anomalies such as what currently exists in Japan.There, the nation\u2019s central bank owns 34 percent of the country\u2019s government bonds and is one of the top 10 shareholders in 90 percent of the companies listed on the stock exchange, according to data from Bloomberg.\u201cCentral banks have done everything to jury-rig markets,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes. \u201cWhat makes you think they won\u2019t want to do more?\u201dMr. Jen, the hedge fund manager, scoffed at the notion that the extraordinary central bank interventions of recent years were designed to stamp out deflationary threats and spark an increase in prices and economic activity in stagnant economies in Europe and Japan.\u201cWe have plenty of inflation, it\u2019s just asset price inflation,\u201d he argued, referring to elevated equity, bond and housing markets that have been one consequence of these policies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t live in cities anymore, and they are grumpy about their jobs.\u201dInterestingly, one of the most vocal critics of central bank overreach has been the Bank for International Settlements itself.For years now, two senior economists at its research arm, Claudio Borio and Hyun Song Shin, have been arguing via speeches and papers that artificially low interest rates have created pernicious asset bubbles in equity and housing markets in the developed world and debt frenzies in emerging markets like China and Brazil.These views were highlighted again on Sunday in Basel with the presentation of the bank\u2019s annual report.In a speech, Jaime Caruana, the bank\u2019s managing director, said that extremely low interest rates were a threat to global financial stability as they \u201cdepress risk premia and stretch asset valuations.\u201dThe result, Mr. Caruana contended, was the threat of a \u201closs of confidence in policy making\u201d and \u201cunrealistic expectations about growth and the ability of present policies to lift global growth.\u201dWhile couched in platitudes, Mr. Caruana\u2019s message was clear enough. Persistent central bank interventions have not only created dangerous distortions, they have added to a sense of worldwide cynicism that these measures have not accomplished their central aims: lifting economic growth and increasing wages.But, Mr. Brigden said, central bankers will have a harder time justifying an intervention when the markets are going haywire because of an election upset somewhere.Of course, bashing central bankers is always a popular and easy pastime for politicians, economists and investors alike.It is also true that central bankers in Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States have consistently said that their actions have been forced by the unwillingness of politicians and governments to act themselves.\u201cMonetary policy cannot do it alone,\u201d said Daniel C. Dektar, a bond investor at Amundi Smith Breeden, a global asset manager. \u201cPeople have been left behind, which is creating anti-establishment sentiment in just about every democracy in the world. You would think that at some point governments would get the message.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Referendum", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cThis will certainly have consequences for Britain, for Europe and for us,\u201d Mr. Putin told reporters on Friday at an Asian security conference in Uzbekistan. \u201cThe consequences will be global. They are inevitable. They will be both positive and negative.\u201dHe added that only time would tell if the outcome was more positive or negative. \u201cThe markets will certainly decline, they have already declined,\u201d he said, \u201cbut everything will be certainly restored.\u201dFrom other precincts, however, the reactions were far less restrained.\u201cWe must express solidarity with the British people, with their right decision to exit the European Union,\u201d Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a populist politician whose statements often reflect the national mood, said in a speech in Parliament. \u201cThey did a great deed!\u201dThe Russian government, which has worked assiduously to undermine European solidarity in recent years, has any number of reasons to celebrate, analysts said.\u201cThe Kremlin is interested in any kind of disagreement, any kind of trouble in the E.U. which makes it weaker,\u201d said Nikolay V. Petrov, a professor of political science at the National Research University\u2019s Higher School of Economics in Moscow.For starters, he noted, the vote removes Britain as an influential voice in European efforts to isolate and punish Russia over its annexation of Crimea and role in destabilizing Ukraine. Second, it helps Mr. Putin in his preferred method of dealing with strong countries one on one rather than as blocs. Third, it can be exploited at home as an example of how a lack of unity can lead to weakness.\u201cIt can be used domestically to demonstrate that we are strong and everybody around us is not that strong,\u201d Mr. Petrov said. As for any negative economic consequences, he added: \u201cThose are not the highest priority. Geopolitically and strategically, the Kremlin thinks it will benefit.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the European Union will now have time to think about Ukraine or about sanctions,\u201d said Andrei Klimov, the deputy chairman of the international affairs committee of the upper house of Parliament.An unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman told Interfax that Russia expected Britain\u2019s vigorous support for sanctions to continue, although some analysts said they expected that Europe without the British voice might not be so adamant.\u201cWithout Britain, there won\u2019t be anybody in the E.U. to defend sanctions against us so zealously,\u201d Sergei S. Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, wrote on Twitter.Mr. Putin, however, said on Friday that he doubted the result would have an impact on European Union sanctions.The Kremlin is also believed to be following the Soviet tradition of underwriting other political groups that seek to weaken the European Union. Many Russian officials and commentators said they expected similar referendums across the Continent.Mr. Putin broke his silence about the British campaign the week before the vote to deny accusations that the Kremlin was trying to sway the outcome.\u201cIt is unpleasant to link Russia to every problem, even those with which we have no link, nor to make Russia into a kind of boogeyman,\u201d he said. \u201cI should say that this is absolutely none of our business. This is the choice of the British people.\u201dThe Russian leader is not a fan of unpredictable votes, and he expressed puzzlement about why the British prime minister, David Cameron, decided to hold the referendum in the first place.\u201cWhy did he initiate this referendum? Why did he do it?\u201d Mr. Putin asked. \u201cTo intimidate Europe, or to threaten someone? What is the point of this if he himself opposes the idea?\u201dUltimately, he said, the decision to call the referendum reflected \u201coverconfidence\u201d on the part of Britain\u2019s leadership.Mr. Putin said Friday that the result reflected public dissatisfaction with issues like security, immigration, the subsidizing of weaker economies and excessive control from Brussels, which he compared unfavorably to the old Soviet Union. \u201cPeople want to be more independent,\u201d he said.Also on Friday, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, told Russian news outlets that he hoped a Britain outside the European Union would understand \u201cthe need to build good relations\u201d with Russia.Although Russia did not officially take a position on the British vote, state-run news reports by the English-language service of RT television and the Sputnik news agency openly supported a British exit from the bloc.State-run news outlets give significant attention to issues that are considered central to the euroskeptic movement, particularly the migrant crisis, and they paint Europe as a continent in crisis. An analysis of Sputnik\u2019s English-language coverage by Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the British-based Institute for Statecraft, found a significant bias toward the exit campaign.Perhaps the only thing tempering the general euphoria were a few sobering notes on the economic impact.Aleksei Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow said Russia would feel the economic effects of Britain\u2019s vote.\u201cWhile this is a political victory, on the economic side of things, Russia will suffer,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOil will fall. The markets will be turbulent. Russia won emotionally but lost economically.\u201dMr. Makarkin said many Russians saw in the vote the possibility that the European Union might crumble, much the way the Soviet Union fell apart 25 years ago.\u201cThe overall mood in Russia can be described as malicious joy,\u201d he said. \u201cA few liberals regret that Britain voted to leave, but in general there is some sort of relief that they have their problems, too, they are collapsing, too.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Britain\u2019s position on European Union sanctions on Russia. It supports them strongly; it does not have a hard-line stance against them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Hits U.S. Stock Market Harder Than an Election", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byAftershockIn response to the British vote to leave the European Union, the American stock markets have moved more than they have in response to any presidential election over the past 60 years.In part, this reflects the fact that Thursday\u2019s referendum result was quite unexpected. Election-eve prediction markets had suggested around a one-in-six chance that Britain would leave.Even sharp and unexpected electoral shifts in the United States don\u2019t produce swings this large. Take the 2000 election, when markets rose and fell by only a percentage point or two, as the networks went back and forth on whether George W. Bush or Al Gore had the edge in Florida and in the Electoral College. Stocks moved by less than a percentage point in response to the subsequent Supreme Court decision certifying Mr. Bush as the winner.Likewise, stocks moved by only a percentage point or two on Election Day 2004, when early exit polls led many to believe that John Kerry had won the election, only to reverse course when it became clear the early numbers were wrong.Think of Friday morning\u2019s re-evaluation of the price of stocks as the market\u2019s judgment that the British referendum has more profound economic implications for the United States than the difference between a Democratic and Republican president. (Perhaps the contrast this November will prove to be larger.)Economists focus on stock market reactions because they provide a useful real-time barometer of a nation\u2019s broader economic prospects.After all, when traders buy a stock index, they\u2019re buying the future earnings of a broad swath of American corporations. The theory is that the price they\u2019re paying should be tied to expectations of future earnings. This morning\u2019s lower stock prices suggests they\u2019re much more pessimistic.While market reactions are surely neither as rational nor as carefully calibrated as the theory suggests, at least they provide a useful quantification of the conventional wisdom. And that conventional wisdom seems to be that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will lead to economic disruption that will echo across the Atlantic.Advertisement"}

Much of his speech was devoted to urging his followers to continue fighting for causes like universal health care, free public college and an end to fracking, regardless of who wins the general election in November.The event, which was organized by National Nurses United, a labor union that campaigned heavily for Mr. Sanders, featured discussions about how to encourage like-minded people to run for local offices and to push groups to work together on issues like racial justice, income inequality and electoral changes. One session included discussion of protest methods, using mock sit-ins and arrests, for the Democratic National Convention next month in Philadelphia.Panels included \u201cThe Robin Hood Tax: Challenging Wall Street, Neo-Liberalism and Perpetual Debt\u201d and \u201cEnding Voter Suppression, Mass Incarceration, Deportations and Gender Inequality.\u201dMr. Sanders did not attend, though \u201cBernie 2016\u201d hats, buttons and pins were easy to spot, and songs from the senator\u2019s rallies, like Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cAmerica,\u201d blasted through speakers. Conference attendees effortlessly repeated elements of his stump speech \u2014 \u201crigged economy,\u201d \u201ca corrupt campaign finance system.\u201dSome of Mr. Sanders\u2019s Democratic surrogates did show up, like Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who delivered a fiery speech urging people not to allow the party to return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201dThe question of whether to support Mrs. Clinton in November was not an official topic of discussion, but it was on a lot of minds nonetheless.\u201cI\u2019m very frustrated by people who are like, \u2018Vote blue, no matter who,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ramos Rios said. \u201cI feel like we are being threatened with the boogeyman of the dream state and not confronting the actual difficulty that we have in front of us, which is we are being ruled by an oligarchy.\u201dSome at the Chicago gathering said they might vote for a third-party candidate. Others said they would write in Mr. Sanders\u2019s name. (None of the people interviewed said they would vote for Mr. Trump.)Curtis Anderson, 29, an estate groundskeeper from Plainfield, Ill., said that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton, but that that was about all he would do for her. \u201cI campaigned 500 hours for Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t campaign five minutes for Hillary.\u201dNaomi Klein, a progressive author, spoke on Friday night at a panel about the way some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters were feeling. \u201cLet\u2019s not be afraid to admit that we come here wounded and that we also come here in pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are grieving political losses, dreams tantalizingly tasted but ultimately unrealized.\u201dPolls suggest that a large majority of people who voted for Mr. Sanders will back Mrs. Clinton, and in tight races in swing states, her campaign will welcome that support.On the opening panel Friday night, the journalist Juan Gonzalez said that he belonged to the antiwar group Students for a Democratic Society in 1968, and that like some other members, he sat out the presidential election that fall. Richard M. Nixon beat Hubert H. Humphrey by less than a percentage point, and Mr. Gonzalez said he wondered whether the result could have been different.\u201cOur slogan was, \u2018Vote with your feet. Vote in the street,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that the slogan was right. The tactic was wrong.\u201d\u201cHopefully,\u201d he added, \u201cother generations learn from the mistakes of those who came before them.\u201dIt was not clear if that argument held much sway with the Chicago crowd.\u201cIf we get Trump, then we\u2019ve gotten the country we deserve,\u201d Mr. Winnett said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the fault of the Bernie Sanders supporters. It\u2019s the fault of the Democrats for choosing Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Forgets About Hamilton", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorALEXANDER HAMILTON is all the rage. Sold out for months in advance, the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s remarkable hip-hop dramatization of this founder\u2019s life, is arguably the most celebrated American cultural phenomenon of our time. Reported on from every conceivable angle, the show has helped keep Hamilton on the $10 bill and prompted a new nickname for this weekend\u2019s Broadway awards ceremony: the \u201cHamiltonys.\u201dMr. Miranda\u2019s depiction of Hamilton as resourceful immigrant and talented self-made man captures an important aspect of his character. But the musical avoids an equally pronounced feature of Hamilton\u2019s beliefs: his deeply ingrained elitism, his disdain for the lower classes and his fear of democratic politics. The musical\u2019s misleading portrayal of Hamilton as a \u201cscrappy and hungry\u201d man of the people obscures his loathing of the egalitarian tendencies of the revolutionary era in which he lived.Hamilton mistrusted the political capacities of the common people and insisted on deference to elites. In a speech delivered at the Constitutional Convention, Hamilton praised the hierarchical principles of the British political system. He argued, for example, that the new American president and senators should serve for life. Many of the Convention participants feared the \u201cexcess of democracy,\u201d but Hamilton went much further. He wanted to bring an elective monarchy and restore non-titled aristocracy to America. \u201cThe people are turbulent and changing,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey seldom judge or determine right.\u201d They must be ruled by \u201clandholders, merchants and men of the learned professions,\u201d whose experience and wisdom \u201ctravel beyond the circle\u201d of their neighbors. For America to become an enduring republic, Hamilton argued, it had to insulate rulers and the economy as much as possible from the jealous multitude.One of the musical\u2019s most memorable scenes portrays Hamilton\u2019s debate with Thomas Jefferson over the establishment of a national bank. What it doesn\u2019t convey is Jefferson\u2019s populist resistance to an economic plan that, in his view, supported the rule of commercial oligarchs who manipulated credit and currency at the expense of debtors and yeoman farmers. Instead, Mr. Miranda stages a confrontation between a hypocritical republican slave owner and an abolitionist visionary (\u201cA civics lesson from a slaver,\u201d a scoffing Hamilton says in response to Jefferson. \u201cHey, neighbor, your debts are paid \u2019cause you don\u2019t pay for labor\u201d) that conceals as much as it reveals.Our point is not that Mr. Miranda should have offered a more balanced portrayal of Hamilton. But the aspect of Hamilton\u2019s life he celebrates \u2014 the self-making entrepreneurialism of the American dream \u2014 cannot be fully understood without including, indeed without highlighting, Hamilton\u2019s insistent and emphatic inegalitarianism. Hamilton and his contemporaries understood these seemingly contradictory positions as two sides of the same coin. Ignoring one side, as Mr. Miranda has done, obscures their connection both then and now.Just as Jefferson\u2019s republican championing of the people\u2019s liberties depended upon his acceptance of a permanent underclass of slave laborers, so does Hamilton\u2019s commitment to the success of the entrepreneurial self-made man depend upon his assumption that there would be a deferential political underclass to do the heavy work. Mr. Miranda\u2019s emphasis on the contradiction inherent in Jefferson\u2019s stance deflects attention away from the contradiction in Hamilton\u2019s.Hamilton, with his contemptuous attitude toward the lower classes, was perfectly comfortable with the inegalitarian and antidemocratic implications of his economic vision. One has to wonder if the audiences in the Richard Rodgers Theater would be as enthusiastic about a musical openly affirming such convictions. No founder of this country more clearly envisioned the greatness of a future empire enabled by drastic inequalities of wealth and power. In this sense, too, \u201cHamilton\u201d is very much a musical for our times.Jason Frank and Isaac Kramnick teach political theory in the department of government at Cornell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Economic Nostalgia", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald J. Trump went to a suburb of Pittsburgh called Monessen on Tuesday to talk about the steel industry and talk about trade. The mix of location and topic was uniquely appropriate for a major economic speech, though probably not in the way Mr. Trump apparently intended.\u201cToday I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.\u201dHe\u2019s right that the number of steel industry jobs \u2014 more precisely \u201ciron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing,\u201d in government data-speak \u2014 is down by 44 percent in the Pittsburgh area since 1990, a span in which the United States entered the North American Free Trade Agreement and engaged in much more extensive trade with China.But two things are worth knowing. Before Nafta was even a gleam in a trade negotiator\u2019s eye, Pittsburgh had already lost the biggest chunk of its steelworking jobs. The culprit in that era was both international competition and the introduction of mini-mills, which allowed the production of steel with far fewer man-hours. Because of that and other technological innovations that improved productivity, total American steel output is about the same now as it was in 1990, even with far fewer workers.And that shows the fundamental challenge Mr. Trump faces in seeking \u2014 as he did in Tuesday\u2019s speech \u2014 to put opposition to trade deals at the center of his economic agenda in the presidential race. The economics of nostalgia may capture the hearts of a certain portion of voters. But it is disconnected from the decades-long direction of the United States economy and the interests of the businesses that are historically a crucial part of the Republican coalition.But in making the utter rejection of Nafta and normalized trade relations with China central to his campaign, Mr. Trump is evoking a different United States. Since peaking in World War II at 38 percent of all jobs, manufacturing employment has been on a steady downward trajectory almost continuously ever since.Currently 8.5 percent of American jobs are in manufacturing. Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories.Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower. But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge, gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred. America\u2019s economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen.As Mr. Trump faces a general election, the question is how much his message of economic nostalgia will resonate, particularly beyond the older Americans who mourn a lost age.In other words, it\u2019s easy to see why the people who used to work in those 5,100 no-longer-existent steel jobs in the Pittsburgh area might vote for Mr. Trump. But how will he fare with those additional 66,000 health care workers? The answer may well determine the election, and the course of the United States\u2019s economic relationship with the rest of the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit: The Morning After", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "That said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m finding myself less horrified by Brexit than one might have expected \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact, less than I myself expected. The economic consequences will be bad, but not, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue, as bad as many are claiming. The political consequences might be much more dire; but many of the bad things I fear would probably have happened even if Remain had won.Start with the economics.Yes, Brexit will make Britain poorer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to put a number on the trade effects of leaving the EU, but it will be substantial. True, normal WTO tariffs (the tariffs members of the World Trade Organization, like Britain, the US, and the EU levy on each others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exports) are low and other traditional restraints on trade relatively mild. But everything we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in both Europe and North America suggests that the assurance of market access has a big effect in encouraging long-term investments aimed at selling across borders; revoking that assurance will, over time, erode trade even if there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any kind of trade war. And Britain will become less productive as a result.But right now all the talk is about financial repercussions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 plunging markets, recession in Britain and maybe around the world, and so on. I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that the pound has fallen by a lot compared with normal daily fluctuations. But for those of us who cut our teeth on emerging-market crises, the fall isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that big \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that big compared with British historical episodes. The pound fell by a third during the 70s crisis; it fell by a quarter during Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down about 8 percent as I write this.Here, from Bloomberg, is the pound-euro rate over the past 5 years. This is not a world-class shock:Furthermore, Britain is a nation that borrows in its own currency, not subject to a classic balance-sheet crisis due to currency devaluation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like Argentina, where the fall in the peso wreaked havoc with firms and consumers who had borrowed in dollars. If you were worried that fears about Brexit would cause capital flight and drive up interest rates, well, no sign of that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if anything the opposite. Here, again from Bloomberg, is the interest rate on British 10-year bonds over the past five years:Now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that world stock markets are down; so are interest rates around the world, presumably reflecting fears of economic weakness that will force central banks to keep monetary policy very loose. Why these fears?One answer is that uncertainty might depress investment. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how the process of Brexit plays out, and I could see CEOs choosing to delay spending until matter clarify.A bigger issue might be fears of very bad political consequences, both in Europe and within the UK. Which brings me to the politics.It seems clear that the European project \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the whole effort to promote peace and growing political union through economic integration \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is in deep, deep trouble. Brexit is probably just the beginning, as populist/separatist/xenophobic movements gain influence across the continent. Add to this the underlying weakness of the European economy, which is a prime candidate for \u00e2\u0080\u009csecular stagnation\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 persistent low-grade depression driven by things like demographic decline that deters investment. Lots of people are now very pessimistic about Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future, and I share their worries.But those worries wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have gone away even if Remain had won. The big mistakes were the adoption of the euro without careful thought about how a single currency would work without a unified government; the disastrous framing of the euro crisis as a morality play brought on by irresponsible southerners; the establishment of free labor mobility among culturally diverse countries with very different income levels, without careful thought about how that would work. Brexit is mainly a symptom of those problems, and the loss of official credibility that came with them. (That credibility loss is why the euro disaster played a role in Brexit even though Britain itself had the good sense to stay out.)At the European level, in other words, I would argue that Brexit just brings to a head an abscess that would have burst fairly soon in any case.Where I think there has been real additional damage done, damage that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have happened but for Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy malfeasance, is within the UK itself. I am of course not an expert here, but it looks all too likely that the vote will both empower the worst elements in British political life and lead to the breakup of the UK itself. Prime Minister Boris looks a lot more likely than President Donald; but he may find himself Prime Minister of England \u00e2\u0080\u0093 full stop.So calm down about the short-run macroeconomics; grieve for Europe, but you should have been doing that already; worry about Britain.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Single Senator Stymies the Export-Import Bank", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thursday is an ignominious anniversary for the government agency that helps finance foreigners\u2019 purchases of American exports. Thanks to a single senator, it has been a full year since the 82-year-old Export-Import Bank could approve deals exceeding $10 million, a limit that rules out high-dollar deals on airplanes, power generators, heavy equipment and nuclear reactors.More than 30 transactions worth more than $20 billion to American businesses are stuck awaiting assistance for their buyers, in the so far vain hope that Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama and once a bank supporter, will end his power play and allow the agency to fully function.Last June 30, the so-called Ex-Im Bank two blocks from the White House closed its door to all new business after a faction of conservative Republicans, denouncing \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d blocked renewal of its charter.\u201cIt\u2019s very troubling to me, and I think a lot of others, that one person can hijack a process and keep the export credit agency from functioning in the United States when two-thirds of Congress support it,\u201d Mr. Rice said.Two weeks ago, G.E. announced it would expand manufacturing of gas turbines in France rather than Greenville, S.C., in return for French export financing for sales in countries including Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Mexico.Last September, G.E. announced a flurry of moves: creating up to 1,000 jobs in the Czech Republic to produce turboprop aircraft engines; shifting 500 power-project jobs from Texas, South Carolina, Maine and New York to France, Hungary and China; promising 1,000 energy-sector jobs in Britain, whose export bank will finance up to $12 billion in G.E. sales to Brazil, Ghana, India and Mozambique; and relocating 350 engine manufacturing jobs from Waukesha, Wis., to a new factory in Canada.\u201cIs it going to put G.E. out of business? Absolutely not,\u201d Mr. Rice said. \u201cWe can go to a plant in France, or a plant in Switzerland and Germany.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cA lot of our suppliers can\u2019t come with us.\u201dBoeing is working with Britain\u2019s agency to finance airplane purchases for unspecified customers, on the condition that Boeing use Rolls-Royce engines. A company based in Bermuda canceled a contract for satellites, a company in Singapore declined Boeing\u2019s bids to sell satellites and Ethiopian Airlines wrote the manufacturer that the lack of Ex-Im Bank financing threatened \u201cour ability to purchase Boeing aircraft in the future.\u201dMr. Shelby was unavailable over several days to discuss the issue, a spokeswoman said. She instead provided a statement that the senator \u201cbelieves that his actions are in the best interest of the American taxpayer.\u201d\u201cNearly 99 percent of all American exports are financed without the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d it said, \u201cwhich demonstrates that the bank is more about corporate welfare than advancing our economy.\u201dThe bank makes money, through proceeds from its loans and insurance lines, but conservatives cite the risks to taxpayers. The bank\u2019s chairman, Fred P. Hochberg, said he had not talked with Mr. Shelby all year, adding, \u201cIn Washington, not returning a call is an art form.\u201dThe Ex-Im Bank was created during the Depression as a lender of last resort for exporters\u2019 foreign customers that cannot get commercial loans. More than 60 countries followed the United States\u2019 lead. China\u2019s export credit operation is by far the largest.By one measure, the lack of a quorum at the American bank would not seem a problem. In recent years, about 98 percent of applications for help have been for loans under $10 million. But in dollar terms, two-thirds of all assistance has gone for deals exceeding that amount, mostly for customers of big-item manufacturers like Boeing, G.E., Caterpillar, Westinghouse and John Deere.\u201cWe will certainly need a quorum at the bank for the project\u2019s completion,\u201d said Courtney A. Boone, a Westinghouse spokeswoman.Especially in the developing world, some countries require that exporters bidding for sales have backing from an export credit agency. So some American companies are seeking or accepting support from foreign agencies, which in turn require bidders to create jobs in their countries.Foreign carriers like VietJet \u201ccontinue to believe that the United States wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to dismantle its Export-Import Bank,\u201d said Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman. \u201cBut the other issue is to what degree does this have a chilling effect on ongoing sales campaigns for future deliveries?\u201dAlso in May, a Boeing official at its facility in Alabama publicly criticized Mr. Shelby, saying he was putting local jobs and suppliers at risk.Mr. Shelby has stood firm, endearing him to conservative anti-government groups crusading to close the bank \u2014 and known to spend freely against politicians who cross them. Their blessing was especially important to the senator as he faced a conservative challenger in Alabama\u2019s March Republican primary. Mr. Shelby suggested to colleagues and reporters that he would let his committee act on the Ex-Im board nominee afterward.\u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t do this before the primary,\u2019\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the banking committee. \u201cWe took that to mean he\u2019d do it after he won his primary.\u201dYet Mr. Shelby continues to block Senate confirmation of J. Mark McWatters, formerly an aide to the Republican chairman of the House banking committee.Senate Democrats recently tried to force a Senate vote, bypassing Mr. Shelby\u2019s committee, but they needed the Senate\u2019s unanimous consent. Mr. Shelby objected, without further word.She added, \u201cI don\u2019t go to bed worrying about the executives at Boeing or G.E., because guess what? They have options. The American worker doesn\u2019t have options.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strategy Session With Some of Education\u2019s Top Thinkers", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byBy James E. RyanLearning technologies offer great potential to improve education, but whether that potential will be realized depends on three key factors, which have less to do with technology itself and more to do with the people using it.First, we need to ensure that we don\u2019t lose sight of the \u201clearning\u201d in learning technologies. We need to keep in mind that students learn at different rates, that it is critical to master a topic before moving to the next, that students who are engaged are likely to learn more and learn more deeply, and that active learning is more likely to engage students than passive learning.It follows that technologies that tailor learning to the pace and interests of students are likely to have bigger payoffs than those that do not.Second, we need to recognize that this is an adaptive challenge, not a technical one. We have to be thinking about fundamental questions like how we organize classes and schools, how we use time, how we think of the role of the teacher and what we expect students to learn. These are not technical questions but questions about organizational behavior and the role of teachers and principals.Finally, we must be committed to impartial, third-party evaluations of learning technologies. We need to know what is working and for whom. But we cannot rush to judgment. We need to balance our sense of urgency with patience and deliberation, recognizing that fundamental change takes time.Dean of faculty, Harvard Graduate School of EducationBy Jeffrey SelingoNearly 40 percent of American workers hold a bachelor\u2019s degree. Fifteen percent of mail carriers have a four-year degree, as do one in five clerical and sales workers.Getting a bachelor\u2019s degree is what going to college means to most Americans. Students who do not march along are often considered \u2014 or consider themselves \u2014 failures.Yet the decades-long march to college has actually closed off options for young people.As recently as the 1970s, a high school graduate had a number of options: get a good-paying job right away, enlist in the military, find a trade apprenticeship or go to college.Today, there are really only two options: the military or college. Yet only 52 percent of young people have either a two- or four-year degree or an industry certificate by the time they reach their mid-20s.Nearly half of the American work force has these jobs today, but many of them will soon be retiring. As many as 25 million of all new job openings in the next decade will be for middle-skill jobs.We need job-training institutions on par with academic institutions to attract students interested in pursuing these skilled jobs.The school receives more than 4,000 applications each year for 230 spots.We need more such pathways for students who don\u2019t want to travel the one route we offer them now.Author, \u201cThere Is Life After College\u201dBy Nicholas ChristakisOne of the most difficult challenges I faced this year was answering a Native American student\u2019s poignant question: Why should she put any faith in institutions in our society when those institutions had betrayed her people in generations past?\u201cThe same Constitution with its protection of the rights to free expression and assembly that you revere,\u201d she said, \u201cwas previously of no use to people like me.\u201dStudents of all kinds are joining traditions that revere free expression, wide engagement, open assembly, rational debate and civil discourse.But it is illiberal to use these traditions to censor others, to besmirch fellow students and to treat ideological claims as perforce facts. When students (and faculty) do this, they are burning the furniture to heat the house.Open, extended conversations among students are essential to the pursuit of truth, to moral learning and to social progress. The faculty must show students a way forward: to be harder on the problems society faces, but easier on each other. We cannot be a community of searchers and learners if we do not share the same principles at the core of our universities.Disagreement is not oppression. Argument is not assault. Words \u2014 even provocative or repugnant ones \u2014 are not violence. The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.If we fail to see this, we risk confirming for our students the old joke that we wouldn\u2019t want to join a club that would have us.Professor of social and natural science, Yale UniversityBy Marybeth GasmanIn 2014, for the first time, the nation\u2019s student body \u2014 from kindergartners to 12th graders \u2014 was majority-minority.Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States over all will be majority-minority as well. Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? I don\u2019t think so. Faculty members receive little, if any, training on teaching, and even less on diversity issues.First, these minority-serving institutions assume success on the part of their students rather than seeing them from a deficit perspective. Second, they focus on what the student needs to learn rather than what is convenient for the professor. Third, faculty members work together on classes and curriculums that empower students. Fourth, faculty members allow students to bring their full identities to the classroom. And last, the institutions give students the opportunity to participate in culturally relevant assignments.These approaches require a deeper understanding of teaching and a commitment to student learning.To meet the needs of a diverse group of students, Ph.D. programs must consider teaching in addition to research when training graduate students. Research is essential, but we also must ensure that our diverse nation truly learns.Professor of education, University of PennsylvaniaBy Harold LevyFor most of its history, America ignored the talents and potential of most Americans. We will never know what great progress might have been made in science, medicine, business and many other fields if we had taken advantage of the brainpower and abilities of all our people \u2014 regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or income level.But people from low-income families continue to face enormous obstacles.These low-income students lack money, don\u2019t get adequate counseling in high school and face many other barriers that more affluent students never encounter. To enable more low-income students to get a higher education, colleges should make socioeconomic diversity a priority. They should encourage outstanding low-income students to apply, simplify the application process and make transparent the actual tuition price and financial aid possibilities for students from struggling families.In addition, colleges should devote more financial aid to those who need it and less to those who don\u2019t, by reducing so-called merit scholarships. Colleges should also re-examine their policies of giving preferential admissions to the children of alumni.Current policies are resulting in an enormous waste of talent. We need to recommit ourselves to the American dream and being the land of opportunity for all.Executive director, Jack Kent Cooke FoundationBy Marvin KrislovWith student activism sweeping the country over issues like sexual assault, police brutality and racial inequality, American higher education is at a crossroads, as it was in the 1960s during the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.How best to serve a new generation of students facing challenges from changing demographics, rising income inequality, political tumult and doubts about whether the nation can overcome its deepest divides?How can the value of liberal arts be demonstrated when public discourse increasingly defines educational value in terms of initial income?How will higher education create a truly inclusive environment for a diverse group of students who question traditional modes of teaching and learning?First, the faculty and staff must maintain high academic standards and rigor, empowering students with the intellectual tools they will need.Second, we must welcome diverse populations and teach our students to embrace multiple perspectives, while valuing their personal experiences.Third, our institutions must serve as laboratories for collaboration to create sustainable futures that balance idealism with financial realities.Fourth, we must help our students find meaning in their education by communicating options and opportunities to apply learning, and by embracing new possibilities created by technology.All parties should have a voice in these conversations: student activists who are demanding a more relevant education, parents who are making emotional and material investments in their children and faculty members who are protecting academic freedom. We all must learn from each other.President, Oberlin CollegeBy Annette Gordon-ReedOne of the most important issues that educators face is skepticism about liberal arts education in an era that seems to be pushing STEM \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math. This is not just happening in the United States. Calls to cut support for so-called soft disciplines are also made in Europe and Asia.But just recently, the governor of Connecticut used his line-item veto power to cut support for the humanities. We seem to be rejecting the idea that it is essential for society to have people who are broadly educated, who can investigate, analyze and present their findings logically and clearly, without the aid of numbers or code.The commission took the position that \u201cthese goals cannot be achieved by science alone.\u201dWe need more homegrown engineers, but not everyone wants to be an engineer, or can be. Innovation is spurred by people who are creative in different ways. Gathering ideas from seemingly disparate fields can bring new ways to think about problems, allowing creativity to flourish.We need K-12 systems that produce students able to take advantage of all that higher education has to offer. This suggests a need for greater cooperation between those schools and our institutions of higher learning.Professor of American legal history, Harvard UniversityBy John PalfreyIt is a mistake to say that diversity and free expression cannot coexist. And yet, on campus after campus, that has been the choice served up this year: You are either for diversity, equity and inclusion in our communities, or you are for free expression. The strength of our communities depends upon a commitment to upholding both, even \u2014 perhaps especially \u2014 when it is hardest to do so.The American experiment is about the coexistence of diversity and free expression. That coexistence has not been easy, nor has it been all that successful, especially for those who have less power. And free expression has been interpreted in ways that have tended to support those in authority, rather than all people equitably.That the American experiment has not yet been entirely successful, nor fairly carried out, does not mean that the principles are wrong.Diversity and free expression ought to coexist on our campuses in particular. One purpose of education is to bring young people into contact with those of different backgrounds so that they might learn from one another.But free expression and its close cousin, the right to assemble peaceably, do not mean that anyone can say anything to anybody at any time. The First Amendment has been interpreted to permit certain restrictions of time, place and manner on speech. On our campuses, students and faculty need to act respectfully to one another to build community.The idea of diversity and free expression opposing one another may serve some immediate political purposes, but it will not serve our society in the long run.Head of school, Phillips Academy, AndoverBy Deborah TuerkheimerCampus rape is finally receiving the attention it merits. But efforts to address the problem are developing in a scattershot fashion, largely because of confusion about the university\u2019s role in responding to sexual assault.Professor of law, Northwestern UniversityBy Carol DweckEvery fall I face my class of college freshmen and announce: \u201cYour old job is over; your new job starts today.\u201dTheir old job was getting into a good college. Their new job is to become a person who will make a meaningful contribution to society.This is the generation that will determine the future of our world. Will we succumb to climate change? Will we foster equality? Will we steward new technologies to serve rather than undermine human needs and values?The answers depend on whether we can help students look beyond their next test score to focus on longer-term learning and life goals.In a recent nationwide study, led by David Yeager of the University of Texas, 9,000 ninth graders were asked what kind of assignment they wanted (even if it didn\u2019t affect their grade): 63 percent wanted an easy assignment over a challenging one.The most exciting schools in America today are predicated on the belief that intellectual abilities can be developed. They foster that belief in all of their students. And they reinforce it with rigorous, meaningful learning, allowing students to envision their future contributions. These schools understand that this can make all the difference in the world.Professor of psychology, Stanford UniversityBy Marc BrackettRegardless of all the honors classes they took in high school, or the science, technology and engineering classes they cram into their college curriculum, students today will not be fully prepared to compete in an increasingly global business environment.The problem \u2014 and the solution \u2014 is not intellectual. It\u2019s emotional.A survey of more than 123,000 students at 153 colleges by the American College Health Association in 2013 found that more than half experienced overwhelming anxiety and about a third felt deep depression during the school year.This is, or should be, worrisome to educators and policy makers, not only because of the suffering that results but also because research demonstrates that the way people manage their emotions matters for personal growth and the success of the broader society and economy.The Nobel laureate James J. Heckman has written that teaching \u201cnoncognitive\u201d skills, including recognizing and regulating emotions, would be a cost-effective way to increase work force productivity and quality.Teaching emotional intelligence \u2014 or what\u2019s more broadly referred to as social and emotional learning \u2014 to children and adults has proved to be effective and sorely needed.It\u2019s frustrating that policies to mandate and finance evidence-based approaches to social and emotional learning are slow to come. A few states have acted on their own. Leaders in Washington and across the nation need to work to equip America\u2019s youth to be competitive for the new global century. Our future \u2014 and our children\u2019s future \u2014 depends on it.Director, Yale Center for Emotional IntelligenceBy Freeman HrabowskiRecently, I visited my hometown, Birmingham, Ala., to recognize high-achieving eighth graders from public schools. I found myself reflecting on my own experiences as a 12-year-old in that city, participating in the Children\u2019s March of 1963 to fight for access to a better education, and I wondered: Just how far have we come?Only about half of students who begin college now will have earned a degree six years later; the completion rates are much lower for students of color. The gap is equally striking by income. More than 80 percent of Americans from families in the top income quartile have attained a bachelor\u2019s degree by age 24; under 10 percent of those from families in the bottom income quartile have done so. It\u2019s clear that increasing access to college is not enough.It is not acceptable for so many students to work hard to earn a college education, often going into debt, and not to succeed.We need communities that view student success as a collective responsibility. Young people need adults who set expectations and help them develop critical thinking skills and a sense of self. We need public policies that encourage all sectors to work together. There are no quick fixes. There weren\u2019t any quick fixes 50 years ago either, but through decades of commitment and hard work, we have made progress.We must remain committed.President, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyBy John B. King Jr.The $1.2 trillion that borrowers and their parents owe on student loans for college is an eye-popping number \u2014 one that some policy analysts, pundits and journalists often cite in declaring a student loan crisis.But a related challenge that deserves greater attention is the college completion challenge. President Obama has called for America to again lead the world in college graduation. Far too many students start college but do not finish; students of color, first-generation and low-income students are dropping out at higher rates than their white or better-off peers. If students borrow, they may not earn enough money to repay their loans. The typical defaulter owes less than $9,000.The bottom line is this: Debt without a degree often leads to default.Colleges, states and the federal government can change this. The Obama administration has made college more affordable by adding tens of billions in student aid and creating tax credits for college tuition, made it easier for students to repay their loans, and encouraged graduating on time.Across the country, innovative leaders are showcasing strategies that work.The University of Hawaii\u2019s graduation rate has improved significantly since the university began giving students incentives to attend class full time.These promising examples offer hope, but colleges cannot tackle this challenge alone. Congress should support proposals such as structuring the Pell grant program to raise completion rates and providing incentives to scale up other innovative approaches. States need to share responsibility, starting by reversing the trend of disinvestment in higher education.Secretary of educationBy Joni FinneyCollege is becoming less and less affordable to more and more families higher and higher on the socioeconomic ladder.According to a recent report from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University, families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay a significant portion of their gross income to send a student to a public four-year nondoctoral institution. On average, it cost 16 percent (in Alaska) to 33 percent (in New Jersey) of their income in 2013.Private institutions offered no relief, requiring outlays of 16 percent (Idaho) to 45 percent (Rhode Island) of family income.Even the safety net of community colleges is fraying. Families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay 11 percent (Mississippi) to 22 percent (Minnesota) of income to enroll in public two-year institutions.If state policy makers are serious about improving education attainment, as they often promise to do, they must make it a priority to lower the financial burden of higher education on students from low- and middle-income families to increase their chances of enrolling and graduating.Unless we make college affordable for people of all financial means, opportunity through higher education will be a false promise.Director, Institute for Research on Higher EducationBy Randi WeingartenFor people who choose educating others over enriching themselves, college debt can seem insurmountable.The American Federation of Teachers recently started a series of student debt clinics to help our members mitigate the crippling college debt incurred by millions of American students and their families. For some participants, the clinics have been life-changing.In October, a young adjunct professor from Miami attended a two-part A.F.T. debt clinic. Crushed by more than $168,000 in student loan debt and monthly payments exceeding $2,000, this professor, a single mother, was desperate. After one day of training, she applied for income-based repayment and was able to reduce her monthly payment to $700. On the second day, she told the group that it was the first good night\u2019s sleep she\u2019d had in three years.Many people simply can\u2019t afford to seek higher education, or they pay dearly when they do. Forty-seven states are spending less per student than they did at the start of the recession, after adjusting for inflation. Tuition costs have skyrocketed, putting more of the burden on students and their families.When our country realized the value of educating all students through high school, we made high school universally free. The same should be done for college today.The men and women who teach in our public schools, colleges and universities have invested in their own education so that they can, in turn, invest in the students in their classrooms. They know they won\u2019t be rewarded with huge paychecks, but neither should they be punished with crushing college debt.President, American Federation of TeachersAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Corrupt Zigzag, an Argentine Dance", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina is changing political direction again, in a century-old zigzag from left to right and back. Traumatic though this obsessive ritual is, what is most amazing is that the language almost never changes: The powers that be are corrupt. Throw them out.This holds true across the political spectrum. Charged with corruption, an incumbent is ousted by voters or a coup. An appearance in court often follows, but the investigation goes nowhere at the hands of politically wary investigators or judges. Eventually, the reformers are themselves tarred with corruption charges, and the cycle repeats itself.The current turnabout features the populist Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who was president from 2007 to last year, and her husband, N\u00e9stor, who preceded her from 2003 to 2007 and died in 2010. Her center-right successor, Mauricio Macri, ran on promises of ending their alleged corruption and fixing Argentina\u2019s economy. The outcome: Ms. Kirchner has been indicted on charges of organizing a currency trade at an artificially low price that benefited rich investors and cost Argentina\u2019s Central Bank billions of dollars. Meanwhile, television news is rife with images of earth movers digging up a Patagonian farm where a vast Kirchner fortune is rumored to be buried. Other Kirchner-era officials are accused of bribe taking, embezzling and misappropriating public funds.Does this mean Mrs. Kirchner is forever humbled? Hardly. A large slice of the population still sees her as a champion of the underprivileged \u2014 and a strong potential contender for president in 2019.Extraordinary as this may appear to outsiders, none of it is new to Argentines.Nasty political divides date from Argentina\u2019s independence from Spain early in the 19th century, a time of bloody disputes between advocates of local authority or strong central rule. Revolts and civil wars followed each other, as landlords battled rival landlords, using gauchos \u2014 mounted cowhands \u2014 as soldiers.In the 20th century, enduring rifts opened between caudillos \u2014 commanding figures who appealed to the masses \u2014 and more elitist leaders, with all sides typically saying their foes were corrupt. In 1930, after the progressive president Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen was overthrown in a military coup, he was imprisoned on charges involving fraudulent government purchases. But none of the accusations were proved.In the 1940s and \u201950s, the populist general Juan Per\u00f3n and his second wife, Eva, accused \u201coligarchs\u201d of exploiting the working class. Generals aligned with the upper class that the Per\u00f3ns vilified ousted Mr. Per\u00f3n from the presidency in 1955 and ordered an inquiry into allegations against him that included embezzlement of Argentine agricultural export earnings and sexual exploits with teenage girls. But even a lengthy investigation (and a posthumous public exhibition of Eva\u2019s jewelry collection) did not yield conclusive findings.During the next 18 years, with Mr. Per\u00f3n in exile in Madrid, military governments ousted successive elected presidents, typically citing corruption charges as justification.Mr. Per\u00f3n returned to office in 1973, died a year later and was succeeded by Isabel Per\u00f3n, his third wife. She was accused of pocketing proceeds from a government charity drive, and in 1976 was ousted in another coup \u2014 ostensibly to revive an economy depleted by the Per\u00f3ns\u2019 populist policies.That was when Argentina\u2019s political split reached its nadir, with a barbarous descent by that military government into torture, murder and the disappearance of tens of thousands of opponents, many of them young. Only after the generals provoked a losing war with Britain over the Falkland Islands and incurred a crippling foreign debt did they step aside to permit democratic elections in 1983.A rare interlude followed. Amid wide revulsion at the recent horrors, Argentina\u2019s old hatreds seemed to dissipate when a middle-of-the-road president known for honesty, R\u00e1ul Alfons\u00edn, was elected.But the dream of a united Argentina didn\u2019t last. In 1989, Argentines elected as president Carlos Menem, a right-wing Peronist who drove around in a red Ferrari Testarossa he had received as a gift from Italian businessmen. He privatized the state-run telephone, gas, electricity and oil companies, and soon was embroiled in allegations of corruption. He didn\u2019t help his case when journalists asked about the Ferrari and he childishly replied: \u201cIt\u2019s mine, mine, mine!\u201dStill, his reputation for corruption did not turn off voters. He even managed to change the Constitution to allow his re-election in 1995. A remark often heard about him explains a lot: \u201cRoba pero hace\u201d \u2014 \u201cHe steals but he gets things done.\u201dWhich brings us back to the populist Ms. Kirchner, and Mr. Macri\u2019s efforts to have Argentina\u2019s notoriously pliable judges investigate her now.Is Argentina finally tackling its endemic corruption? It\u2019s hard to say. Sebasti\u00e1n Casanello, the judge who ordered the Patagonia excavations, is also investigating Mr. Macri, since his name appears on the board of directors of an offshore company mentioned in the Panama Papers scandal.Nevertheless, when corruption and lurid accusations become so pervasive, a point is reached where they barely raise eyebrows. In Argentina, that juncture was passed long ago. Today, the glacially slow federal courts are honeycombed with judges often as corrupt as the politicians they investigate, says a leading anti-corruption crusader, Luis Moreno Ocampo. \u201cIt\u2019s a system of judges,\u201d he says, \u201cwho cover up corruption instead of investigating it.\u201dAnd the corruption thus enabled creates deep cynicism throughout the society.Consider Ren\u00e9 Favaloro, an Argentine heart surgeon in the 1960s, who pioneered a coronary bypass technique in Cleveland, then returned to Argentina to set up a cardiovascular foundation. His integrity and generosity (he operated on poorer patients free) became legendary.But those traits proved his undoing. When he refused to pay kickbacks demanded by health services officials, the state institute for pensioners refused to pay what it owed him for operations, leaving him at the brink of bankruptcy.\u201cI have been defeated by this corrupt society that controls everything,\u201d he wrote in a famous note saying he\u2019d rather die than take kickbacks. Then he shot himself through the heart.That was 16 years ago. Instead of succumbing again to the cyclical use of its prevalent corruption for political mudslinging, Argentina needs to tackle corruption at its core \u2014 to wage full-out war on an ancient malady eating away at a still-fragile democracy.That will require, before anything else, a truly independent judiciary that can quickly drop unfounded accusations and, when there is guilt, deliver more than token convictions that are intended mainly to discredit political opponents.Most important, the war must be waged against corruption wherever it occurs, not just among political enemies.Uki Go\u00f1i is the author of \u201cThe Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per\u00f3n\u2019s Argentina\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Rather, its 57 pages boil down to one idea: Roll back hundreds of federal regulations that protect consumers, investors, employees, borrowers, students and the environment.Mr. Ryan seems to think his ideas would become reality in a Donald Trump administration. \u201cWe feel very confident that our presumptive nominee is comfortable with this agenda,\u201d he said in announcing the plan.That may be, but the American people are unlikely to be comfortable with it. One of the bills promoted in the plan would repeal \u201call climate-change regulations under the Clean Air Act.\u201d Others promote coal mining and offshore oil drilling. These proposals are consistent with statements by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, that he would eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, but they do not reflect public opinion.Similarly, several items in the Ryan plan attack the legal status and rules of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That fits with Mr. Trump\u2019s stated aim of dismantling the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, but would reverse progress on stopping usurious payday lending, ending racially discriminatory auto lending and prohibiting reckless mortgages. The plan also would undo rules that require retirement advisers to act in their clients\u2019 best interests and rein in regulatory efforts to require big franchisers, like McDonald\u2019s, to accept responsibility for the pay and working conditions of franchise employees.The list goes on, with rollbacks to let banks, for-profit colleges, federal contractors, cable companies and other businesses that have hurt and exploited Americans in the past resume their discredited ways.The Ryan plan is not, in other words, an economic agenda.

On the face of it, our friend exceeded all qualifications for the job, and my wife and I each wrote glowing recommendations for him, including to the head of the department to which he was applying. We thought he was a slam-dunk for the position.To our surprise, he didn\u2019t get it, and in the aftermath, he was eager to know what went wrong, emailing me twice to ask whether I had \u201cheard anything.\u201d My wife subsequently had lunch with the department head, who told her frankly that he had made a bad impression, that he seemed \u201ctoo full of himself,\u201d alienating several people who interviewed him and watched him teach a class. I still believe that the school missed out on an exceptional teacher. Yet knowing him, I can understand how he might have created this impression. He\u2019s a person who works too hard to impress, and his energy can be over the top; at times you want to find the volume knob and turn him down a notch. I\u2019m guessing also that he\u2019s the kind of teacher who is effective in a cult-of-personality way \u2014 a teacher who is a \u201ccharacter\u201d and whom many students will revere but some may resist. This may have turned people off. The friend, knowing that my wife was having lunch with the department head, emailed me again to ask how it went. My question is whether to tell him what I learned.

First, while the department head did not specifically request that my wife not pass along the content of her conversation, it is quite possible that she assumed my wife wouldn\u2019t do so; and my wife is reluctant to do so. Second, I have to admit that I\u2019m reluctant to give my friend news that will vex him; he and I had each assumed that he was passed over for a \u201ctargeted hire\u201d and not that he had in fact been judged adversely. Learning that he was in fact personally rejected will be upsetting to him. On the other hand, it might help him adjust for such situations in the future. Notice that you\u2019re not worried the interviewers got a misleading impression of your friend\u2019s temperament and teaching style; you believe they got an accurate one and didn\u2019t take to it. If that\u2019s so, you may be able to help him interview better \u2014 by hiding the side of him that put the interviewers off. Yet the school may have had good cause to avoid a teacher who is, as you put it, \u201ceffective in a cult-of-personality way.\u201dThere\u2019s another reason it might be good to tell him what happened, though. Our country is full of people convinced that they\u2019ve lost out through affirmative action to less-qualified minorities. Sometimes they have; very often they haven\u2019t. (For one thing, you can be right that a white candidate lost out to a \u201ctargeted hire\u201d but wrong to think that you were that white candidate.) It\u2019s not just his self-esteem that\u2019s being defended by this consoling thought, it\u2019s a false belief that relates to an important social question. I would say the expectation of confidentiality wins out here. But the reason you\u2019re having a hard time deciding is that it\u2019s a close-run thing.Upon finding their actual listing on the site, I learned that they are renting the apartment for nearly $400 a night and have had at least six renters based on the reviews on their page. They didn\u2019t alert anyone in the building that they were doing this, and it violates our co-op\u2019s rules. I believe it also violates New York City law, but I\u2019m a little vague on that.My real issue is that there are strangers in our building, and it makes me feel unsafe. My partner says that no one who can afford their price would do anything damaging to us or the building and thinks I\u2019m crazy for being annoyed with them. Obviously I\u2019m also jealous of their extra income: Who wouldn\u2019t want an extra thousand dollars (at least!) a month?I am a filmmaker and recently graduated from a university. I was shocked when, by a stroke of good luck, hard work and fortunate timing, I managed to get myself booked onto a huge advertising job. The work was extremely fulfilling, fast-paced and well paid.Despite this, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the company I was working for, a giant tech company, was using me to sell a product that is made by employees who make very low wages and work very long hours. Not only did I feel bad for my role in pushing products onto consumers, but worse, I felt very guilty knowing that the extremely high figure I was being paid for a week\u2019s work might be two years\u2019 worth of work for the people who made the things I was selling. At the same time, this job fell from the sky at a time of extreme financial need, and I really enjoyed it.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Smugglers in West Bank Open Door to Jobs in Israel, and Violence", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "A thriving industry allows West Bank residents to get past what Israelis call a security barrier. It has a dangerous side effect: Attackers sneak through as well.Supported byDAHIYAT AL BARID, West Bank \u2014 At 4:15 a.m. on a dead-end street, a 33-year-old Palestinian man came running from the shadows between buildings with a rickety wooden ladder. He slapped it against the hulking concrete wall and climbed up, hoisting himself the last six feet because the ladder was too short.The wall, which Israel began building more than a decade ago to thwart the suicide bombers of the second intifada, is supposed to prevent Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank from entering into Israel outside military checkpoints where their papers can be examined.But the Palestinian man perched in a gap in the concertina wire that tops much of the snaking 400-mile route of the wall. He motioned to a white Daewoo sedan that had lurched to a stop below, and one by one, four young men stepped out of the car, climbed the 13-rung ladder, and slid down a rope on the other side. Within minutes, another car was speeding the men to construction sites in Israel, where they did not have permits to work, and the man with the ladder was leaving to look for more job-seekers willing to pay to scale the wall.\u201cIn the West Bank, you have hustlers,\u201d said the man, who, like more than two dozen other Palestinians interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was breaking the law. \u201cYou can either call them hustlers, or you can call them brokers.\u201dThis furtive predawn crossing is part of a thriving smuggling industry that allows untold numbers of people to pass over, under, through or around what Israelis call the security barrier \u2014 for a price.The industry offers economic benefits for everyone involved: Palestinian workers earn double or quadruple the wages they can in the West Bank; Israeli contractors and restaurant owners pay less for illegal labor than for Palestinians with permits; and the smugglers collect $65 to $200 for each person that passes. Punishment for those caught is generally being sent back to the other side.The two men lived in Yatta, a village in the West Bank\u2019s south, near where the unfinished barrier consists mostly of a metal fence with numerous gaps and holes. Micky Rosenfeld, an Israeli police spokesman, said they had entered Israel illegally, \u201cmost probably via one of the areas which are open or not completed.\u201dThe Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security agency, says that from Oct. 1 of last year to Feb. 1, 21 Palestinians who attacked Israelis were in the country illegally.Since the Tel Aviv attack, Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry has promised to extend a more effective form of the barrier to the south, an area heavily trafficked by smugglers. But the government\u2019s other response to the shooting, the cancellation of 83,000 special permits for Palestinians to cross during the holy month of Ramadan, may reveal how difficult it will be to stanch the flow.At the Qalandiya checkpoint outside the city of Ramallah on the Friday after the attack, men stood at the edge of the restive crowds no longer able to pass through, shouting \u201ctahreeb, tahreeb\u201d \u2014 Arabic for \u201csmuggling, smuggling.\u201d\u201cWe have to understand that you will never solve the problem,\u201d said Nitzan Nuriel, a retired Israeli brigadier general and the former head of the prime minister\u2019s counterterrorism bureau. \u201cWhenever you have illegal workers, it is part of the reality, it is part of the economy.\u201dThe challenge, said Mr. Nuriel, now a counterterrorism expert at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, is filtering potential terrorists from ordinary workers. \u201cYou have to decide,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich fish to catch and which fish you can allow to swim.\u201dThe economics of the smuggling business are straightforward \u2014 and irresistible.Unemployment among West Bank Palestinians is about 20 percent over all, and is even higher for young people. Starting wages per day, according to Khalil Shikaki, the director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah, are 70 to 80 shekels, or $20. Numerous Palestinians working illegally at Israeli construction sites said they made $80 to $100 a day.That is still a major bargain for Israeli companies, who have to treat Palestinians with work permits similar to Israeli workers in terms of wages and benefits, covering sick days, vacations, health insurance and pensions.There are currently about 55,000 Palestinians with permits working legally in Israel, and an estimated 20,000 in the settlements, according to Palestinian Labor Ministry. That is down from a peak of 140,000 before the second intifada in 2000, the ministry says (when the population was about two-thirds the size).Estimates vary widely on the number of illegal workers. Mr. Shikaki said 30,000 was a reasonable guess; Mr. Nuriel said it was closer to 60,000, depending on the time of year. Most work in construction, agriculture or restaurants.Mr. Rosenfeld, the police spokesman, said that hundreds of illegal workers were picked up each week, but that the authorities were \u201cfocusing on arresting those that are attempting to bring in the Palestinians illegally.\u201dThe first time someone is caught in Israel illegally, he said, the police simply record the incident and release the worker back to the West Bank. Repeat offenders \u201cwill appear before the courts\u201d and may face other penalties, Mr. Rosenfeld said, adding that anyone suspected of links to terrorism is referred to the military.But Palestinian workers who have been arrested multiple times said in interviews that the most serious consequences they have faced have been an interrogation and being dropped off at a checkpoint as far as possible from where they were picked up.Mr. Nuriel, the counterterrorism expert, said that it would be too costly to keep such a large population in jail and that even widespread arrests were impractical, asking, \u201cWho is going to interrogate them?\u201dAt a large construction site in Israel, an illegal worker in a yellow hard hat who goes by the name Abu Khalid estimated that he had gone over the wall dozens of times in the last year alone. Like many others interviewed, he said his routine was to cross the wall, work inside Israel for a few days or weeks, and then go back to the West Bank for a short rest. Some employers house workers in trailers, some workers stay with relatives or friends, and some, like Abu Khalid, camp outside.At 50, he has a lined, deeply tanned face and, the sign of his seniority on the job, a walkie-talkie in his pocket. Abu Khalid said that a package deal for the jump over the wall and transportation to his work site costs about 800 shekels for a solo trip; when three men go in together, he said, they can cross for perhaps 300 shekels each.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Abu Khalid said.Workers \u201cpunch in\u201d as soon as they arrive at a job site, he added, and both Israeli and Palestinian contractors know they have no permits. At day\u2019s end, Abu Khalid continued, \u201cwe go find a water pipe to take a shower, and then we find a nice tree and sleep under it.\u201dPassage is not always as simple as going up a ladder and down a rope. Two young workers \u2014 Ahmad, 19, and Bassem, 21 \u2014 sat on a terrace in their village, north of Ramallah, and chuckled about a time when tight security forced them to go under the wall, not over it.\u201cWe used to go through a water main like snakes,\u201d Bassem said.Ahmad\u2019s father, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of legal repercussions, said his son provided a prime source of income for the family. But Ahmad is also a source of deep anxiety because of how he travels to work.\u201cWhen he goes and he comes, I have my hand on my heart in fear of something happening,\u201d the father said.Nowhere is passage more perilous than the West Bank\u2019s south, where the Tel Aviv suspects, who are cousins, most likely crossed.\u201cYou don\u2019t know who you are walking with,\u201d said Mahmoud Khalil, 19, a Palestinian who was working at an Israeli construction site but had no permit.Mr. Khalil is from Yatta, like the suspects, but he said he did not know the cousins and came to Israel only to earn money for his family. He said he paid 250 shekels for safe passage through a large gap in the barrier near the village of Dahriya, southwest of Yatta, and transportation to the work site.One recent day near Dahriya and neighboring Ramadin, pickups jammed with illegal workers played cat-and-mouse with Israeli military Humvees, racing from gap to gap as smugglers chattered on phones nearby. Workers and smugglers alike understand that terrorism is bad for business.A driver for the smugglers in Dahriya who spoke on the condition that he be identified only as Abu Ramzi said that he and his colleagues alert Palestinian security forces at the first hint that a client intends to commit violence in Israel. He complained that the Israeli military had stepped up patrols of the southern barrier since the Tel Aviv shootings.\u201cBefore this last attack, the army would act as if nothing was going on \u2014 30 or 40 workers would cross into Israel all at once,\u201d said Abu Ramzi, 34. \u201cThis last attack has temporarily complicated our operation.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cwe will always find ways to get these workers in.\u201dThat resolve was tested after nightfall last Monday, when five pickups and a Mazda sedan filled with workers massed in the center of Dahriya. With their lights off, the vehicles made two attempts to cross the web of rutted, rocky dirt roads and reach gaps in the fence, but they turned back because spotters saw Israeli Army Humvees converging on the same areas.Finally, the smugglers\u2019 vehicles roared toward another spot, throwing up thick billows of dust and bouncing the workers mercilessly in the beds of the trucks. At the bottom of the hill, two lookouts were talking on their cellphones under an olive tree. To the west, past the fence, nothing was visible but the distant lights of Israeli towns and cities.Then the lights of the cars sent to pick up the workers on the Israeli side could be seen approaching on the bare hills. A smuggler yelled, \u201cYalla, yalla!\u201d \u2014 \u201cGo, go!\u201d \u2014 and workers leapt from the trucks and began running toward a gap in the fence that had been flimsily repaired. Someone pulled it open, and someone else carefully lifted a few strands of razor wire that had been tossed in the dirt to make the passage more difficult.The workers, many toting backpacks stuffed with clothing, slid under the razor wire and met the cars. The last man lifted the razor wire himself, slipped under and ran toward the cars, which drove off toward job sites among the distant lights.Myra Noveck contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Opens Uncertain Chapter in Britain\u2019s Storied History", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byWill Britain be the outward-looking, entrepreneurial, confident country that makes its independent way in the world, as the leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign insisted it could be?Or will it retreat to become a Little England, nationalist and a touch xenophobic, responding to the voters that drove it to quit the European Union?Even more important: Will it even hold together? With Scotland deeply pro-Europe, pressure will increase for another independence referendum that could bring an end to the United Kingdom.Britain, a nation whose storied history has encompassed the birth of constitutional government, global empire, royal pageantry and heroic defense against fascism, is entering unknown territory.Britons voted on Thursday to leave the European Union. The Leave side led with 17.4 million votes, or 52 percent, versus the Remain side\u2019s 16.1 million, or 48 percent, with a turnout of around 72 percent.The questions about its new path could remain unresolved for years. On Friday morning, at least, Britain remained a member of the European Union in full standing, just as it was 24 hours earlier.But the impact of this plebiscite is likely to be profound and long-lasting, well beyond the immediate tumult in the financial markets, and the questions about Britain\u2019s future will be answered against the backdrop of potential political, legal and economic upheaval.And if the British Treasury, the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and the Institute for Fiscal Studies are to be believed, the British economy is in for a severe shock. The Treasury estimates that the British gross domestic product, representing the size of the economy, will fall by 3.5 percent, clobbering tax receipts; that half a million people will lose their jobs; and that housing prices (and thus personal wealth of homeowners) will fall by 10 percent.Those estimates were criticized by the Leave campaign, including senior members of government, as unfounded fear mongering. Now Britain will find out how accurate they are.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.This vote was a severe shock to Britain\u2019s political class from voters who are angry, confused and deeply distrustful of elites.The Labour Party joined Mr. Cameron in campaigning to stay in Europe, as did nearly all the other parties represented in Parliament, with the exception of the Democratic Unionists and the U.K. Independence Party, which was founded on a platform of leaving the European Union. Yet despite that solid wall of establishment voices \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 Britain voted for a fundamental change in direction.\u201cThe British political class should pay attention,\u201d said Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics.\u201cThere is a lot of disaffection with both main parties,\u201d he said. In 1955, the Conservatives and Labour won 97.5 percent of the vote, but in last two elections, the two won only about 66 percent of the vote, he said.\u201cInto that vacuum something else has to move, but what?\u201d Mr. Travers asked. \u201cThe political class has to wonder how to appeal to those who increasingly feel left out of the system, how to stop large numbers of voters feeling cut out of economic change and success.\u201dThe Conservative Party is already split between traditional establishment figures like Mr. Cameron and others who embraced the anti-elite, anti-immigration posture of the Leave campaign, most prominently the former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and one of Mr. Cameron\u2019s senior cabinet members, Michael Gove.The British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.Mr. Cameron also had more centrist views than many in his party\u2019s grass roots, having pushed the Conservatives to back social issues like same-sex marriage and adopt unifying themes like \u201cone-nation Conservatism.\u201dHe is likely to be replaced by someone more to the right and more anti-European, like Theresa May, the home secretary, or Mr. Johnson, who also thinks of himself as a \u201cone-nation Tory,\u201d but in the Churchillian mode, and has made no secret of his ambition.And the Labour Party must find a way to embrace those working-class voters who are clearly unhappy about the effects of globalization and immigration on their lives and found themselves swayed by the Leave campaign. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was somewhat halfhearted in his support for the \u201cRemain\u201d camp, reflecting his ambivalence about whether staying in Europe would be the right focus when it comes to helping working people.This referendum has also displayed a major fissure between Britain\u2019s metropolitan elite and the rest of the country, essentially pitting rich versus poor across the normal party divide.Those with a university degree supported Remain in large numbers, according to pre-referendum polls; those with little higher education supported Leave in equally large numbers. Major cities, multicultural and replete with immigrants, tended to support Remain, while the countryside and poorer areas along the eastern coast were strongly for Leave.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.People over 45, and especially retirees, strongly supported Leave, while younger Britons strongly supported Remain.Those with cosmopolitan lives and money were afraid to lose it; those whose lives are bounded by England and are struggling with the pressures of globalization and immigration looked for a return to a calmer, more homogeneous past.So the divisions are just as much cultural as economic, and they raise serious questions about Britain\u2019s political coherence and unity, and about how long it may take to heal the wounds made or reopened in this noisy, often vicious campaign.The referendum also sharply exacerbated tensions within the four countries of the United Kingdom and gave a jolt to English nationalism, already on the rise since the Scottish independence referendum failed in 2014.Amid the overwhelming confusion about the next few years, it will take more than a few reassuring words about a festival of democracy to begin to bring Britain back together.As Mr. Harris warned, \u201cWe are in a terrible mess, and it is probably going to take decades to even begin to put things right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Suburban Experiment Aims for Free Energy", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported by6 PhotosFONTANA, Calif. \u2014 At first glance, Anthony and Vanessa Genau\u2019s home in a subdivision beneath the San Gabriel Mountains here is like any other gracious new suburban dwelling, with an open-plan living space, granite countertops and stainless steel appliances.But, along with 19 other cream, taupe and rust stucco houses that cradle the landscaped playgrounds here, it is actually something else: a large-scale testing ground for an energy system of the very near future.With a combination of rooftop solar panels, smart thermostats, advanced water heaters and other high-efficiency features, the homes are all built with a similar goal: to make at least as much energy as they use over a year.It\u2019s a concept known as zero net energy, and the cluster of homes here represents one of the nation\u2019s largest experiments to see if zero net energy can be put into wider use.\u201cIt\u2019s not that it cannot be done,\u201d said Ram Narayanamurthy, technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility-funded group that is conducting the study. \u201cThe question that we\u2019re trying to answer is, \u2018Can it be done for everyone?\u2019\u201dThat question has particular urgency in California, whose goal is that all new homes be net-zero or the equivalent by 2020. But as the price of installing and operating once-rarefied technologies has plummeted, builders across the country are increasingly offering homes with the promise of comfort along with low \u2014 or almost no \u2014 electric bills.Since 2013, the Energy Department has certified about 700 homes as \u201czero-energy ready,\u201d meaning that the addition of a renewable energy system, generally solar, would offset most or all of its annual energy consumption.With thousands more in the pipeline, said Sam Rashkin, chief architect of the building technologies office, the department expects to certify roughly 1,000 this year and 3,000 in 2017.\u201cWe\u2019re on that inflection point on the growth curve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re proving the business case to a growing number of builders in key pockets of construction around the country. It takes some really good examples by leading builders to showcase just how cost-effective and technically achievable these specifications are.\u201dDenver is a leading market, with thousands of zero-energy homes on the way in developments like Stapleton and Sterling Ranch, he said, although there are many others in New England, New York and the Carolinas.Low-income developers, including Habitat for Humanity, are also active in building the homes. Although the efficiency features can be more costly, they are often offset by energy savings and other economies.The proliferation of zero-energy homes comes as the power industry and its regulators struggle to adapt an old power system \u2014 in which large, centralized power plants distribute energy to thousands of homes \u2014 to new approaches and technologies. The explosive growth of rooftop solar in states like Hawaii, Arizona and California has upended not only utility business models but also patterns of supply and demand.Solar power, by its nature, is intermittent, which places strain on utilities and grid operators that need to meet homeowners\u2019 energy demands at night when the sun is not shining, while also taking in the excess energy rooftop solar systems produce during daylight hours.Although the proportion of homes with solar is not yet high enough in most markets to cause major problems, industry executives and analysts say it is important to begin studying how that and other technologies affect the nation\u2019s power grid now.\u201cWe know very little about how all these devices interact \u2014 we have so much to learn,\u201d said Mark Duvall, director of energy utilization at the Electric Power Research Institute. \u201cHopefully at the end of the day we can contribute to a greater understanding of how these technologies work together and what it really means going forward.\u201dTo do that, Mr. Narayanamurthy said, it was important to conduct the study, in partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission and its program manager, Itron, in real homes with people using them the way they normally would.But they also needed to have groups of homes clustered on individual transformers to allow them to compare the results with the traditional method of providing power. With that information, they can determine the value for homeowners and grid system operators of adding features like solar panels, heat pumps and, in some cases, battery storage.They found a willing collaborator in Meritage, a leading builder of energy-efficient homes, and are expanding the test program to additional subdivisions in Southern California, the Central Valley and the Bay Area.For buyers, part of the appeal of a home built to be zero-energy is that they do not have to change their behavior to save energy.At Meritage, the company insulates every house with spray foam, sharply reducing the amount of heating and cooling needed, and allowing smaller or fewer units to be installed. Making the homes even more efficient are dual-pane windows that help retain or keep out heat (depending on the need), LED lighting and advanced water heaters that work by funneling heat from the ambient air into the water.All of the test homes have SunPower rooftop solar systems, which are among the most efficient on the market. And because they were designed along with the houses, the arrays can be oriented for maximum production.Half of the test homes also have energy storage systems with LG batteries and Eguana inverters, which help manage the flow of electricity between the solar installation, home and grid, to allow researchers to test and compare how much value they add. The houses come equipped with A. O. Smith water heaters that can be remotely controlled and Trane smart thermostats that can manage all the equipment and can connect to cameras and security systems.If homeowners feel any effect, it is in the pocketbook, at least initially. The houses, all with three or four bedrooms, cost more than the $373,990 to $476,990 standard for the subdivision about 20 minutes west of San Bernardino. But because the cost is wrapped into the mortgage, and paid over an extended period of time, it is more easily affordable, and the larger payments are generally offset by the savings on energy bills.\u201cWith this stuff thrown in you can afford a lot more house, and you get a lot more value,\u201d Mr. Genau, 31, said.Back in the East, where the Genaus\u2019 previous house had a big foyer, their energy bills could go as high as $500 a month. \u201cI\u2019d rather be cold sometimes than see the bill,\u201d Ms. Genau, 29, said. \u201cIt was ridiculous.\u201dTheir energy bill now? About $10.And they feel little effect, living in comfort and controlling the temperature in the different zones of their 2,800-square-foot, three-bedroom home from a smartphone.\u201cI think I did a dance or something when I saw it \u2014 it was so cool,\u201d she said, adding that if she feels it\u2019s getting warm, she will sometimes turn on the air-conditioning from her pew at church, where they often brag about the house.\u201cI think they get tired of us talking about it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aging, but Still Working, in Singapore", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported bySINGAPORE \u2014 The food courts in the basements of shopping malls and the ubiquitous \u201chawker centers,\u201d covered markets where scores of stall-holders sell cooked food, are a mainstay of eating out in Singapore. At one of my regular lunch spots, I watch the cleaners diligently tidy away the trays. They scrape leftovers into bins and wipe the tables and floors with disinfectant.They perform these unskilled, repetitive tasks with often surprising enthusiasm. What is striking is, first, that the workers are local Singaporeans, not the foreign-born recent immigrants one might otherwise expect to do such work in a wealthy country like Singapore. More important, they are frequently of, or even beyond, retirement age.The cleaning staffs have names, of course, but whenever I speak to them, I address them as \u201cAuntie\u201d or \u201cUncle\u201d \u2014 the honorific terms used here when one is speaking to someone of an older generation.I chat with them about health and happiness in old age, and I hear their varied reasons for wanting to keep working in jobs that others might consider demeaning. Some do so because they see it as a way to continue to contribute to society, and they\u2019re reluctant to become a burden on their families. Others among them wish to escape the loneliness of an increasingly sedentary retirement. Many need the extra income that even such modest work provides (typically less than the equivalent in Singapore dollars of about $1,100 a month).Dealing with an aging population is one of the major challenges that the city-state faces as it cements its status as an advanced cosmopolitan nation. Just 50 years after it gained its independence from Malaysia, Singapore has one of the highest per capita rates of gross domestic product in the world, and it boasts world-class systems of education, social housing and health care.Yet such rapid progress has led to a divergence in lifestyles between the younger generation, brought up in an age of relative security and material comfort, and their grandparents, people of the so-called Pioneer Generation (as the government designates citizens born before 1949). How to care for the elderly has become a major topic of public concern. Singapore is grappling not only with the practical effects of a growing social phenomenon but also with the impact that this has on its identity as a country that straddles modernity and tradition, East and West.This demographic shift has already created a large number of families in which two working adults are not only bringing up children but also supporting their retired parents. In Singapore\u2019s fast-paced, modern economy, such demands place a huge strain on the family unit.At the heart of the debate is the idea of the Southeast Asian family. Across the three main ethnic groups in Singapore \u2014 Chinese, Malay and Indian \u2014 one major similarity is the expectation of three generations living under the same roof. Grandparents traditionally live with their children and grandchildren once they have retired. They are expected to contribute to housework and the supervision of the youngest members of the family. In return, they enjoy the emotional and financial support of their families.\u201cLooking after your parents,\u201d in this still strongly Confucian-influenced society, is a concept most Singaporeans have grown up with. So the notion of parents\u2019 going out to work in a job past the retirement age, particularly in physically demanding, low-paid jobs like the food-hall cleaners\u2019 work, sits uneasily with traditional ideas of filial duty.As far-reaching and sophisticated as these developments are, they are unlikely to settle the debate over the retirement age. The argument is as much an emotional one as it is economic: Singaporean friends my age or younger speak of feeling guilty that their parents are still working \u2014 even though, in some cases, they are financially comfortable. At lunch recently with a friend in a food center, we watched an old auntie sweep the floor nearby.\u201cI just hate the thought of it,\u201d my friend said. \u201cShe could be my mother.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Right-Wing Populism Is Prevailing in Left-Wing Strongholds Around the World", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byPolitical CalculusAcross the postindustrial world, the populist right is excelling in the old bastions of the left.If there is a lesson for the United States in the decision by British voters to exit the European Union, it is the importance of the emerging split between the beneficiaries of multicultural globalism and the working-class ethno-nationalists who feel left behind. These issues have the potential to overcome longstanding partisan ties, even in the United States.\u201cRemain\u201d did better than the Labour Party normally does in the establishment-friendly, traditionally Conservative and more affluent countryside of southern England, let alone in the Conservative seats of London, but not by enough.The same story unfolded in the recent Austrian elections. The far right won working-class areas that sided with the Social Democrats a decade earlier. Similar patterns show up in Denmark and Germany, with the center-left doing better in cosmopolitan metropolitan areas and with populists gaining in former leftist strongholds.The result is familiar to Americans: an electorate split between the well-educated, diverse and cosmopolitan metropolitan areas connected to the global economy and the older, less educated, former industrial regions that haven\u2019t benefited from globalization.In some sense, the United States is ahead of this trend. The so-called culture wars, which have pitted the religious right against secularism, had no equivalent in relatively secular Europe. The fights over gay marriage, guns, climate change, abortion and \u2014 before that \u2014 civil rights had already pushed many traditionally Democratic but conservative strongholds in the South and Appalachia toward the Republicans. Many affluent suburbs along the coasts have been voting Democratic.But in much the same way that immigration and nationalism proved to be more persuasive to the more secular European working class, European-style populism \u2014 now embodied by Donald Trump \u2014 could do additional damage to the Democrats in many parts of the United States.The parallel is striking. The European center-left, like Democrats in the United States, have embraced lower taxes, free trade and immigration over the last few decades.There are many relatively secular, traditionally Democratic working-class bastions across the North where the Republicans have made few or no gains in recent decades. Scranton, Pa.; Youngstown, Ohio; and the Iron Range counties in Wisconsin all gave more than 60 percent of the vote to President Obama in 2012. There are areas like this across the Northern United States \u2014 from Aberdeen, Wash., and Butte, Mont., to the coasts of Rhode Island and Maine \u2014 where the Republicans have made marginal or no gains, in no small part because cultural appeals fell flat where there were not many evangelical Christians.These were also among the places where Mr. Trump fared best in the primaries.He won 70 percent in Scranton and nearly 80 percent in nearby Wilkes-Barre. He carried more than 50 percent of the vote in Youngstown, even though his opponent \u2014 John Kasich \u2014 was the state\u2019s governor.He won more than 50 percent in all of the Iron Range counties in Wisconsin, even though he lost badly statewide.His best state was Rhode Island: the state where Democrats did best among white working-class voters for much of the 20th century.Voter-file-based polling data also indicates that Mr. Trump fared best among those self-identified Republicans who nonetheless remain registered as Democrats or who have a history of voting in Democratic primaries.But there is no guarantee that white working-class voters who stuck with the Democrats through the culture wars will stay with them if elections are waged on issues like trade and immigration.Already, polls show that Mr. Trump is winning white voters without a college degree by more than Mitt Romney did four years ago. Over all, he\u2019s faring about as well among white registered voters as Mr. Romney did, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s weakness with well-educated white voters.It may not be enough for Mr. Trump. Indeed, he trails in the same polls that show him overperforming among white voters. But the Brexit vote, and European electoral trends more generally, is a reminder that there\u2019s a lot of room for Democrats to fall among white working-class voters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Violence of Forgetting", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byThe StoneThe warning signs from history are all too clear. Failure to learn from the past has disastrous political consequences. Such ignorance is not simply about the absence of information. It has its own political and pedagogical categories whose formative cultures threaten both critical agency and democracy itself.What I have called the violence of organized forgetting signals how contemporary politics are those in which emotion triumphs over reason, and spectacle over truth, thereby erasing history by producing an endless flow of fragmented and disingenuous knowledge. At a time in which figures like Donald Trump are able to gain a platform by promoting values of \u201cgreatness\u201d that serve to cleanse the memory of social and political progress achieved in the name of equality and basic human decency, history and thought itself are under attack.Once ignorance is weaponized, violence seems to be a tragic inevitability. The mass shooting in Orlando is yet another example of an emerging global political and cultural climate of violence fed by hate and mass hysteria. Such violence legitimates not only a kind of inflammatory rhetoric and ideological fundamentalism that views violence as the only solution to addressing social issues, it also provokes further irrational acts of violence against others. Spurred on by a complete disrespect for those who affirm different ways of living, this massacre points to a growing climate of hate and bigotry that is unapologetic in its political nihilism.It would be easy to dismiss such an act as another senseless example of radical Islamic terrorism. That is too easy. Another set of questions needs to be asked. What are the deeper political, educational, and social conditions that allow a climate of hate, racism, and bigotry to become the dominant discourse of a society or worldview? What role do politicians with their racist and aggressive discourses play in the emerging landscapes violence? How can we use education, among other resources, to prevent politics from being transformed into a pathology? And how might we counter these tragic and terrifying conditions without retreating into security or military mindsets?So we need to remember that education can be both a basis for critical thought and a site for repression, which destroys thinking and leads to violence. Michel Foucault wrote that knowledge and truth not only \u201cbelong to the register of order and peace,\u201d but can also be found on the \u201cside of violence, disorder, and war.\u201d What matters is the type of education a person is encouraged to pursue.It\u2019s not just schools that are a site of this struggle. \u201cEducation\u201d in this regard not only includes public and higher education, but also a range of cultural apparatuses and media that produce, distribute and legitimate specific forms of knowledge, ideas, values and social relations. Just think of the ways in which politics and violence now inform each other and dominate media culture. First-person shooter video games top the video-game market while Hollywood films ratchet up representations of extreme violence and reinforce a culture of fear, aggression and militarization. Similar spectacles now drive powerful media conglomerates like 21st Century Fox, which includes both news and entertainment subsidiaries.As public values wither along with the public spheres that produce them, repressive modes of education gain popularity and it becomes easier to incarcerate people than to educate them, to model schools after prisons, to reduce the obligations of citizenship to mere consumption and to remove any notion of social responsibility from society\u2019s moral registers and ethical commitments.Education does more than create critically minded, socially responsible citizens. It enables young people and others to challenge authority by connecting individual troubles to wider systemic concerns. This notion of education is especially important given that racialized violence, violence against women and the ongoing assaults on public goods cannot be solved on an individual basis.Violence maims not only the body but also the mind and spirit. As Pierre Bourdieu has argued, it lies \u201con the side of belief and persuasion.\u201d If we are to counter violence by offering young people ways to think differently about their world and the choices before them, they must be empowered to recognize themselves in any analysis of violence, and in doing so to acknowledge that it speaks to their lives meaningfully.There is no genuine democracy without an informed public. While there are no guarantees that a critical education will prompt individuals to contest various forms of oppression and violence, it is clear that in the absence of a formative democratic culture, critical thinking will increasingly be trumped by anti-intellectualism, and walls and war will become the only means to resolve global challenges.Creating such a culture of education, however, will not be easy in a society that links the purpose of education with being competitive in a global economy.Yet troubling knowledge cannot be condemned on the basis of making students uncomfortable, especially if the desire for safety serves merely to limit access to difficult knowledge and the resources needed to analyze it. Critical education should be viewed as the art of the possible rather than a space organized around timidity, caution and fear.Creating safe spaces runs counter to the notion that learning should be unsettling, that students should challenge common sense assumptions and be willing to confront disturbing realities despite discomfort. The political scientist Wendy Brown rightly argues that the \u201cdomain of free public speech is not one of emotional safety or reassurance,\u201d and is \u201c not what the public sphere and political speech promise.\u201d A university education should, Brown writes, \u201c call you to think, question, doubt\u201d and \u201c incite you to question everything you assume, think you know or care about.\u201dThis is particularly acute when dealing with pedagogies of violence and oppression. While there is a need to be ethically sensitive to the subject matter, our civic responsibility requires, at times, confronting truly intolerable conditions. The desire for emotionally safe spaces can be invoked to protect one\u2019s sense of privilege \u2014 especially in the privileged sites of university education. This is further compounded by the frequent attempts by students to deny some speakers a platform because their views are controversial. While the intentions may be understandable, this is a dangerous road to go down.Confronting the intolerable should be challenging and upsetting. Who could read the testimonies of Primo Levi and not feel intellectually and emotionally exhausted? Or Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s words, not to mention those of Malcolm X? It is the conditions that produce violence that should upset us ethically and prompt us to act responsibly, rather than to capitulate to a privatized emotional response that substitutes a therapeutic language for a political and worldly one.There is more at work here than the infantilizing notion that students should be protected rather than challenged in the classroom; there is also the danger of creating a chilling effect on the part of faculty who want to address controversial topics such as war, poverty, spectacles of violence, racism, sexism and inequality. If American society wants to invest in its young people, it has an obligation to provide them with an education in which they are challenged, can learn to take risks, think outside the boundaries of established ideologies, and expand the far reaches of their creativity and critical judgment. This demands a pedagogy that is complicated, taxing and disruptive.My critique of what I have called \u201cgated intellectuals\u201d responds to these troubling trends by pointing to an increasingly isolated and privileged full-time faculty who believe that higher education still occupies the rarefied, otherworldly space of disinterested intellectualism of Cardinal Newman\u2019s 19th century, and who defend their own indifference to social issues through appeals to professionalism or by condemning as politicized those academics who grapple with larger social issues. Some academics have gone so far as to suggest that criticizing the university is tantamount to destroying it. There is a type of intellectual violence at work here that ignores and often disparages the civic function of education while forgetting Hannah Arendt\u2019s incisive admonition that \u201ceducation is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume responsibility for it.\u201dSupported by powerful conservative foundations and awash in grants from the defense and intelligence agencies, such gated intellectuals appear to have forgotten that in a democracy it is crucial to defend the university as a crucial democratic public sphere. This is not to suggest that they are silent. On the contrary, they provide the intellectual armory for war, the analytical supports for gun ownership, and lend legitimacy to a host of other policies that lead to everyday forms of structural violence and poverty. Not only have they succumbed to official power, they collude with it.The solutions are complex and cannot be addressed in isolation from a range of other issues in the larger society such as the defunding of public goods, the growing gap between the rich and the poor, poverty and the reach of the prison-industrial complex into the lives of those marginalized by class and race.We have to fight back against a campaign, as Gene R. Nichol puts it, \u201cto end higher education\u2019s democratizing influence on the nation.\u201d To fight this, faculty, young people and others outside of higher education must collectively engage with larger social movements for the defense of public goods. We must address that as the welfare state is defunded and dismantled, the state turns away from enacting social provisions and becomes more concerned about security than social responsibility. Fear replaces compassion, and a survival-of-the-fittest ethic replaces any sense of shared concern for others.Lost in the discourse of individual responsibility and self-help are issues like power, class and racism. Intellectuals need to create the public spaces in which identities, desires and values can be encouraged to act in ways conducive to the formation of citizens willing to fight for individual and social rights, along with those ideals that give genuine meaning to a representative democracy.Any discussion of the fate of higher education must address how it is shaped by the current state of inequality in American society, and how it perpetuates it. Not only is such inequality evident in soaring tuition costs, inevitably resulting in the growing exclusion of working- and middle-class students from higher education, but also in the transformation of over two-thirds of faculty positions into a labor force of overworked and powerless adjunct faculty members. Faculty need to take back the university and reclaim modes of governance in which they have the power to teach and act with dignity, while denouncing and dismantling the increasing corporatization of the university and the seizing of power by administrators and their staff, who now outnumber faculty on most campuses.In return, academics need to fight for the right of students to be given an education not dominated by corporate values. Higher education is a right, and not an entitlement. It should be free, as it is in many other countries, and as Robin Kelley points out, this should be true particularly for minority students. This is all the more crucial as young people have been left out of the discourse of democracy. Rather than invest in prisons and weapons of death, Americans need a society that invests in public and higher education.There is more at stake here than making visible the vast inequities in educational and economic opportunities. Seeing education as a political form of intervention, offering a path toward racial and economic justice, is crucial in reimagining a new politics of hope. Universities should be subversive in a healthy society. They should push against the grain, and give voice to the voiceless the powerless and the whispers of truth that haunt the apostles of unchecked power and wealth. Pedagogy should be disruptive and unsettling, while pushing hard against established orthodoxies. Such demands are far from radical, and leave more to be done, but they point to a new beginning in the struggle over the role of higher education in the United States.Advertisement"}

The economy, they say, would add about half as many jobs under the compromise scenario as it would if current economic policy were unchanged. Long-term economic growth would slow. The trade deficit would rise.The Moody\u2019s model has its critics. Kevin Hassett, director of research for domestic policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that Mr. Zandi and his team underestimate the benefits of the tax cuts \u201cby kind of a large margin.\u201d\u201cI think the bottom line is that the model that they\u2019re using is not a very good model,\u201d said Mr. Hassett, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. McCain, George W. Bush and Gov. Mitt Romney.Mr. Hassett, who said he neither supported nor opposed Mr. Trump, said he was more convinced by the Moody\u2019s analysis on trade and immigration. Mr. Zandi, he said, is \u201creally, really good\u201d at such analyses.To conduct their analysis, the Moody\u2019s team began by identifying the most economically consequential and detailed policies Mr. Trump has proposed. Moody\u2019s said it had consulted two Trump advisers, who asked the firm not to publicize their identities.Using a proprietary economic model, Moody\u2019s considered three scenarios: one in which the proposals were adopted as Mr. Trump has laid them out; one in which they were adopted on a smaller scale; and one in which Mr. Trump was forced to compromise with a Congress similar in makeup to today\u2019s.Under any scenario, the proposals would have four negative consequences, the researchers say.First, unemployment would rise and the economy would weaken. Second, the United States would become increasingly isolated as Mr. Trump tightened rules on trade and immigration. Third, federal deficits would accumulate in the face of substantially reduced tax revenues paired with few spending cuts. Fourth, very high-income households would benefit most from the dramatic tax cuts and be least affected by job losses.If all the policies were put into effect, the report said, the country would be plunged into a recession beginning in early 2018 and remain there into 2020.\u201cThis would be an unusually lengthy recession \u2014 even longer than the Great Recession,\u201d the authors write.\u201cThat would do a significant amount of damage pretty quickly \u2014 setting off something akin to a trade war,\u201d Mr. Zandi said.\u201cThat would be a pretty significant corrosive on investment, productivity and then G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Zandi said.The economy would also struggle to grow if Mr. Trump acted on his pledge to deport 11 million immigrants. An already-tight labor market would constrict even further, driving up labor costs. Positions would go unfilled, the Moody\u2019s analysts said, with Americans unlikely to take the jobs once held by undocumented immigrants, such as those in agriculture \u2014 even at higher wages.Analyses like the Moody\u2019s report are, of course, imperfect exercises, Mr. Zandi and his colleagues acknowledge.But statements made on the campaign trail offer insight into how a politician might govern and deserve examination, Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt\u2019s about vetting ideas, proposals and putting them in the crucible of the public debate,\u201d he said.A similar report on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals is in the works.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Dreams of a \u2018Swiss Miracle\u2019 Look More Like Fantasy", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseTo help explain why the British voted to leave the European Union, look to Switzerland.Only \u201ca few lunatics\u201d still want to join the European Union, said the Swiss lawmaker Thomas Minder, a staunch proponent of \u201cSwissism,\u201d after last week\u2019s action.That may be an overstatement, but it\u2019s easy to see why the Swiss would feel vindicated. With a per capita gross domestic product of $80,675 in 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund, Switzerland ranks second in the world (after Luxembourg), far ahead of Britain ($43,771) and the United States ($55,805.)Switzerland\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.3 percent in May, lower than that of Britain or the United States, which have both been hovering around 5 percent this year.Switzerland has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, and there have been no terrorist incidents there in the last 30 years.Known for its religious tolerance since a civil war during the Reformation, Switzerland accommodates four national languages and has a higher percentage of Muslims (5 percent) than Britain. Roughly a quarter of Switzerland\u2019s population is made up of foreigners.Switzerland\u2019s reputation for cleanliness, punctuality and efficiency is so widespread that the Swiss tourism board pokes fun at the stereotype.The only problem? It\u2019s doubtful that Britain (or any other European country, for that matter) could replicate what\u2019s widely known as the \u201cSwiss miracle\u201d by abandoning the European Union.This isn\u2019t simply because the island kingdom of Britain is so different from landlocked Switzerland, though it is. Its population of 65 million is much bigger than Switzerland\u2019s eight million, as is its economy ($2.85 trillion in economic output in 2015 compared with Switzerland\u2019s $664 billion).Switzerland owes its highly productive economy to an overwhelming focus on lucrative jobs in financial services and precision engineering \u2014 in contrast to Britain, where the City of London financial district is a sparkling crown jewel encased in a broader, duller economy laced with generally aging manufacturers and a large, comparatively inefficient public sector.Moreover, the hard-working Swiss all but invented the notion of the Protestant work ethic. (In 2012 Swiss voters firmly rejected an initiative to extend their annual paid vacation time to six weeks from four.)\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s prosperity has nothing to do with independence from the E.U.,\u201d Professor McCormick said. \u201cServices tend to be more profitable than industry, so Switzerland will always be ahead of the U.K. because of the way their economy is structured.\u201dHe noted that Luxembourg, another small, landlocked European country with an economy oriented toward providing financial services for the world\u2019s wealthy, is a founding member and staunch supporter of the European Union. Luxembourg\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was $101,994 in 2015 \u2014 by far the highest in the world.An argument can be made that Switzerland\u2019s economy would be in even better shape if it had joined the European Union. Its Alpine neighbor, Austria, joined in 1995 after years of debate. Its economic growth outpaced Switzerland\u2019s in the ensuing years.Switzerland, with its heavily export-driven economy, hardly exists in isolation. After the Swiss rejected European Union membership, Switzerland negotiated bilateral agreements giving it free access to European markets. In return, Switzerland agreed to abide by most European Union policies, including immigration and the relatively free movement of workers among countries. But Switzerland has no say in determining those policies.The European Union is now Switzerland\u2019s largest trading partner, and Switzerland is the European Union\u2019s fourth-largest. Norway has a similar status outside the European Union. Both countries are economically dependent on the much larger European market.\u201cSwitzerland and Norway cannot survive on their own,\u201d Ms. de Gruyter said. \u201cThey want to participate in a lot of common E.U. projects.\u201d But the \u201cE.U. countries can decide on these projects, while Switzerland and Norway cannot. During European summits in Brussels, the Norwegian ambassador would often sit with me in the press room, waiting for decisions to be announced.\u201dThe extent of Swiss sovereignty will soon be tested anew. In 2014 the Swiss voted to impose immigration quotas on European Union countries, a blatant violation of the union\u2019s principle of free movement of labor. The Swiss vote, which closely followed the admission of Croatia into the European Union, was aimed at curbing immigration from Eastern Europe and requires Switzerland to renegotiate its immigration policies with the European Union within three years.The European Union has rejected the idea out of hand, saying Switzerland can\u2019t pick and choose which policies to embrace, and that it risks losing unfettered access to European Union markets. Negotiations were suspended pending the British vote. But now that the British have made their decision, Brussels is expected to take a hard line.The European Union has little choice, Professor Crombez said. \u201cWithin the E.U., some countries benefit in some ways, and other countries in others. That\u2019s what has made the E.U. a success. If each country said it only wanted to participate in the policies that benefited it, the whole thing would fall apart.\u201dThe Swiss vote also suggested there were limits to Switzerland\u2019s open-mindedness. In addition to imposing immigration quotas, Switzerland is much more restrictive in granting asylum to refugees from places like Syria than many other European countries are.\u201cNo one will say this, but there\u2019s an element of racism,\u201d Professor McCormick said. \u201cWhat they want are white, Christian, European immigrants. They want to make sure they stay culturally homogeneous.\u201dThe Swiss seem to be waking up to the consequences of defying the rest of Europe. Swiss citizens have gathered enough signatures to force a referendum on whether to retract the proposed immigration restrictions before the 2017 deadline.\u201cThe Swiss have access to the European market, but they have very little leverage,\u201d Professor McCormick said. Now that Britain has voted to leave, it, too, will lose a good deal of influence, he said. \u201cThe economic reality is that Britain would still be subject to the rules of the single market even if it left the E.U.\u201dEveryone I consulted saw similarities between the anti-European Union movements in Europe and supporters of Donald J. Trump in the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of correlation,\u201d Professor McCormick said. \u201cMany are nostalgic for the idea of the good old days, which in reality were never all that good. But in their imaginations they thought life was so much better. The E.U. makes an easy scapegoat.\u201dAs in the United States, the underlying cause of so much voter resentment isn\u2019t trade agreements or immigration. \u201cThe problem for individual European countries, whether they are members of the E.U. or not, is globalization,\u201d Ms. de Gruyter said.An earlier version of this column misidentified the organization Swiss voters rejected membership in in a 1992 referendum. It was the European Economic Area, which links European Union members and three nonmembers \u2014 Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein \u2014 for trade purposes; it was not the European Union itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, Justin Trudeau and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto Focus on Climate, Both Political and Global", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 For President Obama, foreign trips these days have increasingly become an exercise in explaining the inflamed politics of his country to nervous foreigners.So it was here on Wednesday, when Mr. Obama joined the leaders of Canada and Mexico at a summit meeting that began as a show of North American solidarity and ended up as an attempt to repudiate the nativist and isolationist currents that are agitating politics in the United States, as well as in Europe.With the gothic spires of Canada\u2019s Parliament as a backdrop, Mr. Obama, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico announced a landmark agreement on climate change and extolled the benefits of a Pacific Rim trade agreement. But it was the charged words in the American election and Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union that seized most of the attention.Mr. Obama deplored the anti-immigrant remarks of Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, particularly his statements about Mexican immigrants. Though he never mentioned Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Obama said the next American president would have a strong interest in having a solid relationship with \u201cour good neighbor to the south.\u201dSpeaking at a news conference with the Canadian and Mexican leaders after their meeting, the president said that anti-immigrant appeals had a long history in the United States, but that they had never permanently curtailed the flow of people into the country.\u201cWe should take some of this rhetoric seriously and answer it boldly and clearly,\u201d Mr. Obama said, answering a question from a Mexican journalist, \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t think it is representative of how the American people think.\u201dMr. Obama said he rejected the argument that the harsh tone in the American presidential campaign, or in Britain\u2019s recent referendum on leaving the European Union, was populist. He ridiculed the notion that a candidate who worked to preserve the interests of wealthy people could be a populist.\u201cThey don\u2019t suddenly become populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the measure of populism; that\u2019s nativism or xenophobia or worse. Or it\u2019s just cynicism.\u201dMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, for his part, put Mr. Trump in a line of populist demagogues, including Hitler and Mussolini, though he, like Mr. Obama, did not use the candidate\u2019s name. \u201cThose political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today\u2019s world,\u201d he said.Their comments lent urgency to the North American leaders\u2019 summit meeting, a diplomatic ritual that usually goes unnoticed by the public. This meeting, in fact, slipped from being an annual gathering during the administration of George W. Bush to once-every-few-years during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.For Mr. Trudeau, who has inherited Mr. Obama\u2019s mantle as a change agent, the meeting was a sort of debut on the global stage. He presented the deal under which Canada, the United States and Mexico pledged to generate half their power through clean energy sources by 2025. To achieve that goal, they will seek to harmonize energy regulations, increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.Under Mr. Trudeau\u2019s conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, Canada pulled out of its commitments to the first global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and clashed with the United States over Mr. Obama\u2019s opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But Mr. Trudeau has recommitted Canada to legislative efforts to combat climate change, much as Mr. Obama did when he succeeded Mr. Bush in 2009.For Mr. Obama, the visit was a chance to galvanize three major economies behind the advances made in the Paris climate-change accord, at a time when Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has clouded the prospects for multilateral cooperation and the durability of international agreements.Mr. Obama said he worried that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union would freeze investment in the country and in Europe. The leaders also discussed the impact of Britain\u2019s vote on trade agreements. Mexico and Canada are signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the mammoth Asia-Pacific deal that has stalled in the United States, with Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump both coming out against it.Appearing with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Tuesday, a day before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival, Mr. Trudeau said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen around the world many examples of protectionism, of stepping away from trade agreements and engagements like we\u2019re showcasing today.\u201dIn a speech to the Canadian Parliament later in the day, Mr. Obama acknowledged that globalization had unleashed deeply disruptive forces.\u201cWhile the circumstances of Brexit may be unique to the United Kingdom,\u201d he said, \u201cthe frustrations that people feel are not.\u201d But an interconnected world, he argued, was irreversible. The remedy was to pursue policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would level the playing field.Mr. Obama\u2019s relations with Mr. Harper were tense, and the president had not visited Canada since 2010. With Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election, however, the chill has given way to an affectionate big-brother relationship. In March, Mr. Obama celebrated Mr. Trudeau during a state visit to Washington that felt at times like a passing of the torch.\u201cHe campaigned on a message of hope and of change; his positive and optimistic vision is inspiring young people,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cOn the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what\u2019s not to like?\u201dThis summit meeting is being marketed as a meeting of \u201cthree amigos.\u201d But Mr. Obama is spending less time in Ottawa than Mr. Trudeau did in Washington. After his speech to the Parliament, at which he received a rapturous reception, Mr. Obama flew home, not spending a single night in the Canadian capital.Like most countries with a larger and more powerful neighbor, Canada has a general wariness toward the United States and its political leaders. As a result, Canadian prime ministers have generally been careful to be seen as friendly but not too cozy with American presidents.However, there appears to be little danger of that for Mr. Trudeau when it comes to Mr. Obama. Throughout Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, he has not only been Canadians\u2019 favorite American politician, he has also enjoyed higher ratings than Canadian politicians. One poll released on Wednesday found him more popular even than the charismatic Mr. Trudeau.Perhaps more surprisingly, the fondness of Canadians for Mr. Obama transcends party lines.Christine Campbell and her husband, Rob, woke up at 5 a.m. on Wednesday to travel from Perth, Ontario, into Ottawa to wait along Mr. Obama\u2019s motorcade route. While she voted for Mr. Harper\u2019s Conservatives during Canada\u2019s election last October, she said that she had always admired Mr. Obama and that she hoped Mr. Trudeau took some tips from the American president.\u201cTrudeau is just starting out, he\u2019s learning the ropes,\u201d Ms. Campbell said as she stood at an intersection where the motorcade would soon turn. \u201cPossibly Mr. Obama will be a good mentor for him.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptian Court Nullifies Transfer of 2 Red Sea Islands to Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 An Egyptian court on Tuesday nullified a government decision to transfer sovereignty of two strategic Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, in a surprising setback for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.The ruling surprised even some of Mr. Sisi\u2019s critics, who did not expect the judiciary to go against the government.The islands are of strategic value because they lie at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, the only sea route to the Jordanian port of Aqaba and the port city of Eilat, in Israel.Egyptian and Saudi officials signed at least 15 agreements during the king\u2019s visit, including a Sinai development package and an oil deal worth $22 billion to Egypt over five years, the state news media reported. But the announcement set off unexpected protests from Egyptians who for decades had considered the islands Egyptian territory, and some critics said that Mr. Sisi had made a humiliating concession to a wealthy ally.The ruling on Tuesday was largely unexpected, because the Egyptian judiciary has long been considered to be deferential to \u2014 and, critics would say, complicit with \u2014 the country\u2019s leadership. In recent years, Egyptian judges have sentenced hundreds of government critics to lengthy prison sentences or even death.If upheld, the verdict will not only leave Mr. Sisi in awkward position with an important ally, but it could also pave the way for the prosecution of senior government officials, legal experts warned. Under Egyptian law, officials who negotiate with foreign governments deals that harm national interests can be sentenced to life in prison. Some legal experts suggested that this possibility, despite being politically slim, was why the agreement was signed by the prime minister rather than by the president, who traditionally seals such deals.If tried as individuals who compromised Egyptian territory, officials could face the death penalty.On the other hand, if the agreement is upheld, it will be sent to Parliament, where many expect it to be approved quickly given the wide support for Mr. Sisi there.Mr. Sisi\u2019s government had presented the transfer of the islands as part of an economic deal that would help stimulate Egypt\u2019s economy, but critics took to the streets in protests that led to the arrests of nearly 1,300 people, human rights defenders say.By Tuesday evening, the Egyptian government announced that it had filed an appeal. Officials in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, did not comment immediately.In response to the wave of criticism, Mr. Sisi had urged Egyptians to stop discussing the deal, saying it was signed in secret to avoid attention in the news media. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want anyone to talk about this anymore,\u201d he said in a speech in April.Critics had taken to referring to Mr. Sisi as Awaad, a character in an old Egyptian song who sold his land \u2014 an act traditionally considered shameful.Essam el-Eslamboly, one of the Egyptian lawyers who filed the case challenging the transfer of the islands, called the ruling \u201ca victory for the judiciary,\u201d because it demonstrated that the courts \u201care fair and only care about the interests of the country.\u201dDuring testimony before the court, Mr. Eslamboly said, the government\u2019s lawyers declined to furnish documents to make their case, arguing instead that the transfer was a \u201csovereign decision\u201d that was made at the discretion of the cabinet, and one that the administrative court had no right to question.\u201cThe silence revealed the weakness of their position,\u201d he said.Legal experts, both for and against the deal, have described the crux of the official argument in court as hard to prove, at best.\u201cThere is no legal text that defines what constitutes a \u2018sovereign decision,\u2019\u201d said Mohamed Hamed el-Gamal, the former chief of the Council of State, the judicial body that issued Tuesday\u2019s verdict. \u201cIt is really up to the judges here,\u201d he said, adding that there was no legal text immunizing such decisions. \u201cThat idea is based on judicial norms; normally such decisions are respected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut such decisions are not usually challenged either.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicare and Social Security Trustees Warn of Shortfalls", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Wednesday that the financial outlook for Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund had deteriorated slightly in the last year and that Social Security still faced serious long-term financial problems.Under existing law, the trustees said Wednesday, Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund would be depleted in 2028, two years earlier than projected in last year\u2019s report.In addition, they said, the Social Security trust funds for old-age benefits and disability insurance, taken together, could be depleted in 2034, the same year projected in last year\u2019s report. Tax collections would then be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits through 2090, they said.Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of all federal spending.Obama administration officials often say the Affordable Care Act has slowed the growth of health spending, compared with estimates made just before the law was adopted in 2010.But the trustees said Wednesday that the short-term financial outlook for Medicare had worsened in the last year because of changes in their assumptions and expectations. Medicare actuaries now expect higher use of inpatient hospital services, as well as lower projected improvements in workers\u2019 productivity and lower payroll tax revenue, as a result of slower growth in wages in the next few years.In their report, the trustees \u2014 four administration officials \u2014 said that the costs of Medicare and Social Security would grow faster than the economy through the mid-2030s because of the aging of the baby boom generation. As for Medicare, they said, \u201cgrowth in expenditures per beneficiary exceeds growth in per capita gross domestic product over this time period.\u201dThe projected growth in Medicare spending will not immediately set off automatic cuts in the program under a controversial provision of the Affordable Care Act that generally requires such cuts when spending is expected to exceed certain benchmarks. However, such cuts could be required in a few years under the trustees\u2019 forecast.Under current projections, they said, the automatic cuts could take effect for the first time in 2019.Medicare now spends an average of nearly $13,000 per beneficiary, and this figure is expected to exceed $16,000 in five years, the report said.\u201cHigh-cost drugs are a major driver of Medicare spending growth,\u201d said Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Such projections in years past have prompted leaders in both parties to at least broach the idea of benefit cuts or tax increases for entitlement programs.By contrast, President Obama said in Elkhart, Ind., this month that Social Security should be made \u201cmore generous,\u201d and that \u201cwe could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.\u201dTreasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday that he saw no contradiction there. The two objectives \u2014 ensuring the solvency of Social Security and increasing benefits \u2014 are \u201cnot at all inconsistent\u201d if they are discussed in the context of \u201ca broader conversation\u201d about taxes and benefits, he said.The report predicts that Social Security will provide a modest cost-of-living adjustment, increasing benefits by two-tenths of 1 percent next year. But, it warned of a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in Medicare premiums in 2017 for about 30 percent of beneficiaries. Under assumptions in the report, the standard premium, now $121.80 a month, would rise to $149, and the change could be announced just weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8.Congress took action last year to shore up Social Security\u2019s disability insurance trust fund, but the report says the legislation was a short-term fix. The law postponed the projected depletion of the disability trust fund by seven years, to 2023, Mr. Lew said.Like other Democrats, Mr. Lew said the report showed the \u201cpositive impact\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. Since the health law was signed, he said, \u201cincreases in health care costs have slowed substantially.\u201dCarolyn W. Colvin, the acting commissioner of Social Security, said Americans should begin a serious discussion of how to close the \u201cfuture financing gap\u201d in Social Security. Sixty million people now receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is expected to reach 76 million by 2025.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The United States of Inequality", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "It will come as little surprise that income inequality in the United States is greatest in New York and Connecticut. Those states are home base for Wall Street, where the income gains of the few have been amplified by outsized growth in the financial sector and protected by taxpayer-provided bailouts.The study, which measures income inequality by state, metro area and county, shows that inequality has risen in every state since the 1970s. It also shows that rising inequality is entrenched. \u00c2\u00a0Recessions in recent decades have temporarily slowed income growth among the top 1 percent, but they have not altered the basic pattern in which the rich have gotten much richer while nearly everyone else has seen income stagnate or decline.Between 2009 and 2013, for example \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a period that encompasses most of the post-Great Recession era \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the top 1 percent captured all of the income growth in 15 states (Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming). In another 9 states (Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas), the top 1 percent captured half to nearly all of the income growth.In all, the top 1 percent in the United States captured 85.1 percent of total income growth from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, the 1.6 million families in the top 1 percent made 25.3 times as much on average as the 161 million families in the bottom 99 percent.Those and other figures are reminiscent of conditions in the Roaring Twenties. In 1928, the peak year of that decade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boom, the top 1 percent took home 24 percent of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income. In 2013, the top 1 percent nationally took home 20.1 percent of all income, while in five states (New York, Connecticut, Wyoming, Nevada and Florida) the income share for the top 1 percent exceeded the peak from 1928.To explain how the economy became so lopsided, the E.P.I. study compares the decades of rising inequality since 1979 with the era from 1928 to 1979, when inequality narrowed and the American middle class emerged, grew and prospered.In contrast, the decades since 1979 have been characterized by erosion of the minimum wage and overtime-pay standards, a decline in unionization and cultural and political acceptance of excessive executive pay.Rising inequality in the current economic recovery also has roots in politics and policy. Since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, the Fed has been consistent \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0and correct \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in trying to stimulate the economy by keeping interest rates low. But Congress backed off fiscal stimulus efforts starting as early as 2010, largely for partisan reasons that have nothing to do with the public interest. Loose Fed policy in the absence of loose fiscal policy tends to concentrate the benefit of stimulus among the already wealthy, resulting in wider inequality. A solution would be for Congress to stimulate the economy with more spending on infrastructure like roads, bridges and airports, which would create jobs and lift pay , helping to narrow income inequality. Unfortunately, the Republican-dominated Congress has not been willing to do what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to get the economy back on track.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barack Obama, the President of Black America?", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "OpinionWhat the haters and the hagiographers get wrong.Supported byIT was a crucial speech, high-stakes even for a man used to giving important speeches: The first black president of the United States had to acknowledge, and then bind up, the nation\u2019s racial wounds. A year ago, after the massacre of nine souls at prayer at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, Barack Obama traveled to Charleston, S.C., to eulogize its pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney.When Mr. Obama stood in the pulpit, I saw him as thrust into a peculiar position: He nobly assumed a symbolic, though not individual, guilt for the hate that had been visited on Charleston, largely because the white killer appeared to despise black progress, and there was no clearer representation of that progress than President Obama.To do that, the president brilliantly evoked grace as an antidote to hate and preached in a black style to forge healing and redemption. He ended with a stirring rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d As the call and response of the black church came full circle, Mr. Obama was at his best when he was at his blackest. It was a rare display of unapologetic race pride.We are now approaching the last months of the Obama era. He will be remembered as a great, but flawed, president, and many of those flaws have to do with how he has addressed race \u2014 or avoided doing so.In his first two years in office, President Obama performed herculean deeds in rescuing the banks, restoring the economy, bailing out the automobile industry and getting his signature health care legislation passed. It was an astonishing record of success despite bitter right-wing resistance to his presidency and the alarming racist reaction to a black man being in charge.I have twice worked hard to help get this president elected. I have known Barack Obama since the early 1990s, and for a time we belonged to the same church in Chicago. Watching him as president, I greatly admired how this highly intelligent and supremely confident figure managed the affairs of state with verve and swagger. No matter how much I disagreed with him about policy or politics I was deeply moved by his historic achievement. Still, I am frustrated. Because the president has hit some targets in the path to racial progress, but missed a great many as well. And that is not a sentiment I or other fellow black scholars, preachers and activists are supposed to express.That\u2019s because black America has carried on an unrepentant love affair with Mr. Obama.There is good reason to celebrate Mr. Obama\u2019s importance to black America. It is hard to overstate the symbolic significance and positive effects of a black man commanding the most celebrated seat of power. His black brain and tongue have changed America forever.But gales of black pride have swept aside awareness of his flaws, and when those flaws are conceded, gusts of black defiance play down their meaning and significance. Mr. Obama\u2019s most ardent black fans ignore how he often failed to speak about race or use his powers to convene commissions or issue executive orders to lessen black suffering; his nastiest black critics lambast him as an ineffectual leader who has done little to protect blacks from racial assault or lift them from economic misery. Neither the haters nor the hagiographers do the Obama legacy justice.Mr. Obama\u2019s failure to take to the bully pulpit on race unhappily coincided with the rise of racial demagogues. Part of the racist reaction to Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency has found its troubling apotheosis in Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s surprising run for the White House has amplified our country\u2019s worst racial instincts in a generation.It is unsurprising that the man who led the \u201cbirther\u201d movement disputing Mr. Obama\u2019s American citizenship should build a campaign that reflects elements of the \u201cbirther\u201d bigotry: anti-Muslim talk, xenophobia toward Mexicans and hostility toward blacks at his rallies. It\u2019s possible that if the president had spoken more forcefully on race, it might have blunted some of the bigotry that fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, or at least provided a compelling alternative to his vision of race. Now, in addition to working to get Hillary Clinton elected, Mr. Obama must more aggressively address the racism that he has never been eager to acknowledge or confront, and that thrives in deep pockets of the support for Mr. Trump.But where has that anger been?It has been my experience that Mr. Obama and his inner circle bristle at black efforts to hold him accountable on race. They have shown little ability to distinguish loving and thoughtful criticism from unprincipled attack. This approach has signaled admirers to view even reasonable dissent as racial treason.The Obama administration\u2019s resentment of black criticism hasn\u2019t kept it from tapping the deep well of black solidarity. Thus it is a one-way street: African-Americans should never bother as a group to request that Mr. Obama be held accountable as a black man, yet the Obama administration has from the start skillfully exploited the always strong support for the president.If the president might reasonably fend off some criticism by noting that Congress has limited what he can accomplish, it is distressing to see what he has made of the powers he has: cabinet and Supreme Court nominations and the ability to use the presidency to highlight racial injustice.It is true that he brought us the first black attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., but he largely skimped on black cabinet appointments until pressured by black politicians to name more African-Americans in his second term. A few months after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, the Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, Marcia Fudge, scolded him for the lack of diversity in his second-term cabinet choices. At the start of his second term Mr. Obama had appointed nine new cabinet members, including three women and one Latino. Mr. Obama eventually named Anthony R. Foxx as transportation secretary and Mel Watt as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 and added Jeh Johnson as secretary of homeland security, John King Jr. as education secretary and Loretta Lynch as successor to Mr. Holder. It\u2019s a respectable tally, but it doesn\u2019t break any of his predecessors\u2019 records.The president justly boasts of his record of diverse appointments to the federal bench. On the Supreme Court, however, he has unfortunately passed up three opportunities to nominate the first black woman to the court. \u201cBut at no point did I say: \u2018Oh, you know what? I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot. Can you find me one?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said in April, referring to the Illinois hometown of Merrick B. Garland, his latest, and stalled, nominee to the Supreme Court. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a white guy, but he\u2019s a really outstanding jurist. I\u2019m sorry. I mean, you know, I think that\u2019s important.\u201d Diversity appears to be set off against quality in Mr. Obama\u2019s thinking, a common mistake also made by opponents of diversity.Beyond appointments, the president\u2019s reluctance to highlight black suffering is lamentable. He seems capable only of being forced to do for black citizens what he willingly does for others. For instance, Mr. Obama traveled to Newtown, Conn., two days after the shooting deaths of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He later called that the worst day of his presidency. Yet he had to be prodded to return to his home base, Chicago, as it suffered a rash of black death.On that visit, Mr. Obama lamented the absence of male role models, claiming that government alone couldn\u2019t end violence because \u201cthis is not just a gun issue\u201d but an issue of \u201cthe kinds of communities that we\u2019re building\u201d and that when \u201ca child opens fire on another child, there is a hole in that child\u2019s heart that government can\u2019t fill.\u201d This was mourning mixed with scolding; in Newtown, there were no reprimands for the grieving.It has been dispiriting, too, to hear the president remind his most loyal constituents that he is \u201cnot the president of black America\u201d \u2014 as if they were na\u00efve enough to believe that he represented only, or primarily, black interests. Mr. Obama may not be the president of black America, but he is the president of black Americans, and he owes them the same regard he has for all citizens. He went to New Jersey just a few days after Hurricane Sandy hit. Yet in the face of a more complex, government-made disaster, he took months to make it to Flint, Mich., where thousands of poor black residents are dealing with contaminated drinking water with less immediate federal support than the hurricane victims were offered.The president has been guided by a view of race that may be termed strategic inadvertency. He believes policies should not be shaped with a view to helping blacks specifically, but supports ideas from which they are likely to benefit. This reflects his faith in universal rather than targeted remedies for black suffering: Blacks will thrive when America flourishes. \u201cI do think that the discussion about targeted strategies versus broad-based strategies is probably the central fault line around which I may be criticized by African-American leaders,\u201d the president told me in an Oval Office interview in 2010. \u201cI really am very confident I\u2019m right on it.\u201d He said that this concept guided how he thought he should govern as president: \u201cI\u2019ve got to look out for all Americans, and do things based on what will help people across the board who are vulnerable and who need help.\u201dBut even the famed sociologist William Julius Wilson, whom Mr. Obama credits as influencing his views on this subject, has changed his mind. In his 2009 work \u201cMore Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City,\u201d he argued that we should underscore \u201cspecific issues of race and poverty.\u201d Mr. Obama would have been wise to do the same.President Obama is an extraordinary figure who has done some good things in bad times, and some great things under impossible circumstances. As the first black president he has faced enormous difficulties and has had to weather a steady downpour of bad faith from the right wing and racist resistance from bigoted quarters of the country. He has been torn between America\u2019s noble ideals of democracy and its cruel realities of race \u2014 a tension he rode into office, and one that occasionally defeated his desire to reconcile the best and worst halves of the nation he governs.Mr. Obama\u2019s presence in office has reflected our most hopeful embrace of change, even as it throws light on the deeply entrenched bigotry that would reverse such change. He has been reluctant to speak about race, and hesitant to champion the causes of a valuable, if vulnerable, black constituency. He was not always free to relax into his blackness, out of fear that it would frighten white America. There was a lot he couldn\u2019t do. But because of what he did do, the road will undoubtedly be easier for the next black president.Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown, is the author of \u201cThe Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Is Hitting the Road Again", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Gas is cheaper than it has been in over a decade, and a nation weary of cutting back is getting behind the wheel and spending to make road trip memories.Supported byON ROUTE 66 IN NEW MEXICO \u2014 Bob Pack forgot to bring his James Taylor CDs. Still, he and his brother and sister were having a blast, rolling among the sandstone mesas, ghost towns and kitschy tourist attractions.They reminisced about family trips as children back in the 1950s, Mr. Pack and his sister, Joann, said, and not even their brother\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d habits of chewing tobacco and telling dirty jokes could ruin the drive. \u201cI wanted to see West Texas one more time,\u201d he said over breakfast at the Route 66 Casino Hotel.Over in Arizona, Kay McNellen, a 23-year-old actress from San Diego, said she took to the highway almost every weekend these days, just to see how far she could drive. She has motored across the Mojave Desert, admired Sequoia National Forest and Instagrammed the Grand Canyon. \u201cThis is a better view than Netflix will give you,\u201d she said.The great American road trip is back.It\u2019s partly that gasoline this driving season is cheaper than it has been in 11 years, according to the AAA motor club, and that the reviving economy is making people more willing to part with their money. But there is more than that at play here. This may be a cultural shift, as Americans experiment with the notion that maybe money can, in fact, buy happiness, at least in the form of adventures and memories.It is a change that appears to have taken root in the years since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cPostrecession, people are focused on memories that cannot be taken away from them, as opposed to tangible goods that expire and wear out,\u201d said Sarah Quinlan, a marketing executive at MasterCard Advisors. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you can take away my job, you can take away my home, but you can\u2019t take away my memory.\u201dWhatever their motivation, Americans last year drove a record 3.15 trillion miles, according to the Department of Transportation, beating the previous mark, set in 2007. So far this year, both travel and gasoline consumption are up again.The desire to get behind the wheel still comes as something of a surprise. The conventional wisdom was that driving mileage had probably peaked in 2007. The demographic bulge represented by the baby boomers is aging out of the driving years; people typically drive less as they hit retirement.At the same time, millennials were not sharing the passion for the open road that previous generations of young adults had. Many, in fact, preferred to live in the nation\u2019s downtowns, eschewing personal cars in favor of shared Ubers, or walking to their work and play.But it turns out that both generations are driving more than anyone expected. \u201cA lot of millennial behavior was really deferred assimilation,\u201d said Steven E. Polzin, a transportation researcher at the University of South Florida. In other words, just like Mom and Dad, they were destined for a more traditional lifestyle \u2014 the marriage, the home, the garage \u2014 they just took a little longer to get there.One such millennial is Jenna Bivone, a 29-year-old website and app designer, who two years ago left downtown Atlanta to live on the outskirts of the city with her boyfriend. \u201cWe used to walk everywhere, but the rents were too high and we wanted some land for my dog,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a more suburban area we found good schools, stuff like that for future plans.\u201dNow she has a daily commute of at least a half-hour each way, and on weekends she and her boyfriend drive around Georgia and neighboring states looking for the best hiking. Over the last three years they have taken road trips in Wyoming and Colorado to hike in the national parks.\u201cWhen we travel we want to go to places we might never see again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be young forever.\u201dMichael McNulty, a 67-year-old biotech executive from San Francisco, might not agree with the last part of her statement. Last year he bought a used Ford Airstream B-190 motor home on Craigslist for $13,000 as an experiment. He and his wife are enjoying the road trips, he said, and they are gradually extending their radius.\u201cThe kids\u2019 colleges are paid for, and they are out of the house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been all over the world, and now we are seeing the U.S.A.\u201dMr. McNulty did all the driving to the Grand Canyon for an extended weekend in April, and he prepared to drive all the way back home, 14 hours, in one day. The reason was simple, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go for it on Tuesday,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cbecause I have to get back to work on Wednesday.\u201dThe phenomenon is being further amplified by, of all things, a desire in some families for cross-generational adventures that harks back to a halcyon age of bundling everyone into the station wagon, counting license tags from faraway states, and mediating back-seat fights over who started the fight. Baby boomers, it seems, want to bond with their grandchildren on the road. Rental-car companies are reporting increased demand for bigger vehicles to accommodate the generations.Along Route 66 recently, near the parking lot of Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona, Rita Bandy, a 62-year-old widow from Philadelphia, Tenn., described having just such an experience driving cross-country with her 11-year-old grandson last summer. \u201cHe and I together, it was just so wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw him so happy, laughing and joking with me.\u201dMs. Bandy pointed out that she had plenty of toys at home \u2014 a pool, a motorcycle. \u201cI have everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I want now is memories with my grandchildren, and to let them see that I was fun, and not just old.\u201dLast year\u2019s trip with her grandson was so great that her older sister Vicky said she was jealous and wanted to do the same thing. So this spring \u2014 along with their third sister, Gail, and two husbands, all retired \u2014 they piled into a Toyota van to take the classic American road trip, Route 66. After visiting Branson, Mo., and a cowboy museum in Oklahoma City, they stopped at the Petrified Forest on their way to California.\u201cI always wanted to see the Pacific Ocean \u2014 and now we\u2019re doing it!\u201d Ms. Bandy said just before entering the national park.Few, perhaps, carry a sense of wanderlust as far as Anne Utech, a 36-year-old federal employee, who found herself along Route 66 one recent Friday after visiting the giant meteor crater in northern Arizona. A year ago, she gave up her Houston apartment to go on the road full time in her pearl white Nissan Altima, which she has named Pearl. A copy of the Ralph Waldo Emerson essay \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d sat on the passenger seat.\u201cI do my best thinking while driving,\u201d said Ms. Utech, who works from her laptop and stays with friends or at hotels or takes short-term rentals along the way. Most of all, she says, \u201cI like to get lost, and Pearl is my best friend.\u201dAll of this has been good news for the hotels, restaurants, theme parks and other destinations that depend on travelers\u2019 rolling up on four wheels. Attendance at national parks last year reached 300 million for the first time. The 5.5 million who visited the Grand Canyon in 2015, for example, was a 16 percent increase from the year before, and park officials project a similar increase this year. On one recent weekend, during spring break, the car line at the south entrance was two and a half miles long, a wait that local rangers said was extremely rare.Theme parks are also reporting strong business, with attendance up by about 2.5 percent in 2015, according to initial estimates. Industry experts project a 2.9 percent increase this year over last.NBC Universal just opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction at its Hollywood theme park, which was estimated to cost $500 million, and it is just one of several recent expansions of tourist destinations in California \u2014 including Disneyland in Anaheim and Legoland California in Carlsbad. Buc-ee\u2019s, a convenience store chain, just got approval from Katy, Tex., to build a gas station the size of a football field with 100 pumps along Interstate 10.Part of the driving phenomenon can be explained by the improving job market and more commuting, but far from all of it. Public transit use was down slightly last year from 2014, while every driver averaged 2.6 percent more miles on the road. Rural and highway travel was particularly up. And early indications point to an acceleration of the trends this year.Changes like these come at an inopportune moment, given the commitment by the United States to make steep reductions in carbon emissions after the Paris climate accord last year. The fact remains that coming to terms with climate change, experts say, means people must burn less petroleum in the future. With Americans driving more miles at lower cost \u2014 and in bigger S.U.V.s, recreational vehicles and trucks \u2014 that goal is going to be harder to reach, at least in the short term.According to Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, most of the increased driving can be accounted for by the steep decline in prices at the pump. Gasoline prices have fallen more than 50 percent in the last two years, he said, saving the average household with two cars as much as $1,000 a year.New models of cars and light trucks, which under federal rules must nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025 to 54.5 miles per gallon, \u201cwill more than offset the behavioral increase of more driving,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 10 years vehicles will be consuming half as much fuel as they do today.\u201dFuel prices certainly figured in Frank Claeys\u2019s decision to take a 10-day road trip with his wife and two sons during their spring break. They were originally just planning to drive to Utah for some backpacking. But with a gallon of gas cheaper than some candy bars these days, they decided to stretch the journey all the way to the Texas Panhandle.\u201cWe were less tight,\u201d said Mr. Claeys, a 40-year-old police officer from Gaylord, Mich., as his children bought ice cream and shopped for polished stones at a roadside trading post in New Mexico. \u201cAt $2 a gallon, I don\u2019t cringe at the pump.\u201dAaron Conley, the 35-year-old owner of a Cincinnati lawn landscape company, has been taking long road trips with his girlfriend, Michelle Mercer, a bartender from Burlington, Ky. This year they drove to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, then took a swing around the Gulf Coast to Port Arthur, Tex.; Lake Charles and Baton Rouge, La.; and finally the Florida Panhandle.On a recent trip they flew to Las Vegas and then drove to the Hoover Dam; the Grand Canyon; Sedona, Ariz.; and finally Death Valley, Calif. \u201cWhen gas was $4 a gallon, we didn\u2019t travel at all,\u201d he said, recalling the early years of the couple\u2019s six-year relationship.And \u2014 in one sign of how quickly things could change again \u2014 they almost didn\u2019t make it to the Grand Canyon this spring. The reason? They discovered that prices were not quite as low as they thought. \u201cWhen we saw gas was $2.25 a gallon here, that was at the tipping point,\u201d he said of the difference between prices in northern Arizona and the $1.70 he had been seeing back home.Ms. Mercer was quick to agree. \u201cI\u2019d rather not spend a lot of money on gas,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weighted by Debt, Puerto Ricans Divided Over Federal Oversight", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byCAGUAS, P.R. \u2014 Standing at his lottery ticket concession in this town speckled with graceful colonial-era buildings, F\u00e9lix Mu\u00f1iz Rivera said the island\u2019s economic meltdown had proved one thing amid all the uncertainty: Puerto Rico\u2019s political leaders, no matter the party, could not be trusted to pull the commonwealth out of the quagmire they created.\u201cThe politicians, red and blue, have stolen this country; they have finished this country,\u201d said Mr. Mu\u00f1iz, 74, who grew up here and helped inaugurate this now half-closed pedestrian mall where he runs his business. \u201cWhen a patient is sick, he needs medicine. When a patient is in critical condition, he needs intensive care. That\u2019s what the junta is.\u201dBut as the House on Thursday takes up a contentious White House-backed bill to establish the independent board, Puerto Ricans are sharply divided over the legislation as they try to decide what is worse: the homegrown leaders whom they feel have failed them, or a federally appointed independent board that many distrust.So while there is widespread backing here for the bill, there is a strong and vocal opposition, including by those elected officials who would be forced to govern with a control board looking over their shoulders, union officials, many young people and artists, and advocates for Puerto Rican independence.In their view, the bill would benefit the hedge funds that lent Puerto Rico the money, not Puerto Rico. And they argue that the island\u2019s fate, its laws and regulations, should not be trumped by people who, for the most part, will not be Puerto Rican and will know little about the intricacies of life on the island.If approved by Congress, the board would be run by seven members selected by President Obama from candidates proffered by Republicans and Democrats in Congress. At least one of the seven members must be a resident of Puerto Rico.Coursing through the opposition movement is frustration and an infuriating feeling that the federal government believes Puerto Rico incapable of fixing its own problems without paternalistic intervention. It speaks loudly to Puerto Rico\u2019s longstanding, emotionally fraught conflict over its in-between status as a United States commonwealth, neither state nor independent country.Colonia, or colony, is the word most often bandied about here. For the most part, Puerto Ricans on the island, who are all American citizens, simultaneously embrace their ties to the mainland and complain about their stepchild status.\u201cThe message the bill carries is that we can\u2019t handle it; we don\u2019t have the tools,\u201d said Janiel Gonz\u00e1lez, 33, an artist who owns a grass-roots gallery in the pedestrian mall, Paseo Gautier Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIf the board was coming to put all the politicians who robbed us in prison, well, let them come. But they are coming to control our money.\u201dAnd yet supporters of the bill said controlling where the money goes is exactly the point; political leaders and their appointees have proved themselves unable to handle the job. Without the bill, what is the alternative? More of the same? Allowing a federal judge to decide the lawsuits, which would most likely favor bondholders and not the people of Puerto Rico?\u201cPeople want to know where the money goes,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Osorio Correa, 61, who has seen her hours at Sam\u2019s Club cut six months ago from 28 to 16 a week, with no benefits. \u201cIf the junta comes, the politicians will have to do what the junta says. We are tired of those jackasses.\u201dThe situation is only expected to get worse. On July 1, Puerto Rico will miss its next debt payment, $2 billion, to bondholders, many of them American citizens. Without the legislation, more lawsuits are bound to follow.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.But there are flash points: The board would hold veto power over government officials if their proposals threatened to financially hurt the island. The legislation gives the governor the power, unlikely to be used, to reduce the federal minimum wage for young people. And it allows for the sale of Puerto Rican assets.\u201cIt could be as good as you can get,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if as good as it can get is not going to fix the problem, then what\u2019s the purpose?\u201dPresident Obama and his administration have been emphasizing in recent days that the legislation, which would also ensure the viability of Puerto Rico\u2019s public pension funds, is critical to the island\u2019s financial health. \u201cHe made absolutely clear that there is no \u2018Plan B\u2019 here,\u201d said Pedro Pierluisi, the departing resident commissioner, after a meeting with Mr. Obama on Wednesday.But the bill, a result of intense compromise, faces challenges in the House and the Senate. Democrats want to see more done for Puerto Rico\u2019s working class. Republicans are nervous that it does not do enough for creditors, who lobbied vigorously against it.Sitting at her jewelry kiosk at the pedestrian mall, Sylvette Villafa\u00f1e-Ru\u00edz said she was torn. But, for her, opening the door to the control board boiled down to this: \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a bill to create a federal control board to oversee a reboot of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy referred incorrectly to the sovereign status of Puerto Rico. It is a commonwealth, not a country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drought Selfies and Drought Suicides", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byOpinionMUMBAI, India \u2014 When 2-year-old Rutuja playfully tipped over a bottle, spilling water onto the mud floor of the family\u2019s shack, her mother, Nageshwari Rathore, let loose a screech, lunging forward as though to slap the toddler. Ms. Rathore stopped herself, sinking her head into her hands. \u201cYou finished it,\u201d she whispered.The loss wrenched at the 25-year-old. That June morning she had stood in line in the scorching heat for over an hour to collect five liters of water. A government tanker rolls up once a day to the abandoned field where she now lives.Located in Ghatkopar, a Mumbai suburb, the field functions as a relief camp for 350 families who have left their villages in rural Maharashtra because of a drought, the worst in 100 years. Wild pigs root through the open sewer that runs alongside the Rathores\u2019 tarpaulin shack. When the monsoon arrives, possibly in the next few days, it will flood the camp and force the family out.Rural Indians are falling behind even as urban Indians enjoy unprecedented prosperity. And the tragedies that befall the poor benefit the more affluent. Forced to migrate to the cities, displaced farmers have little option but to join the enormous, unorganized labor force that serves the urban middle class as construction and domestic workers.Shau Chavan, who has been living in the camp for two months, said that government help had increased. In previous years, a local mafia had charged 1,000 rupees a month ($15) \u2014 about 2.5 days of the migrants\u2019 daily wages \u2014 for a plot of 40 square feet. This year, Ms. Chavan said, the farmers are living rent-free, most likely as a result of government intervention.Government failure stems from institutional disregard for the poor. Almost 70 percent of Indians live in rural areas, but the government doesn\u2019t appear to view them as essential to India\u2019s march to modernize. The spiraling number of suicides suggests that farmers\u2019 despair is not resonating with politicians.Even after eight states declared a drought last year, the government in Delhi failed to increase support for two programs created to act as lifesaving buffers: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which promises every household 100 days of paid employment annually, and the Public Distribution System, which delivers subsidized grains and fuel to the needy.Government investment in the employment program has decreased since 2014, the year the B.J.P. came to power, and fewer jobs were created than before. Because of corruption in the food program, rations earmarked for the poor are often sold on the black market instead.The government\u2019s neglect is rivaled only by its officials\u2019 flippant attitude.The next day, the water conservation minister, Pankaja Munde, showed up, and tweeted photographs of herself grinning in front of a parched riverbed.Sonia Faleiro is the author of \u201cBeautiful Thing: Inside the Secret World of Bombay\u2019s Dance Bars\u201d and a founding member of the global journalism cooperative Deca.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Gold Curtain of Donald Trump\u2019s R\u00e9sum\u00e9", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyAndrew Beal, a billionaire banker and investor, called me the other day to talk Trump. I had been leaving messages for every prominent business executive I could find who has publicly expressed support of the Republican candidate.Before I could ask my first question, Beal told me he wanted to get something out of the way. He knew that I would ask about specifics. \u201cEverybody wants to be real specific,\u201d he said. But Beal\u2019s support for Trump has nothing to do with specifics. He grants that he doesn\u2019t know much about Trump\u2019s policy goals or about whom he might choose for key economic positions. He doesn\u2019t even think Trump knows. And that, he explained, is exactly why he supports him. \u201cAll these politicians with all these specific plans,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s total [expletive].\u201dHis point was that business doesn\u2019t run this way: If you\u2019re hiring someone to be a chief executive, you don\u2019t ask them to lay out every decision they\u2019ll make, years ahead of when they\u2019ll make it. You hire someone whom you trust, and you let them run things. Beal says he knows that Trump will do the right things to make the economy perform better. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say, \u2018How?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. I know that sounds crazy. That\u2019s how the real world operates.\u201dNow that Trump has sewn up the nomination, a looming question is whether he can consolidate the support of business people behind him. During the last election cycle, Mitt Romney\u2019s business background was a major reason he became the candidate of choice for corporate America; he received huge donations from nearly every major bank, many business-advocacy groups and countless chief executives. But at least so far, such eminences have failed to rally around Trump. The only large corporate donor named in his federal election filings is Aon, the insurance giant; when I called its public-relations office, a seemingly exasperated spokeswoman wanted to make very clear that one employee had given that money and that it did not reflect the views of the company.I asked Trump\u2019s campaign for a list of prominent businesspeople and chief executives who have endorsed him. I was emailed a quote from Trump. \u201cI have too many to mention,\u201d it read. \u201cI get along with everybody.\u201d After further prodding, a campaign spokeswoman provided a list of 10 names, including the chief executives of Nascar and Marvel, as well as several other businesspeople, like Rupert Murdoch and Jack Welch, who opposed Trump for most of the campaign but have recently (and not especially enthusiastically) made statements about party unity.Does he? By many accounts, Mitt Romney did. Romney was an undeniable superstar in the field of private equity, and former business associates praised him as someone who could see a business problem more clearly than others and create powerful, profitable solutions. The professional biography of Trump, by contrast \u2014 though the man is clearly exceptional at something \u2014 hardly inspires such confidence.Trump\u2019s primary claim to fame is as a Manhattan real-estate developer. He inherited this profession (and his economic worldview) from his father. But it\u2019s worth stressing that within the world of Manhattan real estate, Trump is a relatively minor player. Yes, there are about a dozen buildings in New York City that bear his name, but nearly all are branding relationships, not actual ownership. He sits so far down the pecking order of Manhattan real estate that Adam Pincus, head of research at the industry publication The Real Deal, doesn\u2019t recall ever including Trump or his companies in their major rankings of developers, owners or property managers. Likewise, Trump\u2019s importance in the industry of casinos and luxury resorts is far below what his public reputation might suggest. After multiple bankruptcies, Trump no longer owns any casinos; he owns only nine hotels, with three more said to be \u201ccoming soon.\u201dThrough Trump Productions, he has enjoyed remarkable success with his TV show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d But of course, that series does not fundamentally belong to him: It was created by Mark Burnett, who cast Trump in the lead. And while Trump\u2019s television franchise at least enjoyed one successful idea before petering out, most of his brand-specific businesses have simply failed outright. The frenetic, panicky way in which he thrusts his name on different products pell-mell \u2014 steaks and ties and wine and bottled water and suits and fragrance \u2014 has engendered what any corporate branding expert would call \u201cbrand confusion.\u201d (What are you communicating when you wear a Trump-branded suit \u2014 $143 on Amazon \u2014 to a job interview? That you are brash and ambitious? Cocky on the cheap? Or that you don\u2019t know much about suits?)His scattershot approach to branding might also hint at cash-flow issues. As a certified billionaire, Mark Cuban recently said in a radio interview: \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting your name on steaks, you\u2019re putting your name on water, you\u2019re putting your name on playing cards, you\u2019re putting your name on all this nonsense, right, you\u2019re not going to make big bucks, no matter what.\u201d He recalls asking Trump: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Are you that desperate for money?\u201d Based on his read of Trump\u2019s election filings, which showed only $165 million in liquid assets, Cuban harbors doubts about whether Trump is even a billionaire as he claims.Recent revelations about Trump University, the failed for-profit college that Trump founded in 2005, have centered around the savagely cynical manner in which sales reps separated students from their money, with an array of high-pressure tactics that included encouraging financially challenged prospects to open up new credit-card accounts in order to pay. But the more striking question is Cuban\u2019s: why a man with as much money as Trump claims to have, presiding over as many successful ventures as Trump claims to own, would stoop to start up a boiler-room business like Trump University, squeezing out revenues from would-be students a few thousand dollars at a time. The fact that he did \u2014 even if that decision doesn\u2019t point, as Cuban suggests, to an outright desperation for cash \u2014 speaks volumes about Trump\u2019s utter inability to calibrate risk and reward.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Notes on Brexit", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "I guess it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to weigh in on an issue I have mostly been avoiding: Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vote on whether to leave the EU, aka Brexit.Not to keep you in suspense: if I had a vote, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d vote \u00e2\u0080\u009cremain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as enthusiastic as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if \u00e2\u0080\u009cremain\u00e2\u0080\u009d wins, as I hope it does, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still feel a sense of dread about what the future holds.Why? Some notes on the issue:2.On top of these conventional losses, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the special issue of the City of London, which looms very large in the British economy thanks to huge exports of financial services to the rest of Europe. The City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role, like that of other financial centers, rests on hard-to-model agglomeration economies. Would the frictions and extra costs of Brexit hurt the City sufficiently to undermine its role, at big cost to the UK? Nobody knows, but if so that could add a lot to the economic costs.3.Pay no attention to claims that Britain, freed from EU rules, could achieve spectacular growth via deregulation. You say to-mah-to, I say voodoo, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no better than the US version.4.On the other hand, I would greatly discount claims about dramatic financial crisis or whatever. Maybe the pound would fall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but for a country that borrows in its own currency and has an excessive current account deficit, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing.5.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also true that the economic impact of Brexit would fall quite differently on different groups within Britain. The City and those whose incomes are tied to its fortunes would probably lose badly, but some regions of the country might actually benefit from a weaker pound. 6.Despite such distributional issues, the straight economics is pretty clearly on the side of Remain. Why, then, am I at all ambivalent? Because the EU is so dysfunctional, and seems utterly resistant to improvement.7.The euro is the most obvious case: it was a mistake in the first place, and this mistake was greatly compounded by the handling of the post-2009 crisis. A big technical problem of adjustment after a sudden stop in capital flows was turned into a morality play requiring destructive austerity. And there is no hint outside the ECB that any of the major players have learned anything from the debacle.8.But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the euro. The EU seems unable to come to grips with migration issues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just the refugee crisis, but the interaction among extensive welfare states, large internal income disparities, and open borders. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure anti-European forces are exaggerating the burden created for Britain by migrants from eastern Europe, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a flash point to which the EU doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem able to respond.9.So something has to give. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to imagine that a close Brexit vote in favor of Remain would be a wake-up call \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but there have been many such calls in recent years, and nothing seems to happen.10.And yet, and yet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the European project has been a source of tremendous good in the world, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still very important. The EU has historically been a key force, not just for increased trade, but for democratization. Even when it falls short, as it has when dealing with the rise of authoritarianism in Hungary and now Poland, the EU and its institutions are an important restraint. If Brexit greatly damages the European project, it would open the door to a lot of ugliness.11.So I would vote Remain, but with some feelings of despair, because what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be voting to remain with is a system that desperately needs reform but shows little sign of reforming.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

As president of China, Mr. Xi also serves as general secretary of the Communist Party. Mr. Choe was subsequently among the many foreign guests at China\u2019s major military parade last September.Mr. Ri, who was recently elevated to North Korea\u2019s Politburo, came to Beijing to report on the outcome of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party congress in early May, Chinese analysts said.But he apparently also came to try to mend the frayed strategic ties between the two countries. The Xinhua report said that Mr. Ri gave Mr. Xi a \u201cverbal message\u201d from Mr. Kim that stressed his desire to \u201cstrengthen and develop the traditional friendly relationship.\u201dAt the Workers\u2019 Party congress, Mr. Kim said the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal would create \u201cpeace and stability\u201d on the Korean Peninsula, while Mr. Xi has mentioned his desire for the peninsula to be rid of nuclear weapons on several occasions.\u201cWe will stay firm on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia in Beijing in April.North Korea faces tough economic conditions under sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and Mr. Ri\u2019s visit was also probably aimed at trying to soften China\u2019s enforcement of the measures, analysts said. China is the biggest benefactor of the North\u2019s rudimentary economy.The sudden meeting on Wednesday came ahead of a visit to Beijing by Secretary of State John Kerry next week for the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China. The Obama administration considers China\u2019s enforcement of United Nations sanctions on North Korea, imposed as punishment for its nuclear program, vital to their success.The United States has praised China for agreeing to the sanctions. It has also pointed to cooperation over North Korea as one of the areas where the two countries can work together, even as relations grow more fraught.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan in His Labyrinth", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a large labyrinth. As he drifts from room to room \u2014 and there are about 1,000 of them in his new Ankara palace \u2014 Erdogan no doubt has time to reflect on Turkey\u2019s travails and perhaps ponder how events can escape the control of even the most megalomaniacal ruler.Here\u2019s a sobering thought: Erdogan, the would-be leader of the Sunni world, after 13 years in power, alone in his vast palace with his neo-Ottoman dream in shreds and Turkish society polarized to the point of violence.Most of the victims then were Kurds. Mystery still surrounds the bombing.For Erdogan, the word \u201cterrorist\u201d chiefly denotes the Kurdish militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., which has fought an intermittent insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s.In Turkey\u2019s southeast, many towns are under curfew. Erdogan is waging a relentless campaign against the Kurds in the shadow of the Syrian war. Kurdish territorial inroads and self-government in northern Syria have awoken the darkest specter in the Turkish psyche: a border-straddling Kurdistan.ISIS, by comparison, has been an object of ambivalence. Erdogan has played a double game.For a long time he allowed ISIS recruits to move across Turkey and over the border to the Islamic State\u2019s Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. Given a choice between the terrorists of the Islamic State in northern Syria and what, for him, are the Syrian-Kurdish terrorists of the P.K.K.-affiliated Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D (and its associated militia, the Y.P.G.), the Turkish president has no doubt who is more menacing.ISIS has had anti-Kurdish uses for Erdogan. By contrast, the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, known as Rojava, is only trouble from a Turkish perspective. That the Y.P.G. has, in effect, been America\u2019s most effective ground force against ISIS complicates Erdogan\u2019s position. Turkey is a NATO ally opposed to America\u2019s anti-ISIS Syrian-Kurdish alliance.Welcome to the Middle East. I hope everything is clear in this Kurdish alphabet soup (I have not even mentioned Turkey\u2019s Kurdish-dominated Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., out of deference to you, dear reader.) If all is fog, please at least retain the following:Erdogan has found himself in a terrible neighborhood, his country destabilized by more than five years of war in Syria and the millions of refugees pouring across the border. He has been frustrated, with reason, by President Obama\u2019s unwillingness to back with a coherent policy his statement in 2011 that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must \u201cstep aside.\u201d But, in the end, Turkey\u2019s descent into violence is of Erdogan\u2019s own creation.Prickly and erratic, he has perceived enemies everywhere \u2014 in the press (whose freedom he has stifled), among former business allies, in the secular Turkey that resists his increasingly unbridled attempts to advance an Islamist agenda. Turning his back on years of attempted reconciliation with the Kurds, he has adopted an uncompromising brutality. Seeing his power threatened, he was prepared to countenance violence to instill an atmosphere of fear in the run up to last year\u2019s November election, so that he could emerge as strongman-savior.Borrowing from Vladimir Putin\u2019s playbook, Erdogan has gone through the alternating-office routine \u2014 in his case, prime minister to president \u2014 in order to render the Constitution pliant to his appetite for power. Forsaking diplomacy for braggadocio, he has gotten into fights with Israel, with Egypt, with Russia, to the point that Turkey\u2019s economy was reeling and he found himself obliged to apologize to Russia and settle differences with Israel in recent days.Above all, Erdogan has contrived to turn Turkey \u2014 the poster child of moderate democratic Islam not so many years ago \u2014 into a divided and combustible country where the Erdogan personality cult grows daily at the expense of freedom. It was typical of the Erdogan order that access to Twitter and Facebook was cut off for hours in the aftermath of the airport attack.In doing all this, Erdogan knew that he has the United States and Europe where he wants them. For strategic reasons (military for America; refugees for Europe), they need Erdogan more than he needs them. So he does what he wants \u2014 with dire consequences.Funny how the \u201czero problems\u201d foreign policy of early \u201cneo-Ottomanism\u201d morphed into a very problematic reality: Erdogan has reaped the bitter harvest of his machinations.I grieve for the victims of the terrorist attack at Ataturk airport. It was in many ways a bloodbath foretold.Advertisement"}

Referendum", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Supporters of a British exit from the European Union opened up a substantial lead over advocates of staying in the bloc as the nation tallied the votes early Friday on one of its most momentous decisions in generations.With more than half of towns and cities reporting, the so-called Leave campaign was leading by more than 700,000 votes out of more than 24 million that had been counted, an advantage of 51.6 percent to 48.4 percent over the Remain campaign, according to the BBC.\u201cDare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,\u201d Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a.m., denouncing the \u201clies, corruption and deceit\u201d that he said elites in both major parties \u2014 Conservative and Labour \u2014 had peddled.The vote was still too close to call, and Remain supporters were not giving up. But as Thursday night turned to Friday morning, the results were consistently giving hope to the Leave campaign while inducing deep worry among supporters of staying in Europe, starting with Prime Minister David Cameron.The early results startled the financial markets, which gyrated wildly after initially banking on a victory for the Remain campaign. At one point the value of the pound plummeted to $1.36 from $1.50, the sharpest one-day drop on record.Officials were busily counting some 33.6 million ballots cast Thursday by an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters at the conclusion of a campaign that amounted to a fierce debate over sovereignty, national identity, immigration and trade.The Leave campaign did better than anticipated in areas it had expected to win, particularly in northeast England, and picked up Swansea, a Welsh city it had not expected to win.The Remain campaign performed well in the inner London boroughs of Wandsworth, Lambeth, Hammersmith and Fulham, but it barely carried Newcastle upon Tyne, a university town it had expected to dominate.Proponents of staying in the European Union started the night in a confident mood, especially after Mr. Farage suggested that he was not optimistic about victory.The first indication that the outcome might be closer than some of the late polling suggested came from one of the first sizable areas to report, as the Leave campaign did even better than expected in Sunderland, a working-class community in the northeast.Voting lasted from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., though some particularly crowded poll sites stayed open longer to accommodate voters still in line to cast their ballots.Britons will make a momentous choice on Thursday that could matter more for their future than any ordinary election.In the deprived town of Oldham, near Manchester, a traditional stronghold of the Labour Party, Lisa Kirk, 43, said she and her family had been swayed by the U.K. Independence Party, which opposes Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, and expressed disenchantment with British leaders. \u201cThey\u2019re just letting all the foreigners in, and there is nothing left in the system for us,\u201d she said.In the 18th-century spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, in the picturesque Kent countryside, Michael Selway, 54, expressed worry about the future of European integration. \u201cThis project was set up by people who had fantastic intentions \u2014 no more war \u2014 and now it might all come to a crashing end,\u201d he said.Britain is voting on whether to remain in the European Union. How many countries are in the bloc? Can the queen vote? Test your knowledge of these and other important questions.Older voters are seen as being particularly disenchanted with the European Union, and younger voters more attracted to the possibility of studying and working on the Continent. But there were many exceptions.Helen Lickerman, 67, said there was a general tendency to move away from European integration. \u201cNever mind the ins and outs of the economy,\u201d she said at an interview at St. Giles Cripplegate Church in the Barbican, a residential and arts complex in the City of London, the capital\u2019s financial district. \u201cThere\u2019s a general feeling of being part of a community, and the history, the past wars, is something we don\u2019t want anymore.\u201dNear Paddington Station just north of Hyde Park, Yamini Mathur, a 41-year-old Londoner, said that voters had been more confused than enlightened by the blizzard of claims and counterclaims made during a series of debates. \u201cWe do not have all the answers, we do not have all the information, but I guess we will just have to go with all the information we have,\u201d she said.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe Stronger In campaign has at times struggled to make a positive case for the 28-nation bloc, instead focusing on the economic hit that Britain \u2014 the bloc\u2019s second-largest economy, after Germany \u2014 would sustain if it lost access to a common market of more than 500 million people. Even enthusiasts acknowledge that the European Union, with its cumbersome governance, is hard to love, though they say it has helped to unite a Continent that nearly destroyed itself in two world wars.Reporting was contributed by Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Oldham, England; Alison Smale from Royal Tunbridge Wells, England; and Pauline Bock, Stephen Castle and Iliana Magra from London.Advertisement"}

In Sichuan Province, another liberal activist, Chen Yunfei, who advocates the remembrance of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, is expected to stand trial on the charge on Thursday.Mr. Lu, a native of the southwestern province of Guizhou, is a former migrant worker who has used data gleaned from social media and other online platforms to collate information on labor protests. He has published his findings on his social media accounts.Those accounts are often deleted by censors, and the police have questioned him at home before.\u201cHe lives in Dali but is quite low profile,\u201d Mr. Wei said, also by phone. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t publish much of his personal information online.\u201dMr. Wei said he visited Ms. Li\u2019s father in Foshan, in Guangdong Province, a few days ago and brought two lawyers with him.

{"Headline": "Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady and Plans Slower Increases", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is struggling to adapt to an economy that refuses to boom.The Fed said on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, and that future increases were most likely to unfold at a slower pace.Economic output has increased while job growth has slowed, the Fed said. Consumers are spending more while companies are making fewer investments. Exports are rebounding, but Britain\u2019s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union could set off another round of disruptions.\u201cRecent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,\u201d the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told a news conference.The decision to wait was unanimous. Even Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted to raise rates at the Fed\u2019s last few meetings, agreed this time that the moment was not ripe. \u201cThe labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.In this environment of tepid growth and weak inflation, Fed officials once again dialed back their expectations for future rate increases. The Fed in December had predicted four rate increases this year. On Wednesday, the Fed released new projections showing that 15 of its 17 policy makers now expected no more than two increases this year, and six of those officials predicted just one.Even more striking, the median prediction of Fed officials was that the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate would rise to just 2.4 percent by the end of 2018, down from the March median of 3 percent. That suggests officials increasingly regard mediocre global economic growth as an enduring malaise.The Fed also appears increasingly open to the view that a shift in basic economic dynamics, driven by factors like lower productivity growth and an aging population, is holding down interest rates. That means low rates are less stimulative than they would have been in earlier eras. \u201cIt means that long rates can remain low without causing the economy to overheat, and therefore the urgency of tightening is very substantially diminished,\u201d said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist.Markets are even more pessimistic than the Fed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 1.574 percent, the lowest level since 2012. That is part of a broader decline in global rates that, in recent days, also has sent the yield on 10-year German debt below zero for the first time.Equity markets, which in recent years have often celebrated when central banks hold down rates, also declined modestly on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.18 percent to close at 2,071.50.Fed officials increasingly think the economy has exited its postcrisis period, according to economic projections the central bank published on Wednesday. The recovery, in other words, may not be complete, but it is over. Most officials predicted stable growth around 2 percent over the next few years, and they foresaw little if any additional decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest level unemployment had reached since 2007, before the recession.But economic growth has disappointed expectations, and the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0.25 and 0.5 percent after a single rate increase last December.As recently as late May, Ms. Yellen predicted the Fed would raise rates in \u201cthe coming months.\u201d On Wednesday, she downgraded a summer move to \u201cnot impossible.\u201dJon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said the Fed was standing still because the basic economic situation had been remarkably stable. For the last several years, the labor market has gradually improved while inflation has been sluggish.Under those circumstances it makes perfect sense for the Fed to watch and wait.Officials also have expressed increased concern about inflation expectations, which play a significant role in determining future inflation. (Workers, for example, may seek larger raises if they expect prices to rise more quickly.) The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer survey reported last week that consumers expected 2.3 percent annual inflation in five years, the lowest level in the survey\u2019s history.Ms. Yellen emphasized again on Wednesday that Fed officials also saw significant risks in moving too quickly. Because interest rates already are low, the Fed has little room to ease conditions if growth falters. Officials say it will be easier to respond to faster inflation than to an economic downturn.Some economists see evidence that the Fed itself is playing a role in the slowdown. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, and officials have made clear that they would like to keep raising rates. Moreover, the decline in the Fed\u2019s projection of long-term interest rates suggests that the Fed may have underestimated the impact of its actions in December.But Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed\u2019s move in December amounted to a small adjustment in rates, and that she did not agree with critics that it had an outsize impact. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that a single rate increase in December has had much significance for the outlook,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Unlimited\u2019s buyer base, for reasons of scale, tends to be restricted to private and public museums.\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity to present large-scale installations that can\u2019t be presented anywhere else,\u201d said Adrian Turner, a partner at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York, one of three dealerships collaborating to present the piece. \u201cSharing with other galleries helps with the burden of cost and gets more collectors in front of it.\u201d \u201cThe Collector\u2019s House\u201d was priced at 750,000 euros, about $820,000, and as of Thursday was still available.A preponderance of such historical pieces was also noted at Unlimited. \u201cThey\u2019re here because of the conservative nature of today\u2019s market,\u201d said Michael Short, an art adviser in Berlin \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend $5 million you want to spend it on something that will get you $5 million back.\u201dSome significant sales were made after Unlimited\u2019s Monday night preview. Paul McCarthy\u2019s 1994 sculpture \u201cTomato Head (Green),\u201d presented by Hauser & Wirth and priced at $4.75 million, was bought by an American private collection, and the New York dealer Skarstedt found a home for Mike Kelley\u2019s 50-part work on paper, \u201cReconstructed History,\u201d from 1989, at $1.5 million.The Tuesday preview of the main Galleries section, which features 286 exhibitors from 33 countries, was a far more telling indicator of how the world\u2019s leading art dealers are faring in today\u2019s uncertain times. As collectors filed through the rain into the two-floor Messe Basel, it soon became clear that the \u201cprimary\u201d trade in new works by contemporary artists and \u201csecondary\u201d re-sales by dealers and auction houses \u2014 usually at significantly higher prices \u2014 are two distinct markets. Even though visitors were moving with less urgency than they had been in recent years and the lunchtime lines looked shorter, new \u201cprimary market\u2019\u2019 pieces by bankable names were selling steadily.A 2016 \u201cDegenerate Art\u201d abstract by the Romanian-born auction favorite Adrian Ghenie, priced at $460,000, was among the numerous early sales by the Paris dealer Thaddaeus Ropac, helped by the knowledge that a 2014 canvas by Mr. Ghenie sold for $4.5 million at Sotheby\u2019s in February. The Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo gallery Blum & Poe sold the typically stylized Yoshitomo Nara figure painting, \u201cMia,\u201d also dated 2016, for $700,000.Instead, collectors this year were focusing on work like Rodney Graham\u2019s painstakingly devised 2016 lightbox photograph, \u201cArtist in Artists\u2019 Bar, 1950s,\u201d showing the 67-year-old Vancouver artist sitting pensively in an imaginary bar surrounded by 20th-century modernist abstracts (which he himself had painted). Two of the four examples of this editioned work were sold by New York\u2019s 303 Gallery, priced at $275,000 each, with the remaining two on reserve.\u201cBasel was more conservative this year both in terms of what people brought and what people were buying,\u201d said Ms. Levene, the London art consultant. \u201cClients are nervous about buying works by younger artists if they\u2019re not sure where their careers are going.\u201dCollectors would, however, love to acquire new works by Njideka Akunyili Crosby, but at the moment museums, which dealers regard as the key to building an artist\u2019s long-term reputation, are the only buyers.Ms. Crosby, 33, is a Los Angeles artist of Nigerian birth who makes large-scale figurative portraits using a range of media on paper. In March, the Whitney Museum of American Art bought a diptych portrait shown by the London dealer Victoria Miro at the Armory Show in New York. Here at Basel, the dealer sold the serene nine-foot-wide portrait of a woman in an interior, \u201cSuper Blue Omo,\u201d for an undisclosed five-figure sum to another, as yet undisclosed American institution. Victoria Miro\u2019s co-director, Glenn Scott Wright, said the dealership has a waiting list of 18 museums for examples of Ms. Crosby\u2019s work.The continuing desirability of new art bought directly from galleries was emphasized on Wednesday in an Art Market Confidence survey published by the London analysts ArtTactic. Based on responses from 122 experts, the survey\u2019s confidence indicator for dealers in the primary market stood at 64, up 32 percent over the past six months, while that for the auction market stood at 42, a decline of 7 percent over the same period.\u201dThe market has changed,\u201d said Andrew Fabricant, a partner at the Richard Gray Gallery of Chicago and New York, which was exhibiting at Basel.. \u201cThe auction houses have been marketing B-quality works as masterpieces and people are waking up.\u201d But Mr. Fabricant added that the secondary market for works re-offered by dealers has also become more price-sensitive.A 2014 Rudolf Stingel gold brocade-pattern \u201cwallpaper\u201d painting on his booth priced at $2 million attracted at least 50 inquiries at the Tuesday preview, but no sale by Thursday. Another gold example, but dating from 2004 and almost twice the size, was bought at auction in 2014 for $1.4 million. \u201cPrices will continue to change,\u201d Mr. Fabricant said.But high quality secondary market works by blue-chip artists were selling at Art Basel, if perceived to be at a fair price. The New York and London dealer Dominique Levy, for example, sold a totally market-fresh white kaolin on pleated canvas \u201cAchrome\u201d by Piero Manzoni from 1958-1959 for just under $7 million. An example of the same size and date sold at auction in February for $8.1 million, according to the Artnet database of salesroom results.A few booths away on the ground floor, the London dealership Hazlitt Holland-Hibbert sold the 1981 Sean Scully canvas \u201cEnough,\u201d one of the first of the [British] American-based Irish artist\u2019s trademark striped abstracts, to a New York collector for about $ 1million.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in the world at the moment, but wealthy collectors have enough money to ride out this situation,\u201d said the gallery\u2019s director, James Holland-Hibbert, who deals almost exclusively in secondary market works. \u201cBut they are price-sensitive at the moment. If a good work doesn\u2019t sell you know you\u2019ve just priced it too high.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changing Kenya\u2019s Landscape for Wildlife and Jobseekers", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byFixesRUKINGA SANCTUARY, Kenya \u2014 Twenty years ago, this wildlife corridor in southern Kenya was in jeopardy. A scarcity of jobs in this impoverished, arid landscape meant people were hunting wild giraffe and antelope for meat, and chopping down trees to make charcoal. With fewer trees, desertification loomed. Water was so precious that local cattle herders lit fires at water holes to keep giraffes and zebras from drinking.The animals had less vegetation to eat and less forest cover. Cutting down trees combined with poaching decimated wildlife in this 500,000-acre swath of the Kasigau migration corridor, which bisects Tsavo, Kenya\u2019s largest national park. Tsavo, roughly the size of Wales, is home to half the country\u2019s estimated 25,000 elephants.Mercy Ngaruiya, known as Mama Mercy, is a community leader in the village of Itinyi. \u201cPeople used to come with buckets of meat,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was killing animals. People were cutting trees for charcoal. They said, \u2018What else are we going to do for money?\u2019\u201dAgainst the odds, things have changed. Illegal tree cutting and poaching have fallen significantly. Previously, rangers from Wildlife Works, the local conservation group that initiated the shift, would find 8,000 wire snares in a year. Last year they found fewer than 300.In 1998 there were no elephants on the 75,000 acres of Rukinga Sanctuary where Wildlife Works is based, said Rob Dodson, vice president of African operations. Now wildlife has returned. One recent evening, a herd of elephants, including babies, gathered at a water hole during a tranquil sunset. As many as 2,000 elephants live in the corridor, depending on the season; so do zebra, giraffe, buffalo, warthogs and several kinds of antelope, from slender dik-diks to impala. Lions had vanished from the area; now there are about 40, including two males seen lounging by a water hole on a hot Friday afternoon.Illegal activities haven\u2019t been wiped out. In January, seven elephants were poached for ivory. Every week rangers catch people burning trees to produce charcoal. But forest and wildlife in the Kasigau Corridor have been visibly revitalized by conservation efforts. And poaching has dropped. In the last few years, Wildlife Works hired more unarmed local rangers to supplement the Kenyan Wildlife Service, and in 2014 Kenya toughened its poaching laws. Seventy-six elephants were killed for ivory in the area in 2012, in contrast to 21 last year.The key to preserving wildlife here is human relationships. Impoverished locals need alternatives to poaching and burning. So Wildlife Works has created hundreds of new jobs, including increasing the number of its rangers sevenfold to 85 in the past few years. (Many are former charcoal burners and poachers themselves.) Critically, this expansion won support for conservation from local elders and villagers, and the organization is now their county\u2019s third-largest employer.This community development work got a much-needed financial lifeline when Wildlife Works started the world\u2019s first REDD+ project in 2011. REDD+, which stands for \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,\u201d is an international system to combat climate change by preserving forests. It essentially pays communities in poor countries not to cut down trees.Preserving this swath of forest in the Kasigau Corridor avoids emitting more than 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year for the next 30 years.Since 2011, Wildlife Works has sold carbon credits and earned millions of dollars shared by landowners, investors, Wildlife Works and the local community. Money for the community finances schools, scholarships, water pipes, reservoirs and other public works that serve 150,000 people. The support was critical for getting the local community to support conservation.\u201cNow if someone cuts down trees or kills animals, people will report them,\u201d said Mama Mercy.REDD+ was controversial when it introduced nearly a decade ago. Critics feared fraud, and that the developed world would use carbon credits as an excuse to keep burning fossil fuels instead of curbing them. Supporters said poor countries needed financial incentives to preserve forests rather than cutting them down for fuel, farming and grazing.At first, locals were also skeptical. Mama Mercy recalled that when people first heard about REDD+ they said, \u201c\u2018How do we get money from trees? The air? These people are cheating us.\u2019 It was really complicated.\u201dEducating locals about REDD+ and getting them on board was essential, because REDD+ uses international social auditors to enforce a requirement for informed consent from communities.From 2009 to 2011, Wildlife Works\u2019 team of local Kenyans met with about 60 elders, chiefs and heads of community councils to explain how the complex project works.\u201cThey thought people were coming to get their land,\u201d said Pascal Kizaka, a retired local chief. \u201cWe had to go and talk to them and preach. It took a year and a half to make the people understand.\u201dAlthough several tribes live in the area, Swahili is commonly spoken, so language was not a hurdle. Local leaders eventually gave consent to sell carbon credits on behalf of the community.\u201cPeople were so desperate,\u201d said Dodson, of Wildife Works. \u201cThey had nothing to lose. They said, \u2018It sounds mad, but let\u2019s give it a go.\u2019\u201dThe forest was assessed by teams that measured trees in 480 sample plots across Kasigau Corridor. Independent environmental consultants from the United States used analytical software involving 60 algorithms to determine the amount of carbon in the forest.Results were verified by the environmental audit firms Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, both based in Washington. The latter\u2019s social audit includes weeks of meeting with local councils and questioning them independently.In the early days, critics feared that \u201ccarbon credit cowboys\u201d would displace or exploit locals and pocket profits. But setting up and verifying REDD+ is too complicated, expensive and stringent for speculators to make easy money. Rolling out REDD+ cost Wildlife Works about $4 million, each audit costs about $70,000, and verification requires evidence that REDD+ has benefited the community and environment.The biggest pitfall is managing a multiparty project and building consensus among many community councils. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to fail an audit. Getting back on your feet if a project fails is tough,\u201d said Dodson. \u201cOrganizationally, it is fraught with danger.\u201dWhen Wildlife Works\u2019 REDD+ project was verified, credits were sold on Markit, a London-based financial trading platform. The companies and other organizations that have purchased credits to offset their carbon emissions or fulfill corporate social responsibility policies have included Barclays, BNP Paribas, Allianz, the French postal service La Poste, and Kering, the holding company for Gucci, Saint Laurent and other luxury brands.Wildlife Works sold $3 million worth of carbon credits in 2012, $2.5 million worth in 2013, and more than $5 million in 2014.Carbon credit revenues are divided up with one-third going to landowners, roughly another third to Wildlife Works\u2019 projects in Kenya, and the rest divided among the community and Wildlife Works in the United States, including its investors.Community councils most commonly decide to use their shares for clean water projects or schools.\u201cPeople used to go long distances to get water, six kilometers or more,\u201d said 24-year-old Zahira Kastoka, who grew up in Itinyi. Now there are water storage tanks near her home.\u201cREDD has changed things in so many ways,\u201d she said. Kastoka got a high school scholarship through Wildlife Works, where she now works as an office administrator. Without the grant, her single mother could not have afforded school fees; Kastoka\u2019s older sister had to drop out after fourth grade.In 1998, few local youths were enrolled in college or in other tertiary institutions; now hundreds are. Over the years, more than 3,200 students have been awarded some $260,000 in high school and higher education scholarships.For example, Mwolo Muasa, who grew up near Wildlife Works, had to drop out of school after his mother died when he was 10. But a few years later, he got a Wildlife Works scholarship, without which, he says, \u201cI would have ended up a street kid.\u201d Now 29, he helps lead Wildlife Works\u2019 forest plot sampling, having studied environmental science at Kenyatta University in Nairobi.Carbon credits have also financed precious new jobs. Before REDD, Wildlife Works had 65 employees in 2010. Now it has more than 300 who work in a small garment workshop, greenhouse and tourist lodge and as rangers, mechanics and office staff members. Before carbon credits there were 12 rangers hired from local villages; now the 85-strong force patrols a much larger area.In 2009, Korchinsky read a magazine article about REDD+ and wondered if Wildlife Works could sell carbon credits. At the time, there was no method with which to measure the carbon in Kasigau\u2019s shrubby drylands forest. So Wildlife Works hired independent environmental consultants to design one.One challenge today is planning for the future and managing expectations if carbon credit sales slump. In 2015, sales of Wildlife Works\u2019 carbon credits fell to about half that of the previous year. Hesitant buyers were awaiting the outcome of the United Nations\u2019 climate change summit meeting in December.As a result, there were fewer scholarships. \u201cSome people had to drop out of school,\u201d said Mama Mercy. \u201cSome girls married early. Parents want to educate children but there\u2019s no work.\u201d\u201cLast year was difficult,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe hope this year won\u2019t be the same.\u201dREDD+ agreements span only 30 years, so it\u2019s uncertain what will happen when the contract expires. Dodson hopes that by then there will be enough economic development and jobs to sustain the community and preserve the forest and wildlife.Ivo Mulder, the REDD+ green economy adviser for the United Nations Environment Program, said large-scale national initiatives that span entire counties or provinces and better control deforestation are a model for the future.Worldwide, there are many REDD+ projects. However, the carbon credit market is limited and there are not enough buyers driven by corporate social responsibility. An oversupply of voluntary credits \u201creduces prices and makes it difficult to make REDD+ projects financially viable,\u201d said Mulder.Selling carbon credits from large government-backed REDD+ projects to other governments can make a bigger dent in combating global deforestation, though they are complicated to set up.Back on the ground in the Kasigau Corridor, this environmental framework has already changed the landscape for flora, fauna and humans alike.Kizaka, the retired local chief, recalled that big trees sheltering wildlife and cattle were being destroyed every day for charcoal. But now, he said: \u201cIf we show you photos before the carbon project and the present situation, the vegetation has changed. It has blossomed.\u201dFrom beneath the acacias in the Kenyan bush, one can still see the forest for the trees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Vows to Rip Up Trade Deals and Confront China", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byMONESSEN, Pa. \u2014 Donald J. Trump vowed on Tuesday to rip up international trade deals and start an unrelenting offensive against Chinese economic practices, framing his contest with Hillary Clinton as a choice between hard-edge nationalism and the policies of \u201ca leadership class that worships globalism.\u201dSpeaking in western Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump sought to turn the page on weeks of campaign turmoil by returning to a core set of economic grievances that have animated his candidacy from the start. He threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and pledged to label China a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.He attacked Mrs. Clinton on her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration, and challenged her to pledge that she would void the agreement in its entirety. Noting that Mrs. Clinton had backed free-trade agreements like Nafta in the past, Mr. Trump warned, \u201cShe will betray you again.\u201dAt a rally later in the day in eastern Ohio, Mr. Trump attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership in more provocative terms, saying it was a \u201crape of our country.\u201dAs a policy manifesto, Mr. Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania speech was an attack on the economic orthodoxy that has dominated the Republican Party since World War II. It is an article of faith among establishment Republicans and allied groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents the interests of large corporations, that trade is good and more trade is better.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has made blistering attacks on trade his primary economic theme. In his address he rejected the standard view that countries benefit by importing goods, arguing that globalization helped \u201cthe financial elite,\u201d while leaving \u201cmillions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\u201dIt is a critique that has been leveled for years, mainly by a small group of liberal economists who have gained little traction even on the Democratic side. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump not only embraced their views, but also cited the work of the liberal Economic Policy Institute by name.Mr. Trump, as president, would have significant authority to raise trade barriers, and his speech Tuesday included his most detailed account to date of his plans to do so, saying that he would pull the United States from Nafta if Mexico and Canada did not agree to renegotiate it.But it is far from clear that any president has the power to reverse globalization. Under existing law, Mr. Trump could impose tariffs only on specific imports. The most likely effect would be to shift production to other low-cost nations.The language and location of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech encapsulated his aspirational strategy for the general election: His greatest source of support has been white working-class men, and his campaign hopes to compete in traditionally Democratic-leaning states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, to offset his deep unpopularity with Hispanic voters and women, which may put swing states like Florida and Colorado out of reach.Mr. Trump delivered his address at a steel plant in the heart of coal country, on a stage flanked by blocks of compressed steel wiring, aluminum cans and other metals. And for the second time in two weeks, he spoke carefully from a script. Aides to Mr. Trump, who has faced criticism throughout the race for factual exaggerations and outright falsehoods, circulated a copy of the speech with 128 footnotes documenting its claims.Still, Mr. Trump could not resist the occasional ad-libbed line to skewer Mrs. Clinton or boast of his own achievements. He said, for example, that he had forced her to use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.And he took credit for pressuring Mrs. Clinton to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, though at the time she faced far greater pressure from a primary challenge on the left, from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech drew rebukes from two sides: The Clinton campaign attacked his credibility as a critic of free trade, and deployed Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a populist Democrat who is viewed as a potential running mate for Mrs. Clinton, to accuse Mr. Trump of hypocrisy.\u201cWith all of his personal experience profiting from making products overseas, Trump\u2019s the perfect expert to talk about outsourcing,\u201d Mr. Brown said, reciting a list of Trump products, from suits to picture frames, that he said were made in other countries. \u201cWe know just in my state alone where Donald Trump could have gone to make these things,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump also drew a cold response from traditionally Republican-leaning interests for his heated attacks on international trade agreements. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spends millions of dollars in federal elections, almost entirely in support of Republican candidates, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Twitter and claimed that his policies would hurt the economy.\u201cEven under best-case scenario, Trump\u2019s tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,\u201d the group wrote in one Twitter message.For Mr. Trump, who has shifted and doubled back on high-profile policy pronouncements, trade has been a rare area of consistency in the 2016 race.At nearly every campaign rally, Mr. Trump has knocked trade deals with China as unfair to the American worker so frequently as to make his percussive pronunciation of China a hallmark of impersonators.Mr. Trump appeared in his speech to pre-empt criticism from economists and business groups that have argued his policy proposals would lead to a damaging trade war with China and perhaps other countries.\u201cWe already have a trade war,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd, departing from his prepared remarks. \u201cAnd we\u2019re losing, badly.\u201dMr. Trump, who has struggled for months to win support from the conservative business community, also attended a fund-raiser in West Virginia on Tuesday hosted by a coal executive, Robert E. Murray.It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will stick closely to the trade-focused message he delivered in Pennsylvania. At an evening rally in eastern Ohio, he returned to a familiar set of red-meat themes, calling for a wall on the Mexican border and reiterating his vow to waterboard Islamic State terrorists.But to win that state in November, Mr. Trump hopes to outflank Mrs. Clinton with economically distressed voters who may have voted Democratic in the past, and trade remains an issue that stirs up voters across party lines.In a nod to potential crossover voters, Mr. Trump at one point on Tuesday quoted Mr. Sanders by name in criticizing Mrs. Clinton.Though he dwelled at greatest length in Pennsylvania on what he described as the damaging economic consequences of globalization, Mr. Trump also laced his remarks with broader nationalist language, arguing that the United States would lose its sovereignty and national pride by negotiating too freely with the world.\u201cThey get the expansion. We get the joblessness,\u201d Mr. Trump said of trade deals with foreign countries. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it works \u2014 not going to happen anymore.\u201dNick Corasaniti reported from Monessen, Alexander Burns from New York, and Binyamin Appelbaum from Washington.

In this city at the heart of the last century\u2019s drama its presence lingers \u2014 in the Soviet War Memorial in the Tiergarten (80,000 Soviet soldiers died in the Battle of Berlin); in the vast memorial and military cemetery in Treptower Park; in the graffiti scrawled by Soviet soldiers on the walls of the Reichstag; in the fragments of the Wall that cut off the Soviet imperium\u2019s captive masses. Yet, a quarter-century ago, the Soviet Union vanished from the map.No foreign army conquered it. No massive uprising overran it. No economic implosion swallowed it. One of the world\u2019s two superpowers simply ceased to be. The unthinkable occurred. A vast empire put itself out of existence and turned out the lights.There is no better place to ponder all that cannot possibly happen until it does.There is no better juncture, either.

The politics of America mystify the world.From Germany\u2019s \u201czero hour\u201d in 1945 there emerged in due course two institutions \u2014 NATO and the European Union \u2014 that together ushered Germany from its shame and Europe from its repetitive self-immolation. They cemented the United States as a European power. They fashioned European security and prosperity through unity.Now NATO and the E.U. are questioned, even ridiculed. Forces of disintegration are on the march.Conditions seem ripe. Europe is increasingly unloved, its miracle too dull to be appreciated. For President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the disintegration of the European Union would be sweet revenge for the fall of the Soviet Union. He will probe. For populist anti-European politicians from the Netherlands to France \u2014 friends of Putin all \u2014 a British exit would offer open season for fantasies of drum-beating nationalist fragmentation.The departure of Britain would magnify German dominance of the European Union, accentuating anti-German sentiment and upsetting the balance between liberal northern European economies and more statist Mediterranean models.But the unimaginable must be taken seriously if it is to be averted. The Soviet Union proved vulnerable to being unloved. A season of anger is upon the West.Realpolitik and idealism meet in the unity of Europe.

O.K.?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not going,\u201d she replied.I am the son of Muslim immigrants. As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped.Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think \u201cMuslim,\u201d the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. It\u2019s of a scary terrorist character from \u201cHomeland\u201d or some monster from the news.Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. It\u2019s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.I asked a young friend of mine, a woman in her 20s of Muslim heritage, how she had been feeling after the attack. \u201cI just feel really bad, like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really sick of having to explain that I\u2019m not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown.\u201dI myself am not a religious person, but after these attacks, anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described. There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else.I understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, it\u2019s usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think I\u2019m a terrorist.But I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled: \u201cTerrorist!\u201d To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but I\u2019m not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history.One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear: Keep military-grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists.

{"Headline": "How Much Will \u2018Brexit\u2019 Stress Banks? Some Ways to Tell", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byMoment of TruthAmong all the anxieties that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has provoked, here\u2019s another one: Are big banks going to be in trouble?Taxpayers in Europe and the United State might want to know.The Brexit vote could very well be a test of whether governments have, since the financial crisis of 2008, limited the threat that large banks pose to the wider economy.In 2008, governments around the world decided to spend huge sums bailing out their nations\u2019 banks, underscoring that they were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Brexit will go a long way toward telling us whether they still are.Today, banks are stronger. They have more capital, meaning they borrow less money to finance their loans and trading. Lower borrowing makes them more stable. The banks also have higher reserves of liquid cash they can tap into if it becomes hard to borrow money in the markets.So, how are they doing? Here are some ways to assess the stress in the financial system.The valuations on bank stocks also look awful, particularly a yardstick called the price-to-book ratio. This effectively compares a bank\u2019s market value with its net worth as stated in its balance sheet. If that ratio is below one, it suggests investors are skeptical about the bank. Deutsche Bank is trading at around 30 percent of its net worth, a big discount. In the United States, Bank of America is trading at just under 60 percent of its book value, a ratio even lower than in 2009, when losses from the financial crisis were still piling up.But it can be a mistake to think that a bank is in dire trouble because its stock is slumping or its valuation looks sickly. The declines might reflect investors\u2019 belief that it will be harder for the banks to make profits in the future, particularly if Brexit leads to a recession. Or it may be a signal that the market believes the bank will have to break itself up, or sell operations, to become more streamlined. But this is something a bank can do without help from the taxpayer.Let\u2019s look at the swaps on UniCredit, a large Italian bank. An investor on one side of the credit default swap makes a payment to an investor on the other side of the swap. The investor making the payment stands to receive a big payout if UniCredit defaults. That probably won\u2019t happen, of course. But if the cost of that insurance against default rises because of fears stirred up by an event like the Brexit crisis, the investor who bought the insurance against default before the crisis, when it was cheaper, can now sell the swap for a profit.And what is this swaps market telling us now about the banks? The good news: The costs of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging.But if the Brexit crisis pushes European banks to use such loans, it may be hard to track how much they are borrowing. One of the ways in which Greek banks were helped last year during the country\u2019s debt crisis was through a loan facility called the emergency liquidity assistance. But the European Central Bank, and some national central banks, typically do not break out exactly how much each country is borrowing under that loan program, which added to the confusion last year.Why do these loans matter in assessing what the Brexit crisis tells us about too-big-to-fail?So far, those who contend that the post-recession banking overhaul has significantly strengthened the system are winning the debate. Further evidence for their position: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that all but one of the United States\u2019 largest banks had unconditionally passed annual stress tests, and were thus allowed to distribute money to their shareholders. But it\u2019s too early to see if the overhaul has succeeded. The real test would be whether a major European country that uses the euro \u2014 Britain does not \u2014 voted to follow Britain out of the European Union.It\u2019s a frightening prospect, but it might take that to really test whether the too-big-to-fail banks can fail.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Views From the Inside, an Activist Challenges Vietnam\u2019s Rulers", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfileMr. Quang A went ahead anyway, choosing his best suit and a fresh shirt. He uploaded a photo of himself in his smart attire to Facebook. Then he stepped outside onto a narrow street in the Vietnamese capital.\u201cI went out at 6:22 a.m. At 6:25 I was arrested,\u201d he said. A phalanx of security men shoved him into a car and slammed the doors. Mr. Quang A was isolated inside with two plainclothes police officers and a driver. The windows were tinted dark, and the license plate was covered. It was, Mr. Quang A said later, a \u201cmoving prison.\u201dThey drove for the next seven hours, first to Hung Yen, a city of historic temples east of the capital, and then back to his home, just as President Obama\u2019s plane was lifting off for the next stop.Mr. Quang A, 69, a computer scientist, a former businessman and, for a decade since his retirement, a full-time critic of the Communist government, takes the long view on how to open up Vietnam\u2019s repressive political system. American human rights activists criticized Mr. Obama for agreeing to sell Vietnam lethal weapons without winning any concessions, particularly the release of political prisoners. But Mr. Quang A said he believed the president did the right thing.\u201cIf you transform human beings into a commodity for barter, I oppose it,\u201d Mr. Quang A said. He made that argument when he met the assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor, Tom Malinowski, just before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival. (He arrived late to the meeting with Mr. Malinowski because the police threw a cordon around his house for several hours beforehand.)Mr. Quang A said it was like negotiating with hostage takers. \u201cYou create incentives for the Vietnamese authorities to arrest more and more to create access for future barter.\u201dMr. Quang A is not the classic outsider. He was a member of the Communist Party, though never an official, and left the party 23 years ago.\u201cAmong our members about 60 percent were party members,\u201d he said. \u201cThey still have party connections and know a lot of people in the establishment. We use that information channel.\u201dHis latest approach to bring change is to mobilize popular outrage against huge fish kills in the sea off central Vietnam. The fish appear to have been killed by the untreated effluent from a new steel plant owned by a company in Taiwan. \u201cWe take the fish crisis as an opportunity,\u201d he said, chatting at a cafe near his house, and not far from a military post.Security forces have brutally put down protests against the plant, beating some protesters and hauling many into detention. On two consecutive Sundays last month, the police outside his house stopped him from showing up at the weekly protests.\u201cIf you have influence, they crack down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the authorities were smart, they would know that the protesters don\u2019t want to overthrow them, but want to negotiate to change the policies.\u201dThat turned out to be a big break. \u201cGeneral Giap helped me escape from the army,\u201d he said. He was assigned to a civilian job at an informatics branch of the government, but he stayed only briefly.It was the period of a slight opening in the economy, and Mr. Quang A started a joint venture selling Vietnamese-assembled computers to Russia. It was while dealing with the government as a businessman, he said, that he became disenchanted with the Communist Party and decided to try to undermine its power.As he assumed the role of activist, he first translated books by the Hungarian economist Janos Kornai and the Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, both critics of Communist rule.On relations with China, Mr. Quang A has some sympathy with the government. \u201cIt is in a very difficult position. I would not want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be a good neighbor with China, but not a good friend.\u201dThe Saturday Profile article on June 4, about Nguyen Quang A, a longtime critic of the Communist government in Vietnam and one of several dissidents blocked from meeting President Obama during his recent trip there, referred incorrectly to Nguyen Huu Vinh, a friend of Mr. Quang A\u2019s who was jailed for five years for posting anti-state writings on the internet. Mr. Vinh is a former police officer, not the son of one. A reader alerted The Times to the error shortly after the article was published online, but editors failed to follow up with a correction.Advertisement"}

Christie\u2019s contemporary evening sale comes on Wednesday.\u201cSo far, this week\u2019s London auctions have been strong,\u201d said Elizabeth Szancer, an art adviser. \u201cThis evening, Sotheby\u2019s did well, and Brexit was not in the auction room.\u201dThe underbidder on the Saville was Larry Gagosian, whose gallery represents Ms. Saville and is currently showing her work at its Davies Street gallery here.American and Asian collectors who came looking for bargains at the London auctions this week in light of the depreciated pound may have been disappointed. A number of the works sold for more than their high estimates, including Keith Haring\u2019s 1989 \u201cThe Last Rainforest,\u201d which sold for \u00a34.2 million, or $5.6 million, to a telephone bidder represented by the Sotheby\u2019s executive Amy Cappellazzo after intense back and forth with Gabriela Palmieri, chairwoman of contemporary art at Sotheby\u2019s Americas, who was on the phone with another bidder.\u201cIt may be that Brexit has a good effect on art because it makes collectors who think of art in dollars have a 10 percent discount,\u201d said the New York dealer Helly Nahmad. \u201cIt makes people want to buy art instead of keeping cash in uncertain financial markets.\u201dThree works by Jean Dubuffet brought strong prices, including \u201cBarbe de Lumiere des Aveugles\u201d from 1959, which sold for \u00a33.2 million, about $4.2 million.The artist Adrian Ghenie continued his winning streak, with his painting \u201cThe Hunted\u201d (2010) selling for \u00a31.9 million, or about $2.5 million, and his \u201cSelf-Portrait as a Monkey\u201d (2011) for \u00a3665,000, or about $886,000, triple its pre-sale estimate.\u201cThere is still a lot of money around,\u201d said Alex Lachmann, a private art dealer based in London and Cologne, Germany. \u201cWealthy people make money in this kind of crisis and they\u2019re looking to buy important things. The exchange rate was very important.

Trump, aided by two teleprompters, presented the version of himself on Tuesday evening that Republican Party officials had desperately craved \u2014 softer, serious and sophisticated.\u201cI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never ever let you down,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech at his golf club here. \u201cI will make you proud of your party and our movement.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s disciplined performance was geared at soothing nervous voters and at stopping the flight of high-ranking Republicans. And it came just hours after Mr. Trump reminded them why they had been concerned in the first place.A series of missteps and vicious attacks \u2014 with targets that included former rivals, entire nationalities and religious groups \u2014 has led to fears that Mr. Trump has doomed Republican chances of taking back the White House and keeping the party\u2019s hold on the Senate. It was the type of calm performance that Mr. Trump has delivered before, only to revert to form within days.\u201cTonight\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t change much,\u201d said Dan Senor, who supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the primaries and who has been an adviser to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. \u201cEven tonight, there are conversations that maybe, just maybe, he says these offensive things because he actually believes them.\u201dMr. Ryan maintained his endorsement of Mr. Trump, but Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois withdrew his. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who never publicly endorsed Mr. Trump, urged Republicans who had endorsed the candidate to withdraw their support.\u201cThey are waiting for him to change, and he is not going to change,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who supported Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio in the primaries, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is like the old story of the scorpion and the frog \u2014 the Republican Party is the frog and Donald Trump is the scorpion, and we want these assurances he\u2019s going to stop doing these things but he can\u2019t, because it\u2019s in his nature.\u201dTim Pawlenty, a Republican and the former governor of Minnesota, was not quite as pessimistic, saying he still had \u201chope for at least some improvement.\u201d\u201cEven modest changes would help,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Trump vanquished a legion of primary opponents without much change in demeanor or strategy, he is entering a race in which he is trailing in polls. His support among college-educated suburban voters in battleground states is especially low, according to polling conducted by Republican groups.Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump head into the presidential race with the worst favorable ratings of any presumed nominee in decades.The Trump campaign is also working to ramp up its fund-raising operations, with the candidate holding at least four events this week.On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel. Mr. Trump is expected to attend both the meeting and the lunch.And on Friday evening, Mr. Trump is to attend a fund-raiser in Richmond, Va., though the invitation that went out just over a week before the event did not specify where it would be held. It also did not have host names, tiers of donors or even a request for a specific dollar amount \u2014 all basics of most political fund-raisers.Mr. Trump has complicated matters by resisting efforts to engage in routine telephone calls to donors and to make gentle requests of people to write checks. Some donors who have been approached have given tepid responses, worried about their names showing up in a public campaign-finance filing.Some aides have also grumbled privately about a trip Mr. Trump has planned for the end of the month to Scotland and Ireland, to tour his golf courses. Three aides, speaking anonymously to discuss internal frustrations, said they worried that the trip would distract him from his campaign.The Trump team has had trouble filling positions, in part because some Republicans they tried to recruit turned down their offers, worried about how a Trump line on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could affect their job prospects. The campaign has spent two months searching for a communications director, after an early prospect fell through, according to one of the three aides and two people who were approached about possible jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that the candidate was always planning for a progression.\u201cThe campaign evolves, as it always does, from a primary strategy to a general-election strategy, and there are very different issues,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to refocus on jobs and the economy.\u201dMr. Trump made clear on Monday that regardless of his campaign staff members\u2019 job titles, he was his own chief strategist. On a conference call first reported by Bloomberg Politics, Mr. Trump belittled his aides for having sent a memo urging surrogates to stop talking about the judge in the Trump University case. Instead, Mr. Trump said, his supporters should keep criticizing the jurist, Gonzalo P. Curiel, and should suggest the reporters asking questions about his comments are \u201cracists.\u201dMr. Carson said he believed that Mr. Trump could be perfectly suited for the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re in more of a W.W.E. brawl stage as a nation right now,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to World Wrestling Entertainment, \u201cand the people who tend to appeal to that group tend to do better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s stance on Donald J.

{"Headline": "Cathleen Schine\u2019s \u2018They May Not Mean To, but They Do\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cI think Daddy died .\u2008.\u2008. but Mommy doesn\u2019t want him to know.\u201d This comment by a distraught daughter at her father\u2019s deathbed nicely sets the tone of Cathleen Schine\u2019s latest novel, which combines black comedy with shrewd observation of family dynamics. Of a particular family, of course. The Bergmans\u2019 inner circle consists of a father, Aaron; and a mother, Joy; their daughter, Molly; and son, Daniel \u2014 but it extends, significantly, to Molly\u2019s son, Ben; and Molly\u2019s lesbian partner, Freddie; as well as to Daniel\u2019s wife, Coco; and his daughters, Ruby and Cora. To which Freddie adds her own parent and sibling problems. An extensive cast, then, one that allows for an extensive exploration of the fine balance between affection and exasperation that marks family relationships and, above all, the parent-child bond.At one point, in a wry inversion of the well-known Philip Larkin quotation (part of which Schine borrows for her title), Joy broods about her relationship with her son and daughter. At 86, she is devastated but not defeated by Aaron\u2019s death. Yet her children are convinced she can\u2019t manage on her own. Molly wants her to leave New York and join her and Freddie in Los Angeles; Daniel visits dutifully, but worries about Joy\u2019s finances. Joy still works \u2014 at a part-time job as a conservation consultant for a museum, a position she values, despite ageist attempts to sideline her. Joy is the central figure in the narrative, coping initially with a husband stricken with heart failure, colon cancer, bladder cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a situation compounded by her own decline after a minor stroke and an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection. We are not spared the distresses of age and infirmity.Widowed after a long marriage, Joy is a persuasive character, intelligent, independent, with a flair for witty responses and wry thoughts, though in fact everyone in Schine\u2019s narrative is given to sharp comment and occasionally manic behavior. Despite its subject matter, \u201cThey May Not Mean To, but They Do\u201d is a very funny novel.It is also a novel suffused with guilt. Joy dreads the prospect of having her children feel obliged to put her in a nursing home and feels guilty at her classic situation of \u201cbeing a burden.\u201d Molly is full of guilt because she lives in Los Angeles and can\u2019t visit her mother in New York as frequently as she might. Daniel feels guilty because he can\u2019t ask his mother to live with his wife and daughters. In other words, everyone is classically guilty about being a parent or a child. Emotionally confused but also entirely united, the Bergmans are a family bound together, as Freddie notes, with \u201cinsular ferocity.\u201dThis is a situation plenty of readers will recognize. There are particular ingredients here \u2014 this is a Jewish family, though they\u2019re not especially observant Jews, and some fun is had with Ruby, Joy\u2019s granddaughter, who suddenly decides she wants to keep kosher and go to the synagogue, to the confusion of her secularly inclined \u00adfather. And there is of course the long shadow of past events \u2014 Aaron\u2019s fecklessness with money, his frittering away of a family fortune, Daniel\u2019s desperate illness at the age of 18. Schine reminds us that a family is as united by its trials as by its triumphs.I must confess, though, that I did get a touch irritated with Joy at a certain point, frustrated by her inability to do anything about an apartment apparently awash with papers, with files marked urgent, with unopened letters and so forth. Come on, Joy, it\u2019s just a matter of gritting your teeth and getting down to it! And here I can speak with a certain authority, being myself an octogenarian. But I am my own sort of octogenarian, and that is the whole point. Old people do have certain collective features \u2014 mostly the age-\u00adrelated disabilities \u2014 but otherwise we\u2019re as distinct from one another as are people of any age. Schine deserves credit for taking on the challenge of writing about an age of which she has no personal \u00adexperience and, on the whole, making a convincing job of it. But novelists worth their salt must write beyond their experience most of the time \u2014 imagining different genders, ages, situations in time and space. Schine\u2019s particular fictional exercise focuses on the way the members of a family cope with the challenges involved in disparities of age, of needs, of agendas. While Joy must make the best she can of her last years, her children have their own lives, their own problems. They are all bound to her by love and duty, they all mean well, but they are not always acting for the best.And then there is Karl, a friend of \u00adAaron\u2019s and an old flame of Joy\u2019s. When she meets him on one of her walks in the park, he\u2019s propped on a red wheeled walker and accompanied by a Polish caregiver. But when it looks as if their friendly chats may lead to a deeper relationship, the rest of the family is horrified. After Joy invites Karl to the first family Passover since Aaron\u2019s death and later proposes that he be invited to Ruby\u2019s bat mitzvah, her children react by \u201cyelling and stamping their feet like toddlers.\u201dCathleen Schine writes with economy and style \u2014 saying most by saying least, employing brief staccato sentences, with much of the action unfolding by way of dialogue. Some readers might feel that too much levity surrounds some disturbing matters \u2014 a farcical deathbed scene, the humiliations of colostomy bags and incontinence. But others will see this as a proper form of defiance, the best way to face down the most disagreeable of circumstances. This is a novel in which serious subjects are treated with a deliberately light touch, a tactic that doesn\u2019t imply insensitivity or lack of empathy but simply accepts the fact that humor may be the best way of dealing with the \u00adunavoidable.I have always mistrusted Tolstoy\u2019s \u00adoften quoted observation that \u201chappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d In fact, I doubt if the perfectly happy family exists, or at least one in which every member would claim to be absolutely content. Most families\u2019 discontent has to do with relationships \u2014 with imbalances of affection, jealousies, resentments, changes in alignment. And it is very much this last that is the focus of the Bergman family\u2019s unhappiness, if it can be called that \u2014 the disconcerting shift of balance that comes about when old age strikes and suddenly (it always seems to be suddenly) those who were to be relied upon become those who are dependent. The parents become children. This troublesome shift is the focus of Schine\u2019s deftly handled storytelling.Penelope Lively\u2019s latest book is a memoir, \u201cDancing Fish and Ammonites.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pei\u2019s glass pyramid, was desolate early Friday morning, save for a few tourists taking selfies.At the other end of the room, the goddess of wisdom, Athena, kept an eye on the metal drawers stacked to her side. The Hellenistic gallery had become just another storage room for treasures from elsewhere in the Louvre.Some 150,000 artworks in storage rooms, and an additional 7,000 pieces in galleries, were deemed vulnerable to flooding, and many of them were moved to higher floors starting on Thursday evening.Although the Seine was expected to crest by Friday evening at around 20 feet, and no water had entered the museum thus far, officials were taking no chances.The works that were in storage were the easiest to handle. \u201cIt took us less time than we thought, because the artwork was already in containment boxes, so we just had to move them from one floor to an upper one,\u201d said Adel Ziane, the museum\u2019s deputy director of communications.In some galleries, it looked as though a family was about to move in \u2014 or out. Boxes were subdivided by foam boards, creating spaces for vases and other precious objects. A seemingly abandoned ancient frieze sat on a wooden pallet on the floor of one gallery, half wrapped in plastic sheets.\u201cFor the artwork which was exhibited and not in storage, like for the department of Islamic art, we had to move the pieces from their window displays,\u201d Mr. Ziane said. \u201cWe have a team of exhibition-space managers who take care of handling the artwork, and a team of curators who watch over everything.\u201dThe 2002 flood-protection plan, for all its detail, does not prioritize among works of art. How, in a palace of treasures, can one select the very best?\u201cIt is difficult to say which one is more valuable,\u201d Mr. Ziane said. \u201cThey are all priceless, and we decided the evacuation according to their risk of exposure.\u201dBesides Islamic art, the staff also moved works from Coptic displays and most of the Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquities in storage.Mr. Martinez, the museum\u2019s president, said it was difficult to estimate the total number of works moved, but he said it amounted to \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d Officials were monitoring the levels of the Seine constantly, he said, to see if they needed to move even more works.\u201cThe situation is changing hour per hour \u2014 it is still difficult to know when we are going to reopen,\u201d he said.Earlier this year, the museum did a training exercise, simulating a flood situation, involving in the Islamic art department.

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen: After Brexit, the People\u2019s Spring Is Inevitable", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 IF there\u2019s one thing that chafes French pride, it\u2019s seeing the British steal the limelight. But in the face of real courage, even the proudest French person can only tip his hat and bow. The decision that the people of Britain have just made was indeed an act of courage \u2014 the courage of a people who embrace their freedom.Brexit won out, defeating all forecasts. Britain decided to cast off from the European Union and reclaim its independence among the world\u2019s nations. It had been said that the election would hinge solely on economic matters; the British, however, were more insightful in understanding the real issue than commentators like to admit.British voters understood that behind prognostications about the pound\u2019s exchange rate and behind the debates of financial experts, only one question, at once simple and fundamental, was being asked: Do we want an undemocratic authority ruling our lives, or would we rather regain control over our destiny? Brexit is, above all, a political issue. It\u2019s about the free choice of a people deciding to govern itself. Even when it is touted by all the propaganda in the world, a cage remains a cage, and a cage is unbearable to a human being in love with freedom.The European Union has become a prison of peoples. Each of the 28 countries that constitute it has slowly lost its democratic prerogatives to commissions and councils with no popular mandate. Every nation in the union has had to apply laws it did not want for itself. Member nations no longer determine their own budgets. They are called upon to open their borders against their will.Countries in the eurozone face an even less enviable situation. In the name of ideology, different economies are forced to adopt the same currency, even if doing so bleeds them dry. It\u2019s a modern version of the Procrustean bed, and the people no longer have a say.And what about the European Parliament? It\u2019s democratic in appearance only, because it\u2019s based on a lie: the pretense that there is a homogeneous European people, and that a Polish member of the European Parliament has the legitimacy to make law for the Spanish. We have tried to deny the existence of sovereign nations. It\u2019s only natural that they would not allow being denied.Brexit wasn\u2019t the European people\u2019s first cry of revolt. In 2005, France and the Netherlands held referendums about the proposed European Union constitution. In both countries, opposition was massive, and other governments decided on the spot to halt the experiment for fear the contagion might spread. A few years later, the European Union constitution was forced on the people of Europe anyway, under the guise of the Lisbon Treaty. In 2008, Ireland, also by way of referendum, refused to apply that treaty. And once again, a popular decision was brushed aside.When in 2015 Greece decided by referendum to reject Brussels\u2019 austerity plans, the European Union\u2019s antidemocratic response took no one by surprise: To deny the people\u2019s will had become a habit. In a flash of honesty, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, unabashedly declared, \u201cThere can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.\u201dBrexit may not have been the first cry of hope, but it may be the people\u2019s first real victory. The British have presented the union with a dilemma it will have a hard time getting out of. Either it allows Britain to sail away quietly and thus runs the risk of setting a precedent: The political and economic success of a country that left the European Union would be clear evidence of the union\u2019s noxiousness. Or, like a sore loser, the union makes the British pay for their departure by every means possible and thus exposes the tyrannical nature of its power. Common sense points toward the former option. I have a feeling Brussels will choose the latter.One thing is certain: Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will not make the union more democratic. The hierarchical structure of its supranational institutions will want to reinforce itself: Like all dying ideologies, the union knows only how to forge blindly ahead. The roles are already cast \u2014 Germany will lead the way, and France will obligingly tag along.Here is a sign: President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain take their lead directly from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, without running through Brussels. A quip attributed to Henry Kissinger, \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d now has a clear answer: Call Berlin.So the people of Europe have but one alternative left: to remain bound hand-and-foot to a union that betrays national interests and popular sovereignty and that throws our countries wide open to massive immigration and arrogant finance, or to reclaim their freedom by voting.Calls for referendums are ringing throughout the Continent. I myself have suggested to Mr. Hollande that one such public consultation be held in France. He did not fail to turn me down. More and more, the destiny of the European Union resembles the destiny of the Soviet Union, which died from its own contradictions.The People\u2019s Spring is now inevitable! The only question left to ask is whether Europe is ready to rid itself of its illusions, or if the return to reason will come with suffering. I made my decision a long time ago: I chose France. I chose sovereign nations. I chose freedom.Marine Le Pen is president of the National Front party in France. This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Dads\u2019 Club", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "When my wife, Courtney, and I were expecting our first child just a few years ago, I was astonished by the almost instantaneous community of expectant and new mothers that greeted her. Despite the fact that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just moved cross-country and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet know many people, she was flooded with sage advice and a deep sense of community.It was impressive, and yet it often left me feeling like a bystander. As I watched the anticipation of these expectant mothers shift into weekly get-togethers with babies rolling around on blankets on the floor, I found myself envious and wondering: Where was the parallel universe of new dads?After experiencing, often appreciating, and sometimes lamenting many of these dynamics for the first two years of our daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, I decided to try to bring some dads together to talk about our shared experience. I had a hunch that I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one yearning for a community and some deeper conversation on fatherhood.I identified 28 relatively new fathers, mostly through my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, and finally worked up the courage to invite them. A stream of responses to my email invitation came promptly and enthusiastically.On a cool, Bay Area night, those two dozen eager dads (few of whom knew one another) showed up at our place with an enviable array of fancy cheeses, a homemade coffee cake, some Brussels sprouts smoked via some jury-rigged stovetop contraption, and no small amount of uncertainty about what the hell they were doing there. If all else failed, at least we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t starve.Among us were both nonprofit and tech company workers, stay-at-home dads, a tattooed investment banker-turned-restaurateur, and a couple of writers, myself included. Most had one child; a few had two.Nervously excited and visibly breaking a sweat, I explained my reason for bringing the group together: to give new fathers a chance to talk honestly about the highs and lows of their new identity, together.Throughout our conversation, the mood in the room was fun and lively, but at other times it also felt almost sacred. Although there were many moments of group laughter, unlike so many typical gatherings of guys where there is often cross-talk and side jokes, only one person spoke at a time.To get things started, I asked the group: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has surprised you most about fatherhood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d (My wife, a skilled facilitator, had suggested it.) The answers were remarkably wide-ranging. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy own parents seem to care very little about my children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one dad said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving a child has made me lose my career ambition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another.For many of us, as much fun as it can be, being a father is all-consuming and omnipresent, blurring time and space like few other experiences. Some days, especially during those early sleepless nights, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to know which end is up. And yet these few hours of conversation every couple of months somehow manage to stay with me. I often find myself reflecting on things other fathers said in our groups, days, weeks or even months after the fact. Others have reported the same.At the end of that first night, one of the other dads asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow often do you guys have conversations like this, with other guys? Once a week? Once a month? Once a year?\u00e2\u0080\u009d After the last prompt, finally a mass of hands started going up.Guys like us, it turns out, are hungry for a place to talk with other men, particularly about how fatherhood is changing us, and changing writ large. Just as literature has long helped people see that our seemingly personal struggles are universal, being able to talk in this group offers a similar revelation. In an age of near-constant superficial virtual connection, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an enormous benefit in having a real life community to confide in more deeply and provide a genuine social network \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially for men and young fathers so often without it.Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Gas Is Going Up, but Maybe Not Enough", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGas prices have been rising, though you may not be aware of it because they are still extraordinarily low.That\u2019s good news. And it\u2019s an opportune time to consider whether we should take steps that would keep prices moving in the right direction: upward.I\u2019m not a fan of expensive gas for its own sake. I drive a car, mainly on weekends, and prefer to pay less to fill the tank, like everybody else. But rock-bottom prices encourage behavioral patterns that aren\u2019t beneficial \u2014 not if we want to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.The markets are likely to do that job for a while. While they have given up some ground lately, oil prices have almost doubled since February, so we can expect that gas at the pump, which typically trails wholesale oil prices, will continue to climb in the short term. No one knows, of course, where oil or gas prices will be a year or two from now.I don\u2019t think that way when gas prices are high, as they were until fairly recently. Recall that a gallon of regular cost more than $3 two years ago, and more than $4 in 2008.Those high gas prices contributed to a virtuous cycle in consumer behavior, according to statistics provided by Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.Here are a few important numbers.But as gas prices rise, people are shifting back toward more environmentally friendly models. This fuel economy measure rose to 25.4 miles per gallon in May \u2014 up 0.2 miles per gallon in one month. In an email, Mr. Sivak said, \u201cThe improvement likely reflects the increased price of gasoline in May, and the consequent increased interest in more fuel-efficient vehicles by buyers of all vehicle classes.\u201dHow you view these current fuel economy levels depends on your point of comparison, he observed. It is \u201cdown 0.4 m.p.g. from the peak reached in August 2014, but still up 5.3 m.p.g. since October 2007,\u201d when his institute began compiling this statistic.In short, when gas is really cheap, Americans are likely to buy less fuel-efficient vehicles and drive more, which we\u2019ve already seen happen.In the meantime, gasoline prices are inching higher. Adding a modest gasoline tax of, say, 25 cents a gallon \u2014 or a more ambitious carbon tax \u2014 would magnify and consolidate that upward trend.One problem with such taxes \u2014 aside from the glaring fact that taxes are generally unpopular \u2014 is that they tend to be regressive. A gasoline tax, for example, burdens low-wage people who must drive to work, but tax credits aimed at low-income car commuters could offset this.Taxes and prices affect behavior in fairly predictable ways. Without taxes, the benefits of higher prices can be expected to flow mainly to energy companies and their investors, and Wall Street will certainly calculate those effects. But we all have broader interests, and it may be that the best thing we can do for ourselves and the environment is impose a tax.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Choices in New York Congressional Primaries", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byEditorialHeads up, New York, there\u2019s an election coming up. Congressional primaries are on June 28. Here are recommendations in five races \u2014 three of them for open seats \u2014 that could make a difference locally and even nationally.But it will be hard to make a true break with the Rangel era by electing either of the two veteran Albany politicians in the race, Assemblyman Keith Wright or State Senator Adriano Espaillat. Mr. Wright is, in fact, Mr. Rangel\u2019s chosen successor, an affable pol deeply rooted in Harlem\u2019s political and business establishment. In 23 years in the Legislature, Mr. Wright has not been tainted by that body\u2019s infamous corruption, but neither has he stood out as a reformer or a particularly creative lawmaker. His sponsorship of a nation-leading \u201cbill of rights\u201d for domestic workers is an exception.Mr. Espaillat, who has the strong support of his many fellow Dominicans, challenged Mr. Rangel in 2014 and nearly won. But he ran a campaign that to some seemed more like an appeal to Dominican pride than one that sought to build alliances across ethnic lines in a historically black district that has gained new Latino and white residents, among other groups. This district needs someone who is both a strong reformer and a community unifier.That won\u2019t be Adam Clayton Powell IV, who was a weak assemblyman and has little to offer besides his father\u2019s famous name. Two other candidates, former Ambassador Suzan Johnson Cook and Assemblyman Guillermo Linares, a former member of the New York City Council, are respected in the community but have little support.Anna Kaplan, a member of the town council in North Hempstead, has a compelling life story: She fled revolutionary Iran in 1979 at 13, and built a life as a lawyer and local Nassau politician. Jon Kaiman, a former town supervisor in Nassau County, deserves credit for inventively tackling local problems with limited money. Steve Stern, a Suffolk County legislator and lawyer, has Mr. Israel\u2019s endorsement, but does not otherwise stand out among his competitors. Of the candidates, Mr. Suozzi, with his broader experience and political talent, is the one who can bring big ideas and a pragmatic governing style to Washington.Of these two well-qualified candidates, Ms. Teachout would be the better choice. Though she is a newcomer to that part of New York (she grew up not too far away, on a farm over the border in Vermont), she has the potential to be a rarity in Congress \u2014 an effective local representative who has national stature as a legal expert on political reform. She made her name by running a spirited campaign against Mr. Cuomo, and with her book, \u201cCorruption in America.\u201d Her political skills and expertise would make her a powerful ally for those who have become angry and disillusioned by Washington\u2019s chronic dysfunction. Ms. Teachout could focus attention on the ways big business, big agriculture and big monopolies distort the economy and hobble those trying to survive. That and dedicated constituent service would make her a credit to the New York delegation.Advertisement"}

Volleyball\u2019s training center. \u201cAnd I\u2019m no spring chicken. I don\u2019t want to get Zika and have to wait an additional year, or whatever it may be, for us to have kids. I\u2019m paying attention to Zika, and I\u2019m concerned about it. It\u2019s not going to stop me from going down there, but I\u2019m taking measures right now.\u201dIn interviews with many other likely Olympians, most said they were not hugely concerned about Zika but planned to take suggested precautions against it \u2014 generally by avoiding mosquito bites. The threat has mostly altered plans of friends and family members who expected to go to Rio to cheer them.\u201cMy brother\u2019s wife is pregnant, so if I go, he won\u2019t be coming,\u201d the American indoor volleyball player Murphy Troy said. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. That\u2019s the biggest impact \u2014 other family and friends, people who may have come before may not come now.\u201cAs far as an athlete perspective, there\u2019s not much we can do but be as prepared as we can to be mosquito-free \u2014 bug spray and long sleeves and stay inside. The information that I\u2019ve gotten is that maybe it\u2019s not as bad in Rio as the media has portrayed. We\u2019re kind of being optimistic but also want to be as prepared as we can.\u201dGenerally, for those who participate in sports in which the Olympics represent the ultimate achievement, the threat of Zika \u2014 or, for that matter, Rio\u2019s polluted water, its propensity for random violence, its collapsing economy or its scandal-ridden politics \u2014 is not enough to keep them away.Several of those who have expressed reservations have been golfers, tennis players and basketball players. Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook and James Harden are among the N.B.A. players to have opted out of the Olympics, although none cited Zika concerns as the reason.U.S.A. Volleyball officials said that no players expected to make the Olympic rosters, men or women, had suggested they might not attend.The beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time gold medalist, said in an interview on Wednesday that she was not concerned, having been in Rio for a tournament in March. The threat of mosquitoes is expected to decline into August, which is the heart of the Brazilian winter.\u201cI took my essential oils, I\u2019m going to bring my Honest bug repellent, and I escaped all mosquito bites until the very last day,\u201d Walsh Jennings said. \u201cAnd I came home, and I didn\u2019t get Zika.\u201dShe said her three children would not go to Rio \u2014 not because of Zika concerns but because they were young and there was not a lot for them to do.April Ross, Walsh Jennings\u2019s playing partner, said Zika was not a worry, but her agent, who is pregnant, is not planning to go to Rio.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be smart about it and take all the precautions you can, which we will,\u201d said Ross, who is married. \u201cAnd I plan on getting tested when we get back before we start trying to have a baby. If we have to wait, we\u2019re going to wait. In my mind, there\u2019s no point in necessarily worrying about it if there\u2019s nothing you can really do. Take the precautions you can, and forget about it.\u201dThat is why Speraw, the men\u2019s indoor coach, is taking the pre-emptive measure of freezing his sperm. His wife, Michelle, and their 7-month-old daughter, Brooklyn, will not go to Rio because of concerns over Zika, he said. And an original travel-party list of about 10 family members and friends has been whittled to just his parents.\u201cI\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m 44,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait and try to have a baby when I\u2019m 46, you know?

It was seized on by far-right and anti-Brussels parties across Europe, with Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France calling for a \u201cFrexit\u201d referendum and Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands calling for a \u201cNexit.\u201dEuropean officials met in Brussels to begin discussing a response and to emphasize their commitment to strengthening and improving the bloc, which will have 27 members after Britain\u2019s departure.\u201cAt stake is the breakup, pure and simple, of the union,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France said, adding, \u201cNow is the time to invent another Europe.\u201dGermany urged calm. \u201cToday marks a turning point for Europe,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \u201cIt is a turning point for the European unification process.\u201dWith all votes counted, Leave was ahead by 52 percent to 48 percent, an enormous snub to Britain\u2019s elite.The process of withdrawal is likely to play out slowly, perhaps taking years. It will mean pulling out of the world\u2019s largest trading zone, with 508 million residents, including the 65 million people of Britain, and abandoning a commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. It has profound implications for Britain\u2019s legal system, which incorporates a large body of regulations that cover everything from product safety to digital privacy, and for Britain\u2019s economy.The main ways in which the change will be felt are on trade \u2014 Britain will lose automatic access to the European single market \u2014 and on immigration, with Britain no longer bound to allow any European Union citizen to live and work in the country. Britain will have to try to negotiate new deals covering those issues.To those in Britain who supported remaining in Europe, the result of Thursday\u2019s in-or-out referendum was a painful rejection, leaving the country exposed to a possible economic downturn and signaling a step away from the multiculturalism that they say has made Britain among Europe\u2019s most vibrant societies.To backers of leaving, the outcome was vindication of their belief that Britain could pursue an independent course in the world, free of the Brussels bureaucracy and able to control the flow of immigrants into the country.For Mr. Cameron, the results were a humiliating disaster, forcing him to announce his departure only 13 months after he won re-election behind a surprisingly large Conservative majority in national elections. Critics said that he had led Britain out of Europe for no good reason and that the unity of the United Kingdom itself was threatened, with Scotland now more likely to try again to bolt.Speaking in front of 10 Downing Street early Friday, with his wife, Samantha, standing nearby, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a new leader had been chosen by his party, a decision he expected by October. He will stay now to provide stability, but a new prime minister, he said, should formally begin Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and negotiate the terms of that divorce.Britons voted on Thursday to leave the European Union. The Leave side led with 17.4 million votes, or 52 percent, versus the Remain side\u2019s 16.1 million, or 48 percent, with a turnout of around 72 percent.\u201cI held nothing back,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. His voice breaking, he said, \u201cI love this country and I feel honored to have served it.\u201dHis statement created an immediate churn in the political waters, with speculation that the two Conservatives most likely to succeed him are Boris Johnson, the flamboyant former mayor of London who helped lead the Leave campaign, and Theresa May, the Home secretary, who supported Mr. Cameron and Remain, but concentrated on doing her job rather than campaigning.Mr. Johnson was booed Friday morning as he left his home in London, which voted overwhelmingly for Remain. In a brief statement later, Mr. Johnson praised Mr. Cameron, an old friend and rival from school days, as \u201can extraordinary politician\u201d and said he was sad to see him go.Mr. Johnson refused to answer questions about his own future but praised the result. \u201cWe can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,\u201d he said.But if Britain\u2019s Treasury and Central Bank are to be believed, the economic hit the country will take from leaving the single market of the European Union will be considerable, with permanent loss of economic growth, higher unemployment and lower tax receipts.The immediate market reaction was an effort to find a floor in the midst of so much uncertainty, said Barrington Pitt Miller, an equity research analyst at Janus Capital. But he said he expected British economic growth to be zero or negative in the short and medium term, with a secondary impact over time as London\u2019s financial services sector, which makes up about 10 percent of the economy, begins to move staff members and headquarters to Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.A lot will depend on how the European Union chooses in the end to respond \u2014 whether it is \u201cvindictive, friendly or frightened,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson and some in the Leave campaign argued that the other European nations valued trade with Britain so much that they would negotiate a special deal after Britain\u2019s withdrawal to let Britain remain in the single market without having to guarantee freedom of movement and labor. That seems highly unlikely because it would only encourage other nations to pressure Brussels. But it may be that as the dust settles, some sort of association agreement with Britain could be negotiated, as Ms. Merkel suggested on Friday, though the price could be high.Investors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.The economy aside, the United Kingdom itself now faces a threat to its survival. Scotland voted by 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the European Union, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Friday that it was \u201cdemocratically unacceptable\u201d for Scotland to be dragged out of it against its will. Another independence referendum, she said, \u201cis now highly likely.\u201dAppearing before reporters in front of the flags of Scotland and the European Union, Ms. Sturgeon, who leads the dominant Scottish National Party, said, \u201cIt is a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.\u201dThe threat is real, but any new vote will not come soon, because it is only two years since the last one, which the Scottish nationalists lost, and the price of oil, on which the Scottish economy largely depends, has dropped.Northern Ireland, too, voted for Remain, although Protestants and Roman Catholics, as usual, were split. But the prospect of an open border with Ireland now becoming a hard border between the European Union and the United Kingdom will change matters and require checks of passports and goods, putting strain on the Good Friday peace agreement.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.In England, which voted for Leave, there are obvious strains, too.They can be found between the young who voted in large numbers for Remain and those over 45, who voted for Leave; between the cities and the countryside; between richer and poorer; and between better educated and less educated.London itself, the glittering, expensive, multicultural and multinational global capital, with its many immigrants and liberal values, was isolated in a sea of those favoring Leave; in some sense, the vote was against the wealthy elites who live in London and rule everyone else from there.Last, there is the chasm between political leaders, nearly all of whom backed Remain, and many of their voters, who rebuffed them.Bronwen Maddox, former editor of Prospect Magazine and the new director of the Institute for Government, a research institution, said in an email that \u201cthere is a growing intolerance for representative government, which is likely to have consequences for the ability of any government to run the country.\u201dThe referendum, she suggested, might have been about Brussels, but it revealed and unleashed many other forces. Those forces, she said, \u201chave ejected the U.K. from the European Union; they may now wreak similar turmoil on the old political parties themselves.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of the British economy represented by the financial services sector. It is 10 percent of the gross national product, not 80 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Global Flavor to Art Basel\u2019s 47th Edition", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingAs Art Basel opens its 47th edition on June 16, what is now the world\u2019s most prestigious art fair will attempt to demonstrate a robust middle age. Two hundred and eighty-six galleries from 33 countries are gathering at the Messe Basel exhibition hall through June 19. A dizzying array of artworks is spread over six sectors at the fair, with satellite events spilling all over the Swiss city.Cutting-edge contemporary pieces make up a large percentage of the offerings, but modern works from the 20th century are strongly in evidence too, more so than at other top fairs.\u201cWe want to feed the entire ecosystem of the art world, which means we have to be different things to different people,\u201d said Marc Spiegler, the global head of Art Basel.He said the staff took pride in the fact that the fair organizes noncommercial elements like \u201cZome Alloy,\u201d the artist Oscar Tuazon\u2019s wood-and-aluminum installation, in Messeplatz, the outdoor square in front of Art Basel.But sales are the live-or-die factor. Despite the economic vicissitudes that have buffeted the world economy \u2014 especially in Europe \u2014 Art Basel still styles itself as the hub for connoisseur-collectors who can pay dearly for art.As Mr. Spiegler put it, speaking about the dealers, \u201cIf they can\u2019t sell great works in Basel, they can\u2019t sell them anywhere.\u201dThe New York photography dealer Edwynn Houk, who has been showing at the fair for 30 years, said there were slight differences among the three editions of Art Basel (Miami Beach and Hong Kong are the other two).\u201cFor us, Basel in Switzerland is exceeded by Basel in Miami Beach in terms of sheer sales,\u201d said Mr. Houk, who shows in both locations. \u201cBut no other fair compares to the Swiss edition in terms of getting a terrific representation from museums and the most important collectors of the U.S. and Europe.\u201dThis year Mr. Houk is showing the work of 14 photographers, with an emphasis on early modernists like Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.The nationality of dealers, artists and collectors becomes less important every year at all art fairs as the market essentially ignores borders. Mixing it up is the guiding principle for many.Barbara Wien, who runs a gallery in Berlin bearing her name, is showing the work of Indian, Mexican, Korean and Swedish artists, among others.\u201cI have an international view of culture,\u201d Ms. Wien said. \u201cThat\u2019s very important to me.\u201dMs. Wien first showed at the fair in 2006, but this edition is her first in the Galleries sector, which features the heaviest hitters from around the world.\u201cBasel is not a new place for me, but this is the next step in a way,\u201d she said. She also organized a piece for this year\u2019s Unlimited sector, for large-scale projects that don\u2019t fit in traditional booths.The gallery Jos\u00e9Garci\u00e1.mx, based in Mexico City, shows mostly European artists, and is also making its debut in the Galleries sector.\u201cWe want an exchange of ideas,\u201d said Ana Castella, the gallery\u2019s director.The booth\u2019s works by Nina Beier, Marie Lund, Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n Cerrillo and Edgardo Aragon have something in common, Ms. Castella added: \u201cThey are mostly abstract, and materiality is very prominent \u2014 they rely on metal like copper and bronze.\u201dThis year\u2019s Unlimited sector is the biggest ever at the fair, with some 88 works.\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary effort on the part of the galleries, but more people than ever want to do it,\u201d Mr. Spiegler said, adding that they received a record number of applications for the sector.The size of the Unlimited projects means they are not oriented toward being picked up by average collectors.\u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t buy what\u2019s at Unlimited,\u201d said Gianni Jetzer, who organized the sector and serves as curator-at-large at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.\u201cThey\u2019re too process-oriented, or too big, too esoteric,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be a museum, but we\u2019re challenging the limits of what contemporary art can be.\u201d The global flavor of the fair is well in evidence in Unlimited, too. In showing pieces by Archana Hande, Prabhavathi Meppayil and Mithu Sen, Mr. Jetzer said, \u201cWe have three of the most important contemporary female artists from India.\u201dThe Feature sector, for what organizers call \u201cprecise curatorial projects,\u201d is also newly expanded, with 32 galleries.The James Cohan Gallery, with branches in New York and Shanghai, will be showing pieces by Robert Smithson, famous for his earthworks like \u201cSpiral Jetty.\u201d But the offerings are all from his earlier, lesser-known Pop period, including the colorful sculpture \u201cFling\u201d (1965).For collectors who value architecture as well as art, the booth of the Zurich-based Galerie Gmurzynska will be of interest, given that it was partly conceived by the architect Zaha Hadid, whose death this year at age 65 shook the design world.For the gallery\u2019s Zurich location, on view now, Ms. Hadid and her studio worked on a computer-generated version of the Merzbau, a room-size, modernist grotto of sorts by the artist Kurt Schwitters (1887\u20131948) that is something of an obsession for fans of modernism.The Basel booth\u2019s walls will be printed with images of the Zurich installation, but hung with real works by Schwitters. \u201cWe had a long relationship with Zaha,\u201d said Mathias Rastorfer, an owner of Galerie Gmurzynska. \u201cShe loved Schwitters, and she was completely inspired by the Merzbau, and fascinated by it.\u201d Ms. Hadid even chose the Schwitters works that are on view and for sale at the fair.The Zurich installation, Mr. Rastorfer said, reminds him of a cave. \u201cThat\u2019s one of her masterful skills,\u201d he added of Ms. Hadid\u2019s work. \u201cShe transforms spaces so you don\u2019t recognize where you are.\u201dThe project had been under discussion for years between Ms. Hadid and the gallery, and it started just a few months before she died.\u201cWe said, \u2018Now we have to finish this,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Rastorfer said. \u201cIt\u2019s being executed exactly as Zaha wanted it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Having Won, Boris Johnson and \u2018Brexit\u2019 Leaders Fumble", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 With their giddy celebrations of \u201cindependence day\u201d having given way to political and economic turmoil, one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union: They had no plan for what comes next.The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or \u201cBrexit.\u201d But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign.In changing their tune, the leaders of the anti-European Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union \u2014 which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week \u2014 would be available to help finance the National Health Service.For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services.Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and right-wing groups like the U.K. Independence Party eager to build support.\u201cThere is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010.\u201d\u201cIt is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cI do not believe that is so.\u201dSuggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, \u201cBritish people will still be able to go and work in the E.U.; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down.\u201dNot only that, he asserted, \u201cThere will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market.\u201dWhat he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in decision-making.But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member.Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his free-market economic credentials.But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. \u201cI worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,\u201d he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right.The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, \u201cRemain,\u201d against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U.K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics.\u201cThere was no coherence, because it wasn\u2019t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,\u201d he said.Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of free-market economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said.\u201cAnd now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a one-party government that must reflect the schism in itself,\u201d he said.In the aftermath of the Leave campaign\u2019s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp\u2019s plan.The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: \u201cThere is no plan. The Leave campaign don\u2019t have a post-Brexit plan.\u201d Then the legislator added, \u201cNumber 10 should have had a plan,\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of the Felon-Friendly Workplace", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byST. LOUIS \u2014 Rick Plowman\u2019s business, installing suspended ceilings in offices, schools and hotels, could use new blood. But hiring is tough, he tells the man sitting in his office. The 20-somethings he sees haven\u2019t had the work ethic, haven\u2019t had the hustle.\u201cI have a hard time hiring people with that drive,\u201d he says. \u201cI go through a lot of employees that don\u2019t have that drive.\u201dThe man listening, Scott Anders, is a federal probation officer \u2014 and he spots the opening he came for: He pitches Mr. Plowman on the notion of hiring more ex-cons.\u201cWhat we really want is just for them to have an opportunity to interview with you,\u201d Mr. Anders says.Mr. Plowman isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s a good idea. What about his company\u2019s truckloads of expensive construction tools, he wonders aloud. You send the new hire out with that truck, and \u201cYour initial instinct is, \u2018Is that coming back to me?\u2019\u201d Mr. Plowman says. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate you think that. But that\u2019s the fact.\u201dMr. Anders knows this dance well. He is the architect of one of the most ambitious jobs-for-felons program in the federal courts system.With significant gains in two crucial measurements \u2014 number of those employed and of those who stay out of trouble while under supervision \u2014 the Eastern District of Missouri\u2019s program has served as a model for state and federal prisoner re-entry programs nationwide. Its mantra is that hiring people with criminal records can be good for business. That is a tough sell.Mr. Anders is on the front lines of a fundamental challenge within the federal criminal system: the struggle to reintegrate former prisoners into society. When released prisoners can\u2019t find work, it contributes to a costly, negative social and economic cycle of recidivism, crime, and ultimately perhaps a return to imprisonment, all at the expense of taxpayers and communities.The Bureau of Prisons responded with vows to improve. A longtime prison-reform advocate, Pat Nolan of the American Conservative Union, said the deficiencies extend beyond teaching skills to perform particular jobs.To make prisoners employable, prisons need an injection of real-world business smarts in their programs, said Mr. Nolan, a former California lawmaker who served a federal prison sentence on corruption charges. That means focusing on the jobs that are in demand on the outside.And it requires teaching prisoners to think of themselves as employees.\u201cIt\u2019s getting up on time, cleaning up, showing up when you\u2019re supposed to, putting in a full day\u2019s work for a full day\u2019s pay, not pilfering from the cash drawer or the supply room \u2014 you know, the basics,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. Making matters more complicated, often the ex-prisoners are young people \u201cwho have never had an adult in their life that had a regular job and that they could emulate.\u201dFifteen years ago, Mr. Anders said, the St. Louis federal probation office faced a different sort of numbers gap: No one knew precisely how many of its 2,000 or so ex-offenders were unemployed. Back then, Mr. Anders said, he and his colleagues figured, \u201cIf they\u2019re not working, they don\u2019t want to.\u201dA new boss, Douglas Burris, came in and ordered up the numbers, which showed that, despite the booming economy at the time, convicted felons supervised by the office were three times as likely to be unemployed than the average local worker. Mr. Anders was given a new job: start trying to fix that.The standard approach has long been relatively disconnected from the real-world job market. Focused on teaching \u201csoft\u201d skills \u2014 interview etiquette, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing and the like \u2014 it often sent prisoners into the labor pool lacking marketable skills or direction, resulting in low-paying, short-term jobs.While studying work force development, Mr. Anders said, he met a consultant from the National Institute of Corrections who suggested a different approach: focus on what employers need. His office began examining local labor-market projections to understand which industries might be hiring. Armed with that information, the office began working inside prisons to start inmates\u2019 career planning.In effect, Mr. Anders began building an employment agency. He assembled lists of employers willing to hear from ex-prisoners and a roster of groups that could provide counseling that his team could not offer.The team developed questionnaires to determine prisoners\u2019 schooling, training and interests. It added mock job fairs, where employers conducted practice interviews and explained the jobs available on the outside, to help prisoners plan ahead or seek training.Case officers are graded on their ability to place former prisoners in appropriate jobs, with a goal of limiting job hopping.Prisoners, once released, are sorted into two groups. Those unable or unwilling to function in the workplace receive remedial counseling in social skills and setting employment goals. Others have their interests or skills matched with available jobs while getting training under the Second Chance Act, a federal law that finances prisoner re-entry programs.Over all, though, the St. Louis office was essentially on its own. Federal money is limited, and national probation officials have not pushed to make employment programs a higher priority, partly out of deference to local prerogatives, but also because of caution bred by research that questions whether employment actually causes recidivism to drop.At first, the program required an intensive door-to-door effort to persuade employers. That cold-calling continues, but now the program focuses more on labor unions, truck-driving schools and other employment middlemen.Greg Gooch of S&J Potashnick Transportation Inc. in Sikeston, Mo., said he had successfully hired through one of those truck-driving schools. \u201cWe\u2019d almost rather have them than some that\u2019s never done anything, never had a job,\u201d Mr. Gooch said. They have seen hardship, he pointed out. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go back to where they were.\u201dUnder the program, unemployment among the office\u2019s ex-offenders fell early on by more than half, to under 6 percent from a previous 12 percent. Since the recession, it has hovered around 5 percent, notable considering that rates of 50 percent or more among ex-offenders are the norm. Recidivism was 15 percent in a 2012 study, compared with 38 percent nationally in the federal system.There are some failures. Mr. Anders recounts one: a bank robber who, after his release from prison, was sent on a parking-lot maintenance crew to the same bank, which he promptly robbed again.But more typically, failures stem from a mismatch between prison attitudes toward authority and behavior suited to the workplace, where threats and intransigence won\u2019t cut it. That takes time and effort to fix.Before he accepted help that landed him a job as an ironworker that pays more than $30 an hour, Mark Geralds emerged from a 17-year prison stint wary of probation officers. Mr. Geralds, a burly 46-year-old who was jailed for drug crimes, says that his attitude was, \u201cJust stay away from me.\u201dBut after floundering in low-paying jobs delivering furniture and working on lawn crews, he realized the probation officers were trustworthy. \u201cThose guys were good,\u201d he says.To date, St. Louis probation officials have trained personnel from 80 of the 93 other federal districts\u2019 probation offices. Delegations from state and federal parole and probation offices make pilgrimages to the office.One obstacle remains companies\u2019 concerns about developing a reputation as a felon-friendly workplace. When Mr. Anders visits prospective employers, three out of four still say they are not interested. Even so, \u201cIt is better now than it was in the beginning,\u201d he notes.Sometimes, employers that do say yes are motivated by necessity, given how many Americans have some sort of criminal record. Johns Hopkins Health System recruits through local nonprofit groups in Baltimore that serve ex-offenders, highlighting the fact that 5 percent of its 18,000-person work force has a record. \u201cThere were so many people who had something on their background, if you were going to disqualify everybody, then what are you going to be left with?\u201d said Michele Sedney, a Johns Hopkins recruitment executive.Back in the office of Mr. Plowman, Mr. Anders has encountered an obstacle. It turns out that Mr. Plowman hired a recruit early last year on the recommendation of the carpenters\u2019 union, without hearing directly from the probation office. He learned later that his new employee had been in prison for selling cocaine.\u201cIt is something that, as a company, I think I would like to know,\u201d Mr. Plowman tells Mr. Anders.But Mr. Plowman also acknowledges the value of hires who \u201chave been around the block\u201d and have learned a lesson or two. He warms to the idea of hiring more former prisoners. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cmaybe there\u2019s something to the fact that these people are getting a second chance.\u201dBut if he does hire more former prisoners, Mr. Plowman says, it won\u2019t be because he\u2019s a pushover for a hard-luck story. \u201cYou need someone that wants to do the job,\u201d he says.Mr. Anders promises to stay in touch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Needs Help That Only Congress Can Provide", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Given the dismal employment report for May, released on Friday, it would be cruel and unusual for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. The report is more evidence that the economy is already slowing; it clearly does not need the Fed to tap the brakes by raising rates.What it needs is for Congress to step up with federal investment and federal spending now, when borrowing costs are still low and when consumers and businesses are clearly unable to generate full employment.The economy created 38,000 jobs in May, the worst monthly tally since employment began to recover from the recession, back in 2010.Taking a broader view, job growth has been decelerating for the past year, from a monthly average of 200,000 over the past 12 months to an average of 116,000 over the past three months.The news on unemployment last month was also bad. The jobless rate dropped, from 5 percent in April to 4.7 percent, but not because of more hiring. It fell because people left the labor force \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a sign that job opportunities are lacking. A decline in the size of the work force does not signal a sudden national attack of laziness and, in this case, it does not signal retirements: The recent decline has occurred among people ages 25 to 54.Worse, the numbers for May would have been even weaker but for the fact that 470,000 people took part-time jobs last month, even though they needed and wanted full-time work. Involuntary part-time status signals hardship for individuals and wasted human capital in the broader economy. In all, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underemployment rate remains stuck at 9.7 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an elevated measure of distress and lost potential.In previous eras, before Republican majorities in Congress devoted themselves solely to thwarting the White House, stewarding the economy with federal fiscal policy was known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriming the pump\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009claying a foundation for growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was one of the acknowledged duties of Congress. It still is a congressional duty, but one that has gone willfully unmet.The economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural resilience can overcome some congressional intransigence. But over time, it will not and cannot overcome the drag of sustained poor stewardship.That is not to say that bolstered federal investment in the economy is a cure-all or that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican-led Congress is wholly to blame for the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems. But it is wholly to blame for not doing what only it can do to foster a fair and flourishing economy.Only federal investment can repair and modernize the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure, provide financing to hire more teachers, support basic scientific research and combat climate change \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of which would create good jobs today and prosperity in the future.The alternative is the deteriorating status quo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Credit Suisse Boss Faces Revolt From Bankers Over Strategy Shift", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byInstead, Mr. Thiam said, the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in China, Indonesia and Africa. The message: The future for the company is in managing the wealth of others.One year in, Credit Suisse stock is down 50 percent. And the investment bank, the second largest in Switzerland after UBS, is in open revolt.Across Europe, banking giants like Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland have, to varying degrees, moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets. Sluggish growth in large European economies \u2014 not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates \u2014 have not helped matters, either.But what makes the situation at Credit Suisse stand out is that Mr. Thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities. The question is not whether Mr. Thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt, domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over.\u201cIt is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic,\u201d said Guy Moszkowski, a longtime securities analyst at Autonomous Research.By any measure, Mr. Thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank. Born to a prominent family in Ivory Coast, he cut short a career at McKinsey & Company in Paris in 1994 to join a reform-minded government in his home country as a top banker and minister.Following a military coup in 1999, Mr. Thiam returned to McKinsey, and in 2009, he was named chief executive of Prudential, the British insurance conglomerate \u2014 becoming the first African to head a major listed company in Britain.Six-foot-four and snugly tailored, Mr. Thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools. He had a successful run at Prudential (no relation to an American company with a similar name), overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the Asian operations of the American International Group. Along the way, he became one of London\u2019s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global get-togethers.That he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise. \u201cThere needs to be a cultural change,\u201d he said in a televised interview in March, in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay. \u201cA lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs.\u201dIn turn, deal makers in London and New York, who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly 40 percent, are not hiding their dislike of the man.More than any other bank on Wall Street, Credit Suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses, allocating large chunks in company stock, which has halved in value. So when their new chief executive gave a speech in May and said that Credit Suisse\u2019s stock price \u201creflected reality,\u201d bankers, especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades, could not believe it.On Credit Suisse\u2019s newly renovated trading floor in New York, several bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, grumbled that Mr. Thiam had \u201clost the building,\u201d which is Wall Street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders. And when he has appeared on television in recent months, employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen, according those bankers, who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in New York last year, but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier, said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly. In particular, many at Credit Suisse find Mr. Thiam\u2019s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low.This is particularly true when compared with Brady W. Dougan, his low-key predecessor: Mr. Thiam\u2019s own dealings with the media are handled by a British firm, Powerscourt. He enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in London and Davos, Switzerland. And he recently purchased a luxury home in Herrliberg, an exclusive lakeside enclave in Zurich.To be sure, analysts agree that Credit Suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like Deutsche Bank as a profit center. Instead, Mr. Thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm\u2019s private bankers in Asia, by providing loans to palm-oil magnates in Indonesia or helping billionaire clients in China with initial public offerings.Mr. Thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies. He has been to China and broader Asia at least four times in his new capacity, and his business cards carry a Mandarin translation on the back.Mr. Thiam\u2019s defenders say that with the future of Credit Suisse in doubt, he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from well-compensated traders and bankers should not deter him. And it is also true that wealth managers in Switzerland and Asia, where Mr. Thiam is adding resources, are embracing the new strategy.Following last year\u2019s losses, he also asked his board for a 40 percent cut in his bonus, taking in $4.5 million for the six months he worked last year.To date, the Credit Suisse board appears to be standing with Mr. Thiam. Indeed, having had two Wall Street chiefs since 2001, the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like Mr. Thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it.Nevertheless, directors were not happy with his televised comments in March when Mr. Thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him. Mr. Thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached, though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment. Mr. Thiam also called these distressed-debt traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a \u201cclarification\u201d of his remarks.\u201cThe board is 100 percent behind the strategy, Tidjane and the executive board,\u201d said Richard E. Thornburgh, a former Credit Suisse banker with 30 years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board\u2019s risk committee.With morale in New York at a low point, Mr. Thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders, hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients. For many, though, this is easier said than done. It is unusual, after all, for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm\u2019s revenue.That is particularly true on Wall Street, where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm, as productive bankers head for the exits in droves. Over the last six months, at least 18 bankers and traders have left the firm, with many of these coming from Credit Suisse\u2019s once prestigious technology unit in San Francisco.With wealth managers now ascendant, Mr. Thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed. \u201cIs there a vision. Is there a direction?\u201d Mr. Thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy. \u201cThe Germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end.\u201dLeslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A British Divorce From Europe? Henry VIII Blazed the Trail", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Across the English Channel, a great and unyielding power holds sway, denying London\u2019s rights. The sovereign state is not sovereign at all.But the English have been there before.Five centuries ago, King Henry VIII, chafing at the theological and financial clout of the papacy, broke with Rome and led his subjects into the new pastures of the Church of England, with himself as its supreme overlord. It was a step that changed Christendom, molding faith and identity to this day among the world\u2019s roughly 85 million Anglicans.Historical parallels can be facile if not misleading, and the differences between the two eras are profound, not least in the democratic nature of Britain\u2019s decision this time.But the echoes are strong enough to resonate at a moment when Britain is looking to its past for lessons that would apply to its future.Henry\u2019s pique was rooted in Rome\u2019s refusal to annul his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon. He went on to take five more wives in his quest for a male heir, in direct contradiction of Catholic orthodoxy.The soul-searching goes beyond that. Over centuries, England, and then Britain, has strutted the global stage as an imperial overlord whose people sometimes seem more comfortable in the guise of underdogs. The national psyche rests on a history of invasion, submission, conquest and self-assertion \u2014 from the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons through the Normans and on to dynasties entwined with the royal houses of Europe.In more recent years, waves of immigration \u2014 Jamaicans in the 1950s, then Pakistanis, Indians and other Asians in the 1960s \u2014 have reshaped the country\u2019s demographics. Christianity, prevalent in Henry\u2019s day, is professed by less than half the population. The loss of an empire and the rise of a complex, interconnected global economy has rekindled the notion that, in times of flux, the English define themselves by their opposition to a bigger outside power \u2014 the papacy in the 16th century; the European Union in the 21st.This go-it-alone theme suffused Churchill\u2019s speeches during World War II as Hitler\u2019s armies spread across Europe to the Continent\u2019s coastline. \u201cWe shall never surrender,\u201d Churchill declared in 1940, albeit with the caveat that Britain would fight on until \u201cthe New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\u201dToday\u2019s political leaders can barely resist the Churchillian mantra. Facing hostile questioning from a television audience on Sunday, a rattled Prime Minister David Cameron pointed out that \u201cat my office I sit two yards from\u201d where Churchill \u201cresolved to fight on against Hitler.\u201dChurchill did not wish to be alone, Mr. Cameron said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t quit,\u201d the prime minister added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t quit on democracy, he didn\u2019t quit on freedom. We want to fight for those things today.\u201d\u201cWe see nothing but good and hope in a richer, freer, more contented European commonalty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked, but not comprised. We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.\u201dDavid Starkey, a Cambridge historian critical of the European Union, has drawn a direct parallel with the modern battle for the nation\u2019s soul.\u201cEngland\u2019s semidetached relationship with continental Europe is neither new nor an aberration,\u201d he wrote in 2012. \u201cInstead, it is deeply rooted in the political development of the past 500 years.\u201dThe 16th-century debate \u201cwas couched in strikingly \u2018modern\u2019 terms,\u201d Dr. Starkey wrote, with Henry\u2019s opponents arguing the case for papal authority \u201clike a contemporary europhile,\u201d maintaining that England was \u201csubordinate to the laws and values of a Pan-European Christendom.\u201d\u201cHenry VIII\u2019s judges replied, on the contrary, that statute was binding and Parliament sovereign,\u201d Dr. Starkey said. Then, as now, the notion of sovereignty was central to the discussion, and the implications were enormous. By breaking with Rome, some historians argue, the English came to see themselves a nation apart \u2014 a self-image magnified by the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707 and by centuries of colonial expansion.\u201cImperial Britain was isolationist, xenophobic, anti-Catholic and nationalist,\u201d the historian Edwin Jones wrote in 1998, and a combination of these elements \u201chelped to sustain the self-identity of the British\u201d in the early 18th century, he added.In 1848, Lord Palmerston, then the foreign secretary, told Parliament: \u201cI may say without any vainglorious boast or without great offense to anyone that we stand at the head of moral, social and political civilization. Our task is to lead the way and direct the march of other nations.\u201dBut the British always seem to qualify global ambition with the kind of parochial preoccupations that persuaded Adam Smith in 1776 to coin the phrase \u201ca nation of shopkeepers.\u201dAs the empire grew, indeed, a group known as the Little Englanders advocated a retreat from headlong colonial expansion, particularly in southern Africa.These days, the term endures as a derogatory epithet for the Brexiteers, who prefer to claim the mantle of a reawakened Britannia ruling newer waves \u2014 this time through a web of trade deals and alliances beyond the perceived narrow constraints and petty regulation of Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the Economy Is Sinking, Policy Makers Are Far From Prepared", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBut what if I\u2019m wrong?It\u2019s possible that the economy is slowing significantly \u2014 that Friday\u2019s jobs report is the canary in the coal mine. Perhaps employment is slowing because of election-related anxiety, or Fed-induced fears of higher interest rates, or concerns about the world economy. Maybe the recovery has run its course.Whatever it is, I find it hard to think of a time in recent American history when policy makers are as ill-prepared to respond.The Federal Reserve still has interest rates set nearly as low as they will go. This means it can\u2019t use its standard tool of cutting rates to stimulate the economy.Typically, that would suggest turning to fiscal stimulus. But the odds of a timely stimulus are slim. Though it\u2019s only early June, Washington is already gripped by election fever, and Congress has decided to punt on just about every major issue until after the election.As a result, fiscal policy will most likely be delayed at least until a new administration takes office in early 2017. And who knows what the priorities of the new president might be?Add in the usual lags in recognizing the downturn and then passing and ultimately carrying out fiscal policy, and it seems unlikely that an economic slowdown will generate much of a policy response for nearly a year.If the economy falters, perhaps the Federal Reserve will return to a policy of quantitative easing. But this would require a major shift in thinking, as the Fed now seems impatient to return to more normal interest rates. I\u2019m doubtful that the Fed has any desire to reverse course soon, and particularly not in the run-up to an election.If the Fed were to turn to unconventional measures in the months before an election, political furor would be likely.Fed officials would face a very difficult decision: They could follow an expansionary monetary policy that would set the economy on a better course in the short run, but that could anger Congress, which could harm its effectiveness in the long run.If economic circumstances are sufficiently dire \u2014 as they were when the economy cratered during election season eight years ago \u2014 that could tip the balance toward monetary stimulus.But a more mundane slowdown \u2014 the kind where we spend a few months debating whether it\u2019s a recession \u2014 is unlikely to elicit such a response.Worse, market expectations of policy inaction can make the economy more vulnerable.When investors are confident that the authorities will counter any recessionary forces, they don\u2019t need to respond to every disappointment in the data. But when they expect inaction, even a minor slowdown might snowball into something bigger, raising the prospect of a rapid sell-off that might itself undermine confidence.Even if the economy is doing well, there\u2019s no guarantee that will persist: History teaches us that downturns are rarely expected. Even a healthy economy can suddenly slow if an earthquake in Japan disrupts global trade, strife in the Middle East causes oil prices to rise or financial trouble in Europe becomes contagious. We rarely see where the next downturn is coming from.Good economic management doesn\u2019t focus on today\u2019s success but rather on the possibility of tomorrow\u2019s failures. By that metric, at least, we seem in danger of underperforming.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Russian Oil Company Is for Sale \u2014 Again", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 For sale in Russia this summer: one repossessed asset, well loved and maintained. Seller is motivated. Everything must go.In this fire sale, the asset is Bashneft, the oil company once owned by Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, who was prosecuted and put under house arrest. And the seller is the Russian state, in desperate need of cash.At the right price, investors will bite. But the sale, and dozens of others taking place around the country, will reinforce Russia\u2019s reputation in the global markets for uncertainty.Early in his tenure, President Vladimir V. Putin pursued a policy of controlling the so-called commanding heights of the economy with a nationalization push that elbowed Russian and foreign owners out of strategic industries. Now, he is inviting investors back, as Russia faces the economic fallout from a second year of Western sanctions and low commodity prices.The political about-face, part of the seemingly endless cycle in Russia between nationalization and privatization, adds to investors\u2019 worries about being blindsided.In the early post-Soviet period, privatization was viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But those opportunities are just happening over and over again under Mr. Putin.Bashneft is coming full circle. Bashneft, Russia\u2019s sixth-largest oil company, was first privatized in a series of sales in the early 2000s. Then it was renationalized in 2014 when Mr. Yevtushenkov was put under house arrest. Now, it is for sale again.\u201cAny buyer today should understand the risks,\u201d Aleksandr Y. Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said of the latest planned resale of 51 percent of Bashneft. \u201cIn a few years, this deal, too, could be unwound for one reason or another.\u201dSuch uncertainty is a big reason investors remain wary of Russian stocks.Consider the differing perceptions of Brazil and Russia. Both developing countries are big commodity exporters facing serious economic headwinds. But investors are willing to pay only about half as much for a Russian company as they would for a Brazilian business with the same earnings potential, according to Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.Illustrative of Russia\u2019s stock troubles is Gazprom, the state-controlled oil giant that was once the country\u2019s biggest company. Gazprom\u2019s market value was $52 billion on Tuesday, down from its peak in May 2008 of $367 billion.Russia\u2019s mighty oil, mining and industrial holdings looked like a good deal in the early 1990s during the transition from communism to capitalism. The government tried to create a society of stockholders out of the Soviet ashes by giving everyone vouchers representing shares in state-owned businesses. But the chaotically run effort largely flopped.Hard up for money ahead of an election in 1996, President Boris N. Yeltsin tried a new tack of catering to rich insiders. He sold companies on the cheap to a new class of wealthy Russians.After Mr. Putin assumed power on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1999, he vowed to eliminate these oligarchs \u201cas a class.\u201d Three years later, police arrested Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, then Russia\u2019s richest man as owner of the Yukos oil company, bought in the sale under Mr. Yeltsin.The primary pumping asset became Rosneft, the state oil company. Rosneft was partly privatized; the state sold 13 percent on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.Foreign investors have been hurt, too.In 2006, Russian regulators forced the Western oil giant Shell to sell a 25 percent share in its valuable Sakhalin Island field after threatening to shut it down for environmental violations. The threat went away after Gazprom, the state gas giant, gained control of the field.It was Shell\u2019s second run-in with the Russian agenda. The company\u2019s oil assets in the country were nationalized in 1918, and Shell was only partly compensated by the Soviet government.Bashneft\u2019s story is perhaps one of the most tangled.In 1993, the Russian government transferred Bashneft to the regional government of Bashkortostan, at a time when Mr. Yeltsin was trying to curry favor with local leaders. In the early 2000s, the regional government sold shares to a company owned by local elites, Ural-Invest. In the years after, Mr. Yevtushenkov steadily picked up shares through a holding company called Sistema, in deals that were certain to have been approved by the Kremlin, according to oil analysts.Then the government changed its mind. In 2014, prosecutors asserted that the company\u2019s original transfer \u2014 21 years before \u2014 to a regional government had been illegal. So all subsequent transactions were voided.Mr. Yevtushenkov was ensnared by the flurry of criminal and civil cases that followed. His shares were handed over to the state.Mr. Yevtushenkov was finally cleared in a ruling late last year. Sistema won $950 million in a lawsuit against the previous owner, Ural-Invest. A spokesman for Sistema declined to comment.Russia\u2019s view of Bashneft has changed, too. Mr. Putin in April removed Bashneft from a list of so-called strategically important companies, despite substantial proven oil reserves of 2.2 billion barrels. The move clears the way for the company\u2019s potential sale to overseas investors.The for-sale signs are broadly up again. Along with Bashneft, the government plans to offer shares in Sovcomflot, a shipping company; Alrosa, a diamond mining company; VTB, a state bank; and Rosneft.Investors are already sniffing around. Russian oil companies, one run by a former chief executive of Rosneft, have announced plans to bid for Bashneft. Executives and government officials in India and China have said the countries\u2019 energy giants are potentially interested in buying shares in Rosneft.The government needs money to cover a portion of Russia\u2019s projected deficit this year of 2.4 trillion rubles ($36 billion), up from 1.95 trillion rubles ($31 billion) last year. And the privatization push is one of the few ways for the government to raise money.Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis make it difficult for Russia to hold bond sales, a common method for governments to cover budget shortfalls. While the United States Treasury has not specifically outlawed Russian bond deals, it has told American banks not to underwrite them.At a meeting of presidential economic advisers last month, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former minister of economy, suggested that the Kremlin spur growth by easing international tensions, as another option along with privatization. Mr. Putin responded that Russia would not \u201cbargain with its sovereignty.\u201dRussia insists that the government will do better this time around with the privatization plan. Dmitry Pristanskov, head of the Federal Agency for State Property, who is overseeing the effort, said the early post-Soviet sales were partly rolled back because corruption had tainted the process.\u201cAt the time, 25 years ago, there was no clear criteria for choosing an investor,\u201d Mr. Pristanskov said. He said the state now carefully vetted potential buyers for criminal ties or flaws like weak compliance departments, limiting the risk that deals will fall apart later. \u201cThis is exactly what we do differently today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
