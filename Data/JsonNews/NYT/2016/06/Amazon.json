{"Headline": "Donald Trump Could Threaten U.S. Rule of Law, Scholars Say", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s blustery attacks on the press, complaints about the judicial system and bold claims of presidential power collectively sketch out a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law, legal experts across the political spectrum say.Even as much of the Republican political establishment lines up behind its presumptive nominee, many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis.Mr. Trump accused the judge of bias, falsely said he was Mexican and seemed to issue a threat.\u201cThey ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cO.K.? But we will come back in November. Wouldn\u2019t that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case?\u201d\u201cThis is how authoritarianism starts, with a president who does not respect the judiciary,\u201d Mr. Post said. \u201cYou can criticize the judicial system, you can criticize individual cases, you can criticize individual judges. But the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law. That is his constitutional obligation.\u201dDonald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.\u201cIf he is signaling that that is not his position, that\u2019s a very serious constitutional problem,\u201d Mr. Post said.\u201cYou would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers, on congressional powers, on federal powers,\u201d Professor Barnett said, \u201cand I doubt he has any awareness of such limits.\u201dRepublican leaders say they are confident that Mr. Trump would respect the rule of law if elected. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a White House counsel,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told Hugh Hewitt, the radio host, on Monday. \u201cThere will be others who point out there\u2019s certain things you can do and you can\u2019t do.\u201dSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has become a reluctant supporter of Mr. Trump, said he did not believe that the nation would be in danger under his presidency.\u201cI still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We\u2019re not Romania.\u201d\u201cOur institutions, including the press, are still strong enough to prevent\u201d unconstitutional acts, he said.Mr. Post said that view was too sanguine, given the executive branch\u2019s practical primacy. \u201cThe president has all the power with respect to enforcing the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of those three branches that actually has the guns in its hands, and that\u2019s the executive.\u201dRepublican officials have criticized Mr. Obama for what they have called his unconstitutional expansion of executive power. But some legal scholars who share that view say the problem under a President Trump would be worse.Current polls show an uphill battle for Donald Trump should he and Hillary Clinton face off in the general election.President George W. Bush \u201coften went beyond what he should have done,\u201d Professor Epstein said. \u201cI think Obama\u2019s been much worse on that issue pretty consistently, and his underlings have been even more so. But I think Trump doesn\u2019t even think there\u2019s an issue to worry about. He just simply says whatever I want to do I will do.\u201dMr. Trump has boasted that he will use Mr. Obama\u2019s actions as precedent for his own expansive assertions of executive power.But Mr. Post said there was a difference between Mr. Obama\u2019s view of executive power and that of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhatever you think of Obama\u2019s position on immigration, he is willing to submit to the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no suggestion that he will disobey if the courts rule against him.\u201d\u201cI can easily see a situation in which he would take the Andrew Jackson line,\u201d Professor Epstein said, referring to a probably apocryphal comment attributed to Jackson about Chief Justice John Marshall: \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\u201dThere are other precedents, said John C. Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who took an expansive view of executive power as a lawyer in the Bush administration. \u201cThe only two other presidents I can think of who were so hostile to judges on an individual level and to the judiciary as a whole would be Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt,\u201d he said.Both of those presidents chafed at what they saw as excessive judicial power. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t doing it because they had cases before those judges as individuals,\u201d Professor Yoo said. \u201cThey had legitimate separation-of-powers fights between the presidency and the judiciary. Trump is lashing out because he has a lawsuit in a private capacity, which is much more disturbing.\u201d\u201cHe owns Amazon,\u201d Mr. Trump said in February. \u201cHe wants political influence so Amazon will benefit from it. That\u2019s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems. They\u2019re going to have such problems.\u201dA detailed list of the journalists, politicians and places President Trump has insulted since declaring his candidacy.More generally, Mr. Trump has discussed revising libel laws to make it easier to sue over critical coverage.On one hand, Mr. Trump seemed to misunderstand the scope of presidential power. Libel is a state-law tort constrained by First Amendment principles, and a president\u2019s views do not figure in its application.\u201cThere are very few serious constitutional thinkers who believe public figures should be able to use libel as indiscriminately as Trump seems to think they should,\u201d Professor Somin said. \u201cHe poses a serious threat to the press and the First Amendment.\u201d\u201cIt was a tremendous list, a great list,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, from the Cato Institute. \u201cWho knows how much you can trust the list?\u201dJennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Tucson.Advertisement"}

When he challenged her to a race and sped off, she playfully clung to him before losing her balance and tumbled to the ice. As she rose to her skates, she noticed a small pool of blood beneath them.\u201cHis right skate blade had accidentally run over my left hand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was so cold in there, I didn\u2019t even feel it. I had no idea I was bleeding.\u201dNow 26 and a physician, having received her medical degree last month from Florida International University, she recalled being whisked away in the back of an ambulance, where a paramedic asked her for some identification.\u201cI told him I had left my ID in my bag at the skating rink and that the gentleman I was with probably had it,\u201d she said.She was told that the same gentleman was now sitting in the front of the ambulance.\u201cThat was when I really started developing strong feelings for Lionel,\u201d Dr. Koppuzha said. \u201cHe took it upon himself to look after me that day, which told me how loyal and caring he is, and from that moment on, I just felt so much closer to him.\u201dShortly after she was released from the hospital she realized that her parents, who are both internists in private practice, had been frantically trying to contact her from their home in Port Charlotte, Fla.\u201cNeedless to say, they were beside themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re both doctors, so when I finally told them what had happened with me and Lionel, and that my cut only required about five stitches, they got over it pretty quickly.\u201dBut what she failed to share with her parents was the kind of news that would have cut too deeply for stitches: \u201cWhen they asked me about Lionel, all I told them was that he was just a friend,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had mentioned that we were dating, they would have been very upset, so I kept our relationship a secret.\u201dDr. Beena Koppuzha and Dr. George Koppuzha were born and raised in Kerala, a state in southwest India. They are Knanaya, Christians whose religious heritage traces back to Abraham and whose culture goes back to Jews of the Aramaic-speaking regions of Israel and Syria, who migrated in A.D. 345 to the Malabar Coast. The Knanaya do not believe in marrying outside the faith.When Cecily was just a year and a half old, her parents moved to the United States. The second of three daughters, she grew up in what she described as a \u201cvery strict Indian household,\u201d where her parents insisted that their daughters do not date or marry outside of their tight-knit ethnic and cultural circle.\u201cAll I ever heard was that one day I was going to marry a nice Knanayan boy,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, Lionel is from a loud Puerto Rican family, so I knew my parents wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201dStill, Dr. Koppuzha, who was studying neuroscience, and Mr. Sotomayor, who was studying aerospace engineering, continued to date.\u201cI was horrible at physics and he was horrible at chemistry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would tutor each other, and the more we worked together, the stronger our relationship grew.\u201dBut while Mr. Sotomayor\u2019s parents were delighted to learn that he had taken her to his freshman pledge formal in November 2008, their son would remain a secret to the Koppuzhas for the next two and a half years.\u201cWe understand that every family is different, but we happen to be a diverse family that is loving and accepting of all cultures,\u201d said Mr. Sotomayor\u2019s mother, Nilda Correa, who teaches English as a second language at Kissimmee Middle School in Florida. \u201cCecily is a wonderful girl. As far as my husband and I are concerned, if you love our son, we love you.\u201dBy January 2011 Dr. Koppuzha decided to invite her parents and two sisters to Boston for what she described as a family get-together, but she had something else in mind.\u201cAt that point, not telling my parents about Lionel was becoming too difficult to handle, too much of a struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cI had brought up his name so many times in our conversations because I didn\u2019t want to completely hide him, but I never told them we were actually dating.\u201d\u201cI was also feeling pressure from Lionel\u2019s side of the family to talk to my parents about him,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I figured it was just time, for everyone\u2019s sake, to tell the truth.\u201dShe eventually met with her family at a hotel near campus. When the conversation turned to dating, the oldest of the three daughters, Ann Koppuzha, who had known about Lionel, asked their father what characteristics he valued in a future son-in-law.After listening to his answers \u2014 Catholic, Indian and good-hearted \u2014 Cecily jumped in and joked about how two out of three weren\u2019t so bad. But then she turned serious and summoned the courage to admit that she and Mr. Sotomayor had long been an item.\u201cMy father took it surprisingly well,\u201d Dr. Koppuzha said. \u201cBut my mother, she just went silent.\u201dWhen the bride\u2019s mother did speak, she did so in a rather terse manner. \u201cDid you come to M.I.T. to study or to date?\u201d she asked.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget those words,\u201d said Dr. Koppuzha, who will begin a residency in emergency medicine next month at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn.Neither will her mother.\u201cI have to admit, I was very upset,\u201d Dr. Beena Koppuzha said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say much to Cecily because it was a very unexpected conversation. I had no idea that the Lionel who called us when Cecily went to the hospital had been her boyfriend all along.\u201dThe next day Mr. Sotomayor met the Koppuzha family for dinner, and Cecily\u2019s mother, by her own admission, was still in protest mode.\u201cI think I said \u2018Hi\u2019 to Lionel, maybe, but I was still very reluctant to accept the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was upsetting to me that my daughter was probably going to marry someone from outside of our community.\u201dAnn Koppuzha, who is three years older than her sister, said that while \u201cLionel was a great guy who was very down to earth, our parents were worried that Cecily, being so young, might lose sight of her academic goals.\u201d\u201cThey wanted Cecily to go to medical school,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want her relationship to be a distraction.\u201dLater that year, Mr. Sotomayor received a surprise invitation from his intended\u2019s parents, who asked him to Port Charlotte for Thanksgiving dinner.\u201cAt that point, my mother came around to realizing that Lionel was a significant part of my life,\u201d Dr. Koppuzha said. \u201cShe finally began accepting him.\u201dThough he was grateful for the invitation, Mr. Sotomayor said that the thought of visiting to his girlfriend\u2019s childhood home and seeing her mother for the first time since that cold meal in Boston 10 months earlier \u201cwas definitely nerve-racking.\u201dBut this time around, he found her parents, especially her mother, warm and receptive.\u201cThey were so welcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cThey asked about school and my family, they were genuinely concerned about me, and Cecily\u2019s mom fed me lots of spicy food, which I had trouble handling at first. It was wonderful.\u201dAfter graduating from M.I.T. in 2012, the couple began a long-distance relationship. He took a job as a systems engineer with Boeing in Los Angeles, and she headed for Florida International University.In May 2014, Mr. Sotomayor shortened the distance between them by taking a job at Amazon in Tampa, Fla., a four-and-a-half-hour drive from her. \u201cAt least we were back in the same state,\u201d he said.The sacrifice that Mr. Sotomayor made to be closer to his fianc\u00e9e was not lost on her mother.\u201cI appreciate everything Lionel has done for my daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a very smart and very humble person, and he and Cecily have been bringing each other joy for many years now.\u201dThe couple were married on May 21 at the 131-year-old St. James Catholic Cathedral in Orlando, Fla., the pews bursting with 354 guests, some from as far away as India, Canada, Puerto Rico and New York.Women of Indian heritage \u2014 and the groom\u2019s mother \u2014 wore traditional gold earrings, necklaces and bracelets, and henna art on their arms and hands.After the exchange of vows, the Rev. Te\u00f3filo Useche, a Roman Catholic priest, wrapped a stole around the couples\u2019 hands as he blessed their union.A few days before the wedding, the bride\u2019s mother said she accepted seeing her daughter\u2019s hand in his.\u201cI must admit that Lionel and Cecily make a great team, and I know they will do well together in life,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom that very first day, when he called from the hospital to tell us that she got hurt, they have always been there for each other.\u201dLes Neuhaus contributed reporting from Orlando, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whit Stillman and His Duffel-Bag-Size Life in Paris", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byAt Home WithPARIS \u2014 Whit Stillman would prefer that you not call him an expat, though it\u2019s been 18 years since the filmmaker left Manhattan, propelled, in part, by what he calls the \u201cimpossible economics\u201d of New York.In so doing, he continued a storied tradition of financial exiles here, like F. Scott Fitzgerald and the Rolling Stones. \u201cForward-Deployed American\u201d is his preferred term, borrowed from a boarding school acquaintance who was posted abroad for work and never returned.Mr. Stillman, of course, is a man devoted to the precision of language and keenly attuned to the taxonomies of class, culture and nationality. Terminology matters, though labels are always ripe for lampooning.For the last few years, Mr. Stillman, 64, has been forwardly deployed in the apartment of his girlfriend, Marianne Monnier, who works in finance, and the youngest two of her five children, who attend college here. They share a series of rooms on the top two floors of a 17th-century apartment building in the Marais district. (Mr. Stillman has two daughters, one in medical school in Florida, and one working as a lawyer in New York.)Sparsely furnished with Ms. Monnier\u2019s family antiques \u2014 like Mr. Stillman, Ms. Monnier can trace her patrician roots back for generations \u2014 the apartment is an austere and elegant setting that would not be out of place in one of Mr. Stillman\u2019s films.That hardly anything in this apartment belongs to Mr. Stillman is a matter of pride for him. Since he separated from his wife in 2002, his aim, largely successful, has been to reduce his possessions to those that would fit in a small rolling duffel bag. (His excesses, he said, are white and blue cotton boxers from Brooks Brothers.)\u201cI prefer \u2018The Taste of Others,\u2019 though I haven\u2019t seen the movie, so I don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Mr. Stillman said, a joking reference to a French film from 2000.The next day he would fly to Dublin and then London for the movie\u2019s British opening. He hadn\u2019t slept much, what with jet lag and a panicky phone call from his distribution company in the early hours of the morning.Mr. Stillman was also traumatized, he said, by the fact that he hadn\u2019t been able to choose the film\u2019s stills, which meant that, to his eyes, the movie was being marketed like a women\u2019s genre film. \u201cAre period adaptations women\u2019s films?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr are they for everyone? Just like Jane Austen is for everyone. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything clich\u00e9 feminine about Jane Austen. And, anyway, her earliest champions were Sir Walter Scott and the Prince Regent.\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t important, though I really regret not being able to,\u201d he said, still worrying over those stills. It was \u201cmy own fault for blowing through a deadline\u201d for the movie\u2019s companion novel, titled \u201cLove & Friendship: In Which Jane Austen\u2019s Lady Susan Vernon is Entirely Vindicated,\u201d which meant he had to finish the book when he should have been choosing images. ( Mr. Stillman, never a speedy writer, adheres to the motto \u201cfirst thought, worst thought.\u201d)The book, a postmodern confection featuring a malevolent, unreliable and spectacularly dim narrator named Rufus \u2014 who is addicted to footnotes and dedicated to slandering \u201cthe spinster authoress,\u201d as he calls Jane Austen \u2014 is very, very funny, and stands on its own merits.In addition to the contents of Mr. Stillman\u2019s scuffed duffel bag \u2014 bought for just 21 euros (about $24), he boasted \u2014 his scant possessions here include two independent film festival awards and a curious looking white vase festooned with gold circles. \u201cThose circles are supposed to represent disco,\u201d Mr. Stillman said.The vase was a trophy given to him in 2014, when he won the Prix Fitzgerald, a literary award, for his first novel, \u201cThe Last Days of Disco, With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards,\u201d a comic companion to his 1998 film \u201cThe Last Days of Disco.\u201dKindly, self-deprecating and prone to extreme thrift, Mr. Stillman explained his light domestic footprint this way: \u201cSometimes people who are very fastidious about what they\u2019re going to do in their work are not very fastidious in their private life. I\u2019m like that. I love it when people do really nice things around me, but I don\u2019t have time to do it for myself. It\u2019s very hard for me to even buy a new pair of trousers.\u201dOn that afternoon, he was wearing a white button-down shirt, dark blue corduroy pants worn smooth at the knees, and a pair of new Blundstone boots, swag from this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival. He was grateful for the largess, since he didn\u2019t receive a directing fee for \u201cLove and Friendship.\u201dMr. Stillman\u2019s contribution to Ms. Monnier\u2019s apartment was to suggest a multiplicity of doors when she renovated, he said, so that every passageway and room can be closed off, like those on a boat. \u201cIt\u2019s a new life, with doors,\u201d said Ms. Monnier of her roommate. Mr. Stillman added: \u201cMy flair factor is that I go to a cafe every morning to write. So I\u2019m never here.\u201dMs. Monnier\u2019s contribution to his films has been editing the French subtitles of \u201cLove and Friendship,\u201d an urgent role since an interpreter for \u201cDamsels in Distress\u201d rendered Adam Brody\u2019s character\u2019s name, Packenstacker, \u201cas a really bad, kind of dirty joke instead of what is to American ears just a long and funny name,\u201d Mr. Stillman said.His French is very correct, except for his accent, which makes him sound like Zorro, Ms. Monnier said. (He learned Spanish in Mexico during a semester off from Harvard and so he speaks French with a Mexican accent.)\u201cI was taken there by my friend George, and we were lost, and we were late,\u201d Mr. Stillman said, recalling that evening. \u201cOur driver was a ex-Mossad agent. George is one of those people who knows everyone. He\u2019s a Serbian preppy, which is very much like an American preppy. Anyway, when we arrived, there was this sort of bouquet of French femininity sitting in chairs on a terrace. Space is made for us, and we sit down between the lovely young women.\u201dMs. Monnier said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember the other women. I thought I was alone.\u201dMr. Stillman smiled at her. \u201cYou could have been.\u201dIn \u201cThe Cosmopolitans,\u201d the young strivers confidently proclaim themselves \u201cParisian\u201d to a deeply unimpressed American fashion journalist, played with exquisite disdain by Ms. Sevigny.One young man is in an on-again-off-again relationship with a French divorc\u00e9e named Cl\u00e9mence (a character inspired by Ms. Monnier). His friends gloat that he has \u201cinfiltrated French society at its most resistant.\u201dTo which Ms. Sevigny\u2019s character responds, incredulously, \u201cYou guys have girlfriends with names like Cl\u00e9mence?\u201dThere\u2019s always a temptation to conflate Mr. Stillman\u2019s work with his biography. In \u201cMetropolitan,\u201d the main character, Tom, is a child of divorce, with an absent father (thanks to a wicked stepmother), who pines for a young heartbreaker named Serena, who simultaneously wooed a number of boarding school boys with her prodigious letter writing, all of which Mr. Stillman experienced.\u201cWhit wasn\u2019t a very natural 15-year-old,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was playing a literary role and he had cast me into a literary role as well. As a grown up, I remember feeling flattered by my part in \u2018Metropolitan,\u2019 because, at 40, I wasn\u2019t worried about being a bitch. Whereas dreary? That was cause for worry.\u201cMostly I remember weeping with excitement that Whit had gotten everything exactly right, which is not to say that he just took the biography and put it out there. As an artist, he liberated the material from its time and place.\u201dOn a recent Saturday night, Mr. Stillman and Ms. Monnier met Carolin Young, an American friend, gastronomic historian and culture writer, at Caf\u00e9 Hugo on the Place des Vosges, after which they toured Victor Hugo\u2019s house. Noting the Parisian pretensions of the characters in \u201cThe Cosmopolitans,\u201d Ms. Young and Mr. Stillman said emphatically that Paris wasn\u2019t exactly home for them, but it was certainly home base.\u201cWhat confuses people about Whit is that his films are autobiographical, but they are also fiction,\u201d Ms. Young said later. \u201cAnd that gets problematic sometimes. It\u2019s hard to separate the characters in the films from Whit himself. Part of what he loves about living here, I think, is that not many people know the films, so he doesn\u2019t have to play Whit Stillman. He can just be Whit Stillman.\u201dMr. Stillman, however, doesn\u2019t quite agree. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure I know what that means,\u201d he said. As an American in Paris, \u201cI think I\u2019ve enjoyed the isolation when I wasn\u2019t horribly lonely.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Testing the Clean-Energy Logic of a Tesla-SolarCity Merger", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byImagine a world in which every home and building is a miniature power plant, with solar panels on the roofs and electric vehicles and stationary battery banks in the garages.Meters and software would manage the flow of power, allowing homeowners and businesses to seamlessly buy and sell electricity at the best prices, simultaneously lowering their costs and raising the amount of green energy on the grid.That\u2019s the long-term vision behind the plan that Elon Musk described late Tuesday, explaining the rationale for Tesla to acquire SolarCity and create the \u201cworld\u2019s only vertically integrated energy company.\u2019\u2019And it may very well become reality, whether in years or decades, and whether Mr. Musk\u2019s version of the vision is one that proves viable.Still, if Mr. Musk and his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, can trounce the competition and surmount their financial woes \u2014 and those are very big ifs \u2014 the integrated company they are trying to assemble could be in a position to dominate.\u201cThis is an effort to build the Apple of clean energy,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat really is part of the new wave of companies that could make this decarbonization addressing climate change really work.\u201dWall Street, at least for the moment, is not on board.SolarCity\u2019s stock, which has been trading at roughly a quarter of its peak value in recent months, rose after the announcement. But Tesla\u2019s has tumbled. Several analysts and investors have questioned the wisdom of adding to both companies\u2019 financial pressures \u2014 between them the companies lost more than $1.6 billion last year \u2014 and potentially distracting Tesla from building its enormous battery factory in Nevada and bringing its first moderately priced car to market next year.Even some energy analysts say the proposed acquisition is at least as much about helping Mr. Musk\u2019s personal investments as furthering his green agenda. But, some energy experts and investors say, there is logic in combining Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, and SolarCity, where he is chairman.Describing Tesla automobiles as \u201cbatteries wrapped in a car,\u201d Shawn Kravetz, founder of the solar power investment company Esplanade Capital, said that the energy storage business was likely to become colossal. \u201cAnd so you can see,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018how the electricity to power those batteries can be an essential part of this.\u201dThe two companies have been moving toward a closer partnership for some time. SolarCity began installing Tesla batteries in pilot projects for residential and commercial customers about four years ago. Last year, Tesla announced its move to market rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that could mount to a home garage wall, as well as battery blocks large enough to power commercial and industrial customers and serve in utility-scale installations to smooth out fluctuations in the grid.At the same time, SolarCity, after years of challenging the utility industry to innovate or die, started acting more like a utility itself. It began a program aimed at cities, remote communities, campuses and military bases to design and operate small, independent power networks called microgrids. At the time, Peter Rive, one of the company\u2019s founders and its chief technical officer, called the system \u201ca template that can be scaled up to basically be the next-generation grid.\u201dAs the leading rooftop solar provider in the country, SolarCity is thought to have the largest collection of data on how solar customers use energy at every minute of the day. With that data \u2014 especially if combined with information from electric cars, chargers and stationary batteries \u2014 the combined company could be well suited to creating products and services based on customer needs.\u201cThey deeply understand what the customer\u2019s usage patterns are,\u201d said Swapnil Shah, chief executive of FirstFuel Software, which provides energy management services to buildings. He compared the potential to Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt and customize online shopping to buyer\u2019s behavior.\u201cThey\u2019re creating unique personalized profiles of your habits,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Shah said, \u201cand they use that to identify what is the next click for the next product.\u201dAnd yet, while SolarCity was building the infrastructure for a new, decentralized approach to power production known as distributed generation, while earning a reputation for aggressive attacks on the old-school utility industry, Mr. Musk was turning Tesla into \u201cthe brand that everyone wants to buy,\u201d Mr. Kammen said. That brand burnishing is something that could benefit SolarCity, he said.But a big challenge for Tesla, said Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which focuses on clean energy industries, is that it is not the only company with such a grand vision. Utility industry stalwarts like Edison International and Con Edison are developing energy services and consulting divisions, while technology giants like General Electric, Oracle, Google and even Apple are getting into the business of providing or managing power.Of course, the merger plan may not go through, if other investors balk and because of the corporate governance and other issues arising from Mr. Musk\u2019s roles in both companies. He also owns more than 20 percent of each. But maybe a merger isn\u2019t necessary to achieve the larger goals.\u201cDo you have to own things in order to leverage or even to a certain extent control them?\u201d Mr. Kravetz of Esplanade Capital asked. \u201cI think the answer is no. You don\u2019t have to own the cow to get the milk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Uber Keeps Raising Billions", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byDealBookConsider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million.So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber \u2014 and the financial markets \u2014 that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds?Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uber\u2019s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uber\u2019s fund-raising efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: It\u2019s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers; it\u2019s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash.At the moment, Uber\u2019s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, \u201cWe can do it too.\u201d But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash \u2014 after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber \u2014 venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber.Uber\u2019s fund-raising arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns \u2014 private companies worth $1 billion or more. So there\u2019s clearly a rush to take the money while it\u2019s still available.\u201cIt\u2019s not the second inning or even the sixth, it\u2019s the 14th inning in a five-hour baseball game,\u201d Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: \u201cYou are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort.\u201dThe ride-sharing industry has long been seen as a zero-sum game because of the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.)The question is whether the financing game is zero-sum too. And the even larger question is whether Uber\u2019s eye-popping capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uber\u2019s competitors: Will they look at Uber\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there \u2014 and throw up a white flag?So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined.Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other \u2014 at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.)Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber.Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia \u2014 if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share.That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uber\u2019s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4.5 percent.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. That\u2019s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then.But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none.The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thomas J. Perkins, Pioneering Venture Capitalist in Silicon Valley, Dies at 84", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byThomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valley\u2019s venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84.His longtime assistant, Kathy Daly, said Mr. Perkins died after a prolonged illness, which she did not specify.Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins \u2014 and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. \u2014 became a destination for other venture capitalists.Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.The firm\u2019s success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world.Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.\u2019s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled \u201cMine\u2019s Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the World\u2019s Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It\u201d (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkins\u2019s \u201clegacy won\u2019t be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed,\u201d though he was a \u201cseminal figure\u201d for Silicon Valley.In a statement on Thursday, two other Kleiner Perkins co-founders, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had \u201cdefined what we know of today as entrepreneurial venture capital by going beyond just funding to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions with operating expertise.\u201dThat lifestyle was the backdrop to one of several books he wrote, a novel titled \u201cSex and the Single Zillionaire\u201d (2006), which featured a yacht on its cover. For the book, Mr. Perkins had guidance from the romance novelist Danielle Steel, whom he married in 1998; the marriage ended in divorce. He dedicated the novel to her.Thomas James Perkins was born on Jan. 7, 1932, and grew up in White Plains in modest circumstances, attending White Plains High School. His father, Harry, worked for an insurance company, and his mother, Elizabeth, was an occasional seamstress.He became interested in technology early. In a 2007 autobiography, \u201cValley Boy: The Education of Tom Perkins,\u201d he wrote that as a youth he assembled television kits and had planned to be a TV repairman.Accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he studied electrical engineering and computer science, earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in both. He later received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. After working for a time for Sperry Gyroscope Company in Great Neck, on Long Island, he moved to California, where he worked in the technology industry for a decadeHe joined H.P. in the 1960s, working for the company\u2019s founders, David Packard and William Hewlett. In his autobiography, Mr. Perkins wrote that Mr. Packard and Mr. Hewlett \u201cwere restless and driven men.\u201d\u201cTheir aspirations always reached beyond the present success,\u201d he added, noting that he had been \u201cfortunate to have come knocking on their door.\u201dWhen Mr. Perkins and Eugene Kleiner founded Kleiner Perkins in 1972 (Mr. Byers and Mr. Caufield joined later), Silicon Valley knew little of venture capital, and the men had the field largely to themselves, investing in fledgling companies like Tandem Computers, Applied Materials and Genentech.Mr. Perkins later stepped away from active venture investing and joined several corporate boards over the years, including Compaq Computer and News Corp. Compaq was purchased by H.P. in 2002, and Mr. Perkins joined H.P.\u2019s board in 2005, not long before its chief executive at the time, Carly Fiorina, was fired. Mr. Perkins supported Ms. Fiorina\u2019s recent run for the Republican presidential nomination.Before his marriage to Ms. Steel, Mr. Perkins was married to Gerd Thune-Ellefsen, a Norwegian whom he had met skiing near Lake Tahoe, until her death in 1994. He is survived by two children from that marriage, a son, Tor, and a daughter, Elizabeth.An earlier version of this obituary misidentified one of the Kleiner Perkins co-founders who released a statement on Mr. Perkins\u2019s death. It was Brook Byers, not John Doerr. The earlier version also misstated his place of death. He died in Marin County, Calif., but not in Tiburon.An obituary on Friday about the venture capitalist Thomas J. Perkins misstated part of the name of a company in which he invested. It was Tandem Computers, not Tandem Computer. The obituary also misstated, in some editions, the year that Hewlett-Packard, on whose board Mr. Perkins served, bought the computer company Compaq. It was 2002, not 2001.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tony Fadell Steps Down Amid Tumult at Nest, a Google Acquisition", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byTime to move on. That is the explanation Tony Fadell, a former star executive at Apple known for his aggressive management style, offers for his departure from Nest, a maker of digital versions of household staples like thermostats and smoke detectors that he helped found and sold to Google.Mr. Fadell, the company said, will become an adviser to Alphabet and to its chief executive, Larry Page.In a recent interview in his Palo Alto office, Mr. Fadell, 47, talked about his career. At Apple, he led the engineering team that created the iPod digital music player and worked on the first three versions of the iPhone. In 2010 he founded Nest with Matt Rogers, a young Apple engineer.\u201cI\u2019m a guy who\u2019s at the beginning of things,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to do maintenance mode. It\u2019s not what gets me out of bed.\u201dThe sharpest attack came from Greg Duffy, the founder and former chief executive of Dropcam, the home video camera and cloud-computing service that Nest acquired for $555 million in 2014, about six months after Google bought Nest. Mr. Duffy clashed with Mr. Fadell, remained at Nest for eight months and briefly moved to another post at Google before departing last September.In the interview, which Mr. Fadell agreed to on the condition that it not be published before Alphabet announced he was leaving, he had answers for most of the criticisms of his tenure. He described the staff departures as a small fraction of Nest employees and in line with the turnover in Silicon Valley, where switching jobs is common.Mr. Fadell said that Nest had \u201cstrong double-digit\u201d revenue growth from the outset. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Page, citing Nest\u2019s achievements, noted that its revenue growth was \u201cin excess of 50 percent\u201d a year since it began shipping products in 2011.Mr. Fadell characterized Nest as healthy, with 1,100 workers and strong teams in design, software and services around its three product families \u2014 its \u201clearning\u201d thermostat, smoke detector and video camera.Yet the larger issue is not Nest\u2019s past performance but what impact Mr. Fadell\u2019s departure will have on its future. Nest is the linchpin of Alphabet\u2019s bet on the emerging smart home market \u2014 devices and software to automate homes for convenience, energy savings and security.Mr. Fadell will be succeeded by Marwan Fawaz, a former executive vice president of Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker Google bought for $12.5 billion in 2011. Google unloaded Motorola three years later to Lenovo for the fire sale price of $2.9 billion, though a sizable share of Motorola\u2019s value was its thousands of patents.In the troubled Motorola acquisition, Mr. Fawaz led a financial bright spot, Motorola Home, a television set-top box business. He pared its product line, cut costs and oversaw its sale in 2013 for $2.35 billion to the Arris Group, a cable television equipment maker.In the Alphabet portfolio, Nest is a leading entry among the parent company\u2019s \u201cother bets,\u201d its effort to build businesses beyond Google\u2019s lucrative franchise in online search and advertising. Google\u2019s record with acquired hardware businesses, notably the Motorola deal, has not inspired confidence.When the Nest thermostat was introduced in 2011, it was an innovative reimagining of a product category, much as the iPod was a reinvention of the MP3 music player and the iPhone was a new take on the cellphone. It was a stylish piece of hardware, a circle of brushed stainless steel, reflective polymer and a crystal-sharp color display.Inside, the Nest thermostat houses sensors for detecting motion in the room and clever software to learn and adjust room temperatures, according to whether people are present or not, to curb electric bills.Priced at $249, the Nest thermostat was far more expensive than traditional models. Rivals scoffed but later offered their own models. Honeywell, for example, now has a $249 model that resembles the Nest oval.The pace of product introductions in the home necessarily will be more gradual, which critics often miss, Mr. Fadell said. A thermostat typically lasts 10 or 12 years.\u201cSome people expect us to be a gadget factory,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want your thermostat to be like your smartphone, replacing it every two or three years.\u201dMore is done with software, especially updates, sent over the internet and wirelessly connected to Nest devices. Relying on software, of course, opens the door to software bugs. In 2014, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered a recall of more than 400,000 Nest Protect smoke and gas detectors because a defect could cause users to turn them off unintentionally. Nest halted sales for a while and fixed the problem by updating the software.The software is what allows its devices to communicate with each other. The Nest Protect, for example, can detect a carbon monoxide leak and tell the Nest thermostat to turn off the furnace.Mr. Fadell points to the 18,000 software developers working with Nest software, 12,000 retail stores that sell Nest devices and more than 100 utility companies, many of which offer consumer rebates to buy Nest thermostats, for their energy saving potential.\u201cWe\u2019re not a products company,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cWe\u2019re a products, services and software company.\u201d And, he added, building up those networks \u201ctakes a long time.\u201dIt will be up to others to do that building now. Yet Mr. Fadell expresses no regrets. Selling to Google, he insists, was the right choice to give Nest the financial ballast it needs for the long term.When Nest started, the technology giants were not in the smart home market. But now, Samsung has SmartThings software and devices, Apple has HomeKit software, and Amazon has the Echo voice command device.Nor does Mr. Fadell apologize for his management style. He described his strength as \u201cholding people to a higher standard than they thought they could achieve and pushing them beyond what they thought they could achieve.\u201dMr. Fadell said he had no immediate plans but he would spend more time looking at technology start-ups.In the last decade, he has quietly invested in and advised many fledgling companies. His current investments include Impossible Foods, which synthesizes beef without cattle; Airwave, an operating system for drones; Mousera, sensor technology to speed insights from preclinical drug trials on lab animals; and Phononic, semiconductor-based heating and cooling.\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d Mr. Fadell said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for technology that is about to come out of the lab and has the potential to transform a business. I like to see these technologies raw.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.A.A. Issues Commercial Drone Rules", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government on Tuesday made it much easier for companies to use drones for a variety of tasks, including aerial photography and emergency response.The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s new commercial drone rules allow a broad range of businesses to use drones under 55 pounds, but with several restrictions: The drones must be operated by a pilot who has passed a written test and is at least 16 years old. And drones can be flown only below 400 feet, during the day and at least five miles away from airports.The new F.A.A. rules do not necessarily preclude a hodgepodge of state and local drone regulations that have popped up in recent years. The administration sent a letter to states and cities saying they recommend everyone follow their lead. But it is only a recommendation.Still, the action brings the drone delivery vision one step closer to reality. And experts predict that in time federal regulators will get comfortable with the notion.\u201cWithin months you will see the incredible impact of these rules with commercial drones becoming commonplace in a variety of uses,\u201d said Michael Drobac, a lawyer at Akin Gump who represents drone efforts at companies like Amazon and Google. \u201cThis will show the technology is reliable and then it becomes harder to argue against broader uses \u2014 like for delivery.\u201dDrone makers and tech companies have been lobbying for the rules for five years. But the Obama administration, while trying to accommodate the potential economic benefits of the technology, has struggled to safely integrate the popular, remote-controlled flying vehicles into airspace.Pilots and privacy groups that pushed hard for greater safety provisions and strong surveillance rules expressed fear that clearing the way for more of the flying machines posed new dangers and few protections from spying. The F.A.A. rules prohibit drones from flying above people and faster than 100 miles per hour.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.\u201cThe F.A.A. continues to ignore the top concern of Americans about the deployment of commercial drones in the United States \u2014 the need for strong privacy safeguards,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of Electronic Privacy Information Center.In February 2015, the F.A.A. created its first rules for recreational drone users, and more than 450,000 hobbyists registered last winter in the government\u2019s user database.Previously, companies had to apply for special permission from the F.A.A. to operate drones. The government has issued more than 6,000 approvals and about 7,000 companies are on a waiting list for approval. When the new rules go into effect in 60 days, companies will no longer have to gain that special exemption.\u201cWith this new rule, we are taking a careful and deliberate approach that balances the need to deploy this new technology with the F.A.A.\u2019s mission to protect public safety,\u201d said Michael Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator. \u201cBut this is just our first step. We\u2019re already working on additional rules that will expand the range of operations.\u201dIn a fact sheet released by the White House, the government cited economic estimates that commercial drones could generate more than $82 billion in the next decade.Drones \u201crepresent a potentially powerful innovation that could have a positive impact on our economy,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. The new rules are \u201cjust the beginning of the process.\u201dAmazon has hired several lobbyists just to focus on drone rules. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, expects drone delivery to be available within the next few years and has begun testing its own devices.\u201cWe are extremely pleased the rule establishes a risk-based, federal approach for operating drones nationwide, and thank the F.A.A. for engaging industry throughout the process,\u201d said Kara Calvert, director of a coalition of drone manufacturers including the Chinese company DJI and GoPro.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

One group of ballots arrived late because stormy weather had delayed a boat carrying them on the Amazon.Both candidates had promised free-market reforms, but the election was closely watched because of Ms. Fujimori\u2019s candidacy.

Code is a series of propositions about arranging transistors in a computer.Apple became one of the world\u2019s biggest companies thanks to this paradoxical invention, and now it may also be threatened by where software is headed.But this session was more about catching up to rivals.

Give credit to British actress/comedian Sally Phillips, with her clipped, deadpan line readings: so humorously humorless. But tip a cap too to the \u201cVeep\u201d writers, who get why Minna makes such a great foil to Selina Meyer. She\u2019s everything our fictional president is not: rational, good-hearted and comfortable in her own skin. She represents a viable alternative for how a progressive 21st-century leader should be. If Minna Hakkinen existed in the real world, Michael Moore would\u2019ve already made an admiring documentary about her.In \u201cCamp David,\u201d the fair-haired Minna arrives to help broker a deal between the Meyer administration and the Chinese. Selina has scheduled a pre-Christmas retreat with her ex-husband, Andrew, their daughter Catherine, and Catherine\u2019s girlfriend, Marjorie, (whom Catherine is hoping will get a chance to show that she can be \u201cFun Marjorie\u201d). But it\u2019s all a cover for a negotiation that the Americans hope will bring manufacturing jobs back to Ohio and North Carolina \u2026 and thus net the president Selina some key votes in the coming House runoff between her and her challenger Bill O\u2019Brien.International diplomacy aside, in sitcom terms, \u201cCamp David\u201d is a classic story of \u201ctwo dates on the same night.\u201d In one part of the camp, Selina\u2019s trying to outmaneuver her sleazy ex, who\u2019s wowing Marjorie with expensive Christmas presents in order to get Catherine to invest some of her vast inheritance in one of his sketchy real estate deals. (When Andrew hears that his daughter\u2019s best gal is a raw food vegan, he immediately lies and says that the Brazilian hotel chain he\u2019s representing is converting into \u201can eco-resort.\u201d) Meanwhile, Selina is secretly huddling with her staff, keeping track of the last days of the Jonah Ryan campaign in New Hampshire, and trying to impress her Chinese guests with how gracious, thoughtful and strong-willed she can be \u2014 which is especially difficult, given that she hasn\u2019t bothered to learn anything about them or their culture.This episode\u2019s director Becky Martin, and one of its writers, Rachel Axler, find a good balance in this half-hour between the basic elements of farce \u2014 spontaneous fibbing, mistaken identities, a breakneck pace \u2014 and the more naturalistic acting rhythms and overlapping dialogue that \u201cVeep\u201d demands. Every near disaster in \u201cCamp David\u201d seems to spring up organically, even though in retrospect it\u2019s all hilariously preposterous.Here\u2019s an unlikely chain of events: Catherine gives her mother a historic pen, which Selina finds surprisingly thoughtful (thereby managing to insult and thank her daughter simultaneously). That same pen gets passed along to the Chinese, to save face after the guests out-gift their hosts. From her visitors, Selina receives an antique silken robe, which she gives to Marjorie, whom she forgot to Christmas shop for. And because Marjorie looks a little Selina, when the Chinese see her wearing the robe and kissing Catherine, they think the president is making out with her own daughter. One impulsive decision provokes another, until it looks like the economic future of two countries is going to be ruined by one woman\u2019s inability to look at an Amazon wish list.But just like in \u201cMother\u201d \u2014 where Selina\u2019s grief over losing the Nevada recount was interpreted as her mourning the loss of her mom \u2014 in \u201cCamp David\u201d something wholly unrelated to the moment turns the tide in her favor. When the president storms out of the talks with the Chinese so that she can stop Andrew from pitching one of his dud properties to Catherine, the opposition sees this as a power move, and offers a deal that would include China\u2019s willingness to discuss Tibetan independence, possibly. Ignoring all the layers of \u201cperhaps\u201d in that proposal, Selina seizes the opportunity to be \u201cthe president who freed Tibet\u201d and ditches the good people of Ohio and North Carolina. (\u201cThey should\u2019ve gone to college,\u201d she says with a shrug.)The addition of Minna to all this madness is a masterstroke. It\u2019s so easy to get mired in the Meyer Way of doing business, and to think that it\u2019s normal \u2014 or even preferable \u2014 to be manipulative, petty, myopic and vain. Minna\u2019s keen observation and lack of a filter means that she ends up providing a monotone running commentary on everything that\u2019s happening, making Selina uncomfortable by pointing out her cosmetic surgery, her menopause and her casual cruelty to her only child. (When Selina compares a picture of a farm animal to Catherine, a confused Minna says, \u201cBut your daughter is a beautiful woman and this is a piglet.\u201d) Minna is the anti-Meyer: friendly with other foreign leaders and personally plugged in to what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s fair to say that any \u201cVeep\u201d episode that features Minna is going to be a winner.\u201cCamp David\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a minor comic miscalculation to put the flat-voiced Minna in the general vicinity of the even flatter Marjorie. (But Marjorie does figure into one of the funniest moments of the episode, when Selina asks whether her \u201csham-ham\u201d nut-loaf tastes like pork and she blankly answers, \u201cNo.\u201d) And a lot of the side characters are shortchanged this week, including Mike, who gets only a few seconds of screen time to learn that the Chinese have belatedly approved his adoption of a baby, and that his surrogate mother is having twins.But the most rushed arc belongs to Jonah, who goes from being a congressional long shot \u2014 thanks to a viral clip of him at a debate trying to force his opponent, Judy Sherman, to take the apple he brought her \u2014 to a come-from-behind winner. After he shoots himself in the foot while hunting, Judy makes a joke about guns that turns the N.R.A. against her, driving a turnout for Jonah. It all happens awfully fast, cheating us out of a few more weeks of \u201cJohn H. Ryan\u201d screaming at New Hampshirites on the campaign trail.Still, there\u2019s something apt about Jonah winning a congressional seat at the same time that Minna, Finland\u2019s governmental guru, is vexing President Meyer. On the one hand, we have Minna, a woman with an even temper and a deep understanding of all the issues facing her country and our planet. On the other hand, we have Jonah, an angry ogre who uses his victory speech to insult his old high school friends and insist that, \u201cYou can believe in yourself so hard that you can become a congressman.\u201d It just goes to show that as bad as Selina can be, she\u2019s far from the worst we\u2019ve got.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Worker Advocates Express Skepticism Over Raises", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. \u2014 This week, as part of the festivities that surround Walmart\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d blasted through loudspeakers as employees entered an arena at the University of Arkansas. Handpicked by their managers out of Walmart\u2019s work force of more than a million, the employees arrived ready to cheer.\u201cI think we can sell another three million this year,\u201d said Steve Bratspies, Walmart\u2019s chief marketing officer, as he held up a round pillow with a yellow smiley face, a symbol Walmart has used to signal low prices and one of many emoji pillows it wants to sell. \u201cCan you help me do that?\u201dWorkers certainly have something to cheer about. Average hourly pay has gone up since Walmart announced early last year that it would increase wages to at least $10 an hour for its army of part-time and full-time workers.But not all employees were as enthusiastic as those in the arena.The employees more critical of the company say Walmart \u2014 the biggest private employer in the United States \u2014 has found more subtle ways to keep the reins on its workers\u2019 paychecks. The retailer has cut merit raises, for example, and has introduced a new training program that can keep employees at $9 an hour for as long as 18 months.The moves have concerned worker advocates, who say the changes have chipped away at the earnings gains employees appeared to make last year.\u201cI fear that Walmart\u2019s plan is more about delaying an actual wage increase than providing real training,\u201d said Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve found other major retailers using probationary periods and other strategies as a way to avoid committing to set work schedules and higher wages.\u201dWalmart, naturally, tried to keep the focus on its biggest initiatives this week. The company said, for example, that it would test a new grocery delivery service with the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, as a way to help grow its ecommerce business, which lags behind its online rival, Amazon.Its grocery business, which has helped to drive much of its online growth, has been undergoing a transformation, with a broad range of initiatives aimed at things like making fruit look more fresh and appetizing and improving grocery pickup options.Still, a group of workers also made their grievances known.On Tuesday, a van of OUR Walmart members, a nonprofit worker group, drove around the retailer\u2019s hometown of Bentonville, 30 miles north of here, to tape petitions onto the mailboxes of executives and several members of the Walton family, who collectively control more than 50 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares.\u201cDoes everybody want to talk to us? No, there\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Dan Schlademan, a co-director of OUR Walmart, said of the workers in town for the week.One point of contention is raises. In February, Walmart said it was \u201cenabling hourly workers to earn their annual pay increase months earlier than expected.\u201dBut many workers ended up getting smaller raises than they would have under the old system. Workers used to get an annual raise of 40 to 60 cents per hour, based on merit. This year, workers got a percentage-based raise: The highest-earning hourly employees got 2 percent, which translated to less than 40 cents for most of them. Other employees got a raise of 2.75 percent, which, for many, still equaled less than 40 cents.\u201cThey cut the yearly raises in half, basically,\u201d said Barbara Gertz, who worked at a Walmart in Denver, Colo., for seven years before quitting this year. She said she believed her last raise was about 23 cents.Walmart is \u201cstill evaluating\u201d how it will handle raises next year, according to a spokesman for the company, Kory Lundberg.Walmart has said that all employees hired after Jan. 1 of this year would start at $9 an hour, and be moved up to $10 after completing Pathways, the training program.But because of the training program, hundreds of thousands of employees are still earning $9, executives explained during a meeting with reporters on Wednesday. Nearly half a million of Walmart\u2019s workers leave the company each year. Most exits occur within the first two years of employment. Walmart said it expects close to 450,000 people to go through Pathways this year, and that it hopes the program will substantially improve retention rates.\u201cWalmart has almost a 50 percent turnover, and it is likely many of the new hires will quit long before they are eligible for the $10 per hour,\u201d said Ms. Luce, the labor expert from CUNY.Walmart executives denied that the program was a way to intentionally keep wages below $10, and emphasized that a trained work force meant better customer service and more opportunities for workers. The retailer has pledged $2.7 billion to lift wages and improve technology, among other initiatives.The company wants \u201cas many people as possible\u201d to advance to $10 through the program, said Kathleen McLaughlin, the company\u2019s chief sustainability officer.Opportunities for personal growth, good communication with a supervisor and a chance to advance in one\u2019s career were among the most important reasons for training, she said.\u201cThe research actually shows that wage is not a big driver of motivation,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Ban Photos of Skinny Models", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIT\u2019S been another big month for talking about women\u2019s bodies.Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s policy sounds, on the surface, like a big step forward. Down with fat-shaming! But it is, rather, an old idea, and one that reinforces stereotypes instead of grappling with the real issue: How do we change the paradigm altogether?It\u2019s not just because, as Mr. Khan or any other parent well knows, banning something simply makes it much more intriguing. Indeed, when the Gucci ad was banned, it immediately resulted in a torrent of new articles and social media posts prominently featuring said ad.It\u2019s also because to judge a body healthy or unhealthy is still to judge it. The notion of creating a committee qualified to rule for the public simply reinforces the message that such judgments by those in power are acceptable and necessary. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s unclear who will even be on the British committee \u2014 a spokeswoman said it was \u201cunder discussion.\u201d (Here\u2019s an idea: Include some teenage girls.)Just because a judgment is supposedly coming from a good place does not obviate the fact that it's a personal judgment, handed down from afar by a third party, bringing another set of prejudices and preconceptions to bear.The message in this case is that women, and young people, are not able to make such distinctions on their own. Yet that power \u2014 the ability of each individual to decide on her body for herself \u2014 is one we should be cultivating, not relinquishing.To ban an ad depicting a specific body type is to demonize that type, labeling it publicly as bad. It also suggests that it is even possible to look at a woman, or a photo of a woman, and know whether she is healthy or unhealthy. That\u2019s a misguided idea, as Claire Mysko, chief executive of the National Eating Disorders Association, acknowledges: One individual can have a seemingly normal body mass index and still have a tortured relationship with food and her physical self; another can look almost bony, and be fine. You can\u2019t tell from the outside.\u201cThe solution to body-shaming isn\u2019t to limit the number and kinds of bodies we are exposed to,\u2019\u2019 said Peggy Drexler, assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University, and the author of \u201cOur Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers and the Changing American Family.\u201d \u201cThe more sorts of bodies young women see \u2014 fat, thin, short, tall \u2014 the better they understand that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and that theirs fits in somewhere.\u201dDr. Drexler is not the only one who thinks so. There\u2019s a growing movement on social media among a broad range of women to reject the marketing of anxiety and to embrace physical authenticity.Last month, the comedian Amy Schumer posted a photograph of herself in a bathing suit on Instagram with the caption: \u201cThis is how I look. I feel happy. I think I look strong and healthy and also like Miss Trunchbull from \u2018Matilda.\u2019 Kisses!\u201d Then she tweeted, \u201cBottom line seems to be we are done with these unnecessary labels which seem to be reserved for women.\u201dT singer and former Disney star Demi Lovato has also been vocal about herself, recently featuring a photograph from a magazine shoot with the words, \u201cPosting a #nophotoshop pic because I\u2019m proud to show my body the way it naturally is. (And there was great lighting\u2026 ).\u201d Ditto the actress and singer Zendaya Coleman, who wrote on Instagram last year: \u201cHad a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19-year-old hips and torso quite manipulated. These are the things that make women self-conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have.\u201dIncreasingly, the conversation is moving from fat-shaming to fat-shamer-shaming, and it seems to be working. \u201cFashion is acutely aware of the changing notion of the body and the changing notion of beauty, and the need to represent that in a way that feels current,\u201d said Ian Schatzberg, president of Wednesday, a creative agency that works with such brands as H&M and Polo Ralph Lauren. It is in their self-interest, after all.Change may be happening more slowly than many, including Mr. Khan, would like, but we should not ignore the fact it is happening. Nor the fact that it is being powered by demand from women themselves. This is not a battle fought by saying no to the one, but by applauding the many.Whose body image is it anyway? It should be ours.Vanessa Friedman is the chief fashion critic for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Cerf, another founder of the internet and chief internet evangelist at Google, in a phone interview ahead of a speech to the group scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cPeople think making things digital means they\u2019ll last forever, but that isn\u2019t true now.\u201dThe project is in its early days, but the discussions \u2014 and caliber of the people involved \u2014 underscored how the World Wide Web\u2019s direction in recent years has stirred a deep anxiety among some technologists. The revelations by Edward J. Snowden that the web has been used by governments for spying and the realization that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have become gatekeepers to our digital lives have added to concerns.Efforts at creating greater amounts of privacy and accountability, by adding more encryption to various parts of the web and archiving all versions of a web page, also came up. Such efforts would make it harder to censor content.\u201cEdward Snowden showed we\u2019ve inadvertently built the world\u2019s largest surveillance network with the web,\u201d said Mr. Kahle, whose group organized the conference. \u201cChina can make it impossible for people there to read things, and just a few big service providers are the de facto organizers of your experience. We have the ability to change all that.\u201dMany people conflate the internet\u2019s online services and the web as one and the same \u2014 yet they are technically quite different. The internet is a networking infrastructure, where any two machines can communicate over a variety of paths, and one local network of computers can connect with other networks.The web, on the other hand, is a popular means to access that network of networks. But because of the way web pages are created, managed and named, the web is not fully decentralized. Take down a certain server and a certain web page becomes unavailable. Links to pages can corrode over time. Censorship systems like China\u2019s Great Firewall eliminate access to much information for most of its people. By looking at internet addresses, it is possible for governments and companies to get a good idea of who is reading which web pages.In some ways, the efforts to change the technology of creating the web are a kind of coming-of-age story. Mr. Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, as a tool for scientists. Today, the web still runs on technologies of the older world.Consider payments. In many cases, people pay for things online by entering credit card information, not much different from handing a card to a merchant for an imprint.At the session on Tuesday, computer scientists talked about how new payment technologies could increase individual control over money. For example, if people adapted the so-called ledger system by which digital currencies are used, a musician might potentially be able to sell records without intermediaries like Apple\u2019s iTunes. News sites might be able to have a system of micropayments for reading a single article, instead of counting on web ads for money.\u201cAd revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cPeople assume today\u2019s consumer has to make a deal with a marketing machine to get stuff for \u2018free,\u2019 even if they\u2019re horrified by what happens with their data. Imagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.\u201dTo make that work now, Mr. Kahle has to search and capture a page, then give it a brand new web address. With the right kind of distributed system, he said, \u201cthe archive can have all of the versions, because there would be a permanent record located across many sites.\u201dThe movement to change how the web is built, like a surprising number of technology discussions, has an almost religious dimension.Still, not all the major players agree on whether the web needs decentralizing.\u201cThe web is already decentralized,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said. \u201cThe problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one Twitter for microblogging. We don\u2019t have a technology problem, we have a social problem.\u201dOne that can, perhaps, be solved by more technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Wins New Bragging Rights in Supercomputers", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers provides more evidence that the once-yawning technology gap between the United States and China is closing.Also for the first time, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer uses Chinese-made microprocessor chips instead of chips from Silicon Valley\u2019s Intel.Supercomputers are viewed in scientific circles as an indicator of national technology leadership, and they are vital for research in areas ranging from the development of new weapons and medicines, to the design of cars and consumer products. American computing experts and business executives have warned for years that leadership in supercomputing is vital to a range of national interests.\u201cToday even consumer detergent bottles are designed with supercomputers,\u201d said Eric D. Isaacs, a physicist and provost of the University of Chicago. \u201cThe Chinese are getting good at building these computers, and it\u2019s a competitive issue now for U.S. industry and national security.\u201dThe United States primacy on the Top500 list has slipped for a number of reasons. Government support for supercomputing has been slowed by long-running debates on the level of federal spending on basic scientific research, as well as opposition to funding for industrial innovation that is not directly related to national security.In the private sector, companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon invested billions of dollars in cloud-computing centers that don\u2019t focus as much on solving scientific problems.And last year, the United States blocked the sale of a number of advanced microprocessors to China over concerns they were being used in nuclear weapon development, which most likely accelerated the development of China\u2019s own technology, said Jack Dongarra, a University of Tennessee computer scientist who helped create the list of the world\u2019s fastest computers in 1993.The Top500 list is maintained by Dr. Dongarra and Erich Strohmaier, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Individual computing centers report descriptions and performance to them twice a year.In 2001, there were no Chinese supercomputers on the Top500. Now, China has 167 systems on the list compared to 165 from the United States. China also leads a more obscure category \u2014 total processing power, or the combined computing speeds of all of its supercomputers on the list.The fastest machine, the Sunway TaihuLight System, was installed this year at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, in China\u2019s Jiangsu province.Despite those achievements, Intel still provided the chips for 91 percent of the machines on the list. And China is still catching up with the United States in state-of-the-art technologies, like software and the networking that links the thousands of chips in a modern supercomputer.But that could soon change. Officials at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the Chinese government has an ambitious $150 billion program to acquire as well as develop new technologies in various kinds of chips.After years of neglect, the United States does appear to be taking the competitive threat seriously, said John Neuffer, president of the S.I.A. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to double down on supercomputing and get ourselves back on track,\u201d he said.While the Chinese have perfected the manufacture of traditional supercomputers pioneered by American companies like IBM and Cray, the United States may focus on new, more efficient supercomputers that might lead to machines intended for challenges like artificial intelligence, according to Larry Smarr, a physicist who directs the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.One of the design challenges of the fastest computers is their vast power consumption. The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer in China, which could fill a large warehouse, requires the same electric power needed to run roughly 15,000 homes. An exascale supercomputer will very likely require more than twice that amount of power, or roughly the amount of power produced by the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, the largest producer of solar power in the United States.At the same time, even if the United States is able to design an exascale computer within the next decade, the Chinese could get there first. According to Dr. Dongarra, the Chinese government is committed to reaching the exascale goal by the end of this decade.Because of funding shortages and technology challenges, \u201cthere has been a delay in getting the exascale launched in the U.S., and as a result, we\u2019re further behind than we should be,\u201d he said.The Sunway supercomputer in Wuxi is a marvel of Chinese manufacturing prowess, Dr. Dongorra noted. The computer is based on 10.6 million processor \u201ccores\u201d spread across 40,960 microprocessors that work together. The chips are relatively slow individually \u2014 about the speed of the processor in Apple\u2019s iPhone 6.The Sunway machine does have its shortcomings. It has older memory-chip technology, meaning it is limited in the speed with which it can move data in and out of each processor when compared with the most powerful American supercomputers. And the new Chinese supercomputer is still based on American-made optical network technology that is used to connect the thousands of microprocessor chips.Despite the fact that the Chinese now have the most supercomputers on the list, the United States still dominates the top 20, with 10 machines. There are now 105 supercomputers in Europe. Japan has 29 systems on the list, down from 37 systems in November.Several American scientists compared what is going on now to the 1980s, when they worried that the nation was losing ground to Japanese supercomputers.\u201cScientists might be saying, \u2018I have to go to China to run my computations,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Smarr.Advertisement"}

That may add some zip to slowing growth while bolstering a heated rivalry with the old-school Oracle. But the price includes a high premium of nine times estimated revenue.Software that operates in the cloud \u2013 essentially large servers accessible through the internet \u2013 has a lot to offer. It\u2019s quick and relatively cheap to set up, easily accommodates additional users and capacity and is updated continuously. As a result, more big businesses are switching to it from traditional software based on individual computers. That is a major reason Salesforce revenue has been growing about 25 percent each year.The problem is that investors may be looking for more, given the company\u2019s $57 billion market capitalization. Margins are improving, but Salesforce is still barely profitable. Acquiring Demandware could refocus shareholders on growth, buying the company a bit more time.Online retailing is a hot area. Even with the likes of Amazon booming, it still accounts for less than 10 percent of total sales in the United States. That leaves plenty of opportunity for Demandware, whose specialty is helping the likes of Adidas, Brooks Brothers and Clarins set up shop online.Plugging the company into a much larger enterprise could help it grow. Salesforce paid almost as much for the cloud-marketing firm ExactTarget three years ago, and that company has by all accounts expanded significantly since, though its revenue isn\u2019t stated separately.The Demandware deal also involves a bit of one-upmanship, helping Mr. Benioff stick it to its long-time rival Oracle and its boss, Larry Ellison. Oracle has been caught somewhat flat-footed by the rise of cloud software, and Salesforce is aiming for a substantial edge in retailing software.The purchase price is an aggressive bet on growth. If Demandware doesn\u2019t deliver over several years, Salesforce will have wasted a chunk of its cash. Yet Mr. Benioff has made such bets before \u2013 and won.What\u2019s more, many fast-growing, cash-burning, privately held cloud firms have recently fallen in value. That could whet Mr. Benioff\u2019s appetite for acquisitions even further.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.To my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)So what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.Is all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.There are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.For instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)Granted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.Oh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn?

Only three have debuted so far in 2016. Additionally, Twilio\u2019s first day of trading coincides with Britain\u2019s vote to stay or leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit, which could roil the markets.Twilio\u2019s new investors did not seem too fazed. The company said on Wednesday that it sold 10 million shares for $15 apiece, which was above the $12 to $14 range it had been marketing to investors. The I.P.O. price yields a market valuation of $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.1 billion valuation Twilio received in a private funding round a year ago.Twilio, based in San Francisco, is being hailed as a trailblazer compared with the almost 170 unicorns \u2014 or companies with valuations above $1 billion \u2014 that have opted to stay private for now. Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software company\u2019s finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets become more uncertain, investors have preferred companies doing I.P.O.s to turn a profit.Twilio generated $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.Bessemer Venture Partners first backed Twilio in 2009 and is its largest shareholder, owning about 25 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Fidelity Investments and Union Square Ventures also hold significant stakes. These entities as well as select executives hold 98.6 percent of the voting power after the I.P.O., because of their ownership of supervoting stock.Jeff Lawson, 38, founded the company eight years ago and currently serves as its chief executive. Before Twilio, he started Nine Star, a retailer of equipment and apparel for the skate, ski, surf and BMX sports crowd. He had also worked for Amazon as technical product manager and as chief technology officer of StubHub.The company plans to use the net proceeds to expand its engineering, sales and marketing and customer support teams, and potentially to acquire businesses or other assets.Goldman Sachs and J.

{"Headline": "SoftBank President Nikesh Arora Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 A former Google executive and Silicon Valley star was on course to be the next chief executive of SoftBank of Japan, one of the world\u2019s most prominent technology conglomerates. Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank\u2019s global ambitions.When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google\u2019s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent.Mr. Arora was vaunted for his deal-making prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son\u2019s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise.The honeymoon did not last.Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank\u2019s overseas deals. Investments in start-ups like DramaFever and Housing.com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered.And the carefully orchestrated succession plan \u2014 or what appeared to be \u2014 has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon.Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to \u201cwork on a few more crazy ideas\u201d at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer.\u201cThis will require me to be C.E.O. for at least another five to 10 years \u2014 this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,\u201d Mr. Son said.Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. \u201cMasa and I are still in love with each other,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cI will support everyone I invested in, and they know that.\u201dMr. Arora\u2019s legacy \u2014 good or bad \u2014 will ultimately be determined by his investment record.After joining SoftBank, Mr. Arora was put in charge of picking takeover targets around the world. His mandate was to diversify a company that, despite the Sprint acquisition and others, still makes about 70 percent of its operating profits in its home market. It owns a major mobile phone network and a controlling interest in Yahoo Japan, among other domestic assets.Expectations for Mr. Arora had been high. Besides his Google pedigree, he had been unusually well paid.In his first six months at SoftBank, Mr. Arora earned 16.6 billion yen, or $159 million at current exchange rates, including a signing bonus, according to company disclosures. That made him one of the best compensated executives in the world during that period, and one of the highest paid executives in Japan, a country known for relatively low pay at the upper echelon.He earned about 8 billion yen last year. Mr. Arora made a huge personal financial commitment to SoftBank in 2015, buying 60 billion yen of the company\u2019s shares.But some of his bets haven\u2019t panned out. DramaFever, a Korean video site, shed traffic months after SoftBank invested in the business, prompting the Japanese company to find buyers for some of its stake.This year, SoftBank has defended Mr. Arora against criticism from a group of mostly anonymous international shareholders, who laid out their case against Mr. Arora in a letter to the company\u2019s board in April. They said a number of start-ups he backed have fizzled. They also questioned his decision to remain an adviser to an American investment firm, Silver Lake, that could potentially compete with SoftBank for deals.\u201cMr. Arora\u2019s investment strategy as the C.E.O. of SIMI appears to be nothing more than throwing a dart at a dart board,\u201d a lawyer representing the investors wrote in the letter, referring to SoftBank\u2019s internet and media operations as SIMI. \u201cHow many more millions of dollars of shareholder value must be wasted before the board realizes something must be done?\u201dA representative for Silver Lake declined to comment. Advisers like Mr. Arora generally receive limited insight into the private equity firm\u2019s deliberations and spend only a few hours a month with Silver Lake.SoftBank said on Monday that an internal panel set up to investigate the investors\u2019 claims had found no evidence of conflict of interest or other misconduct. Still, the episode may have shaken Mr. Son\u2019s trust in Mr. Arora, soured Mr. Arora on SoftBank, or both.\u201cClean chit from board after through review. Time for me to move on,\u201d Mr. Arora said in another tweet on Tuesday.And it was always an open question whether Mr. Son would readily give up control.Mr. Arora was one of only a small number of non-Japanese to have attained a top management position at a major Japanese company. He faced fewer bureaucratic and cultural obstacles than most, in part because SoftBank\u2019s power structure is simple. SoftBanks starts and ends with Mr. Son, who founded the company in the 1980s and runs it with unquestioned authority.\u201cI feel my work is not done,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement on Tuesday.An article on Wednesday about the abrupt departure of Nikesh Arora, who was in line to be chief executive of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, referred incorrectly in some editions to the Chinese company Alibaba\u2019s main line of business. It is e-commerce, not search.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.Advertisement"}

He has also headed the Cyberspace Administration of China since it was created by Mr. Xi in 2014.Mr. Lu will hand over his position as head of the Cyberspace Administration to its deputy director, Xu Lin, who worked directly under Mr. Xi when the president was made the Shanghai party secretary in 2007 after a corruption scandal. A number of officials who worked with Mr. Xi during his seven months in Shanghai have been promoted in recent years.If his new appointment undoubtedly makes Mr. Xu a figure to watch, Mr. Lu\u2019s fate is less clear. Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the fact that Mr. Lu had retained his title as the deputy head of China\u2019s propaganda department meant it was not clear whether his departure from the Cyberspace Administration was a demotion.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to draw the conclusion that he\u2019s out,\u201d Mr. Lam said.\u201cHe might end up getting a promotion in another area of the bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for these important positions to be moved around frequently.\u201dAs head of the Cyberspace Administration, Mr. Lu personally led the charge to rein in some of China\u2019s most outspoken social media stars. He also helped create laws dealing with technology and worked to bring China\u2019s largest internet companies, all of them private, into closer cooperation with Beijing.Still, others expressed skepticism that such complaints would have any major impact on Chinese government personnel moves. Rogier Creemers, a researcher in Chinese law and governance at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said he believed the next move for Mr. Lu would most likely be a promotion in the propaganda department or perhaps a position running a Chinese province.\u201cI think we would have seen different signs if he had been taken out,\u201d Mr. Creemers said. \u201cGenerally there would be more rumors about it. Pretty much every senior leader who has been taken out has been preceded by rumors, and we haven\u2019t really seen anything big about Lu Wei.\u201dCiting a recent decline in the influence of China\u2019s propaganda arm, Mr. Creemers said Mr. Lu might well be given the task of reinvigorating it, especially given how quickly he was able to establish the Cyberspace Administration\u2019s control of the internet in the country.\u201cLu Wei\u2019s biggest victory was he took the government from a place where they feared technology and were behind to one where they were in control of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe nailed Jell-O to the wall.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

The question is whether America should worry about it.The United States was a strong second, but it used to dominate the list. From the American point of view, not good.Perhaps as impressive as the outcome is the means by which the machines\u2019 engineers arrived at the output. The United States does not allow the shipment of advanced semiconductors to China, because chips of that kind can be used in weapons design. So the winning team figured out how to string together over 40,000 Chinese-made chips, each with the processing power of a nice smartphone.That achievement also underlines some shortcomings in viewing this as a straightforward competition, however. The winning computer required as much power as would be needed for 15,000 American homes, and seemed to hit that power level by using relatively little memory.It is a fine machine, but it may not be a very practical machine. The real race now may be how quickly China can develop its own artificial intelligence industry, along with high-performance semiconductors. These could, if combined with the networking know-how shown by this machine, make a severely daunting computer. It is spending billions on that effort.Even more than for the bragging rights, supercomputers now matter for everything from weather forecasting to packaged-goods design. They are increasingly important for the great number of products and processes that are being developed using A.I.The United States lost the race to the top in supercomputers, but it still placed pretty well. It had 165 machines on the list, compared with 167 for China. Japan, which came in third, had 29 computers on the list. The United States had the largest number of supercomputers in the top 20.And the United States has leading researchers in A.I., both in universities and at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The companies matter because they have lots and lots of data on which to train machines, a critical part of making algorithms work better.Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of semiconductors, is now focusing on the use of high-performance chips in commercial A.I., particularly as part of overall computing systems of chips and data. On Monday, Intel showed the latest A.I. features of its high-end commercial chips at an international supercomputing conference in Germany.One feature that figured in the presentation was the ability to deliver nine times the performance of other commercial A.I. systems for the same money.

{"Headline": "Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.The policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.Last month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.Kanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201dMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.Opening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201dThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.Mr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.Apple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

In six to nine months, the company said, the machines may be used in one or more of its distribution centers.At a demonstration on Thursday at a dry goods distribution center here, a drone moved up and down an aisle packed nearly to the ceiling with boxes, taking 30 images per second. Shekar Natarajan, the vice president of last mile and emerging science, explained that the machines could help catalog in as little as a day what now takes employees about a month.Walmart applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to begin testing drones last year.Walmart workers now manually scan pallets of goods with hand-held scanning devices. The drone\u2019s methodical, vertical movements would essentially mimic the path of a person in a forklift who might be inspecting labels and inventory.While a Walmart employee may handle the drone, the technology could \u201cpotentially\u201d mean fewer workers would be needed to take stock or replace missing items, Lorenzo Lopez, a spokesman, said. Mr. Lopez emphasized that those workers could be deployed in other areas of the warehouse.The test is occurring as Walmart is under intense pressure to grow amid an onslaught of low-cost competition, particularly from Amazon, the online shopping giant. Walmart has committed to spending $2.7 billion on labor, technology and other investments, including improving its website and e-commerce business. Last quarter, Walmart beat expectations with $115.9 billion in revenue, but even Doug McMillon, its president and chief executive, acknowledged that the 7 percent growth of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business was \u201ctoo slow.\u201dThe demonstration occurred a day before Walmart\u2019s annual meeting in Fayetteville, Ark.Walmart is testing its new technology for the next six to nine months as part of its Emerging Sciences and Technology group, which focuses on drones, virtual reality and other technologies to see how they might help improve its supply chain. The company said drones may have other applications, perhaps even in its stores, but did not give details.The retailer is using 80 supercenters, in addition to its distribution centers, to help fulfill online orders. By speeding up warehouse operations, drones could help address the logistical challenges of managing inventory in so many places.Walmart operates 190 distribution centers in the United States, and each one services 100 to 150 stores. Millions of items can move through the centers each week and onto a fleet that includes 6,500 trucks and 8,000 drivers to move merchandise throughout the United States.As boxes zipped along at six miles an hour on conveyor belts in the distribution center here, Mr. Natarajan explained that the drones would be one way to make the Walmart supply chain even more efficient. Walmart already reuses the boxes multiple times, and they are printed with a reminder: \u201cEach box cost the company an average of 75 cents.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lundgren, will step down next year, the company announced on Thursday, as the retailer grapples with sagging sales and broader changes in the ways people shop.Jeff Gennette, 55, who is the company\u2019s president, will take the top spot, while Mr. Lundgren will stay as executive chairman.\u201cI have been honored to lead this enterprise through a period of unprecedented reinvention,\u201d Mr. Lundgren said in a statement. \u201cWhile our company is larger, stronger and more resourceful than we were 13 years ago, now is the time to reset our business model to thrive in a future that is being driven by rapid evolution in consumer preferences and shopping habits.\u201dThe company said the leadership transition was part of its board\u2019s succession plan. But the moves come in the face of widespread turmoil at the nation\u2019s department stores, including Macy\u2019s, which have struggled to recover from the recession as quickly as the rest of the retail industry. Shoppers are spending more, but they are also hunting for bargains, online and at so-called off-price stores known foremost for their discounts.Amazon, the online shopping giant, as well as discount chains like T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, have added to the pressure. Macy\u2019s and other department stores have offered aggressive promotions to entice shoppers, a move that some retail experts say has led to a race to the bottom.\u201cWe\u2019re a promotional department store, and we will continue to be a promotional department store,\u201d Mr. Gennette said in an interview. \u201cWe offer values every day to our customer.\u201dMacy\u2019s, J. C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl\u2019s all reported surprisingly lackluster sales last quarter that sent their stocks tumbling. Macy\u2019s was particularly hard-hit, reporting that sales at comparable stores, a measure often used by the industry, fell 5.6 percent over the previous year, the weakest showing since the recession.The new chief has a \u201cvery daunting task\u201d ahead of him, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting and research firm.\u201cMacy\u2019s is facing some very difficult challenges,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the right move at the right time.\u201dStill, the selection of Mr. Gennette does not seem to suggest a swift resetting of strategy. He said he expected to continue several of the initiatives begun under his predecessor. To better compete with discount stores, Macy\u2019s is opening outlet stores under the Macy\u2019s Backstage name and plans to have 15 of those stores open by the end of the fourth quarter.Mr. Gennette said he also wanted to continue building collaborations with other brands. In some stores, Macy\u2019s leases space to Men\u2019s Wearhouse to run a tuxedo rental business. It also has similar arrangements with Finish Line, the athletic shoe brand, and Sunglass Hut. These brands lease the space and operate separate shops within Macy\u2019s stores.He is also continuing what he calls Macy\u2019s \u201cI do\u201d strategy, upgrading fine jewelry departments within the department stores.\u201cWe believe we can be the wedding destination,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts with the ring and goes all the way to your first house and kid. We believe we can be a one-stop shop for that.\u201dWhat\u2019s not clear is how Mr. Gennette will differ from his predecessor, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino.Mr. Gennette began his career at Macy\u2019s in 1983, starting as an executive trainee and working his way into management roles in the men\u2019s and children\u2019s divisions. Before his promotion to Macy\u2019s president in 2014, he worked as the company\u2019s chief merchandising officer since 2009.\u201cHe\u2019s very much a Macy\u2019s insider,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cHe knows the business inside and out, and he\u2019s worked very closely with Lundgren for many years. In a way, they\u2019re just swapping seats.\u201dAside from its retail business, Macy\u2019s is also exploring ways to raise money from its many real estate holdings. Last year, the company sold part of its building in Downtown Brooklyn to Tishman Speyer, a developer. The retailer will continue to occupy the first four floors of the nine-story building, while the upper floors will be reconfigured into office space for other tenants.Mr. Gennette said Macy\u2019s was also pursuing other sales or joint ventures at its flagship stores in New York, Chicago and Minneapolis, as well as some of its mall properties.Macy\u2019s now operates 870 stores in 45 states, up from just 240 stores in 2005. Those stores include the upscale department store chain Bloomingdale\u2019s and the makeup retailer Bluemercury. Macy\u2019s shares rose about 2 percent in midday trading.\u201cUnder Lundgren, lots of different initiatives were going on. What Macy\u2019s needs is a finisher of those things,\u201d said Mr. Saunders, the retail analyst. \u201cWe have to see what Jeff Gennette can do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Apple Think Outside the Device?", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtMore than any other company in tech, Apple prizes physical objects \u2014 expensive, perfectly designed, self-contained nuggets of aluminum and glass that you buy today, use for a couple years and replace.Until recently, that view worked quite well. Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apple\u2019s device-centric aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world \u2014 and raked in eye-popping profits while doing so.Yet Apple\u2019s view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech.So the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices?The answer: Yes, but slowly \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough.But a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as add-ons to its devices \u2014 not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apple\u2019s best chance to create the kind of transcendent, cross-device experience that its competitors are now pushing.Analysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV; Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apple\u2019s devices, left unclear what Apple\u2019s ultimate aims were for the voice assistant.The new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone \u2014 you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine.These shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice \u2014 in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.Siri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps, ride-sharing apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri won\u2019t let you control music apps, for example \u2014 you can\u2019t ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apple\u2019s own music subscription service.This limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort \u2014 one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t.For now, this isn\u2019t a big problem \u2014 you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?The device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend \u2014 and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201dTo handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload \u2014 there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?But based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is. It\u2019s taking a more moderate app-based, device-centric path. Many of its voice features will be fine \u2014 useful, even. But it sure isn\u2019t pushing for a revolution.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Kindle Learns to Navigate Literary Thickets", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 For years, Amazon has been chiseling away at the irritants that keep many people from switching to e-readers. The company has improved the legibility of the text on Kindle screens to make it nearly indistinguishable from print, and fiddled with the ergonomics of the new Kindle Oasis to make using it feel more like holding a book.On Tuesday, Amazon will make a small change to its Kindle software that could solve a vexing issue for people who prefer the intuitiveness of navigating a print book. The update to the software for Amazon\u2019s own Kindle devices as well as apps that run on iOS and Android will include a feature called Page Flip that effectively mimics the near-universal habit of using a thumb to temporarily mark the page of a printed book where the reader left off.The update will be available free on Tuesday.Page Flip is designed for those moments when you\u2019re reading and need to quickly glance at another section of a book with photographs, maps or family trees. This is especially useful for nonfiction, but also comes in handy for books like \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d that feature large casts of characters who inhabit a bewildering array of fictional lands.In a recent demonstration of Page Flip, Jeff Kunins, vice president for Kindle Reader at Amazon, says the company regularly surveys people with Kindle devices and software to find out how to improve them. Readers of nonfiction have been clear about where they\u2019d like to see changes.\u201cThe No. 1 thing they\u2019ve been telling us to get better at is navigation,\u201d Mr. Kunins said.In the past, someone using a Kindle device or app who wanted to save their place could bookmark a page, which works well enough but can get disorienting if you have digitally dog-eared a lot of pages.With Page Flip, Kindle automatically saves the page you\u2019re reading when you tap the screen of your device, pinning it to the side of the screen. You can also easily shift the book to what Amazon calls a bird\u2019s-eye view, which shows thumbnail images of a handful of pages at once so you can skim quickly to find the reference page you\u2019re looking for.Here\u2019s an Amazon promotional video of how it will work:Mr. Kunins said that 2015 was a record year for the Kindle business at Amazon; customers bought more Kindle books and read more of their pages than ever before. He said the company had paid more than $160 million in royalties over the last 12 months to independent authors who participated in Kindle Unlimited, a $10-a-month digital reading service (the company didn\u2019t provide comparable data for the year before).\u201cKindle keeps growing year after year,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

And now you are as likely to have paid services like Netflix or Amazon Prime as you are to have a DVR service.How much are we watching, and how are we watching it? Here is what Nielsen found:On average, American adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day. The bulk of that \u2014 about four and a half hours of it \u2014 is live television, which is television watched when originally broadcast. Thirty minutes more comes via DVR.So even though ratings are falling and the broadcast networks don\u2019t quite have the glamour they used to, TV is alive and well, right?Well. That five-hour figure is 19 fewer minutes, on average, than Americans were watching two years ago \u2014 and three fewer than they watched per day last year. You\u2019re watching less TV live, but the rate of decline slowed between last year and this year.Let\u2019s break this into groups. People over the age of 50 watch the most TV, somewhere in the range of 50 hours a week, according to Nielsen. In fact, people over the age of 50 are watching more TV per week this year than last.But that\u2019s where that trend ends. People 24 and under are watching, roughly, two fewer hours of live TV and DVR programming per week than last year. And 25- to 34-year-olds (roughly speaking, millennials)? They\u2019re watching an hour less per week, down from 27 and a half hours to 26 and a half hours. People between 35 and 49 mostly held steady and are watching about 22 minutes less television per week: 36 and a half hours from nearly 37 hours a week.About 50 percent of Americans now have subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in their homes, Nielsen said. That is up from 42 percent last year. And that figure of 50 percent for the paid services equals for the first time the proportion of homes with DVR players.

{"Headline": "Stratolaunch\u2019s Gargantuan Flying Launchpad Edges Toward the Skies", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byMOJAVE, Calif. \u2014 The world\u2019s largest airplane by wingspan sits in a cradle of scaffolding as workers fit the remaining parts that will turn it into a flying launchpad for firing rockets into space.Everything about this project, called Stratolaunch, screams bigness. The slogan \u201cThink Big\u201d is plastered on workers\u2019 T-shirts and on posters around the hangar in the desert outside Los Angeles, where the plane is being assembled. The effort is being financed by the jumbo fortune of Paul G. Allen, the billionaire space enthusiast and a Microsoft founder.The plane\u2019s nickname is Roc, after the gigantic mythical bird that carried an elephant in its talons, though Stratolaunch executives are not crazy about it; it sounds like something not known for staying aloft.A rare tour of the plane and hangar last week by executives working for Mr. Allen showed that the project was still underway, and on track to begin commercial operations before the end of the decade. But there are lingering questions about how Stratolaunch\u2019s business will work once its flying behemoth is ready for takeoff.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious undertaking,\u201d said Charles Beames, president of Vulcan Aerospace, the entity Mr. Allen created to oversee Stratolaunch and other space initiatives. \u201cA really big plane means carrying anything from a really big rocket to a smaller rocket. That allows us to serve a broader set of customers.\u201dStratolaunch bought two used Boeing 747s from United Airlines, removed most of their critical parts and is now reassembling them into one carrier plane with a new shell made of lightweight graphite composites. It is hoped that the plane will take off with a rocket slung underneath, which it would then drop from an altitude of more than 30,000 feet, sending it on its way to space.Stratolaunch executives said an airborne launcher would have other advantages, like the ability to simply fly to patches of clear sky to avoid foul weather that could scrub a mission. They also say their plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits, although the plane needs a landing strip that can handle its great size.There has been tumult around aspects of Stratolaunch.Its partnerships ended with SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Stratolaunch had worked with them both to develop rockets for blasting satellites into space from the plane. And questions have been raised about whether there would be enough business \u2014 given the trend toward smaller satellites \u2014 for such a large plane.In an interview, Mr. Beames said that Stratolaunch, which will be able to carry payloads of over 500,000 pounds, was the right size. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not overbuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the size gives us is flexibility in payload.\u201dBill Ostrove, a space systems analyst at Forecast International, an aerospace and defense research firm, says the real demand for Stratolaunch\u2019s services will be determined by its ability to serve the small-satellite launch market, which is extremely competitive.\u201cIf Stratolaunch can figure out its strategy and develop a working rocket, it should be able to capture some business, as long as the small-satellite market continues to grow and demand for launch vehicles continues,\u201d he said.During the tour last week, workers with Scaled Composites, the company founded by Mr. Rutan that is building the plane, were positioning panels on the twin fuselages of the plane and grinding surfaces down to a smooth finish. Over 300 people are working on the craft.The assembly of the plane, inside a cavernous hangar built especially for it, is more than three-quarters finished. The size of the plane is difficult to comprehend. The top of its tail wing is nearly four stories from the ground.Tucked away in corners of the hangar are the landing gear components from the two 747s. The new plane will use six of the eight Pratt & Whitney engines Stratolaunch acquired when it bought the 747s. The plane\u2019s cockpit is being outfitted with electronics, crew seats and windows from the 747s.Mr. Beames said Stratolaunch would announce new partnerships in the coming months that will fill out details about the project. He declined to say when Stratolaunch would begin test flights, but he vowed to meet a goal of Mr. Allen\u2019s to be up and running by 2020.\u201cCome hell or high water, you can be sure we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Mr. Beames said.Advertisement"}

Pinterest wants to be known as a network for inspiration in topics like travel, cooking and crafts, as well as for shopping both on and offline.At bottom, the site sees itself more as a competitor to Google \u2014 a way to search, discover and ultimately buy.\u201cShopping with Pinterest is meant to be that bridge between getting inspiration and actually making it a part of your life,\u201d Ben Silbermann, the chief executive, said at an event at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters on Tuesday.Among the features are buyable \u201cpins,\u201d or buttons, in browsers that users can click to purchase items on the site, as well as a digital shopping bag that follows users from their desktops to their smartphones or tablets.Perhaps most interesting is Pinterest\u2019s object-detection software, a type of product search and discovery that companies like Amazon have tried.

Our TV critics look at a few from the latest crop.Lauren Ambrose (\u201cSix Feet Under\u201d) stars as Jules, who as an adult still feels like a lucky guest at the Interestings\u2019 party, even though she\u2019s as enmeshed as any of them. Jules is like many arch heroines, equal parts bombast and fragility, shaken and poured over ice, or in her case, poured over a husband (Gabriel Ebert) who is decidedly a Boring. Jessica Par\u00e9 (\u201cMad Men\u201d) and David Krumholtz (\u201cNumbers\u201d) also star as two other members of the clique who marry each other; she, the glamorous and theatrical Ash, and he the wildly successful cartoonist Figman.Adapting a novel for television means losing some of the precision of the characters\u2019 interior life. But this cast\u2019s chemistry and performances, particularly from Ms. Ambrose and Mr. Ebert, create a comparable specificity, demonstrating their own spin on the efficient loathing of a failing New York marriage. The pilot effectively conveys the various textures of the relationships among the old friends, which are sometimes fraught and sometimes the only source of peace in their lives. Must it be called \u201cinteresting\u201d? Well, O.K. then. MARGARET LYONSIt\u2019s probably wrong to judge sea creatures based on a first impression, but, to be blunt, Sigmund is no Little Mermaid.\u201cYou have all this cool stuff up here,\u201d he tells the children who free him from a fishing net. \u201cSo much better than what we sea monsters have.\u201dThe storytelling isn\u2019t great, and neither are the three child actors (Solomon Stewart, Rebecca Bloom and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) who are the focus of this show. Also not great: David Arquette, who plays Captain Barnabus, a gnarly old salt who tries in vain to convince other grown-ups that sea monsters are real. Presumably the intended audience here is 8 and younger, and maybe that age group won\u2019t care that this is thin stuff that seems indifferently made. NEIL GENZLINGERF. Scott Fitzgerald described Monroe Stahr, the Hollywood-producer protagonist of his unfinished novel \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d as one of \u201cnot half a dozen men\u201d who could \u201ckeep the whole equation of pictures in their heads.\u201d In adaptation, written and directed by Billy Ray, Stahr is an upstanding guy who can charm a starlet and look good in a dinner jacket \u2014 he\u2019s one of thousands.Putting Fitzgerald on screen is a thankless business \u2014 his infinitely delicate realism withers in the light, and if you can\u2019t capture the texture of his prose, there\u2019s really no point. So Mr. Ray has taken Fitzgerald\u2019s last work \u2014 in which his love and hate for the movie business remain unresolved, while jostling for space with a death-obsessed romance \u2014 and reimagined it as a sprightly but lamentably pedestrian showbiz melodrama. Several plot lines that he\u2019s elevated or created with a series pickup in mind, involving Nazis and a Hooverville across from the studio lot, feel distinctly unpromising.Matt Bomer (\u201cWhite Collar\u201d), in and out of dinner jackets, looks great and projects an easy assurance as Stahr, but the character doesn\u2019t have the gravity of someone (like Irving Thalberg, the producer Fitzgerald modeled his hero on) who can make great art while keeping the whole Hollywood equation in his head. That Stahr would never have given this mundane production a green light. MIKE HALEAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Maudlin Trip Down the Amazon, With a Star in Disguise", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byOpera fans live for the moments when a big-voiced singer fills a soaring melody with raw emotion and thrilling sound. But there\u2019s a limit: Daniel Cat\u00e1n\u2019s opera \u201cFlorencia en el Amazonas\u201d (\u201cFlorencia in the Amazon\u201d) is made up almost entirely of effusive melodic lines.The characters in \u201cFlorencia,\u201d with a Spanish libretto by Marcelo Fuentes-Berain, are inspired by the writings of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, though the opera is not based on any specific work of his. The story follows a group of South Americans on a steamboat journey down the Amazon to Manaus, the jungle city, where they believe Florencia Grimaldi, a world-famous, reclusive soprano, has agreed to sing. Among the group, it turns out, is Florencia, who is searching for a former lover, a butterfly hunter who shaped her young life 20 years earlier.Overall, though, his musical language is unabashedly neo-Romantic. In scene after scene, the characters break into seemingly inevitable, luxurious lyrical flights. Puccini is the model, though he was a more savvy dramatist who saved soaring melodies for crucial moments.The sounds of nature, from chirping jungle birds to the surging currents of the river, are effectively captured in Mr. Cat\u00e1n\u2019s orchestral writing, evocative of Debussy and Stravinsky. But the orchestra also swells with hokey cinematic outbursts. The story becomes sunk in heavy-handed symbolism when a storm sets the boat adrift and sets off a night of soul-searching for the characters.The conductor Dean Williamson drew colorful, shimmering playing from the City Opera orchestra. The cast was excellent, starting with the plush-toned, expressive soprano Elizabeth Caballero as Florencia. The soprano Sarah Beckham-Turner brought a warm voice and earnestness to Rosalba, a young journalist working on a biography of Grimaldi. Rosalba at first resists, but finally accepts, the love of Arcadio, the captain\u2019s nephew, here the ardent tenor Won Whi Choi. Lisa Chaves and Luis Ledesma threw themselves into several scenes as a long-married, frequently quarreling couple who rekindle their love during the crisis-ridden trip. Kevin Thompson made a sturdy captain.The production incorporates videos behind the action to convey the passing shore and flowing river. In a bold choice, the currents (and creatures) of the Amazon are suggested by a dozen dancers from Ballet Hispanico\u2019s BHdos company, wearing full white body suits and writhing on the floor at the front of the stage. One lame touch came when the strong bass-baritone Philip Cokorinos, playing Riolobo, the captain\u2019s mysterious helper, appeared in a mystical butterfly suit to calm the storm. If the idea was to conjure a magical realm, he just looked silly.The last performances of \u201cFlorencia en el Amazonas\u201d are on Saturday and Sunday at the Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 60th Street; 212-721-6500, nycopera.com.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Housing\u2019s New Players Spiraled Into Banks\u2019 Old Mistakes", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 2Some private equity firms that came in as the cleanup crew for the housing crisis are now repeating errors that banks committed, while others are bypassing the working poor.Supported byWhen the housing crisis sent the American economy to the brink of disaster in 2008, millions of people lost their homes. The banking system had failed homeowners and their families.New investors soon swept in \u2014 mainly private equity firms \u2014 promising to do better.But some of these new investors are repeating the mistakes that banks committed throughout the housing crisis, an investigation by The New York Times has found. They are quickly foreclosing on homeowners. They are losing families\u2019 mortgage paperwork, much as the banks did. And many of these practices were enabled by the federal government, which sold tens of thousands of discounted mortgages to private equity investors, while making few demands on how they treated struggling homeowners.Private equity firms, and the mortgage companies they own, face less oversight than the banks. And yet they are the cleanup crew for the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression.Out of the more than a dozen private equity firms operating in the housing industry, The Times examined three of the largest to assess their impact on homeowners and renters.Unlike the banks, Nationstar wears many hats at once: mortgage bill collector, auction house for foreclosed homes and lender to new borrowers. By working every angle, and collecting fees at each step, the company faces potential conflicts of interest that enable it to make money on what is otherwise a costly foreclosure process.When Nationstar becomes your mortgage bill collector, it can make money at every step, regardless of whether you remain in the home or are foreclosed on and kicked out. Making money on foreclosures creates potential conflicts of interest.In the rental market, The Times found, other big private equity firms largely bypassed the nation\u2019s poorest neighborhoods as they scooped up and renovated foreclosed homes across the country. Those firms include Blackstone, a huge private equity firm and the nation\u2019s largest private landlord of rental houses.These decisions point to shortcomings of the government\u2019s response to the housing crisis. Rather than enact sweeping changes to housing policy, the government largely handed the problems to a new set of companies.Normie Brown and her husband, Derrick, have lost two fights \u2014 first with their bank and then with private equity. Initially, the Texas couple say, they faced a wrongful foreclosure by Bank of America. The bank paid them $50,000 as part of a broader government settlement over suspected mortgage abuses, and the Browns used that money to fight for their house in court.But the couple couldn\u2019t stop their new bill collector, Nationstar, from auctioning off their home.\u201cYou think all you have to do is show them where they did you wrong, and basically justice will prevail,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case.\u201dThe court hadn\u2019t yet decided the case, but it didn\u2019t matter: They lost their house. The couple has since separated and Mr. Brown, a decorated Gulf War veteran, said he had moved in and out of homelessness.Nationstar declined to comment on the Browns\u2019 case, but said it had outperformed banks on avoiding foreclosure. Nationstar\u2019s chief executive, Jay Bray, said in an interview that \u201cforeclosure is always, always the last resort.\u201dPrivate equity plowed into the housing market after big banks and regional lenders, facing a crackdown from federal regulators for wrongful foreclosure practices, pulled back in the aftermath of the crisis. The shift led private equity firms to spend tens of billions of dollars acquiring homes and troubled mortgages from banks and the government.For private equity firms, which specialize in buying companies at a bargain, the housing market was just their latest investment in a distressed asset. These firms, unlike banks, raise money for their deals from pension funds and other huge institutional investors.The wave of private equity investment in housing has had a positive impact on the American economy.The firms displaced poorly performing banks. They also helped stabilize the nation\u2019s housing market, and it achieved that through smart business decisions about where to put its money. That, in turn, rewarded investors \u2014 which is how private enterprise is supposed to work.The idea is that banks should follow an implicit social contract: In return for government loans and other support, they are expected to serve a community\u2019s needs. Private equity, which unlike the banks does not borrow money from the government, is answerable to its investors. Those investors include some of the nation\u2019s largest pension plans, whose members \u2014 teachers and police officers among them \u2014 may support improvements to such lower-income areas.As a result, The Times found, private equity has focused on buying newer homes in middle-income areas like the suburbs of Tampa, Fla. They have largely avoided more urban communities with older homes, because doing so would be less lucrative for their investors.\u201cThere has been a missed opportunity here,\u201d said Dan Immergluck, a professor of city and regional planning at the Georgia Tech College of Design, who has studied the effect of the financial crisis on housing. \u201cThey are pushing the market up at the top end and neglecting the bottom end.\u201dGovernment officials are also concerned that private equity\u2019s mortgage firms face less scrutiny than banks. While banks are examined by regulators for financial soundness, no similar testing occurs for private equity\u2019s companies.Ginnie Mae, which issues securities backed by mortgages with government guarantees, wants Congress to grant it greater oversight over nonbank mortgage firms and provide money to perform \u201cstress tests.\u201d The fear is that one firm\u2019s failure would create hardship for millions of customers.\u201cIt\u2019s an Achilles\u2019 heel for us to some degree,\u201d said Ted Tozer, Ginnie Mae\u2019s president.Translation: If foreclosing on a homeowner is the most profitable option, Lone Star is likely to foreclose.Federal officials hoped things would be different.In 2012, America was still in the grips of the worst housing crisis in decades. Foreclosure signs lined the American landscape, casting a shadow on more than 3.5 million homes. In some communities, abandoned houses outnumbered occupied ones. And soured mortgages made by banks were weighing on the government because it had insured them against default.The government, eager to stem its own losses, decided to ramp up the sale of distressed mortgages to investors. In all, it has sold more than 100,000 soured mortgages to investors \u2014 one of the largest such series of sales. The mortgage sales enticed private equity firms like Lone Star into the mortgage market, where they saw bargains.Housing officials reckoned that private equity firms would bring about change. For one thing, these firms were among the only investors with pockets deep enough to take on billions of dollars worth of ailing mortgages. And they could be more flexible than the banks in keeping Americans in their homes because they had bought the mortgages at steep discounts.But instead of showing greater flexibility, Lone Star \u2014 much like the banks before it \u2014 has often remained rigid about modifying mortgages. And in some cases it has moved quickly to foreclose, taking possession of homes to sell them, according to dozens of court proceedings, as well as interviews with borrowers and housing advocates.In a statement, Caliber Home Loans, Lone Star\u2019s mortgage servicing subsidiary, said that \u201cmodifying a nonperforming loan for a borrower is almost always the most profitable option for a lender, and Caliber is incentivized to pursue that outcome.\u201dYet Lone Star and Caliber have foreclosed on more than 14 percent of the 17,000 loans the firm picked up at auction from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2014, according to an analysis of loan filings that RealtyTrac performed for The Times. Caliber is now moving toward foreclosing on at least another 3,200.Some critics say the government is partly to blame by not expressly requiring private buyers to modify most loans. Its priority, these critics argue, was to sell off the mortgages to protect taxpayers against losses, rather than protecting homeowners.\u201cI understand HUD wants to make its money back,\u201d said Representative Michael E. Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat. But, he said, \u201chedge funds and private equity firms have one interest only, and that is the bottom line.\u201dIn its defense, Caliber said that 71 percent of the 17,000 mortgages it bought in the HUD auction had already begun the lengthy foreclosure process and that more than half of the homes were vacant at the time of foreclosure. Caliber said its goal was to \u201cavoid foreclosure whenever possible,\u201d noting that it had done so for roughly 4,200 homeowners in the pool of mortgages it bought from HUD.Modifications don\u2019t always save borrowers money.After filing for personal bankruptcy, Michael Rego, 51, of Yonkers, held out hope for a loan modification when JPMorgan Chase sold his delinquent mortgage to Lone Star. Last October, he received a letter from Lone Star\u2019s Caliber that began: \u201cCongratulations! You are approved for a trial period plan.\u201dBut his hopes were dashed when it turned out that the proposed modification would actually increase his monthly payment by $500. Two months later, to add insult to injury, Mr. Rego lost his job as a marketing consultant at Citigroup.\u201cI would hate to just walk away from the house,\u201d said Mr. Rego, who has lived in the three-bedroom home for nearly 20 years. \u201cBut if I have to, I have to.\u201dCaliber and Lone Star have largely opted not to participate in government programs that encourage mortgage modifications. To date, Caliber has received just $3.3 million in payments from the Treasury Department for modifying loans in compliance with the federal Home Affordable Modification Program.In contrast with Caliber, most banks have participated more fully in the government modification program, as has Nationstar, which has received $158 million in payments.Lone Star, led by the billionaire investor John Grayken, has expanded Caliber \u2014 which employs more than 1,000 people \u2014 into one of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing lenders. As a business, Lone Star has been a success. It has generated an average annual net return of 20 percent for investors for more than two decades.It also just completed one of the largest securitizations of nonprime mortgages since the financial crisis. In early June, the firm announced a $161.7 million bond deal backed by mortgages underwritten by Caliber, including many loans to people who had either filed for bankruptcy or been previously foreclosed on.And the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, opened an investigation last fall into Caliber over its handling of delinquent mortgages. Mr. Schneiderman recently expanded the investigation to include an examination of Lone Star\u2019s securitization of mortgages, including delinquent loans.The New York State Department of Financial Services is also reviewing some of Caliber\u2019s practices.\u201cThese companies are pitching their models as being well aligned with home buyers, but it\u2019s hard to know if that\u2019s true,\u201d said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy for the left-leaning Center for American Progress.Inside Nationstar\u2019s headquarters on the outskirts of Dallas, government regulators made an alarming discovery \u2014 and then another one, and another.The regulators, who gathered at Nationstar in 2014 for what should have been a routine examination, found \u201cinaccurate information\u201d in customer loan files, according to confidential documents reviewed by The Times. Nationstar, which became a huge mortgage bill collector in recent years, often failed to detect these errors \u201cuntil the foreclosure process is underway.\u201d Some of the breakdowns, the documents said, \u201cplaced consumers at significant risk of servicing and foreclosure abuses.\u201dRegulators laid the blame on Nationstar, citing deficient technology and a failure to employ enough trained workers as it rapidly expanded to become the nation\u2019s fourth-largest mortgage bill collector. In 2010, it ranked 18th.The examination, conducted by more than 15 states and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, showed the flaws of private equity\u2019s new role in the mortgage market. Nationstar, controlled by the Fortress Investment Group, was repeating some of the banking industry\u2019s mistakes.As new regulations prompted banks to scale back their servicing of mortgages, companies owned by private equity went on a buying spree. Private equity sensed an opportunity as the mortgage servicing business became a liability for the banks, leading Bank of America alone to reach settlements worth billions of dollars over federal accusations of using illegal foreclosure documents and unfair rejections of loan modifications. Since 2012, Nationstar has bought the rights to collect payments on more than $450 billion in mortgages, much of it from Bank of America.The previously unreported documents detailing Nationstar\u2019s 2014 examination tell the story of its expansion and the problems that followed. \u201cNationstar Mortgage pursued a strategy of explosive and virtually unchecked growth, but did not put in place appropriate operational controls,\u201d one regulatory memo said.The Times focused on three of the biggest private equity firms operating in the housing industry to better understand their impact on homeowners and renters.Authorities are investigating Nationstar based on the 2014 examination, and it could face an enforcement action this year.Jay Bray, Nationstar\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that \u201ccandidly, we did a poor job\u201d handling the 2014 exam. But since the exam, he said, \u201cWe are proud of the work we\u2019ve done to improve the customer experience.\u201d The company has invested in technology and added staff, he said.\u201cDid we make mistakes? Yes. Was it a systemic problem? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, attributing the problems to growing pains.\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to play Monday morning quarterback,\u201d he said.Wesley Edens, a founder of Fortress, Nationstar\u2019s private equity backer, maintains that the servicer has performed better than the banks it replaced. Since buying some of the banks\u2019 most troubled assets, Nationstar has overseen a 50 percent decline in delinquent loans, though those improvements coincided with a broader recovery in housing.\u201cThank God those loans were moved from Bank of America to Nationstar, because so many borrowers were better off,\u201d Mr. Edens said in an interview.(A Bank of America spokesman called the company \u201can industry leader in providing foreclosure avoidance solutions to more than 2.1 million customers since the beginning of the crisis.\u201d)Mr. Edens, noting that Fannie Mae ranked Nationstar higher than its peers at preventing delinquency, encouraged The Times to contact federal authorities to verify these improvements. The authorities declined to comment.Nationstar notes that, over the last four years, it has approved more than 172,000 loan modifications that saved homeowners an average of $380 a month. Whereas all servicers collectively rejected 69 percent of applications for the government\u2019s modification program, Nationstar has been more generous, rejecting 54 percent of borrowers.Nationstar also recently announced plans to rename its mortgage operation \u201cMr. Cooper,\u201d presenting a more consumer-friendly face.Even as Nationstar has shown improvements, on multiple occasions last year the company \u201cwrongfully terminated\u201d borrowers from the federal mortgage modification program, according to a published report. \u201cOver multiple quarters, Nationstar is wrongfully kicking people out of the program, and that\u2019s a real serious concern,\u201d said Christy Romero, the special inspector general for the 2008 bank bailout law and the author of the loan modification report.In Phoenix, Millard and Adria Gaines struggled to modify their loan as it changed hands four times in 20 years.During a recent interview at his home, Mr. Gaines walked to his kitchen freezer, pulled out a pack of cigarettes and described how he tried for years to get Bank of America, and then Nationstar, to modify their loan. In 2014, his wife exchanged emails with a Nationstar \u201cforeclosure prevention specialist\u201d who suggested she apply for a modification.After months of no change, Mrs. Gaines sent a letter detailing family misfortunes that imperiled their finances, including that her husband had been told he had acute kidney failure.About six months later, Nationstar finalized a mortgage modification for the Gaineses. But even then \u2014 reducing the interest rate to 3.2 percent from 5.3 percent \u2014 it was months too late to help the Gaineses avoid a second bankruptcy.Sheri Cellini\u2019s family of five loved their ranch-style home in Ashland, Ore., a small town in the foothills of the mountains. They lived there for six years until a foreclosure turned them into renters.\u201cThe kids want to drive by it all the time,\u201d Ms. Cellini said of the family\u2019s old house. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable thing.\u201dThe recent history of her former home reflects private equity\u2019s new dominance. By the time their home was foreclosed on in 2013, and after the family tried in vain to lower monthly payments, the Cellinis had bounced from one mortgage firm to another.The company that oversaw their foreclosure was Nationstar. Another family took over the Cellinis\u2019 house, winning it through an online auction platform called Homesearch. That family then obtained a mortgage through a company called Greenlight Loans.The companies all have different names and different roles, but all three are essentially the same company. Homesearch and Greenlight are owned by Nationstar.The whirl of transactions illustrates how Nationstar can control nearly every stage of the mortgage process, posing potential conflicts of interest as it earns fees along the way. Nationstar collects bills and, when people don\u2019t pay, can foreclose on homes. Nationstar earns fees auctioning those homes through Homesearch. Ads on Homesearch, which is now known online as Xome.com, direct bidders to Greenlight.Nationstar can then collect on the new mortgage, bringing the process full circle.Shane Hunter, who won the Cellinis\u2019 house through Homesearch, took out a mortgage with Greenlight, even though he had been leaning toward another lender. Nationstar earned a 5 percent \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d by selling the house through its auction website, an extra $10,450 that it rolled into the loan.As a mortgage bill collector, Nationstar\u2019s interests typically align with borrowers\u2019, because foreclosing can be far more expensive than modifying and continuing to service a loan. But because Nationstar earns fees from selling homes through its auction site, as well as making new mortgages from winning bidders, that added business may compete with the company\u2019s interest in keeping borrowers in their homes.Mr. Bray, the Nationstar chief executive, said the company would always rather keep people in their homes. \u201cWe don\u2019t make money from foreclosing on folks,\u201d he said, pointing to data showing that it costs the company 10 times as much to handle a loan in foreclosure. \u201cWe hate foreclosures.\u201dTo prevent potential conflicts, Nationstar said it keeps its servicing employees separate from the auction staff. They work in different buildings and use separate email systems, the company said.Auction sites are a driver of Nationstar\u2019s growth. From 2013 to 2015, revenue more than tripled in the unit that includes the auction platform and other services. This stands in contrast with banks, which generally do not own these types of sites.In interviews, several borrowers said that Nationstar required them to list their homes with Homesearch, even after they had found a buyer through their own real estate agent. While Nationstar argues that Homesearch helps to validate an outside offer price, homeowners and their agents complained that it could slow the sale process.\u201cAny requirement to use a particular auction site, especially one affiliated with the loan servicer, raises serious concerns,\u201d the Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, said in a statement.He is one of several state attorneys general investigating Nationstar\u2019s auction business, questioning whether it imposes unnecessary costs on consumers. The New York State Department of Financial Services is conducting its own investigation of the auction process and the potential conflicts it presents, according to a letter obtained through a public records request.The case of the Browns \u2014 the Texas couple who first fought their bank, then fought Nationstar \u2014 illustrates Nationstar\u2019s aggressiveness when selling a home through an auction site.The Browns won a temporary restraining order against Nationstar as they fought what they argued was a wrongful foreclosure. But Nationstar went ahead and listed the home for sale on Auction.com, an outside auction platform that has split fees with Nationstar.On Sept. 26, 2013 \u2014 more than a week before the restraining order would expire \u2014 Nationstar auctioned off the home through Auction.com. Next, Nationstar moved the case from state to federal court, and it closed the deal before the new judge could rule.\u201cThis was our first home,\u201d said Ms. Brown, who ultimately lost the case after the home was sold. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give up on it.\u201dTo a visitor, Ruskin, Fla., a town just south of Tampa, looks like cookie-cutter suburbia.But to private equity, it is pay dirt. Blackstone, one of the largest private equity firms, owns 125 homes in Ruskin that it operates as rentals.The financial crisis hit Ruskin hard: Nearly 800 families lost their homes in foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac. But the town is bouncing back. Amazon has opened a giant warehouse and distribution facility in Ruskin that now employs 2,000 people.Across America, private equity firms stormed areas like Ruskin, calculating that the decline in home prices would be relatively short-lived. Ruskin\u2019s long-term economic prospects looked good. And it had many relatively newer homes, which are cheaper for a landlord to maintain.In making such a large investment in housing \u2014 $9 billion buying and renovating mainly foreclosed homes over the last four years \u2014 Blackstone effectively bet on which communities would emerge from the housing crisis as winners.It bet correctly. The firm, which now owns about 50,000 homes in 14 markets, recently reported that the fund holding its Invitation Homes rental subsidiary has generated a 23 percent annualized return for its investors.More broadly, private equity\u2019s investment in housing helped stabilize home prices across the country. The Obama administration supported private investment in foreclosed homes, with Timothy F. Geithner, then the Treasury secretary, remarking in 2011 that it would \u201csupport neighborhood and home price stability.\u201dStill, there has been a cost. Blackstone largely steered clear of more urban communities with older homes, which are more expensive to maintain.LuTanya Garrett, who pays $1,395 a month for a four-bedroom house that Blackstone owns in Ruskin, said she was looking for another home because of the rent. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m going to pay rent like this, I might as well own my own home,\u201d said Ms. Garrett, 47, a mother of three.Nationally, the average rent on an Invitation Homes home is $1,605 a month. The median rent in Ruskin is $1,452, according to Trulia, a listing service.Blackstone says 72 percent of its homes have monthly rents that are within federal affordability guidelines for the markets it operates in.Institutional investors, which collectively have bought more than 200,000 homes across the United States, point out that the rental homes they operate are a small fraction of the more than 15 million rental homes nationwide. Most are owned by small investors.About 3 percent of Blackstone\u2019s rental homes are leased to lower-income tenants with federal housing subsidies known as Section 8 vouchers. The numbers are lower for most other big private equity firms.Blackstone has said it welcomes Section 8 voucher holders, if the federal subsidy is enough to cover the rent. \u201cWe are proud to provide quality housing choices for working families,\u201d said Claire Parker, a spokeswoman for Invitation Homes.Blackstone needs to compete for middle-market renters to serve pension fund investors that have come to expect strong returns. And that leads private equity to focus on suburban communities with relatively few Section 8 voucher holders.Housing advocates argue that large private equity firms investing in rental housing should do more for the communities where they operate. \u201cThe urban areas took a big hit, and they have stayed down,\u201d said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress, a nonprofit that advises communities on dealing with vacant and blighted homes. \u201cThese firms are going into markets which would have recovered anyway.\u201d7 PhotosThere are exceptions, though. Patriarch Properties of Newport Beach, Calif., is one small private equity firm that has set up shop mainly on the South Side of Columbus, Ohio, where abandoned buildings dot the streets, some inhabited by squatters and drug users.For the most part, Columbus has rebounded from the financial crisis. Unemployment is low, and the city is home to companies like Nationwide Insurance and Huntington Bancshares.Patriarch has bought about 260 deteriorated homes on the city\u2019s South Side, an area yet to recover, and is using a combination of investor capital and low-interest loans from a nonprofit to rehabilitate the properties. The firm intends to rent the finished homes to residents, many with Section 8 vouchers, for $500 to $900 a month.\u201dWe are trying to bring up an entire area,\u201d said Ethan Temianka, 32, the founder of Patriarch.But there are questions over whether Patriarch can generate the hefty returns it promised investors.\u201cTheir very presence is a validation that there is a renaissance in the South Side,\u201d said the Rev. John Edgar, who heads Community Development for All People, a nonprofit group already rehabbing homes in Columbus. \u201cBut I am not certain that in the long run the business model is viable.\u201dLes Neuhaus contributed reporting.

Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple\u2019s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.Apple announced:\u25a0 Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.\u25a0 Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.\u25a0 A rebranding of its Mac operating system.\u25a0 An expansion of Apple Pay.\u25a0 Opening up Siri to developers.\u25a0 Improvements in photos and maps.\u25a0 Subscriptions through Apple News.\u25a0 Opening up its messaging service to developers\u25a0 A new interface for Apple Music.Here were the main points:That segmentation suggests Apple\u2019s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.That is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominantFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.The move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)Advertisement"}

Or maybe they seem like the less-remarked-on spread of Western democratic tropes after World War II, so that even a totalitarian state like North Korea holds sham elections to declare its government the people\u2019s will.That seems to be the case, since places like Europe worry about the big computers of Google and Amazon, but not so much about similarly sized systems inside the Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent. The Chinese companies tend to stay inside China.In fact, it may be something newer and more threatening to the state: the triumph not of American values but of algorithmic ones, designed to engage the largest audience, to understand the most about a person and to infer the greatest number of patterns in nature and society in order to exploit them.There is no allegiance to any government, perhaps, but to something we don\u2019t yet understand.

{"Headline": "Goodbye, Old-School Amenities", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byBut the laundry room isn\u2019t the only old-school amenity that is vanishing from New York City apartment buildings, according to developers and building owners and managers. A number of features that were once considered standard in the city\u2019s residential buildings are declining in size and importance, or being phased out altogether, in favor of luxuries like private laundry facilities \u2014 or wine cellars or tween rooms \u2014 in an effort by developers to attract and retain residents.Long relied on by working parents, ravenous teens and anyone with a cup of coffee that\u2019s gone cold, microwaves are essential in many New York homes. Of course, they have their limitations (not the least of which are soggy French fries). And many people have never quite understood, or trusted, how they worked.Now there\u2019s something that\u2019s being touted as an improvement: the speed oven. As its name suggests, it cooks faster than a conventional oven \u2014 roasting a whole chicken in 20 minutes, for example, by ramping up convection heat with an assist from microwave technology. And some speed ovens have a browning setting (for things like French fries) as well as a microwave mode.So these single-purpose rooms are being supplanted by multipurpose lounges, which often have a large flat-screen television or a pull-down screen. One resident might use the space for a meeting; someone else might hold a cocktail party there. And anyone who works from home can take a laptop to the lounge for a change of scenery.Large apartments in New York City have long been equipped with their own washers and dryers \u2014 and the largest have full-fledged laundry rooms that rival those in suburbia. For the rest of the city\u2019s high-rise population, there was the common laundry room, where residents could peruse reading material left behind by their neighbors and trade gossip while waiting for their clothes to dry.But as washers and dryers got smaller and more efficient \u2014 some of them ventless and even merging washing and drying functions in a single unit \u2014 New Yorkers began shoehorning the appliances into their linen closets and under kitchen counters. And for many developers, in-home washers and dryers became the new norm.Of course, common laundry rooms still exist in older buildings, and even new buildings with in-unit washers and dryers often have a basement laundry room with a couple of industrial-size machines to accommodate large loads like comforters or sleeping bags. But as a rule, the common laundry facility is becoming scarce, or a lot smaller.When Anbau guts an old rental building during a condo conversion, the company usually replaces the basement laundry room with one about half the size of the old one. \u201cThe big prewars might have had eight washers and eight dryers,\u201d said Barbara van Beuren, the managing director of acquisitions, design and marketing at Anbau. \u201cWe\u2019ll put in two or three of each.\u201dThe laundry room\u2019s location, just steps from the golf simulators, probably didn\u2019t hurt. More than one resident has surely fit in a few holes before moving a load of towels from the washer to the dryer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s White Guy Problem", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionACCORDING to some prominent voices in the tech world, artificial intelligence presents a looming existential threat to humanity: Warnings by luminaries like Elon Musk and Nick Bostrom about \u201cthe singularity\u201d \u2014 when machines become smarter than humans \u2014 have attracted millions of dollars and spawned a multitude of conferences.But this hand-wringing is a distraction from the very real problems with artificial intelligence today, which may already be exacerbating inequality in the workplace, at home and in our legal and judicial systems. Sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are being built into the machine-learning algorithms that underlie the technology behind many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems that shape how we are categorized and advertised to.This is fundamentally a data problem. Algorithms learn by being fed certain images, often chosen by engineers, and the system builds a model of the world based on those images. If a system is trained on photos of people who are overwhelmingly white, it will have a harder time recognizing nonwhite faces.The reason those predictions are so skewed is still unknown, because the company responsible for these algorithms keeps its formulas secret \u2014 it\u2019s proprietary information. Judges do rely on machine-driven risk assessments in different ways \u2014 some may even discount them entirely \u2014 but there is little they can do to understand the logic behind them.At the very least, this software risks perpetuating an already vicious cycle, in which the police increase their presence in the same places they are already policing (or overpolicing), thus ensuring that more arrests come from those areas. In the United States, this could result in more surveillance in traditionally poorer, nonwhite neighborhoods, while wealthy, whiter neighborhoods are scrutinized even less. Predictive programs are only as good as the data they are trained on, and that data has a complex history.Regardless, algorithmic flaws aren\u2019t easily discoverable: How would a woman know to apply for a job she never saw advertised? How might a black community learn that it were being overpoliced by software?We need to be vigilant about how we design and train these machine-learning systems, or we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.Like all technologies before it, artificial intelligence will reflect the values of its creators. So inclusivity matters \u2014 from who designs it to who sits on the company boards and which ethical perspectives are included. Otherwise, we risk constructing machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society, with its old, familiar biases and stereotypes.If we look at how systems can be discriminatory now, we will be much better placed to design fairer artificial intelligence. But that requires far more accountability from the tech community.

{"Headline": "Online Reviews? Researchers Give Them a Low Rating", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionA small Italian place in a strip mall across the bay from San Francisco, Botto is just a few miles from my house. The other night, I packed up the family and headed off for dinner.The attitude is a little brusque. \u201cWe have no ice, no butter, no ranch, no lemon,\u201d a sign behind the counter warns. \u201cWe charge for bread. We charge for everything.\u201dGive Botto five stars for undermining Yelp. The bistro did not want to be reviewed and let itself be subject to the whims of people with no names but plenty of opinions. But Yelp doesn\u2019t allow businesses to opt out.Some shady outfits try to load the dice by buying favorable reviews, but Botto went in the other direction. It asks people to trash it. When we left, the co-owner and chef, Davide Cerretini, gave me a sticker that said, \u201cI gave Botto one star on Yelp.\u201d If I did that, my next pizza would be half price.The restaurant has been fighting Yelp in earnest for nearly two years now. More than half of its 250 reviews are one-star. Mr. Cerretini seems to enjoy the game. \u201cIt may sound to you like a suicide mission, but our business is up,\u201d he said.If Botto\u2019s critical notices on Yelp are often written to be outrageous and unbelievable (\u201cthe pizza arrived at the table with a dead rat under the cheese\u201d), they also reflect the confused state of reviewing on the internet. Even as researchers are finding that reviews are less reliable, more people are relying on them. On Yelp alone, the number of reviews now exceeds 100 million.But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results.Bart de Langhe, an assistant professor of marketing at Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, used to see numerical reviews online and accept them implicitly. Then, when his son was born three years ago, he needed to buy a car seat. Mr. de Langhe noticed that the seat rated lowest by Consumer Reports got a high rating on Amazon, and the one rated highest by Consumer Reports received a low rating on Amazon.The more popular seat on Amazon was also more expensive. Were reviewers, he wondered, paying more attention to things like price and brand than the objective, measurable ability of the seat to protect its occupant? With two other researchers, Philip Fernbach and Donald Lichtenstein, Mr. de Langhe began a study that compared online reviews for items like air-conditioners and car batteries with the evaluations in Consumer Reports.In other words, the consumer saw a number \u2014 4.6 stars out of 5 \u2014 and took it much more seriously than it merited.Nearly half the time, Amazon reviewers and the Consumer Reports experts disagreed about which item in a random pair was better. Moreover, average user ratings did not predict resale value in the used-product marketplace, another traditional indicator of quality.Julie Law, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said \u201cAmazon customer reviews reflect the feedback, tastes and concerns of real customers, not professional reviewers. That\u2019s what makes them powerful.\u201d She also said the company was now giving more weight to the most recent helpful reviews from purchases that were verified.Mr. de Langhe stuck with this recommendation: \u201cYou should rely much less on reviews than you currently do.\u201dThe store also carried some novels that are either self-published or from small publishers, and these often seemed to receive better ratings than the classics. Tamara Lyon\u2019s \u201cPost-Traumatic Brazilian Wax Syndrome,\u201d in which an interior designer named Bristow Sparks tries to regroup after colliding with a park bench on a first date and suffering other disasters, got 4.7 stars.In an email from Stockholm, where he is now living, Mr. Nasser said the praises were an embarrassment of riches.\u201cHonestly, I wish \u2018Home Is a Fire\u2019 had received more three- and four-star reviews, in order to balance out the final result, because I think the sequel, \u2018The Fire Went Wild,\u2019 is a much better book,\u201d he wrote.In any case, Mr. Nasser said his book was not comparable to the classic books with lower ratings. \u201cAbsolutely not, and I would never imply that in any way,\u201d he said.Although that is exactly what anyone strolling through the store would think. Ms. Law of Amazon said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything here that needs to be fixed.\u201dThe problem with reviews and ratings, said Joseph Reagle Jr., author of \u201cReading the Comments: Likers, Haters and Manipulators at the Bottom of the Web,\u201d is that we have elevated them to supreme importance.\u201cThey have always been somewhat subjective, arbitrary, capricious, befuddling, and bemusing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what\u2019s different is that we forget this is the case, particularly given the sheen of big data and quantification.\u201dSix months or so after Botto Bistro began trolling Yelp, the review site blinked. While it did not bend on the restaurant \u2014 a Yelp spokeswoman said Botto was simply cheating itself out of customers \u2014 the site reportedly began exploring offers to sell itself.So does Botto. If you dig on Yelp, you will find reviewers who said they genuinely were not impressed, which is about where I fell. An adequate pizza, a good salad and a beer were $46, not including the minimum \u201csuggested gratuity\u201d of 18 percent \u2014 which, considering this is a place where you set your own table and pick up your food from the counter, was rather aggressive.I\u2019d write a review saying all this, but I doubt it would do any good.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just How \u2018Smart\u2019 Do You Want Your Blender to Be?", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFirst WordsIn the land rush to digitize the world, the home is the new frontier. Over the past few years, practically every household item within reach has been technologically upgraded and rendered \u201csmart\u201d: toothbrushes, cutlery, baby monitors, refrigerators, thermostats, slow cookers, sprinkler systems, sex toys, even the locks in doors. Before they achieved enlightenment, they could perform only their rote, mechanical duties; now they can do so while connected to the internet. In the case of the telephone, this has been nothing short of revolutionary, but no other \u201csmart\u201d object has managed to replicate its success. The absurdity of the phenomenon was made unavoidably apparent in May, when a start-up unveiled a \u201csmart tampon,\u201d called my.Flow. If women wear the my.Flow and the sensor that attaches to the tampon by a string (and clips neatly onto your waistband) and use the my.Flow app, they could now, at last, track their periods\u2019 duration and flow.\u201cSmart\u201d has been slapped onto everything from cups (that analyze what you\u2019re drinking) to surfboards (that let you check your text messages between waves) to clothing (that tracks calorie expenditure). The word is flattering to both the objects and their users, even as it threatens to become a hazy banality.The vogue for \u201csmart\u201d traces at least as far back as the \u201csmart bomb,\u201d precision-\u00adguided munitions made to be more accurate than the dumb bombs of wars past, which tumbled out of planes and exploded wherever they happened to land. Smart bombs were first used in Vietnam, but during the Persian Gulf war, they became media stars, with generals and news anchors presenting footage of the weapons in action, until the moment the screen went to static as the bombs obliterated their internal cameras along with the target. Much like that well-\u00adtimed static, the \u201csmart\u201d in \u201csmart bomb\u201d does some ideological work, masking the inherent violence and mayhem of aerial bombing. A smart bomb is an unerring one. It adds an aura of sensible technocratic efficiency to an inherently messy, bloody affair, occluding the simple fact that bombs are horrific creations.It also conceals a basic oddity: The word \u201csmart\u201d has roots in a Proto-\u00adGermanic word for pain. It wasn\u2019t until the 20th century, in North America, that \u201csmart\u201d came to be synonymous with brains. Smart bombs combine both meanings of the word, mingling intelligence and harm. Better accuracy may save lives on the margins, but it doesn\u2019t make us consider all the political choices leading up to the decision to kill people half a world away.When applied to the latest consumer gadgets, \u201csmart\u201d performs a similar sleight of hand; what is presented as an upgrade is actually a stealthy euphemism for \u201csurveillance.\u201d While a \u201csmart\u201d lighting system promises to adapt to an owner\u2019s preferences or help the environment by lowering electricity bills, what it also does is provide a company a permanent foothold in a person\u2019s home from which he can be monitored. That smart-\u00adlighting company knows when the owner of its product comes home, when he goes, when he dims the lights for a date and when he leaves them on.The intelligence given to these devices really serves twin purposes: information collection and control. Smart devices are constantly collecting information, tracking user habits, trying to anticipate and shape their owners\u2019 behaviors and reporting back to the corporate mother ship. Data is our era\u2019s most promising extractive resource, and tech companies have found that connecting more people and devices, collecting information on how they interact with one another and then using that information to sell advertising can be enormously profitable.And so the makers of smart devices encourage us to make their creations smarter by confessing more to them, by exposing more of ourselves. As we open our lives to increasingly self-\u00adaware, autonomous devices, we are encouraged \u2014 particularly in the case of all-\u00adpurpose personal assistants like Siri and Alexa \u2014 to use them as much as possible, feeding them more useful data that will allow our gadgets to \u201clearn\u201d who we are and what we like, and to make decisions that might anticipate our needs.Using a smart device for anything but the purposes explicitly sanctioned by its manufacturer risks violating a warranty, bricking a device or even breaking the law. (It\u2019s fitting, albeit a touch melodramatic, that unauthorized tinkering with an iPhone is called \u201cjailbreaking.\u201d) The very same elements making these things smart \u2014 connectivity, sophisticated software, semiautonomous intelligence \u2014 can also make them more frustrating than any devices we\u2019ve ever seen.At its most expansive, \u201csmart\u201d produces a world where we no longer exert control over objects we\u2019ve bought from corporations, but corporations exert control over us through things we pay for the privilege of using. And when \u201csmart\u201d is crudely applied to the cities we live in \u2014 to our crumbling infrastructure and militarized police forces \u2014 we give in to forces of privatization, algorithmic control and rule by corporate contract. It seems an indelible symbol of the times that New York City neglects essential but mundane services like public restrooms while promoting other putative municipal innovations, like the mass conversion of pay phones to Wi-Fi kiosks. As with other smart devices, which subsidize their costs with data collection, these kiosks are free \u2014 provided you submit to the collection of your personal information and location data. The commons becomes simply another site for private companies to spy on people.Whether it\u2019s the routes we drive, the songs we listen to or the prices we pay for airline tickets, our lives are increasingly shaped by opaque systems that assess and sort us according to inscrutable criteria. Every one of these systems is, in some sense, \u201csmart.\u201d But that label elides the more important judgment of where power lies and how it operates. A smart tampon may provide some useful information, but many women simply need better access to health services, and laws that preserve their ability to control their reproductive lives. Fitness trackers might help some folks, but they have also become favored tools of insurers and corporate wellness plans while doing nothing to address the underlying causes of obesity. Self-\u00addriving cars represent a potentially lifesaving innovation, but they are increasingly cast as replacements for embattled mass-\u00adtransit systems that millions of people rely on. Amid the ritual enumeration of tech specs and price points, we risk ignoring how smart devices represent another example of consumer capitalism\u2019s bulldozing past political questions.One of the animating myths of American capitalism is that of the savvy consumer. Informed, discriminating, wise to manipulation and deceit, this person fluidly navigates the waters of everyday consumption. And through these small decisions, replicated over and over again by millions of others, the free market improves life for all. Essential to this myth is the notion that influence and power work transparently. Experience shows that this isn\u2019t the case, yet we continue to flatter ourselves by adorning our bodies, homes and cities with smart gadgetry and claiming that it serves us. Perhaps the real smarts on display here are those of the tech-\u00adindustry mandarins who convinced us that we needed all this stuff in the first place.Jacob Silverman is the author of \u201cTerms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain to Leave Europe for a Lie", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 I have been overcome by gloom since Britain voted to leave the European Union. It\u2019s not just the stupidity of the decision. It\u2019s not merely the lies of the charlatans who led the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign. It\u2019s not only the absence, now so evident, of any \u201cNextit.\u201d It\u2019s not even the betrayal of British youth. It\u2019s far more: a personal loss. Europa, however flawed, was the dream of my generation. The European Union was an entity, a bloodless noun, yet it had a beating heart.Riding a European train, gazing at the lines of swaying poplars, the villages huddled around their church spires, it was often impossible, at least for me, not to look past the tranquility to the blood-seeped soil and the tens of millions who gave their lives in Europe\u2019s collective suicides. Well, as the Germans say, we had the blessing of late birth; and the duty inherent in that blessing was to build a united Europe.Covering the European Parliament from 1980 to 1982, I would drive down from Brussels to Strasbourg. The Parliament was a bit of a farce. Unwieldy bundles of documents translated into Europe\u2019s many languages were carted back and forth. Yet, in its cumbersome way, the Parliament embodied something important: the hard trade-offs of European construction, union conjured from Babel.When I moved to Italy, with its large Communist Party and spasms of political violence, I would hear how \u201cscaling the Alps\u201d into the core of Europe was critical to the country\u2019s stability. The E.U. was insurance against the worst. For Mediterranean countries like Spain and Portugal that emerged from dictatorship in the 1970s it was something close to salvation.Memories: feckless Europe at the time of the Bosnian war and the thirst, nonetheless, of the small nations reborn in Yugoslavia\u2019s death to join the European Union and escape the bloody Balkan gyre. Watching Germany move its capital back to Berlin from Bonn in 1999 and thinking, the German question is solved and Europe is home free! Driving, when I lived in Berlin, into Poland and pinching myself to recall the unspeakable suffering overcome by German-Polish reconciliation as Poland prepared for E.U. membership.No miracle was ever so dull. Britain tended to see the E.U. in prosaic terms: It had not been delivered from ignominy or tyranny by European integration. Still, it gave the union heft, a free-market prod, a universal language and its second-largest economy. It was that recalcitrant member any good club needs.Sure, the challenges mounted. The 30-year postwar economic miracle ended \u2014 and with it full employment. The Franco-German balance at the heart of the union collapsed. German dominance stirred unease. The creation of a single currency, the euro, was bungled. The admission of former Communist states spurred large migrant movements. The European welfare state was strained. Resentments multiplied.Technology accelerated globalization, pulling hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in Asia but also offshoring millions of European jobs. Societies disaggregated. For each City honcho getting a daily Christmas delivery from Amazon Prime there was some poor sod out there in Nowheresville working a precarious warehouse night shift packaging stuff.Boris Johnson understood, in his scurrilous way, that the E.U. had become a perfect scapegoat for Western societies beset by the dilemmas of modernity. Opposed to Brexit early this year, he became its chief advocate, playing on every base instinct. Brexit was a tool, a plaything, never a principle. If he looks so glum in triumph it is because the adrenalin has run out.There will be no extra $470 million for the National Health Service from European Union savings, after all. Immigration is not about to fall. Some of the regions that voted for Brexit are also those that get the most funds from Brussels. \u201cThere is now no need for haste,\u201d Johnson says. Oh, really? \u201cWe are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans,\u201d he says. Oh, please!If Johnson becomes prime minister in the fall, he will be an unelected leader, just like all those \u201cunaccountable\u201d high rollers in Brussels. When he tries to extricate Britain from the union, he will face a hostile Parliament. Last time I checked, Britain was a parliamentary, not direct, democracy. So perhaps there is still hope. If words mean their opposite, as they do in Johnson\u2019s mouth, anything is possible. Europa is worth a fight.The union, for all its failings, did not deserve to be betrayed by a huckster. It will not die because of this imbecilic vote, but something broke \u2014 a form of optimism about humankind, the promise of 1989.My children will not inherit the Europe I hoped for. I look at my hands and see my father\u2019s emerging, the veins now more pronounced. Life feels diminished. Some things are unavoidable. This was not.Advertisement"}

The former Cleveland Cavaliers basketball coach David Blatt once said: \u201cWe\u2019re in Cleveland. Nothing is easy here.\u201d Then he got fired.Sunday night Cleveland came back from a three-games-to-one deficit to beat Golden State and win the N.B.A. championship. I was born in Cleveland, my father was born in Cleveland, my children were born in Cleveland, and we\u2019ve all seen many, many losing teams \u2014 52 years\u2019 worth, if you\u2019re counting. And we\u2019re counting here in Cleveland. The last time Cleveland won a championship was the 1964 National Football League Championship. My dad took me. I was in Section 18, Row T, Seat 8 of Municipal Stadium.My kids moved away from Cleveland. Maybe, like King James, they will come back. I have one son temporarily sleeping here. There\u2019s hope. It\u2019s sometimes hard to find jobs here, it\u2019s not particularly trendy here, it\u2019s frequently gray, but there are some major pluses: no traffic jams, cheap houses, a great art museum and orchestra and coconut bars (a local Jewish delicacy).In 2012, two years after James left Cleveland for South Beach, I played a gig (I have a klezmer band) at a relative\u2019s bat mitzvah in Atlanta. I played music for the hora for a few minutes until the D.J. cued up a sappy recording of \u201cHava Nagila\u201d that drowned me out.

He\u2019s from Cleveland and all he can think about, still, is Cleveland.\u201dWhen I got home from Atlanta, I decided to buy the book and ship it to the guest, via Amazon, as a gift, with a note: \u201cFrom \u2018Uncle Bert\u2019 in Cleveland.\u201dI didn\u2019t even get a thank you. A Midwesterner would write a thank you, I figured. I thought about writing, \u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace to Cleveland!\u201d Instead, I messaged, \u201cYou get the LeBron book I sent you?\u201dHe messaged right back: \u201cI had no idea you were the one that sent me the book! I remember you as Julie\u2019s Uncle Bert and the note with the book said it was from Al.\u201d (My legal name is Albert, and apparently the small-print \u201cFrom Uncle Bert\u201d note was overshadowed by my name and address.)

He translates perfectly what it means to be both Jewish and a Cleveland sports fan. I actually highlighted portions of the book that I will go back and read during the next heartbreak to help me get through.\u201dNo need to re-read, Cleveland fans. I\u2019ve got to tell my father the news. The problem is he has been dead for 30 years. The newest T-shirt in town is \u201cBelieveland, Ohio.\u201d I\u2019ll try that on. Hi, Dad!

They say that Y.A. lacks moral ambiguity; that it is too dark; that it doesn\u2019t depict empowered female sexuality; that it is populated by fields of sparkly vampires; that it sprang fully formed from the head of John Green.Nice try, reductive grown-ups. The only overarching thing that characterizes young adult literature is the age of the protagonist. Y.A. is sometimes fluffy, sometimes fanged, sometimes hot, sometimes cool. Its writers\u2019 voices are punk rock and hip-hop and symphonic and fizzy-poppy. As these summer fiction possibilities prove, Y.A. books can be as different from one another as Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin is from Blind Lemon Jefferson.\u201cEvery Exquisite Thing\u201d is guilty of the \u201cnot like other girls\u201d trope \u2014 the notion that while most girls are predictable and icky, this one has complex dreams and emotions that make her special. And since the other girls in \u201cEvery Exquisite Thing\u201d are vapid, undifferentiated, peach-schnapps-swilling sexpots, no wonder Nanette is a singular creation who\u2019d rather hang with dudes who tell her to read dude authors.The plots of \u201cEvery Exquisite Thing\u201d and \u201cThe Bubblegum Reaper\u201d parallel each other; both are about ambiguity and not being able to look to adults or convention for guidance on how to live a meaningful life. But Quick sometimes seems to mock Nanette\u2019s pain and pretensions in a way that feels meanspirited. \u201cI like listening to music and reading poetry and novels,\u201d she tells her friend Shannon. \u201cI like seeing art house films. I like having philosophical discussions as I look up at a hunter\u2019s moon.\u201d Shannon replies, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re just a snob, Nanette.\u201d Maybe she is. But the universe Quick has built for her doesn\u2019t offer an alternative.Unlike Nanette, Scarlett is self-aware and mouthy, snarkily alert to the class divide in her suburban New Jersey town, where her family can\u2019t afford all the extras her classmates take for granted and she is used to being made fun of \u201cfor wearing thrift-store clothes (they weren\u2019t cool yet), bringing weird wholesale Sam\u2019s Club chocolate milk to lunch unlike everybody else\u2019s normal Nesquiks, and the million other tiny indicators kids can sniff out poorness with.\u201d She adores her best friend, Ave, but wishes Ave were more assertive. \u201cIf Ave had invented fire, she\u2019d introduce it to the Cro-Magnons by whispering, \u2018Um, hey, I made this thing, it\u2019s kinda cool, it might be sorta helpful for our continued evolution, if that makes any sense.\u2019\u200a\u201d Scarlett is annoyed at herself for her crush on Gideon, who acts like a jerk with the popular boys instead of living his best life as the stand-up-comedy nerd he is in his soul. When Scarlett sees him in school the day after he and his posse have trashed her feminist, pot-smoking neighbor\u2019s garden, she has no idea what to say. \u201cI freeze helplessly, torn between wanting to yell at him about his cisgender white male sense of entitlement and whisper to him that he smells like pine needles and dreams.\u201d Relatable.Alas, many of Scarlett\u2019s references don\u2019t sound very kidlike (\u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d? \u201cThe Wire\u201d? \u00adReclaimed-wood tables? Flipping through Redbook in a waiting room?), and the plot is, to be charitable, shaky. A character dies solely to advance the protagonist\u2019s emotional arc. Feh. But Scarlett\u2019s goofy, cranky voice is fun nonetheless.Zentner\u2019s great achievement \u2014 particularly impressive for a first novel \u2014 is to make us believe three such different people could be friends. He also manages to blend a dank, oppressive, Flannery O\u2019Connor-esque sense of place with humor and optimism. I particularly looked forward to Travis\u2019s passionate narration as he pretends he\u2019s in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-like world. (Having dinner at Lydia\u2019s well-stocked house, he composes in his head: \u201cThe harvest was good that year in Raynar Northbrook\u2019s lands, and they feasted often on the heavy oaken table that sat in his great hall. He called for bread and meat until he was sated.\u201d)The characters narrate their own chapters, which makes for some wild shifts in tone. The unredeemable monstrousness of Dill\u2019s and Travis\u2019s fathers may prove hard for some readers to take, and a senseless, drug-\u00adfueled tragedy may seem over the top. But I adored all three of these characters and the way they talked to and loved one another.The book\u2019s vivid California-ness \u2014 avocado trees and warm air and concrete \u2014 along with Thomas\u2019s out-and-proud gayness (\u201cRemember we are orchids in a forest of carnations,\u201d he texts) and Naoki\u2019s sparkly air-sprite energy reminded me a bit of Francesca Lia Block\u2019s classic \u201990s Y.A. novel \u201cWeetzie Bat.\u201d But Monty\u2019s voice is far more sardonic than Weetzie\u2019s. \u201cThe sky was that pulsing electric blue that it is here,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt\u2019s this unforgettable, I\u2019m-so-blue-it-hurts blue that I\u2019ve always found kind of ridiculous.

Anyway, today I wasn\u2019t really minding it.\u201d\u201cSaving Montgomery Sole\u201d has the assured tone and meandering plot of Tamaki\u2019s strange and lovely graphic novel \u201cThis One Summer\u201d (illustrated by Jillian Tamaki, who is her cousin and the illustrator of the Book Review\u2019s By the Book feature). Both books deal with inchoate rage and anxiety. Monty loves her two moms and her friends, but the presence of a homophobic right-wing preacher in town has her on edge, and being surrounded by teenagers who aren\u2019t as enlightened as her immediate circle makes her furious. \u201cI could feel my brain filling up with angry bits, piling up like Ho Ho wrappers on a binge day,\u201d she says. \u201cLike homework on a Sunday.\u201d There\u2019s no big revelation, no epiphany. The mystery of the amulet is never solved. Readers who find this maddening are not the right readers for this book.The three play in dives and eat junk food (the beef-\u00adflavored chips \u201chad a taste that I would categorize as like a locker room, but for dogs\u201d) and sleep wherever they can (\u201cMotel 6 is where you go if you\u2019ve been \u00adevicted from your home and you need a place to do the meth that you just stole from the corpse of a prostitute,\u201d Ash \u00adpronounces) and meet lovely and scary people and have romantic interludes.What \u201cThe Haters\u201d excels at is describing music. Here\u2019s how Andrews captures terrible improv jazz: \u201cThe trombones were botching goofball quotations like \u2018Flight of the Bumblebee\u2019 and then signaling surrender with sheepish atonal elephant noises. And each of the saxophone solos was basically the equivalent of the small talk that you are forced to make with the friend of your mom who cuts your hair.\u201d And, helpfully for many readers, \u201cif you don\u2019t know music, just know that if the band is playing in F but you\u2019re playing in E, it\u2019s going to sound simultaneously very whimsical and very horrible. It\u2019s basically a horror movie starring the Muppets.\u201dWhat \u201cThe Haters\u201d does not excel at is girls. Ash is, shall we say, a poorly developed character. And there\u2019s a scene in which she is uncomfortably in the room while a \u00adcomic-relief white hippie girl has several rounds of sex with a semiconscious Wes. (In the morning, when Wes is sober, Ash tells him, \u201cYou were just lying there murmuring, Please, no, and she was ordering you around in broken Spanish.\u201d) Not funny. But a lot in the book is.This is a novel for readers unafraid of science. There\u2019s talk of fractals, wormholes, black holes, the G\u00f6del metric (\u201ca solution to the E=MC\u00b2 equation that \u2018proves\u2019 the past still exists\u201d), Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, string theory. Physics provides metaphors for loss, confusion and love. But there\u2019s humor, too, including terrible band names (Gottie\u2019s brother is a glam rocker) worthy of \u201cThe Haters\u201d: Fingerband, Synthmoan de Beauvoir, Jurassic Parkas. There are funny German words and delicious baked goods and crazy \u00adoutfits.And Thomas is wonderful. When he tells Gottie how sorry he is about Grey\u2019s death, \u201cit\u2019s the first time someone\u2019s hugged me since Oma and Opa, at Christmas. I stand there, made out of elbows. .\u2008.\u2008. But after a moment, I wrap myself around him. It\u2019s a hug like warm cinnamon cake, and I sink into it.\u201d Later: \u201cHis kiss interrupts me, sudden-short-sweet. Unquestionable. It feels like reading a favorite book, and falling for the ending even though you already know what happens.\u201dThe book is too long and has entirely too many physics analogies. But the delectable romance and the moment when past, present and future all come together and semi-solve the mysteries of Gottie\u2019s time travel make the journey worthwhile.Dolssa is an 18-year-old girl who has a Song of Songs-like relationship with God. \u201cHe caught me up on wings of light, and showed me the realms of his creation, the glittering gemstones paving his heaven,\u201d she says. \u201cHe left my body weak and spent, my spirit gorged with honey.\u201d The friars do not look kindly on this kind of talk. But Dolssa (miraculously?) escapes being thrown into the flames and winds up in the seaside village of Bajas. There she\u2019s cared for by three sisters who run a tavern and supplement their income by whoring (the oldest), fortunetelling (the youngest) and matchmaking (the middle sister). It turns out Dolssa can perform healing miracles. But an obsessed friar is tracking her through the countryside with near-\u00adsexual fixation, interviewing prostitutes as well as Jews and small-town clergymen about whether they\u2019ve seen her.The language is gorgeous and evocative without seeming to try too hard. You practically smell the sea and taste the foamy ale. The characters have clearly \u00addifferentiated voices; Dolssa sounds fancy and stilted for much of the book, while the sisters sound like the funny, earthy wenches they are. I cried partly because of the matter-of-fact kindness of the sisters \u2014 they care for others because it\u2019s the moral thing to do \u2014 and partly because of the parallels to our country now. There\u2019s a difference between being Christ-like and using Christ\u2019s name to oppress others, to silence women and persecute immigrants. I\u2019m not sure how big an audience there is for a book like this. But I found it magnificent.Maya, a princess in Bharata, is rescued by a mysterious man named Amar. He smells of \u201cmint and smoke, cardamom and wood.\u201d He can\u2019t tell Maya who he is until the new moon, but he\u2019s obviously trustworthy, because he says things like \u201cI want to lie beside you and know the weight of your dreams.\u201d He tells her, \u201cCome with me and you shall be an empress with the moon for your throne and constellations to wear in your hair.\u201d \u00adMy \u00adteenage-demigoth self would have swooned.Marjorie Ingall is a columnist at Tablet and the author of the forthcoming nonfiction book \u201cMamaleh Knows Best.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "When Aaron Vincent Elkaim reached the Xingu River basin in Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amazon rain forest in 2014, he found a lush and humid green expanse that made him feel as if he were infinitesimally small, living \u00e2\u0080\u009cinside a single giant organism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The region is one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most biologically and ethnically diverse areas, home to about 25,000 indigenous people, many of whom live as their ancestors did in close relationship to the land.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was eye-opening to see what it\u2019s like to live in a mostly preindustrial world where people live off of the environment and are mostly content with work, family and a traditional identity connected to the land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said It is a way of life under threat.The Belo Monte dam, under construction on the Xingu, will soon be the third-largest hydroelectric complex in the world in terms of output. When completed, it will provide energy for Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urban boom and fuel further industrialization of the Amazon basin. The Belo Monte is just one of scores of dams that the government has planned for the rivers of the Amazon rain forest to propel the growth of Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.Although plans for the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex started in 1975, construction was delayed until 2011 because of fierce and persistent protests by several of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 16 indigenous tribes. The original project was changed so that tribal lands would not be directly flooded. But nearby forests where they hunted would be submerged, and the dam will most likely affect water levels and drinkability, transportation and fishing. Many Brazilians whose family roots in the area date to a century ago, when it had a booming rubber industry, are also affected. They mostly live off the land and still depend on fishing and tapping their own rubber trees. The story of the dam and its effects on the environment result in the kind of slow, subtle photo essay that is expensive to do and hard to fund. Mr. Elkaim recently received a $20,000 Alexia Foundation grant, which will enable him to pursue the story for the next year.His rain forest images will be displayed at the Look3 Photo Festival in Charlottesvile, Va., from June 13 to 19 as a part of an exhibit celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Alexia Foundation. Curated by Mike Davis, the exhibit will also include Mary Calvert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on homeless female veterans who have survived sexual trauma in the military.  This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exhibits also include work by Nick Brandt, Graciela Iturbide, Yuri Kozyrev and Frans Lanting as well as Olivia Bee, Sheila Pree Bright, Binh Danh and Radcliffe Roye, known as Ruddy. The festival also includes two daylong seminars for  emerging and midcareer photographers.Even before the Belo Monte dam project, the surrounding area had been severely damaged by the clearing of forests by outsiders for cattle grazing.While the tribal protests helped change the original plan for the hydroelectric complex, a new dam is planned nearby on the Tapaj\u00c3\u00b3s River. Mr. Elkaim recently spent time there with the Munduruku tribe, who are fighting to stop that dam. They have recently delayed construction by getting their territory officially recognized by the government as indigenous land. When Mr. Elkaim returned to the area around the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex earlier this year, even those people still protesting seemed resigned to the dam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impending effects on their environment and way of life. While this story may be too nuanced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and remote \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to inspire headlines in North America, Mr. Elkaim says he thinks it is critical because it is typical of what he sees as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgutting\u00e2\u0080\u009d of ecosystems around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to protect the people whose entire way of life, identity and culture are dependent upon these ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we protect their way of life, they will protect the environment around them.\u00e2\u0080\u009dJames Estrin, the co-editor of Lens, will be participating in the educational programs on June 15 at the Look3 festival.

{"Headline": "And if Elected: What President Trump Could or Couldn\u2019t Do", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUnder the principle of separation of powers, the president shares power with Congress and the judiciary. The party system, the press and American political traditions may constrain him as well. But what would this mean in practice if Mr. Trump wins?It depends on what Mr. Trump wants to do. His signature issues are immigration and trade. He could not build the Mexican wall without congressional support. But he could order immigration authorities to deport unauthorized immigrants.And he could bar Muslims from entering the country under existing law, which authorizes him to bar classes of aliens whose entry he determines \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be the first time: President Ronald Reagan cited this law, as well as his inherent constitutional powers, to block a flood of Haitian migrants from pouring into United States territory in 1981.Can he slap tariffs on China, as he has threatened? Yes, he can. Congress has delegated to the president the power to retaliate against foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices like dumping, leaving it to the president and trade officials to determine what that means. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs on China and other countries for what many observers considered political reasons.The World Trade Organization ruled the steel tariffs illegal in that case. But Mr. Trump could simply ignore its judgment, and indeed withdraw the United States from the W.T.O., just as President Bush withdrew the United States from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002. While he\u2019s at it, Mr. Trump could tear up the North Atlantic Treaty, which created NATO, an organization that he has called \u201cobsolete.\u201dIn wielding executive power in these ways, Mr. Trump would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Bush cited his commander in chief powers in order to justify interrogation, surveillance and detention polices in the wake of Sept. 11. While Mr. Obama has shied away from Mr. Bush\u2019s constitutional arguments, he has interpreted statutes aggressively, while also relying on constitutional authorities, to justify the military intervention in Libya in 2011 and his nonenforcement of immigration laws.He could direct the Department of Justice to investigate his critics by prioritizing categories of crimes they may have committed. Political opponents could be accused of campaign finance law violations. Former government officials, like Hillary Clinton, could be accused of violating secrecy laws. Even if the charges come to nothing, the legal fees for defendants will be hefty.Mr. Trump could also crack down on journalists who report on national security issues by enforcing federal secrecy laws more aggressively than previous presidents. President Obama received a lot of criticism for prosecuting government employees who leaked secrets, but the Justice Department did not bring charges against the journalists who published the leaked information.What couldn\u2019t Mr. Trump do? He couldn\u2019t lower (or raise) taxes on his own. He\u2019s supposed to spend funds that Congress appropriates and for the things that Congress appropriates them for \u2014 that\u2019s what stands in the way of the wall (unless he persuades Mexico to pay for it and construct it on the other side of the border).What, then, stands between us and a nearly unbounded Mr. Trump, aside from the next election? Senators McCain and McConnell say Congress, but only a veto-proof majority in both houses, passing new laws, could stop Mr. Trump from exercising the legal authority that Congress has already given the president. Congress can threaten to withhold funds, but the president\u2019s powers to veto legislation and appoint government officers give him a large bargaining chip. Removal of a president by impeachment is extremely difficult; it has never happened.The courts are another barrier, but they would need to reverse their longstanding practice of deferring to the president in matters of foreign affairs and domestic regulation. The Supreme Court could, for example, declare an entry bar on Muslims unconstitutional. But it\u2019s hard to predict how Mr. Trump would respond. After a federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, ruled against him on a motion in the long-running Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump called him a \u201chater\u201d and a \u201cMexican\u201d (Judge Curiel is an American).To make things happen, Mr. Trump will need to get loyalists into leadership positions of the agencies, but to do so, he will need the cooperation of the Senate (or he will need to aggressively exploit his recess appointment powers). Moreover, the small number of politically appointed leaders enjoy only limited control of the mass of civil servants. These employees can drag their feet, leak to the press, threaten to resign and employ other tactics to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives if they object to them. They\u2019re also hard to fire, thanks to Civil Service protections.But Mr. Trump can fight back. He can appoint loyalists not only to political positions in the executive branch, but to the courts, and he may be able to attract them to the ranks of the Civil Service. And while executive branch officials who disregard the law might be prosecuted by the Justice Department, President Trump would have one more trick up his sleeve. Like President George H.W. Bush, who rescued Iran-contra defendants from punishment in 1992, he could hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards in the form of the pardon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Post Is Latest News Outlet Barred by Trump", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byBarring journalists is an almost unheard-of practice for a modern presidential candidate. The Post is the latest major news organization that Mr. Trump has barred from his rallies and events this year, following Politico, BuzzFeed News, The Huffington Post and others.In a Facebook post on Monday, Mr. Trump accused The Post of \u201cincredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting\u201d and deemed it \u201cphony and dishonest,\u201d although he has granted frequent interviews to the paper\u2019s editors and reporters in the past.It was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement meant he would end all his communications with Post journalists.

Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post, issued a statement on Monday calling Mr. Trump\u2019s action \u201cnothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press.\u201d\u201cWhen coverage doesn\u2019t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished,\u201d Mr. Baron wrote, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s practice. \u201cThe Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along \u2014 honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically and unflinchingly.\u201dThe Trump campaign cited the Post headline in a statement, adding: \u201cWe no longer feel compelled to work with a publication which has put its need for \u2018clicks\u2019 above journalistic integrity.\u201d The campaign added: \u201cMr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.\u201dJournalists without credentials can attend Trump events by obtaining tickets available to the general public. But a Politico reporter, Ben Schreckinger, said he was ejected from a Trump rally in California earlier this month by a campaign staff member and a private security guard. Mr. Schreckinger, like other Politico reporters, had been denied credentials to that event.Nick Corasaniti and Sydney Ember contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Liberal Return Policies for Consumers Can Reduce Retail Workers\u2019 Pay", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byEarnestine Gay, a longtime worker in the fragrance department at Macy\u2019s in Herald Square, clearly remembers a bottle of perfume that was returned recently. It was practically empty.\u201cThere was maybe a spray left,\u201d Ms. Gay, 50, said.Yet Ms. Gay knew that the bottle, bought weeks earlier, would probably lower her commission because it would count against her sales for that week.The perfume\u2019s return was not terribly unusual. These days, people are returning goods in record numbers, and often in worse condition, encouraged by the flexible return policies adopted by e-commerce sites like Amazon and the brick-and-mortar stores trying to keep pace.But unlike returns at online retailers, those at many department stores have a side effect: They can unexpectedly lower a worker\u2019s paycheck weeks or months after a sale is made.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking, \u2018This is my income for the week,\u2019 and then you find out a month later, \u2018Oh that wasn\u2019t my income at all,\u2019 you have to plan pretty far into the future,\u201d said Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York.Some of the country\u2019s leading department stores allow returns for up to one year, like Nordstrom, or set no time limit at all, like Macy\u2019s. The commissions paid to sales representatives at Macy\u2019s can be affected by returns made within six months, while returns at Nordstrom affect workers for up to a year.These windows, union leaders say, are too long and fuel a culture of returns that has added instability to the paychecks of retail workers.\u201cMacy\u2019s used to have a 10-day return policy,\u201d said Ken Bordieri, president of Local 1-S, which represents Macy\u2019s workers in New York, one of the largest organized groups of the retailer\u2019s workers in the country. Macy\u2019s eliminated its time limit on returns, which had been six months, in 2010.\u201cWhen you have a return policy that says \u2018We\u2019ll take anything back anytime,\u2019 well, then returns go up,\u201d Mr. Bordieri said.The union, which provided the statements and arranged for the interview with Ms. Gay, says that changing the return policy is among its top priorities as it negotiates with Macy\u2019s for a new contract by Wednesday.In an email, a Macy\u2019s spokesman, Jim Sluzewski, called the company\u2019s return policy \u201cfair and equitable\u201d to employees. A spokeswoman for Nordstrom, Tara Darrow, said in an email that \u201cwe provide our employees with a commission agreement when they are hired that explains how we calculate commissions, and they can always get a copy of the commission agreement.\u201dFor decades, department stores have used commission as a way to motivate employees. Hone your sales skills, help customers and you, too, can share in the rewards. Returned merchandise has also long counted against an employee\u2019s sales, which are used to calculate commission.Such policies help protect retailers from some legitimate concerns. For example, it prevents an employee from trying to game the system by selling a product to a friend, knowing the product will be returned after a commission is paid. Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said companies\u2019 commission policies can help stop employees from overselling products that consumers would be more likely to bring back anyway.\u201cIt may create a distortion over a period of time,\u201d he said of the variable paychecks. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the sales associate is being compensated for their net sales, and that is a typical practice.\u201dStill, the surge of returns has changed the dynamic. Online retailers, many of which have made generous return policies a prime selling point to shoppers \u2014 and which do not pay employees based on commissions \u2014 have led the push. Amazon, the world\u2019s largest virtual merchant, and many other e-commerce sites offer flexible and sometimes free returns.\u201cOnline-only retailers have conditioned consumers to be able to touch and feel products and then return them if they change their minds, hassle-free,\u201d Kevon Hills, vice president for research at StellaService, a customer research firm, said in an email.\u201cIt is becoming best practice,\u201d Mr. Hills said, \u201cfor retailers that want to provide consumers with the best possible experience to allow this same ability to take products home and make a final decision at a later point in time.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s pressure on them to take these things back, but you can\u2019t charge that back against the workers,\u201d said Mr. Bordieri, the union local president.Worker advocates have had some success in changing return policies. In 2012, union leaders in New York pressured Bloomingdale\u2019s, which is owned by Macy\u2019s, to reduce the time employees could be affected by returns to 150 days from 180 days, and then to 120 days last year, according to a copy of the labor contract reviewed by The New York Times.These return policies have taken on added meaning as department stores have cut jobs and increasingly relied on part-time workers with less control over their own schedules, and therefore income, labor advocates say.\u201cI have two sons that I was proud to raise while I was at Macy\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Gay said. \u201cThank God they\u2019re old now, because I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.\u201dDepartment stores employed 1.3 million workers as of May, the smallest number in a decade and 10 percent fewer than in 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Mr. Sluzewski, the Macy\u2019s spokesman, said that Macy\u2019s employees had \u201cthe opportunity to make their own schedules, within some guidelines that ensure that our stores are well staffed\u201d during the busiest shopping periods. He noted that the company\u2019s scheduling processes had been praised in the past by worker advocates.Ms. Darrow, of Nordstrom, said in an email that the company had increased its reliance on full-time workers and that some return policies \u2014 like buy online, return in-store \u2014 could actually benefit employees by creating an \u201copportunity to serve a customer on the spot and potentially make a sale.\u201dBut many employees still complain that return policies have become so lax as to encourage people to essentially borrow products, maybe for a one-time event like a vacation or a party.In 2011 and 2013, Ms. Luce, the CUNY professor, surveyed hundreds of retail workers as part of two separate studies, and said that many said that they felt return policies had gotten too lax. While she cautioned that the studies did not include enough commissioned workers to identify statistical trends, there were some repeat complaints.\u201cWe were pretty consistently hearing that for workers who had been in the industry for 10 or more years, they felt that first, your commission rates are smaller, and that this returns issue was more and more of a problem,\u201d she said.Ann Pascarelli, 60, who works in Macy\u2019s luggage department and has been at the store for nearly four decades, would be one of those employees. She gets particularly worried when customers announce plans for a trip.\u201cWe call ourselves the rental luggage department,\u201d she said.\u201c\u2018I\u2019m going on my trip tomorrow and I\u2019ll be back in a week,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pascarelli said, repeating what she said was an oft-heard refrain. \u201cYou can time it. In one week\u2019s time, they\u2019ll be back.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically.

{"Headline": "New Chapter for Classic Paris Bookstore: Books Printed on Demand", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Gauthier Charrier, a graphic design student, stepped inside one of Paris\u2019s newest bookstores and wondered, \u201cWhere are all the books?\u201d\u201cI saw this empty, open space \u2014 just a couple of stools \u2014 and I wondered, \u2018Did someone mess up?\u2019\u201d Mr. Charrier, 20, said.No one messed up.The pronounced stock shortage inside the Librairie des Puf, run by the publisher University Press of France, or Les Puf for short, is not the result of an ordering mistake, but the heart of the shop\u2019s business model.There are books, but they are not delivered in advance from wholesalers. They are printed on request, before the customer\u2019s very eyes, on an Espresso Book Machine. On Demand Books, the American company that manufactures the machine, chose the name as a nod to an activity you can complete in the five minutes it takes to print a book: Have a quick coffee.Labeled, not so modestly, the \u201cGutenberg press of the 21st century\u201d by its creators, the machine sits in a back corner of the shop, humming as it turns PDFs into paperbacks. Customers use tablets to select the titles for print \u2014 adding, if they want to, their own handwritten inscriptions \u2014 while sipping coffee in the light and airy storefront in the Latin Quarter of Paris. \u201cThe customers are all surprised,\u201d said the shop\u2019s director, Alexandre Gaudefroy. \u201cAt first, they\u2019re a little uncomfortable with the tablets. After all, you come to a bookshop to look at books. But thanks to the machine and the tablets, the customer holds a digital library in their hands.\u201dFrom a business standpoint, Mr. Gaudefroy said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about space for the stock. We\u2019re in a space which measures less than 80 meters squared, and I can offer readers as many titles as I want.\u201d And that is a lot of titles. All 5,000 books published by Les Puf are available, as well as an additional three million books compiled by On Demand Books, including titles from 10 large American publishers and the public domain.Les Puf\u2019s prestige in the industry has helped it secure even more titles \u2014 a group of French publishers are expected to hand over PDFs of their titles in a few weeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting is that, thanks to the on-demand model, we can revive old titles, which we previously hadn\u2019t bothered with because they\u2019d only sell five or 10 copies in a year,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cOn-demand, it\u2019s a new economy for us.\u201dAbout 2,000 out-of-print Puf titles will be made available to customers in the coming months, Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cWe\u2019re completely revising the chain of book production because we\u2019re a bookseller, a publisher, a printer and also a distributor,\u201d he said.It is a radical reinvention of a store that first opened its doors in 1921. The original Librairie des Puf occupied a far larger, multilevel space in the corner of Place de la Sorbonne, and had packed window displays and a bustling intellectual crowd from nearby universities. It was long a cultural and academic symbol, until it was forced to close because of falling profits and soaring rents. Then, about 10 years ago, the site was sold to a men\u2019s-clothing chain, much to the chagrin of locals.But its closing was no exception. From 2000 to 2014, 28 percent of Paris bookstores closed, according to a 2015 report from the Paris Urban Planning Agency, a body assembled by the City Council in 1967 to chart social and economic evolution in the French capital. Crippling rent increases in Paris\u2019s densely populated center were mostly to blame, as well as growing competition from e-commerce sites that are able to offer far more titles than a cramped city bookstore. The decline in sales of newspapers and magazines also contributed, since these are often sold alongside books in French bookstores.The Latin Quarter, which has the highest concentration of bookshops in the city, was among the worst-hit areas. In an effort to protect the neighborhood\u2019s unique character \u2014 and prevent so-called blandification \u2014 the Paris City Council in 2008 made it the center of its Vital\u2019Quartier program. The program buys retail spaces across Paris, renovates them and rents them to small culturally significant enterprises at far below market rates. Les Puf was leased one of these spaces on Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, allowing it to reopen in March just a few blocks from where it closed.\u201cWe\u2019re already thinking about opening in other big cities in France \u2014 in university towns like Lille, Bordeaux and Lyon,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. \u201cAfter a few weeks of business, there\u2019s a real commercial motivation for doing so because, well, we\u2019re selling a lot of books. A lot more than predicted. We thought we\u2019d sell 10, 15 books in a day, but it\u2019s been more like 30 or 40.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an investment, but if it\u2019s well managed, it can be very profitable,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said. Along with the low rent for its retail space and the elimination of the cost of overproducing books that may not sell, Les Puf benefits from an affordable two-year lease on the Espresso Book Machine from the French printing association Ireneo. And France\u2019s fixed-book pricing law, which prohibits anyone from selling books at a discount, means Les Puf can charge the price set by the publisher for each book. \u201cA lot of publishers I know are interested in the idea, especially when we tell them how little it costs us,\u201d Mr. Gaudefroy said.So far, the store has relied on foot traffic and the pull of the machine\u2019s novelty to draw customers, but a social media and leafleting campaign aimed at students \u2014 Les Puf\u2019s original demographic \u2014 is planned.Les Puf\u2019s success is not an anomaly. Times are still tough for brick-and-mortar shops, but signs of a recovery are widespread. In the United States, sales in physical bookstores rose by 2.5 percent last year, the first increase since 2007. In Britain, the largest chain bookseller, Waterstones, announced a return to profitability at the end of last year after the arrival of the indie book-selling success story James Daunt as managing director.Mr. Daunt decentralized control of the chain\u2019s 275 stores, encouraging individual managers to modify their stores\u2019 layouts for the local book-buying audience, thus scrapping an ingrained industry practice that had effectively allowed publishers to dictate which books appeared in best-seller sections.Independent bookstores, too, are beginning to carve a path out of their business\u2019s decade of decline. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry which is very much starting to rebound,\u201d said Nick Brackenbury, one of the founders of NearSt, a mobile application created in London that is helping to wean customers off buying books on Amazon.com, encouraging them to return instead to their local stores.\u201cBookshops are starting to do lots of little innovative things and getting people to come back into them,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said. For many bookstores that have the space, like Gogol & Company in Milan, La Fugitiva in Madrid and Java Bookshop in Amsterdam, remaking themselves as hybrid bookstore-coffee shops has become a reliable way to attract customers. Other shops are emphasizing something unavailable online \u2014 the experience of visiting a bookstore.The Society Club in London\u2019s Soho district is as much a cocktail club and members\u2019 lounge as a bookstore. Books for Cooks \u2014 a store in Notting Hill entirely devoted to cookbooks \u2014 offers a sensory experience by cooking up one of its books\u2019 many recipes in an open kitchen at the back of the store every morning.Mr. Brackenbury and his team are allowing bookstores to innovate on a more fundamental level: convenience. \u201cThe main feedback we get from our users is: \u2018I buy from Amazon reluctantly because it\u2019s so easy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone will say, \u2018I want to support my local shops.\u2019 But few people actually do today because it\u2019s so much hard work.\u201dNearSt aims to help local shops adapt to the needs of the modern customers by making local shop inventories \u201cshoppable\u201d from a smartphone, allowing customers to search for titles, find local stores that sell them and see routes there. \u201cWe just want local stores to be able to offer customers something which is just better than Amazon,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Economic Payoff From Technology Is So Elusive", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byYour smartphone allows you to get almost instantaneous answers to the most obscure questions. It also allows you to waste hours scrolling through Facebook or looking for the latest deals on Amazon.More powerful computing systems can predict the weather better than any meteorologist or beat human champions in complex board games like chess.One place to look at this disconnect is in the doctor\u2019s office. Dr. Peter Sutherland, a family physician in Tennessee, made the shift to computerized patient records from paper in the last few years. There are benefits to using electronic health records, Dr. Sutherland says, but grappling with the software and new reporting requirements has slowed him down. He sees fewer patients, and his income has slipped.\u201cI\u2019m working harder and getting a little less,\u201d he said.The productivity puzzle has given rise to a number of explanations in recent years \u2014 and divided economists into technology pessimists and optimists.The gains from current tech trends like big-data analysis, artificial intelligence and robotics, they say, will come. Just wait.Technology spending has been robust, rising 54 percent over a decade to $727 billion last year, according to the research firm IDC. Despite all the smartphone sales to consumers, most of the spending is by companies investing in technology to increase growth and productivity.Only 18 percent of the American economy is living up to its \u201cdigital potential,\u201d the report concluded. And if lagging industries do not catch up, we will not see much of a change in national economic statistics, said James Manyika, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute.Since the financial crisis, the Obama administration has moved aggressively to push medicine into the digital age. As part of the economic recovery package, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. The legislation provided for federal incentive payments of $44,000 a physician to shift to electronic health records.The billions of dollars in subsidies were intended to accelerate adoption. And from 2008 to 2014, the share of hospitals with electronic health records rose to 75 percent from 9 percent, while the adoption rate in doctors\u2019 offices rose to 51 percent from 17 percent, according to the most recent surveys by the American Hospital Association and the government.\u201cThe government funding has made a huge difference,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing little evidence so far that all this technology has had much effect on quality and costs.\u201dThe electronic records, health experts say, represent only a first step toward curbing costs and improving care. \u201cPeople confuse information automation with creating the kind of work environment where productivity and creativity can flourish,\u201d said Dr. David J. Brailer, who was the national health technology coordinator in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd so little has gone into changing work so far.\u201dThe government incentives came with timetables for adopting different levels of use and new reporting requirements, with the prospect of financial penalties for doctors and hospitals that fell behind. The early goals for adopting electronic records were reasonable, health experts say, but the later stages were too aggressive.Overwhelmed doctors protested, and the administration recently shelved the previous timetable, stretching out schedules and modifying some reporting rules.Healthstar Physicians, the 50-doctor group in Morristown, Tenn., where Dr. Sutherland practices, was spurred to go electronic by those federal incentive payments, which now total $32 billion. But the cultural adjustment to digital technology has been challenging.Dr. Sutherland and his colleagues evaluated several technology providers and chose Athenahealth, which does not sell software but is paid a percentage of its customers\u2019 revenue. Healthstar started using Athenahealth\u2019s cloud software in 2012, first for billing and then for electronic health records. Athenahealth\u2019s share is less than 5 percent of the group\u2019s revenue.Today, Dr. Sutherland\u2019s personal income and the medical group\u2019s revenue are about 8 percent below where they were four years ago. But in 2015, both his earnings and the revenue of Healthstar, which employs 350 people in 10 clinics, increased slightly, by nearly 3 percent from 2014.Dr. Sutherland decided he did not want a computer screen separating him from his patients. So he opted for a tablet computer, making it easier to keep eye contact.Not a fast typist, Dr. Sutherland decided to use voice recognition software. For six months, he stayed up until midnight most nights, training the software until its speech recognition engine could transcribe his comments into text with few mistakes.Dr. Sutherland bemoans the countless data fields he must fill in to comply with government-mandated reporting rules, and he concedes that some of his colleagues hate using digital records.Yet Dr. Sutherland is no hater. Despite the extra work the new technology has created and even though it has not yet had the expected financial payoff, he thinks it has helped him provide better information to patients.He values being able to tap the screen to look up potentially harmful drug interactions and to teach patients during visits. He can, for example, quickly create charts to show diabetes patients how they are progressing with treatment plans, managing blood glucose levels and weight loss.He is working harder, Dr. Sutherland says, but he believes he is a better doctor. Blunt measures of productivity, he added, aren\u2019t everything. \u201cMy patients are better served,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happier.\u201dAn article on Monday about the effect of digital technology on productivity growth rendered incorrectly the name of a medical technology provider. It is Athenahealth, not Athena Health.Advertisement"}

The week I moved in, a neighbor pulled me aside and offered wisdom on the climb: \u201cYour legs will get used to it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut your heart never will.\u201d How literally she meant this, I was never sure.The apartment was tiny \u2014 I had to shuffle sideways like a crab to get into my bathroom \u2014 and I was intent on justifying the unreasonable rent. So the day before I moved in, I ordered a bunk bed on Amazon. I figured that with an extra berth, I could effectively double the apartment\u2019s holding capacity, allow out-of-towners to avoid hotels and offer refuge for friends, whether locked out of their own homes or weary of the slog back to Brooklyn.The bed arrived as a sprawl of metal poles, each embalmed in white lacquer. I had picked a model with a full-size bed on bottom and a twin on top. While a traditional twin-on-twin evokes the accommodations of childhood and camp, prison and the military \u2014 a sign, somehow, of both playfulness and austerity \u2014 the twin-over-full variety signals something entirely different, and possibly even transgressive. Instead of two sleepers, the bed seemed to beckon heterodox groupings of three or four.Most evenings, the bunk bed offered itself up as a choice. Did I want to transcend worldly concerns, swaddled and suspended in a criblike twin bed that enveloped my lanky build? Or did I prefer to brave the open expanse of the full bed like a taxpaying adult? The decision involved a touch of foresight. The bed was wedged against three walls, and waking up on the twin meant either shimmying down the ladder (and having my ribs played like a xylophone by the rungs) or taking a morning death-leap from the top, more invigorating than a cup of coffee.During the trial run, close friends took the bottom, and I, rather religiously, took the top. I was convinced I would be horribly maimed should the contraption collapse \u2014 \u201cPlease! You take the bottom,\u201d I insisted, shrouding my dread in panicked largess. But once the lights were off, youthful exchanges about life, love and the cosmos raged. We were recumbent along an intimate vertical axis, and our words, unmarred by dubious glances, spilled into the air. All night, the whoosh of cars outside echoed through the room like waves against a hull; until sleep finally took us, we were out at sea together, stowed away safely.The bed swiftly earned its claim to being one of my most prized possessions. Then, my parents came to visit.One evening, I left the apartment to pick up milk for the morning\u2019s cereal. When I returned, they were absent from the living room, and the bedroom door was closed. I opened the door, and I regret it, as those who open doors so often do. My parents, stumbling through a defense, confessed that the bunk bed had sparked dormant passions \u2014 the bed\u2019s latticework of metal poles both the kindling and the match that ignited their love aflame. Freud\u2019s \u201cprimal scene\u201d is supposedly a trauma specific to childhood, but I am now no longer sure.In the years to follow, the bed exerted something like a centripetal force on the space. Nearly all memorable activity in the apartment spiraled around it. Regardless of how close any two (or more) people are beforehand, on bunks they fall asleep together, they wake up together, they hear each other sleeping (snoring, babbling, rolling around). Each person is made to be vulnerable before the other, and in doing so bonds in an unusual and meaningful way. The twin-over-full arrangement did not militate against the orgiastic, as my parents had proved, but much more often, it fostered friendship.In the summer, small, boozy gatherings in the apartment migrated to the air-conditioned bedroom. As many as six of us would distribute ourselves across the beds, and occasionally someone would be dispatched to the bottom bunk if the metal moaned too much under our weight. Treasured memories of childhood mischief and sleepaway camp inevitably surfaced, cementing new friendships and shedding light on old ones.Each morning when visitors were below, I craned my neck over the side of the safety railing to check on them. Some consulted my eyes, as if inquiring about what was in store for breakfast; others instinctively reached out a hand to meet mine halfway. Even though the bed proved to be reliably sturdy, I was always delighted to find that no one perished in the night, that no limbs and organs were compromised by loose screws or buckled metal.Word eventually got around campus, and the questions kept finding me: Is it true that you have a bunk bed? Does it really have a full and a twin? I had bought the thing in the name of economy, but it had become an attraction in itself. Perhaps bunk beds, in an age of individuation, tap into our latent desire to share a world \u2014 they urge us, after all, to cohabitate, and to explore the pleasures and challenges of unfamiliar intimacies.Zachary Fine is a writer based in New Orleans. This is his first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bo Burnham, Discovered on the Internet, Now Challenges It", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOn Comedy\u201cIf you look at original content on YouTube now, the center of it is all-caps comments and girls\u2019 cleavage and commercial, derivative\u201d videos aimed at \u201cwhat 13-year-olds want rather than what they need,\u201d Mr. Burnham said Monday night in a Williamsburg apartment where he\u2019s staying while acting in a movie. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound fatherly, but it\u2019s amazing to watch a medium sell out on steroids.\u201d\u201cSocial media is the market\u2019s answer to a generation that wanted to perform,\u201d he said toward the end of the hourlong special, crouching low to the ground, while describing the constant exhibitionism of online life as a prison. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about anything, but what I do know is if you can live without an audience, you should do it.\u201dMr. Burnham\u2019s comedy has always skewered pop culture (the new show takes aim at the faux populism of country music and the uplift of anthems like \u201cRoar\u201d), but what makes this special stand out is how it examines the shrinking distance between audience and performer in the internet era. \u201cI want to talk about my relationship with the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to think I shouldn\u2019t because it\u2019s unreliable and stupid and \u2018poor me.\u2019 But I think people relate to this idea of having to perform something for people, the idea that the world around you is more of an audience than it used to be.\u201dComedians can be romantic about the response from their audience. Jerry Seinfeld famously claims that after several minutes, his fame has no influence on his act. Mr. Burnham finds that absurd, arguing that those comics are \u201cdesperately trying to act like they haven\u2019t lost that thing they love they had when they were younger \u2014 the \u2018I\u2019m still struggling.\u2019 No, it\u2019s easier for you now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge desperate impulse from a lot of famous comedians to humanize themselves.\u201dIn his show, Mr. Burnham skewers Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d celebrity lip-sync segments, which he calls the \u201cend of culture.\u201d It\u2019s an example of the internet ethos bleeding into television. \u201cIt\u2019s the tearing down of the fake edifice of these people being better than us: multimillion-dollar beautiful people performing their own humanity for us in their $10,000 dresses,\u201d Mr. Burnham said. \u201cI think comedy is destroyed when it gets in bed with celebrity.\u201dAs his argument about the corrosiveness of fame gains momentum, Mr. Burnham stands up, his thin but no longer lanky six-and-half-foot frame jittery with energy. Pointing out the hypocrisy of rich comedians talking about airport woes, when in reality they fly private, he said: \u201cI want you to leave my show skeptical about performance.\u201dIn his special, Mr. Burnham adopts a prickly persona, establishing a tense relationship with his audience members, alternating between making them laugh and baiting, even insulting them. In part, this is rooted in a personal anxiety. Three years ago, Mr. Burnham, who considers himself a writer who fell into performance, started experiencing panic attacks before shows. This is reflected in how his special portrays the audience. \u201cIn comedy specials, the audience is always smiling and well lit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, they\u2019re a mob, faceless black entity. They are intimidating, strange and creepy. \u201cAt the end of the special, he thanks the crowd then says in a blankly affectless deadpan, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d It is wonderfully teasing, grateful on the one hand, bitter on the other.It may be the last thing a crowd will hear from him in a many years, since Mr. Burnham says he plans to take a long break from stand-up to focus on writing, get a movie about a middle schoolgirl off the ground and avoid the stage. He added that the demands on a comic these days mean that people send him tweets asking, \u201cAre you dead?\u201d after he\u2019s been working on a special for a few years. \u201cA band can take a break but a comedian?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not on \u2018@midnight\u2019 every month you\u2019re Thomas Pynchon.\u201dMr. Burnham said he rejects the expectation of an \u201cIV drip of entertainment.\u201d At the same time, he understands how his critique of online culture looks coming from him. \u201cAs someone who hugely benefited from it and maybe bears in part the guilt of what feels like an unfair advantage,\u201d he said, referring to his peculiar career path, which skipped the usual dues-paying steps, \u201cI feel I need to expose what I know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 Begins Previews in London, as Magic Continues", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When we last left Harry Potter, in the final pages of J. K. Rowling\u2019s \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d he was a middle-aged wizarding bureaucrat sending his second child, Albus Severus, off to Hogwarts for the first time. His life, marked in part by violence, danger and grief, seemed to have settled down, and those of us who had worried about him through so many pages for so many years felt relieved at his apparently happy ending.It was odd, too, to watch the action unfold onstage. Reading the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books was for so long a rite of passage for so many children (O.K., and adults), and the movies always felt like faithful adaptations that didn\u2019t advance the plot. But this was something completely different, this sensation of coming to the story not alone in the corner with a book, but in a large theater in the company of some 1,400 other people.Who knows what adjustments the play will go through before it opens; previews are often a time for tweaking. I began the evening slightly worried about what Ms. Rowling could do to a narrative I had read in its entirety years ago and, like many fans, had always associated with a particular time in my life. But above all she is a storyteller, and once more I could not resist the ingenuity of her plot and her joy in her fictional world.Here were a host of memorable characters, many of them making what amount to quick cameo appearances, much as a star might drop into a movie for a few minutes. Here were a second generation of new characters, including Scorpius, the unexpectedly delightful son of the decidedly undelightful Draco Malfoy, and of course the troubled Albus, whose adolescent struggles to make sense of himself, his friends and his family form the focus of the play.How exciting, when you\u2019ve just reread \u201cDeathly Hallows\u201d and been reminded of what happened, to see what Ms. Rowling does: She thrusts us back into that concluding scene, making it the first scene of the play and putting us on Platform 9\u00be as the characters wait for the Hogwarts Express. She then rushes rapidly forward a few years, and shoots off into all sorts of unexpected directions. And then we get to learn the thing that most drives every fan in these situations: What happens next?(NOTE: People who don\u2019t want to find out what happens until July 31, when the text of the play is to be published, might want to disapparate out of their seats for the next two paragraphs. In any case, we will try to keep it vague.)Exciting scenes feature, among others, the Sorting Hat (wittily staged); the grumpiest of the centaurs, who is extra grumpy this time around; the evil Dursleys; and one of the book\u2019s more diabolically unpleasant characters, who turns up at the end and whom we had hoped we had seen the last of. The tantalizing question arises of what might or might not happen to the present if you try to tamper with the past. Albus Dumbledore himself appears, in a painting that speaks to us, as paintings do in Potter-world, followed by as good an explanation as you\u2019ll ever hear of why we should not mistake a portrait for an actual person.There is magic, right onstage, including some books that fly from a bookshelf and speak to us; a dexterous use of fireplaces as pieces of the wizarding transportation network; and an amusing wand fight in which a pair of wizards fling curses at one another. There are some creepy dementors that waft out over the audience, minus, at least from the upper seats, the cold draft that generally accompanies them.\u201cIt was even better than I thought it would be,\u201d said Iman Khabl, 23, who had come from Edinburgh to see the play and who said she had been thrilled to find references to sometimes abstruse details from all seven books. \u201cIt was such a nice nudge to the fans, that they brought everyone back, that they kept our favorite characters while bringing in so many other things.\u201dThe play attracted the usual complement of superfans, including people dressed in Hogwarts robes bought from the internet; people who had flown from California the day before and were being kept awake by little more than caffeine and hysteria; and a pair of newlyweds who ditched their honeymoon in Iceland for the chance to see the play.But for now, even fans lucky enough to procure tickets don\u2019t know how \u201cCursed Child\u201d ends. The play is in two parts. Only the first half was presented on Tuesday, and it ended on a truly shocking note of suspense. We won\u2019t learn what happens until the first preview of the second part, on Thursday night. One thing we still aren\u2019t sure of: Which character is in fact the cursed child?Roslyn Sulcas and Christopher D. Shea contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

By contrast, established sites like YouTube have sophisticated processes to monitor user-generated content.Rohit Agarwal, the general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, the company\u2019s education unit, said the company was looking into how the materials in question came to be uploaded on the site.\u201cOur team is doubling down and investigating what the root cause is,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said in an interview on Tuesday evening at the annual conference of the International Society for Technology in Education, attended by about 16,000 educators in Denver. \u201cWe will do what is appropriate to respond to the results of the investigation.\u201dAmazon Inspire is a major step by the company to gain market share in an education tech landscape where rivals like Apple, Google and Microsoft have already established footholds. Mr. Agarwal said the site, which had been available to a limited number of teachers and school districts during the beta test phase, was scheduled to go live at the start of the school year this fall.Amazon designed the site to enable teachers to post and freely share lesson plans, quizzes and curriculums of their own design, as well as open educational resources created by others. Mr. Agarwal said that users were not supposed to upload copyrighted materials and that the site had a process in place to quickly take down items that were the subjects of such complaints.But it may be more difficult than Amazon executives realized for the site\u2019s users to distinguish between open educational resources and copyrighted works.\u201cEven with all the safeguards in place, you have the ability to have someone upload a resource that violates a copyright,\u201d Mr. Agarwal conceded.\u201cIt takes tremendous work to create engaging and rigorous educational resources,\u201d said Adam Freed, the chief executive of Teacher Synergy, the company behind teacherspayteachers.com. \u201cSo we understand the concerns from our TeachersPayTeachers community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At best, she thought she might finish a draft of something. Worst case, she would fail and put the fantasy of becoming a novelist to rest once and for all.Since coming out in late March, the novel has spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Ecco has printed 275,000 copies in the United States, and rights to the novel have been sold in 22 countries.When did you realize you wanted to write fiction?What drew you back to writing?My kids were getting older, and I didn\u2019t need my job to be flexible anymore. Once I didn\u2019t need that, I wanted it to be meaningful. I thought I would go back to personal essay writing. My friend Liza read one of my essays and said, \u201cI think you should write this as a short story.\u201d The short story was really bad, but the difference between being 48 and 28 was that I had the maturity at that point to understand that novelists or short story writers didn\u2019t sit down at their desk and everything magically flowed.Then you went and got your M.F.A. at Bennington. Did you have any particularly influential teachers there? Where did the idea for \u201cThe Nest\u201d come from?Once I decided to sit down and write it, the setup came very quickly. I thought, it\u2019s four siblings, they\u2019re mad at each other. What are they having a difficult conversation about? Money. Why can\u2019t they drink in front of one another? Oh, one of them is an alcoholic. What have the past few months been like for you?It was like being knocked over by a rogue wave at the beach. I was upside down and trying to figure out which way was up. I\u2019m probably not appreciating it as much as I should be, because I still feel like I\u2019m trying to get my footing a little bit.Months before the book came out, there was breathless coverage of your seven-figure advance. Did that add to the stress?It was really nerve-racking. I just wanted it to be received the way everybody else\u2019s debut novel is received or judged. I understand that it\u2019s a topic of interest, but to have it be presented to readers as a way to contextualize the experience of reading my book, that\u2019s weird to me. It\u2019s not like my book costs any more money than other books.Jill Soloway, the creator of the TV show \u201cTransparent,\u201d is an old friend of yours, and now she\u2019s a producer of a movie based on \u201cThe Nest\u201d for Amazon Films. How did that come about?My film and TV agent said, \u201cI have people lined up who want to talk to you.\u201d I felt squeamish handing the story over and then not having any control over what its life would be. I asked Jill for her advice and said, \u201cDo you know any of these people. Should I put anyone at the top of the list?\u201d And she said, \u201cI can\u2019t option it for Amazon as a series because it\u2019s too close to \u2018Transparent,\u2019 but if you\u2019re interested in a feature film, I would be interested in producing.\u201dSo you\u2019re writing your first screenplay. Are you nervous about it?It doesn\u2019t feel as presumptuous to me as writing a novel did, maybe because I know so many television writers and screenwriters.

{"Headline": "Why Microsoft Likes LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byBitsSo what does Microsoft get for $26.2 billion?Drug company deals are more straightforward though, and the price is usually based on what the acquirer hopes to squeeze out of the products and talent. Technology mergers tend to require a little more imagination to justify their cost.LinkedIn may have 400 million \u201cmembers,\u201d as the people who post their job data there are called, but in 2015 it had revenue of about $3 billion, and posted a net loss of $166 million. The year before it lost only $15 million on $2.2 billion in revenue. It is hard to see why Microsoft paid a premium of about 50 percent of Friday\u2019s LinkedIn share price.But think like a tech chief executive, using the key values of relevance, synergy, data and growth. Microsoft is in the midst of an epochal transition from the time of personal computers and computer servers to machine-based intelligence everywhere, via cloud computing and mobile devices. Where once it owned the desktop, now it strives with the likes of Google and Amazon for a $1 trillion prize, the global market for corporate computing.At the end of last March, Microsoft had $105 billion in cash, far more than the competition. Spending some of that on a well-regarded cloud company it can transition over to its own enormous cloud system makes Microsoft ever more relevant in this world.Unlike Google and Amazon, Microsoft already has a large presence in corporate software, and some of LinkedIn\u2019s functions will fit nicely into its human resources and financial planning products. Microsoft is also trying to increase the corporate utility of Skype, the online communications company it bought for $8.5 billion in 2011.Bolted onto LinkedIn, it could be a means not just of recruitment, but of organizing teams. Much of LinkedIn\u2019s proposition has been that it will be the core of a future in which there is much less lifetime employment and lots more freelancing, consulting and other independent contracting across the globe.LinkedIn already has probably the world\u2019s best trove of data on the work people are doing and looking for, and one of the best-regarded teams of data scientists in tech. That information and those people will now work with counterparts in areas like online search, gaming and artificial intelligence, or A.I.Data is not just inherently important these days; it is a key asset for improving the performance of A.I. systems. Big data sets lend themselves to better results (incidentally, a reason many in tech are starting to worry about the data owned by the biggest companies.) Buying LinkedIn didn\u2019t just improve the likely performance of Microsoft\u2019s own algorithms. It took a large potential data resource off the table for Amazon and Google.That is, in large part, the positive situation \u2014 which is how such enormous acquisitions should begin.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Chaos Monkeys\u2019 Is a Guide to the Spirit of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byBook EntryThe book\u2019s dedication \u201cto all my enemies\u201d who made the oeuvre possible confirms the impression that the blizzard of score-settling that follows is less than balanced. The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read.

Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees.

Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator.

{"Headline": "While Limited, Wi-Fi-First Phones Are a Good, Frugal Bet", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe internet companies Google and Bandwidth.com have turned that little-known fact into a business opportunity. Their mobile phone services rely on cell networks that they lease from traditional carriers, but if a Wi-Fi network has a better connection, they shift phone calls and data over to Wi-Fi instead.More often, your Wi-Fi is going to have a stronger data connection, so in tech industry parlance, these phone services are sometimes called \u201cWi-Fi first.\u201dIn contrast, AT&T\u2019s cheapest phone plan starts at $45 a month for a bucket including only 300 megabytes of data, and Verizon charges $50 a month for its plan including one gigabyte of cellular data.Based on numbers alone, you might wonder, how could one resist going with a Wi-Fi-first phone plan? But there are several other factors to consider, including the reliability and ease of using the phone services, customer service quality and the phones that work with the networks. (For example: The iPhone is out of the picture.)After testing Project Fi and Republic Wireless for a few weeks and comparing their performance with traditional carriers, I concluded that they are ideal for budget-conscious consumers who don\u2019t need to have the latest and greatest devices.Project Fi and Republic Wireless share a lot in common, though there are differences. Both services work only with phones running Google\u2019s Android system. In the United States, both primarily rely on Sprint and T-Mobile networks for cellular coverage. But Project Fi\u2019s plans also include cell coverage from U.S. Cellular, a smaller carrier, as well as foreign networks in more than 120 countries.When you receive a Project Fi phone, you insert the SIM card and activate it through the Project Fi app. Similarly, with Republic Wireless, when you receive the phone, you activate it through the Republic app downloaded through Google\u2019s app store.The technologies for both services work seamlessly \u2014 if you start a phone call over a Wi-Fi connection and move out of its range, for example, the call is handed off to a nearby cell tower.I tested Project Fi and Republic Wireless in two cities where getting a good cell signal can be challenging \u2014 San Francisco and South Lake Tahoe, Calif. \u2014 and compared their performance with a smartphone on AT&T\u2019s network. Both Project Fi and Republic Wireless worked reliably and turned in impressive results.To assess data performance, I ran network tests with the app Speed Test on the phones multiple times in each location. AT&T\u2019s cell network was faster over all: Its download speeds peaked at 28 megabits a second. Republic Wireless reached 17 megabits a second for downloads, and Project Fi\u2019s fastest download speed was 9.2 megabits a second. All those speeds are fast enough to smoothly stream music or video.Both Project Fi and Republic Wireless were better at handling Wi-Fi calls than AT&T. I tried starting phone calls in an area with a strong Wi-Fi connection and then walked out of range of the Wi-Fi. AT&T dropped the call when I left the Wi-Fi zone, but Project Fi and Republic Wireless hung on. As for audio quality, calls on both Project Fi and Republic Wireless sounded similar; I could not discern a meaningful difference between a call placed over Wi-Fi or cellular.For a stress test, I tried using all the phone services while riding in a car through mountains around Lake Tahoe. Not surprisingly, all the services struggled to place calls or browse the web.Traditional phone carriers are not well known for quality customer service, so it\u2019s important to know how quickly and capably Project Fi and Republic Wireless can solve customer problems. Both had customer service operations that felt more modern than traditional carriers.Project Fi lets customers reach out via phone, web chat or email. I experienced a hiccup with Project Fi \u2014 after activating my account and choosing a phone number, Project Fi gobbled my existing Google Voice phone number.After I contacted a service representative over web chat in the evening, Google restored my Google Voice number the following morning \u2014 not ideal. Google said it would revise its sign-up process to clarify that customers will lose their existing Google Voice numbers if they choose a new number for Project Fi.However, in another test, I emailed Google asking why my coverage was spotty in Lake Tahoe, and after about three hours a service representative responded, explaining that reliable service in that area was not guaranteed, and issued me a $5 refund.Republic Wireless has a number of interesting approaches to customer service. You can open a support ticket through the Republic app or website and get a response via email, or ask someone to call you. You can also use web chat or send a text message to a chat bot, which spits out a list of options for how you can get help, and connect with a service representative.I used both the chat bot and app to pose the same question about why coverage was spotty in Lake Tahoe. Within minutes, two representatives looked into it and said there were no outages in the area, so performance should have been fine.Because Republic Wireless and Project Fi are similar, the trade-offs will guide you.Project Fi costs a little more than Republic Wireless, but you will also have the benefit of being able to use the service overseas at the same rates, without swapping out a SIM card.But a major downside is that you have only two phone options: Huawei\u2019s 5.7-inch Nexus 6P and LG\u2019s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X. So if you are frugal, travel often and don\u2019t mind having few options for phone models, go with Project Fi.Then there is the option of sticking with a traditional carrier. The big carriers tend to get the latest and coolest phones right when they are released. In addition, AT&T and Verizon generally have faster and more reliable coverage throughout the country. Early adopters of new gear and professionals who value a zippy cell connection will probably want to stick with a big carrier.Advertisement"}

Daniel Radcliffe and the Art of \u2018Privacy\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe please ask that you turn your cellphones on.\u201dWhile Ms. Rourke, dressed in turquoise sneakers and a flowing cloak, worked on pace and rhythm, Mr. Graham, stubbled and wearing a beige surfer shirt, made notes that would likely result in new pastel-colored pages. The actors\u2019 scripts, an assortment of blue, yellow and pink, already resembled flattened Easter baskets.New interviewees, many of whom will appear as characters, include Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee; Randi Zuckerberg, the former market development director at Facebook; and Sherry Turkle, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology specialist in technology and intimacy, who was tickled to learn that she\u2019ll be played by the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alumna Rachel Dratch.Over a salad lunch in an upstairs office (\u201cWe\u2019ve had so much kale since we\u2019ve come to America,\u201d Ms. Rourke said with some bemusement), the creators discussed what inspired \u201cPrivacy\u201d and how they\u2019re altering it for New York audiences.Ms. Rourke, 39, and Mr. Graham, 33, both grew up in the north of England and describe themselves as private people, so private that they skitter around personal details and consented to share only a few pages from the play\u2019s script.Ms. Rourke wasn\u2019t always this way. \u201cA big part of my childhood was people telling me to stop showing off,\u201d she said. But she later came to embrace a culture in which \u201cit\u2019s quite rare for people to talk freely, openly and constantly about their feelings,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham\u2019s social introversion is even more acute. \u201cI used to be private to the point where it was actually hard for relationships, for friendships, for my family,\u201d he said. He\u2019s had to push himself to become more open, both in his work and in his personal relationships, a trajectory that mirrors the Writer\u2019s journey in the play. \u201cI began to understand there\u2019s only so far you can go unless there\u2019s openness,\u201d he said.For more than a year, they hosted \u201ca two-person book group, reading stuff back and forth,\u201d Ms. Rourke said. They learned about how the internet works, how corporations mine data to focus their advertising, how email has altered written communication, how social media transforms individual psychology.Speedily, they set about interviewing their initial experts. Mr. Graham used his natural shyness and sympathy to coax people into speaking freely. \u201cI do just want to listen,\u201d he said. Ms. Rourke then followed with \u201cthe smash-and-grab for the bit I know we\u2019ll need,\u201d she said.Mr. Graham assembled that testimony into the London version of the script, which also included satirical versions of themselves, a slightly paranoid playwright and a somewhat pushy director. For the New York production the director character has been dropped and the portrayal of the writer now seems less satirical.At first he squirmed while an actor portrayed him, but he came to feel that the character \u201cfelt like me. His paunch was a bit more pronounced than mine but the rest of it was pretty accurate,\u201d Mr. MacAskill wrote.Though Ms. Rourke and Mr. Graham said they were pleased by the enthusiastic response to the play in London, neither considered it finished. Ms. Rourke acknowledged that the original piece had been written with \u201can incredibly tight deadline\u201d and that there were \u201cnotes in the margins that we didn\u2019t get to address.\u201dTo help the piece to resonate with New Yorkers, they\u2019ve now interviewed some two-dozen United States experts. Ms. Rourke noted that, \u201cGenerally, the British are unconcerned about the state having their data but reluctant to share their personal histories.\u201d In America it\u2019s been the opposite. The number of audience interactions have been increased and there is a more graceful emphasis on the connections between the personal choices each individual makes (what to reveal to another person, what to disseminate online) and larger political trade-offs between liberty and security.During the London run, some critics complained that the play was ultimately too diffuse, that it didn\u2019t advocate strongly enough for any particular stance. That\u2019s one element that Mr. Graham and Ms. Rourke have chosen not to alter, in part because they\u2019re still making up their minds. If they are sometimes suspicious of technology, they are also reliant on it and sometimes excited and consoled by it.Besides, as Mr. Graham explained, the conversation around privacy and technology \u201cis moving at such light speed and it\u2019s going to evolve and change over the course of our lives.\u201d He has no interest in writing \u201cthe kind of play that makes its audience think \u2018we\u2019ve lost our freedoms, we\u2019ve lost our privacy, I\u2019m going to go down into the basement and wear a tin hat and never interact with anyone again,\u2019\u201d he said. Rather, he wants to spark discussion and debate.The conversation around privacy clearly engages Mr. Radcliffe, 26. Having been cast in the Harry Potter franchise as a preadolescent, the continuum between the private and the public is very real for him.\u201cPeople probably perceive me as someone who doesn\u2019t have very much privacy,\u201d he said during a rehearsal lunch break. \u201cI still feel like I have a lot and it\u2019s very important.\u201d To preserve this, he keeps away from social media platforms. He\u2019s never tried online dating; he doesn\u2019t Instagram his meals. (As he skipped lunch in favor of a black-currant drink and a cigarette, there may not be much to Instagram.)Mostly he finds this minimal online presence liberating. \u201cWhen I see my friends I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been up to, we can have a conversation about it,\u201d he said. But he clearly still worries about how much privacy he can and should maintain. When a reporter observed that he seemed far less neurotic than the Writer, he said, \u201cI\u2019m just masking that well,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of me in the character.\u201dDuring rehearsal that character is changing. The playwright is changing, too. As he has worked on the script, Mr. Graham has reduced his online presence, lessening his use of Twitter and Facebook. He\u2019s no Luddite, but he\u2019s thinking more deliberately about how he shows himself to the world \u2014 the online one, the real one.\u201cIt\u2019s about how much control do you have, how much consciousness do you have and how happy you are,\u201d he said, spearing another forkful of kale. \u201cThis show is not in any way trying to say throw your cellphones away.\u201dAn article last Sunday misstated the day that the play \u201cPrivacy\u201d was scheduled to begin performances. It was Saturday, July 2 \u2014 not Friday, July 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Netflix Survive in the New World It Created?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "FeatureIt helped to develop all the new ways we watch TV \u2014 on-demand, bingeing, mobile. But the Silicon Valley company still has to keep reinventing itself.Supported byTed Sarandos, who runs Netflix\u2019s Hollywood operation and makes the company\u2019s deals with networks and studios, was up first to rehearse his lines. \u201cPilots, the fall season, summer repeats, live ratings\u201d \u2014 all hallmarks of traditional television \u2014 were falling away because of Netflix, he boasted. Unlike a network, which needs shows that are ratings \u201chome runs\u201d to maximize viewers and hence ad dollars, he continued, Netflix also values \u201csingles\u201d and \u201cdoubles\u201d that appeal to narrower segments of subscribers. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data about its customers\u2019 viewing preferences helped it decide what content to buy and how much to pay for it.Sarandos can be an outspoken, even gleeful, critic of network practices in his zeal to promote what Netflix views as its superior model \u2014 on-demand and commercial-free streaming, on any device. That glee was on full display in these remarks. For years, he said, \u201cconsumers have been at the mercy of others when it comes to television. The shows and movies they want to watch are subject to business models they do not understand and do not care about. All they know is frustration.\u201d That, he added, \u201cis the insight Netflix is built on.\u201dWhen Sarandos was done, Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chairman and chief executive, took the stage. A pencil-thin man, he seemed swallowed up by the empty ballroom. He squinted uncomfortably under the lights. He and a number of other Netflix executives had spent the morning at a meeting in Laguna, Calif., where a rare torrential rainstorm grounded air traffic, forcing them to make the five-hour drive to Las Vegas. They arrived only a few hours earlier. To make matters worse, Hastings was feeling ill.Haggard and tired, he stumbled irritably through his presentation. But as he neared the finale, Hastings broke out into a small, satisfied smile. \u201cWhile you have been listening to me talk,\u201d he said, reading from a monitor, \u201cthe Netflix service has gone live in nearly every country in the world but China, where we also hope to be in the future.\u201d Even though this was only a practice run \u2014 and even though it would be a long time before anyone knew whether global expansion would pay off \u2014 the Netflix executives sitting in the ballroom let out a loud, sustained cheer.They had good reason to celebrate. Netflix, since its streaming service debuted in 2007, has had its annual revenue grow sixfold, to $6.8 billion from $1.2 billion. More than 81 million subscribers pay Netflix $8 to $12 a month, and slowly but unmistakably these consumers are giving up cable for internet television: Over the last five years, cable has lost 6.7 million subscribers; more than a quarter of millennials (70 percent of whom use streaming services) report having never subscribed to cable in their lives. Those still paying for cable television were watching less of it. In 2015, for instance, television viewing time was down 3 percent; and 50 percent of that drop was directly attributable to Netflix, according to a study by MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the media business.All of this has made Netflix a Wall Street favorite, with a stock price that rose 134 percent last year. Easy access to capital has allowed the company to bid aggressively on content for its service. This year Netflix will spend $5 billion, nearly three times what HBO spends, on content, which includes what it licenses, shows like AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d and original series like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Its dozens of original shows (more than 600 hours of original programming are planned for this year) often receive as much critical acclaim and popular buzz as anything available on cable. Having invented the binge-streaming phenomenon when it became the first company to put a show\u2019s entire season online at once, it then secured a place in the popular culture: \u201cNetflix and chill.\u201dBut the assembled executives also had reason to worry. Just because Netflix had essentially created this new world of internet TV was no guarantee that it could continue to dominate it. Hulu, a streaming service jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Disney and NBC Universal, had become more assertive in licensing and developing shows, vying with Netflix for deals. And there was other competition as well: small companies like Vimeo and giants like Amazon, an aggressive buyer of original series. Even the networks, which long considered Netflix an ally, had begun to fight back by developing their own streaming apps. Last fall, Time Warner hinted that it was considering withholding its shows from Netflix and other streaming services for a longer period. John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX networks \u2014 and one of the company\u2019s fiercest critics \u2014 told a reporter a few months ago, \u201cI look at Netflix as a company that\u2019s trying to take over the world.\u201dAt the moment, Netflix has a negative cash flow of almost $1 billion; it regularly needs to go to the debt market to replenish its coffers. Its $6.8 billion in revenue last year pales in comparison to the $28 billion or so at media giants like Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. And for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being.Now that future has begun to take shape. The television industry last went through this sort of turbulence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when cable television was maturing. Previously, of course, television had been mostly transmitted via the public airwaves, and the major networks made the bulk of their money from advertising. But cable provided an indisputably better picture, and the proliferation of cable networks came to offer a much greater variety of programming. In time, consumers concluded that it was worth paying for something \u2014 TV \u2014 that had previously been free. This meant that in addition to advertising dollars, each cable channel received revenue from all cable customers, even those who didn\u2019t watch that channel. By 2000, 68.5 million Americans had subscriptions, giving them access to the several hundred channels the industry took to calling \u201cthe cable bundle.\u201dHastings knew the internet would eventually compete with that bundle, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how. And so he had to be flexible. Sarandos says that in 1999, Hastings thought shows would be downloaded rather than streamed. At another point, Netflix created a dedicated device through which to access its content, only to decide that adapting its service to everything from mobile phones to TV sets made more sense. (The Netflix device was spun out into its own company, Roku.) In 2007, even as Netflix\u2019s DVD-by-mail business remained lucrative, and long before the internet was ready to deliver a streaming movie without fits and starts, Hastings directed Netflix to build a stand-alone streaming service.So the company shifted to television. Cable networks like FX and AMC were developing expensive, talked-about dramas, the kind HBO pioneered with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Wire.\u201d But these series, with their complex, season-long story arcs and hourlong format, seemed to be poor candidates for syndication, unlike self-contained, half-hour sitcoms like \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d which can be watched out of order.Hastings and Sarandos realized that Netflix could become, in effect, the syndicator for these hourlong dramas: \u201cWe found an inefficiency,\u201d is how Hastings describes this insight. One of the first such series to appear on Netflix was AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men,\u201d which became available on the site in 2011, between its fourth and fifth seasons. Knowing from its DVD experience that customers often rented a full season of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d in one go, Netflix put the entire first four seasons of \u201cMad Men\u201d online at once. Bingeing took off.Television networks lined up to license their shows to Netflix, failing to see the threat it posed to the established order. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like \u2018Is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?\u2019\u2009\u201d Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, famously joked back in 2010. The occasional voice warned that Netflix would become too big for the industry to control, but mostly the legacy media companies viewed the fees from Netflix as found money. \u201cStreaming video on-demand\u201d rights, as they were called, hadn\u2019t even existed before Netflix asked to pay for them. And because the networks didn\u2019t understand how valuable those rights would become, Netflix got them for very little money.Everyone seemed to be a winner, including the shows themselves. In 2012, for instance, Netflix began streaming the first three seasons of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the dark drama produced by Sony that ran on AMC. Though praised by critics, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d had not yet found its audience.\u201cWhen the folks at Sony said we were going to be on Netflix, I didn\u2019t really know what that meant,\u201d Vince Gilligan, the creator of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d told me. \u201cI knew Netflix was a company that sent you DVDs in the mail. I didn\u2019t even know what streaming was.\u201d Gilligan quickly found out. \u201cIt really kicked our viewership into high gear,\u201d he says. As Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, put it to me: \u201c\u2009\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.\u201dThis was around the time that network executives started to recognize the threat that Netflix could eventually constitute to them. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d says Richard Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG who happens to be Netflix\u2019s most vocal proponent on Wall Street, \u201cwe wrote a piece saying that the networks shouldn\u2019t license to Netflix because they were going to unleash a monster that would undermine their business.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what seemed to be happening.Worse, they realized that Netflix didn\u2019t have to play by the same rules they did. It didn\u2019t care when people watched the shows it licensed. It had no vested interest in preserving the cable bundle. On the contrary, the more consumers who \u201ccut the cord,\u201d the better for Netflix. It didn\u2019t have billions of legacy profits to protect.Yet the networks couldn\u2019t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. Negotiations between a network or a studio and Netflix became fraught, as the networks, understanding the value of their streaming rights, sought much higher fees. In some cases, those negotiations broke down. The Starz deal, for example, was not renewed after it ended in 2012. (Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Starz, would later describe the original deal as \u201cterrible.\u201d)\u201cWe could see that eventually AMC was going to be able to do its own on-demand streaming,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cOr FX. We knew there was no long-term business in being a rerun company, just as we knew there was no long-term business in being a DVD-rental company.\u201dStill, Hastings was cautious. Producing original material is a very different business from licensing someone else\u2019s shows. New content requires hefty upfront costs \u2014 one show alone would most likely cost more than the $30 million a year Netflix reportedly once paid Starz for its entire library of movies. Developing its own series would thrust it into the unfamiliar business of engaging with producers, directors and stars. Back in 2006, the company set up a way to distribute independent films, called Red Envelope Entertainment, but it failed, and Hastings shut it down. (\u201cWe would have been better off spending the money on DVDs,\u201d he told me.) Now it was going to give original content another try \u2014 with much higher stakes.Sarandos had a show he was itching to buy: \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a political drama that was being pitched by David Fincher, the well-known director, and would star Kevin Spacey. Sarandos knew that, according to Netflix\u2019s vast database, many of the company\u2019s subscribers liked the kind of drama that Fincher and Spacey wanted to make. But algorithms alone weren\u2019t the deciding factor. He and Hastings figured that Fincher, who directed films like \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d would create a critical and popular sensation.In any case, Sarandos said, the potential reward vastly outweighed whatever financial and reputational risk \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d represented. \u201cIf it is a flop, we will have overpaid for one series,\u201d he told Hastings. \u201cBut if it succeeds, we will have changed the brand.\u201dIn winning over Fincher, Sarandos faced two other obstacles: a competing offer from HBO, which also wanted \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and the fact that no one had ever made a show for a streaming service before. For decades, when movies went straight to video without a theater run, they were ipso facto failures in Hollywood\u2019s view; for a seasoned director like Fincher, picking Netflix presented the same risk of marginalization. Sarandos overcame both by offering freedom and money. \u201cThere are a thousand reasons for you not to do this with Netflix,\u201d he told Fincher. \u201cBut if you go with us, we\u2019ll commit to two seasons with no pilot and no interference.\u201d Sarandos also offered Fincher a reported $100 million for 26 episodes, at the high end for an hourlong drama.The first season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d became available in February 2013. It was an immediate hit with viewers and critics. Five months later, Netflix posted the first season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d which Sarandos had ordered before \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d went into production. Critics lavished praise on the new show as well. Having begun its life as a Silicon Valley tech company, Netflix had somewhat improbably become a television network.Born and raised in the Boston suburbs \u2014 his great-grandfather was the wealthy investor Alfred Lee Loomis, who played a critical role in the invention of radar \u2014 Hastings, now 55, is one of those tech executives who came to California to attend Stanford (grad school for computer science in his case) and never left. The tech company he ran before Netflix was called Pure Software, which made debugging tools for software engineers. Before Netflix, Hastings had no experience in the entertainment industry.Although news coverage now tends to focus on its shows, Netflix remains every bit as much an engineering company as it is a content company. There is a reason that its shows rarely suffer from streaming glitches, even though, at peak times, they can sometimes account for 37 percent of internet traffic: in 2011 Netflix engineers set up their own content-delivery network, with servers in more than 1,000 locations. Its user interface is relentlessly tested and tweaked to make it more appealing to users. Netflix has the ability to track what people watch, at what time of day, whether they watch all the way through or stop after 10 minutes. Netflix uses \u201cpersonalization\u201d algorithms to put shows in front of its subscribers that are likely to appeal to them. Nathanson, the analyst, says: \u201cThey are a tech company. Their strength is that they have a really good product.\u201dIt is no surprise that Hastings, given his engineering background, believes that data, above all else, yields answers \u2014 and the bigger the data set, the better. \u201cThe worst thing you can do at Netflix is say that you showed it to 12 people in a focus room and they loved it,\u201d says Todd Yellin, the company\u2019s vice president of product innovation. He likes to note that customers will at most consider only 40 to 50 shows or movies before deciding what to watch, which makes it crucial that the company puts just the right 50 titles on each subscriber\u2019s screen. (All the data Netflix collects and dissects can yield surprising correlations: For example, viewers who like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d also often like the FX comedy \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d)There is another underappreciated aspect of Netflix that Hastings views as a competitive advantage: what he calls its \u201chigh performance\u201d culture. The company seeks out and rewards star performers while unapologetically pushing out the rest.One person who helped Hastings create that culture is a woman named Patty McCord. The former head of human resources at Pure Software, she was also Hastings\u2019s neighbor in Santa Cruz. She car-pooled to work with him and socialized with his family on weekends. \u201cI thought the idea for Netflix was kind of stupid,\u201d she told me. But she trusted Hastings\u2019s instincts and wanted to keep working with him. Her title was chief talent officer.The origins of the Netflix culture date to October 2001. The internet bubble burst the year before, and Netflix, once flush with venture capital, was running out of money. Netflix had to lay off roughly 50 employees, shrinking the staff by a third. \u201cIt was Reed\u2019s first layoffs,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was painful.\u201dThe remaining 100 or so employees, despite working harder than before, enjoyed their jobs more. McCord and Hastings concluded that the reason was that they had held onto the self-motivated employees who assumed responsibility naturally. Office politics virtually disappeared; nobody had the time or the patience. \u201cThere was unusual clarity,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was our survival. It was either make this work or we\u2019re dead.\u201d McCord says Hastings told her, \u201cThis is what a great company feels like.\u201dAs luck would have it, the DVD business took off right around the time of the layoffs. By May 2002, Netflix was doing well enough to go public, selling 5.5 million shares at $15 a share. With the $82.5 million Netflix reaped from the offering, Hastings started hiring aggressively again. This time, he and McCord focused on hiring \u201cfully formed adults,\u201d in their words, go-getters who put the company\u2019s interests ahead of their own egos, showed initiative without being asked and embraced accountability. Dissent and argument were encouraged, even demanded.For those who fit in, Netflix was a great place to work \u2014 empowering and rational. There are no performance reviews, no limits on vacation time or maternity leave in the first year and a one-sentence expense policy: Do what is in the company\u2019s best interest. But those who could not adapt found that their tenure at Netflix was stressful and short-lived. There was pressure on newcomers to show that they had what it took to make it at Netflix; those who didn\u2019t were let go. \u201cReed would say, \u2018Why are we coming up with performance plans for people who are not going to work out?\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. Instead, Netflix simply wrote them a check and parted ways.McCord also convinced Hastings that he should ask himself a few times a year whether he would hire the same person in the same job if it opened up that day. If the answer was no, Netflix would write a larger check and let the employee go. \u201cIf you are going to insist on high performance,\u201d McCord says, \u201cthen you have to get rid of the notion of retention. You\u2019ll have to fire some really nice, hard-working people. But you have to do it with dignity.\u201cI held the hands of people weeping, saying, \u2018I want to be here forever,\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. \u201cI would tell them, \u2018Nothing lasts forever.\u2019 I would say to Reed, \u2018I love them, too, but it is our job to be sure that we always have the right people.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2004, the culture was codified enough for Netflix to put it on a sequence of slides, which it posted on its corporate website five years later. It is an extraordinary document, 124 slides in all, covering everything from its salaries (it pays employees what it believes a competitor trying to poach them would) to why it rejects \u201cbrilliant jerks\u201d (\u201ccost to effective teamwork is too high\u201d). The key concept is summed up in the 23rd slide. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, not a family,\u201d it reads. \u201cNetflix leaders hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.\u201dAfter Hastings, the executive I spent the most time with at Netflix was Yellin, a former independent filmmaker who joined the company in early 2006, when he was in his early 40s. Yellin quickly distinguished himself by pushing back hard whenever he thought Hastings was wrong about something. \u201cThere was a culture of questioning, but I pushed the envelope,\u201d he says. He also helped develop a style of meeting that I\u2019d never seen before. At the one I sat in on, there were maybe 50 people in a small circular room with three tiers of seats, like a tiny coliseum, allowing everyone to easily see everyone else. The issue at hand seemed pretty small to me: They were discussing whether montages on the opening screen of the user interface would be more effective in keeping subscribers than still images or trailers. But the intensity of the discussion made it clear that the group took the matter very seriously. Various hypotheses had been tested by sending out montages to 100,000 or so subscribers and comparing the results with another 100,000 who got, say, still images. (This is classic A/B testing, as it\u2019s known.) Every person present had something to say, but while there were strong disagreements, no one\u2019s feathers seemed ruffled.One of my last interviews at Netflix was with Tawni Cranz, the company\u2019s current chief talent officer, who started under Patty McCord in 2007. Five years later, McCord, her mentor, left. When I asked her why, she visibly flinched. She wouldn\u2019t explain, but I learned later that Hastings had let her go.It happened in 2011, after he made his biggest mistake as chief executive. He split Netflix into two companies \u2014 one to manage the DVD business and the other to focus on streaming. Customers were outraged; for many, the move meant a 60 percent price increase if they kept both the DVD and the streaming service. With complaints mounting and subscribers canceling, Hastings quickly reversed course and apologized. In the three weeks following this episode, the price of Netflix shares dropped 45 percent, and Wall Street questioned the company\u2019s acumen. Hastings decided to re-evaluate everyone in the executive ranks, using the litmus test McCord taught him: Would he hire them again today? One of the people this led him to push out was McCord.\u201cIt made me sad,\u201d she said when I called to ask her about it. \u201cI had been working with Reed for 20 years.\u201d Netflix had just given the go-ahead to \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and McCord said she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to walk away in the middle of the next thing.\u201dBut she also felt a sense of pride. She was gratified that Hastings had taken her advice so thoroughly to heart.\u201cTed,\u201d Murray said, as they shook hands warmly, \u201cyou should get a promotion.\u201d He grabbed Sarandos by the lapels, pulled him close and added loudly, \u201cYou are the future!\u201d The two men laughed uproariously.From the time he arrived at Netflix in 2000, Sarandos has had the final say on both Netflix\u2019s licensing deals and its original programming. An Arizona native, Sarandos was working for a large video-retail chain when Hastings hired him to negotiate DVD deals directly with the studios. Sarandos had been in love with movies all his life: He worked his way through college by managing an independent video store. If he had chosen a different path, it\u2019s easy to imagine him having become a traditional Hollywood executive instead of an industry antagonist.At an investment conference late last year, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, which operates the Discovery Channel, articulated the case for having networks rethink their relationship with Netflix. Streaming video-on-demand platforms \u201conly exist because of our content,\u201d Zaslav said, in an obvious reference to Netflix. \u201cTo the extent that our content doesn\u2019t exist on their platforms \u2014 not to be too pejorative \u2014 they are dumb pipes. We as an industry are supporting economic models that don\u2019t make sense.\u201dSarandos, who had spoken earlier in the day, had clearly anticipated the criticism: \u201cZaslav says that we built a great business on their content,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. We did not renew their deal when they wanted a premium. So we replaced it with other programming that got us just as many viewers for less money.\u201dThose who think Netflix will come to dominate television have a simple rationale: Netflix has exposed, and taken advantage of, the limitations of conventional TV. The more time people spend on Netflix \u2014 it\u2019s now up to nearly two hours a day \u2014 the less they watch network television. \u201cOur thesis is that bingeing drives more bingeing,\u201d says Greenfield, the Wall Street analyst. \u201cOnce people start watching shows that don\u2019t have commercials, they never want to go back. Waiting week after week for the next episode of a favorite show,\u201d he says, \u201cis not a good experience for consumers anymore.\u201dStill, despite the rise in Netflix\u2019s share price over the past few years, the company has no shortage of doubters on Wall Street. Some distrust Netflix\u2019s numbers, arguing that millions of people no longer watch the service anymore but keep their subscriptions because they are so inexpensive. Netflix has announced that it will raise prices this year, and the Netflix skeptics believe the price increase will cause subscribers to cancel in droves. Other critics note the slowdown in the growth of domestic subscribers, by far the company\u2019s most profitable segment. In addition, Netflix, between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers, is spending more than it collects in revenue. How long can that continue?Finally, the pessimists point out that Netflix makes very little profit: In the first quarter of this year, for instance, Netflix had nearly $2 billion in revenue but only $28 million in profit. Despite the significant moves by Netflix into original programming, Wall Street still values Netflix more like a platform company \u2014 a business that uses the internet to match buyers and sellers, like Uber \u2014 than a content company, like a studio or a network. Its valuation is currently $5 billion more than Sony, for example. Hastings, who has been very blunt about the company\u2019s strategy of plowing money back into the business, has promised bigger profits sometime in 2017. Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a significant test of investors\u2019 faith in him.One of the most prominent Netflix skeptics is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank. In his view, Netflix\u2019s true advantage in the beginning was that it had the entire game to itself, and the networks, not realizing how valuable streaming rights would be, practically gave them away. He had a \u201cbuy\u201d on the stock from 2007 to 2010, he told me. But, he added, referring to those years when Netflix had streaming all to itself, \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, then it will attract competition.\u201dNow, he said, the networks and studios are charging higher fees for their shows, forcing up Netflix\u2019s costs. Netflix doesn\u2019t own most of the shows that it buys or commissions, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d so it has to pay more when it renews a popular show. In addition to the money it now spends on content, it also has more than $12 billion in future obligations for shows it has ordered. The only way it can pay for all of that is to continue adding subscribers and raise subscription rates. And even then, Pachter says, the networks will extract a piece of any extra revenue Netflix generates. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to think that Netflix can raise its price by $2 a month and keep all the upside,\u201d he said. \u201cI defy you to look at any form of content where the distributor raises prices and the supplier doesn\u2019t get more. That\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard.\u201cNetflix,\u201d Pachter concluded, \u201cis caught in an arms race they invented.\u201d He compared Netflix to a rat racing on a wheel, staying ahead only by going faster and faster and spending more and more: As its costs continue to go up, it needs to constantly generate more subscribers to stay ahead of others.And if that doesn\u2019t happen? If subscriber growth were to stall, for instance, then Wall Street would stop treating it as a growth stock, and its price would start falling. Slower growth would also increase the cost of taking on more debt to pay for its shows. The company would be forced to either raise subscription prices even higher or cut back on those content costs or do both, which could slow subscriber growth even further. Netflix\u2019s virtuous circle \u2014 subscriber growth and content expenditures driving each other \u2014 would become a vicious circle instead.Matthew Ball, a strategist for Otter Media, who writes often about the future of television, thinks the latter is more likely. He says that today, when you have a cable subscription, you have access to hundreds of channels \u2014 in effect, they all share you as a customer. The cable bundle puts you in a television ecosystem, and you flip from one show to the other depending on what you want to watch. In the emerging on-demand world, television won\u2019t work that way: All the networks will have their own streaming service and customers will have to pay a fee for every one. The days when networks could make money from people who never watch their shows will end.One consequence is that networks will have to have one-on-one relationships with their viewers \u2014 something they have little experience with, and which Netflix, with its ability to \u201cpersonalize\u201d its interactions with its 81 million customers, has mastered. Another consequence is that as streaming becomes the primary way people watch television, they are highly unlikely to pay for more than a small handful of subscription-TV networks. What they will want, Ball believes, is a different setup: companies that offer far more programming than any one network can provide. Netflix, clearly, has already created that kind of ecosystem. \u201cNetflix is ABC, it is Discovery, it is AMC, it is USA and all the other networks,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIts subscribers don\u2019t say, \u2018I love Netflix for Westerns, but I\u2019ll go somewhere else for sci-fi.\u2019 The old model just doesn\u2019t work in an on-demand world.\u201dIn this vision of the future, Netflix\u2019s most potent competitor is likely to be Amazon, which is also developing an extensive array of content, including many of its own original shows. Early on, it, too, produced a highly praised series, \u201cTransparent.\u201d It, too, has no allegiance to the cable bundle. And it has the kind of revenue \u2014 exceeding $100 billion \u2014 that neither the networks nor Netflix can approach. Compared to the networks, Netflix may have an imposing war chest, but in a fight with Amazon, it would be outgunned.According to Ball, what Netflix is counting on to maintain its primacy and to start making big profits is \u201cunprecedented scale.\u201d That\u2019s where the effort to create a global network, the one that was announced in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, comes in. In April, when the company announced its first-quarter results, it said it had added 4.5 million international subscribers. Yet success, and profits, are still some way off, as Hastings is the first to acknowledge.YouTube, he notes, is available in more than 50 languages; Netflix can be seen in only 20 languages. Netflix was primarily attracting people in its new countries who speak English as it races to \u201clocalize\u201d its service in each country. Netflix is ordering shows with an international flavor, like \u201cNarcos,\u201d but so far it has only a handful up and running. Netflix wants to make \u201cthe best Bollywood movie that\u2019s ever been produced,\u201d Hastings told an Indian publication; it wants to make Japanese anime; it wants to make local films for every market; it wants global rights when it licenses shows \u2014 something that, once again, contravenes Hollywood\u2019s conventional business model, in which rights are sold on a country-by-country basis. The company still has much to learn about each country\u2019s quirks and tastes and customs, and it will be a while before it can hope to earn a profit from its global customers.\u201cWhen we were in the DVD business,\u201d Hastings said, \u201cit was hard to see how we would get to streaming.\u201d Then it was hard to see how to go from a domestic company to a global one. And how to go from a company that licensed shows to one that had its own original shows. Now it knew exactly where it was going. \u201cOur challenges are execution challenges,\u201d he told me.Asked what the competitive landscape would look like five years in the future, he returned to the analogy he used earlier with the evolution of the telephone. Landlines had been losing out to mobile phones for the past 15 years, he said, but it had been a gradual process. The same, he believed, would be true of television.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a dramatic tipping point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you will see is that the bundle gets used less and less.\u201d For now, even as Hulu and Amazon were emerging as rivals, he claimed that the true competition was still for users\u2019 time: not just the time they spent watching cable but the time they spent reading books, attending concerts.And Hastings was aware that even after the bundle is vanquished, the disruption of his industry will be far from complete. \u201cProspective threats?\u201d he mused when I asked him about all the competition. \u201cMovies and television could become like opera and novels, because there are so many other forms of entertainment. Someday, movies and TV shows will be historic relics. But that might not be for another 100 years.\u201dJoe Nocera is the sports-business columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byJust ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\u201cAmazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,\u201d Mr. Patterson said.Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks \u2014 the inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system \u2014 have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.Already, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems.In a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms.\u201cEvery teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. He added: \u201cWe are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality.\u201dThe site for teachers is not Amazon\u2019s first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.)In March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students.In the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups.Mr. Agarwal said the company\u2019s new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features.\u201cWith the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,\u201d he said.On Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX \u2014 a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches.Google also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It Going to Be Me, or the Cat?", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported bySocial Q\u2019sTwice a year, my husband and I drive eight hours to visit our son, his wife and baby. Their place is small, so we stay at a hotel nearby. I have always been afraid of cats and dogs; they have a large cat. But the playroom is in the basement. It would be easy to close the door so the cat stays upstairs. When I suggested this, my daughter-in-law said: \u201cWhy should I? The cat lives here.\u201d I was insulted but did not say anything. Next time, I am not planning to visit their home. I do not feel welcome. Thoughts?SUSANSo, you\u2019re going to drive eight hours and just stay at the hotel the whole time? I hope it has a good spa and pay-per-view selection. (May I suggest downloading \u201cCatastrophe\u201d from Amazon \u2014 a terrific show in which a terrier comes to a sad end?)I get why your back is up. It would have been kinder for your daughter-in-law to accommodate you. But many folks consider their pets members of the family. The idea of shutting them away may strike them as odd as placing their less-pleasant children under quarantine. (And some pets go nutso if their territory is shrunk.) Spell it out. You can\u2019t possibly want to blow up your relationship with your daughter-in-law over one insensitive episode.Try to feel less aggrieved and call her. Say: \u201cThis may sound crazy to you, but I have always been terrified of dogs and cats. I\u2019m sure Socks is terrific, but I would so appreciate it if you could keep us separated next time.\u201d If you care to go the extra mile, inquire at your local animal shelter about gradual immersion for your fear of pets. For a small donation, the excellent one in my neck of the woods, Animal Rescue Fund, would probably welcome you with open paws.I am a strong animal rights advocate. My sister knows this. She has had a string of bad relationships, but now seems to be getting serious with a man who hunts. She claims he does so for food and conservation, which I don\u2019t buy. I also see on his Facebook page that he mounts animal heads on his walls and, disturbingly, decorates them for the holidays. She is angry that I am unwilling to have a relationship with him, but I don\u2019t feel I can. Help!TIFFANY, QUEENSLook! It\u2019s Animal Planet week at Social Q\u2019s. I am no hunter (and don\u2019t get me started on automatic weapons), but I have enjoyed venison osso buco and rabbit stew on many occasions. I have no illusions about how those creatures came to sit on my dinner plate. Would you refuse a friendship with me, too? Whether we kill the animal or merely consume it, we meat-eaters are part of one continuum. That\u2019s a lot of people to snub.I have sat at tables with hunters who gave thanks to the animals that died for our supper. They seemed respectful and a million times more thoughtful about the food chain than most of us. Mounting heads may be part of this respect (or proof that your sister\u2019s new beau is a creep). Only one thing is certain: You are never going to find out unless you get to know him.Staying open for (calm) discussion on our big-ticket issues has been as big a gift (to me) as rigidity has been a hindrance. And if you want to stay close with your sister, you have to make a sincere effort. That doesn\u2019t mean quail hunting with him. But respecting him enough to discover the man in full would be a start.My daughter had a serious boyfriend in high school. He went far away to college in the fall, but promised to keep in touch. She broke up with him at Christmas because he didn\u2019t. He recently came home for the summer and told her that he is gay. My daughter is devastated. She truly loves this guy, and I believe he loves her. Any advice?JANET, MICHIGANHe\u2019s gay! They can be close friends, but a sexual relationship seems unlikely. Sympathize with your daughter. The mismatch of her heart\u2019s desire will not lessen her pain. But don\u2019t demonize the boy; he may feel vulnerable enough. And as many people can tell your daughter, she is better off learning the truth now than discovering it at 40.My husband and I often invite friends to dinner. When they ask what they can bring, I say, \u201cJust yourselves.\u201d These aren\u2019t potlucks. But if my husband fields the question, he assigns them actual dishes, \u201cVegetable side, please.\u201d This is embarrassing. Please make him stop.JENNNot my jurisdiction, I\u2019m afraid, though I share your sentiment. Guests should not be expected to bring anything. That\u2019s what makes them guests. Still, many refuse to come empty-handed. If they ask (or insist), respond, \u201cHow about a bottle of wine or a pie from the farmstand?\u201d Keep it simple. But asking them to blanch broccoli seems a step too far.

{"Headline": "Why Do Health Costs Keep Rising? These People Know", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byDANVILLE, Pa. \u2014 The Geisinger Health Plan, run by one of the nation\u2019s top-rated health care organizations, foresees medical costs increasing next year by 7.5 percent for people buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act.So when Geisinger requested a rate increase of 40 percent for 2017, consumer advocates were amazed. And Kurt J. Wrobel, Geisinger\u2019s chief actuary, found himself, along with other members of his profession, in the middle of the health care wars still raging in this political year.Actuaries normally toil far from the limelight, anonymous technicians stereotyped as dull and boring. But as they crunch the numbers for their Affordable Care Act business, their calculations are feeding a roaring national debate over insurance premiums, widely used to gauge the success of President Obama\u2019s health care law. Health plans around the country have just filed proposed rates for 2017. State insurance commissioners are still reviewing them.But questions about the proposed increases are reverberating through the health care system and into the political campaign.\u201cHistorical experience is the lifeblood of what we do,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, in an interview at Geisinger\u2019s headquarters here. \u201cWe take that experience, adjust it for the underlying growth of health costs and project it into the future so we can estimate the expected costs for a particular insurance policy.\u201dSuch niceties may be lost in this scorching campaign season. \u201cThere is panic and anger as health care costs explode!\u201d Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, wrote in a recent Twitter post, seizing on increases of nearly 60 percent sought by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas.Geisinger is different. During debate on the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama and members of Congress repeatedly hailed it as a model providing \u201chigh-quality care at costs well below average,\u201d in the president\u2019s words.Geisinger serves residents of rural central and northeast Pennsylvania, and its roots in the community are as deep as the coal mines that once flourished here.Dr. David T. Feinberg, the president and chief executive of the Geisinger Health System, said its health plan was losing $30 million a year on coverage sold on the federal exchange in Pennsylvania. But leaving the market here would be unthinkable.\u201cFor its shareholders, United made the right decision,\u201d Dr. Feinberg said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t answer to shareholders. We answer to the nice people of Danville, Shamokin and Bloomsburg.\u201dIt would be difficult to find a health plan more aligned with the goals of the federal law. The Obama administration recruited a former chief executive of the Geisinger Health Plan, Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, to be the first director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, created by the health law to test ways to improve care and cut costs.Geisinger has been a pioneer in the use of electronic health records and genomic medicine, recruiting 100,000 patients for DNA sequencing studies in the last two years. It has embraced \u201cpay for performance,\u201d offering a warranty for major surgical procedures and promising not to charge extra if complications occur.But innovation has been no match for the actuarial surprises dealt out by the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Wrobel said Geisinger had simply underestimated how much care its new customers would need.\u201cOur rates for Medicare, Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance have been relatively stable, but those products have to bear the cost of our losses on exchange business,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said.Last October the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, headed by a former Obama administration official, approved a 20 percent increase in Geisinger\u2019s rates, about half of what the company had requested.\u201cBut based on experience,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, \u201cthe 2016 premium rate is too low, so we want to correct it in 2017.\u201dJulia T. Philips, an award-winning actuary who worked 19 years for the state of Minnesota, said insurance regulators generally do not let a company make up for past losses with future rate increases.\u201cBut regulators often allow companies to catch up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you assumed that claims would average $400 per member per month in 2015 and the actual cost was $440, you can use the higher number as a starting point in predicting claims costs for 2017.\u201dGeisinger is not alone. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department says insurers have proposed premium increases averaging 23.6 percent for individual coverage for 2017.\u201cPeople with pre-existing conditions are now getting treatment,\u201d said Antoinette Kraus, the director of a statewide consumer group, the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, \u201cand it\u2019s more expensive because they were shut out of the market for many years.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cwe expect that they\u2019ll eventually become healthier, so we won\u2019t see these huge rate increases every year.\u201dKevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, acknowledged that \u201cpent-up demand for health care is greater than people expected and is lasting longer than expected.\u201dIn April, before most insurers had filed their rate requests for 2017, the Obama administration began a campaign to play down their significance. \u201cProposed rates aren\u2019t what consumers pay,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said. \u201cMost people receive tax credits and can buy a plan for less than $75 per month.\u201dMoreover, the administration says that the health law created a competitive market in which consumers can shop for the best deal. As evidence that this market is working, the administration boasts that more than 40 percent of returning consumers switched to different plans for 2016.However, Mr. Wrobel said, such turnover is making it more difficult for insurers to predict costs. \u201cThe whole point of what we do, the foundation of good health insurance,\u201d he said, \u201cis to develop long-term relationships with our members and to make long-term investments in their health. It\u2019s not like buying a book on Amazon.\u201dBesides, he said, substantial numbers of consumers do not receive subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 12 million people will receive subsidies, in the form of tax credits, next year. But it says that an equal number \u2014 three million on the exchanges and nine million buying insurance outside the exchanges \u2014 will have to pay the full unsubsidized price.\u201cWhen we developed rates for 2014,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said, \u201cwe had no historical data. It was basically an educated guess.\u201dMr. Wrobel said rates were still being affected by a federal policy, adopted in late 2013, that allowed some people to keep and renew insurance that did not meet standards in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHealthier people chose to keep their plans,\u201d he said, \u201cso the collective cost of care for people buying insurance on the exchange was higher than expected.\u201dMany insurers hope to profit from the Affordable Care Act, but for Geisinger, the calculus is a little different.\u201cGeisinger has been here for 100 years, and we expect to be here another hundred,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said. \u201cWe are going to be taking care of the people in this community one way or another. So it\u2019s really important for this program to be financially stable and sustainable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kevin Beggs, Lionsgate\u2019s television chairman, called it \u201ca distinctive, noisy, platform-defining series\u201d that \u201cmultiple networks wanted.\u201dMr. Tatum will be an executive producer of the drama, expected to arrive next year. It will cost several million dollars per episode to make, signaling the arrival of YouTube Red as a major-league buyer of content. The series, which will feature YouTube stars as dancers and actors, will be set at a performing arts high school and be most similar in tone to the first of the five \u201cStep Up\u201d movies.\u201cIt is hard to tell whether the effort is succeeding or will succeed,\u201d Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a client report last month. \u201cIt is possible that it might be too little too late.\u201d Notably, Mr. Kirjner cited a lack of \u201chigh-production-value content\u201d as one of YouTube Red\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going to resonate,\u201d Ms. Daniels said. \u201cYou just have to sort of jump in the water.\u201dStill, the \u201cStep Up\u201d project represents a very educated guess. \u201cDance videos on YouTube drive millions of hours of watch time every month,\u201d Ms. Daniels said, adding that dance is a popular genre for YouTube around the world. YouTube Red is available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and has plans for overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.Music videos are also enormously popular on YouTube \u2014 the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies are known for their music-backed montages \u2014 and some of the biggest traditional television hits of the last decade, including \u201cEmpire,\u201d \u201cGlee\u201d and NBC\u2019s live musicals, have been rooted in song.Mr. Beggs of Lionsgate said that Ms. Daniels was able to nab the series in part because she was willing to commit to a full season without first making a pilot episode as a test. \u201cThat got everyone\u2019s attention,\u201d he said.The deal got its start at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Los Angeles home of Erik Feig, co-president of Lionsgate\u2019s movie division. Ms. Daniels was among the guests. That night, \u201cErik said the studio was getting ready to talk to distributors about a \u2018Step Up\u2019 TV show, and so I immediately started my hot pursuit,\u201d she said.More than most other Hollywood studios, Lionsgate has been early to spot the promise of streaming services as buyers of high-end television shows. Lionsgate\u2019s production roster includes \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d for Netflix and \u201cCasual,\u201d which was renewed on Hulu for a third season. (The now-concluded \u201cMad Men\u201d is still Lionsgate\u2019s best-known series, however.)Will \u201cStep Up\u201d provide the studio with another television hit, the kind that mints money by running multiple seasons? It is too early to say, of course, but Mr. Feig, who has been involved with the \u201cStep Up\u201d franchise from its beginning, has high hopes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cLet me explain why.\u201dJeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn \u201cto control our own destiny.\u201dBut there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn\u2019s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "His longtime assistant, Kathy Daly, said he died after a prolonged illness, which she did not specify. In a statement, two other co-founders of Kleiner Perkins, Brook Byers and Frank Caufield, said Mr. Perkins had helped define entrepreneurial venture capital.  Kenneth Lerer, the venture capitalist who helped found The Huffington Post and is the chairman at BuzzFeed, and Nicole Seligman, a former Sony executive and lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial, are being considered, according to people briefed on the discussions. Also on the list are Judith McHale, the former Discovery Communications chief, and Thomas J. May, the chairman of Eversource Energy utility company, these people said. It is unclear whether these people have formally accepted the positions. The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 board being illegitimate. There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed. If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws. Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in. Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash, but because it is so hard for banks to know the identity of the final customer, remittances companies and their agents are being categorized as high risk for money laundering. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase scrapped their low-cost remittance services two years ago. Last year, Citigroup agreed to pay $140 million to regulators for failing to safeguard against money laundering and shut down its Banamex USA Unit. AmeriMex Communications, a company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, said Don Aldridge, AmeriMex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief executive.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which would not be a bad thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Daniel L.

Yet when the coverage doesn\u2019t go his way, he can retaliate with lawsuits and childish fits of pique.In reality, of course, no one would be more miserable than Mr. Trump if these bans actually resulted in less coverage of his campaign \u2014 and if he is deluded enough to imagine they\u2019ll result in less honest coverage, he will be quickly disabused. As a practical matter, the bans are essentially meaningless, since reporters can enter these events with the public, free from the corral where reporters with credentials are penned up and serve as an occasional target of his mockery.Mr. Trump\u2019s annoyance is not without precedent. Presidents have often sparred with the press, some have found ways to retaliate, and all seek in one way or another to control the political story line or duck cross-examination. Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s likely Democratic opponent, has not held a news conference in months.Yet the sheer breadth and recklessness of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks reveal dark impulses that would not bode well for First Amendment freedoms in a Trump presidency.

(In 2007, for instance, she announced at an event at Carnegie Hall that Dumbledore, whose sexuality in the books was obscure, is in fact gay.)The news has been released slowly \u2014 Ms. Rowling is a master of controlled publicity \u2014 and on Tuesday cast photos of a grown-up Harry (Jamie Parker) and Ginny Potter (Poppy Miller), along with Albus (Sam Clemmett), were unveiled on the Pottermore website.Performances, at least for the first of the two parts, are sold out through May 2017. Secondary-market tickets to the first preview are selling for as much as 4,000 pounds (nearly $5,800). And the play\u2019s script \u2014 by Ms. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, who is also the director \u2014 is No. 1 on the Amazon best-seller list, despite the fact that it won\u2019t be published until July 31, Harry Potter\u2019s birthday.If that wasn\u2019t enough, next fall comes \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d a movie that is both a spinoff and a kind of prequel. Written by Ms. Rowling (who did not write the screenplays for the eight Potter movies), it is very loosely based on her book of the same name. That volume was a fictional wizarding-school textbook; the film takes its supposed author, Newt Scamander, sends him back many years to when he was a young man, and transports him to America. The movie, starring Eddie Redmayne, is expected to be the first of a trilogy.Clearly Ms. Rowling has not wanted to put Harry Potter behind her. It\u2019s an interesting dilemma for an author, particularly one who creates an elaborate world over many volumes: How do you stop? (Do you want to stop?)Both Philip Pullman, author of the \u201cDark Materials\u201d series, and Stephenie Meyer, author of the \u201cTwilight\u201d series, have spoken about further books to come, years after those stories were apparently put to rest. On the other extreme, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle grew so weary of Sherlock Holmes that he killed him off, only to resurrect him years later in response to widespread public unhappiness.\u201cI had thought, No outs whatsoever, and then I looked like a total idiot,\u201d she said.Stephen King, who has written many series as well as stand-alone novels, said the same thing tends to happen to him. In 2012, eight years after completing his seven-volume \u201cDark Tower\u201d series, for instance, he produced an eighth book, \u201cThe Wind Through the Keyhole,\u201d whose action takes place between Books 4 and 5.Characters with unfinished business inveigle themselves into his head, he said in a telephone interview. He\u2019s currently toying with going back into his Bill Hodges trilogy, though \u201cEnd of Watch,\u201d coming out next month, is meant to be the final installment. \u201cThere\u2019s a character named Holly I keep thinking about,\u201d he said.Ms. Rowling gives interviews very rarely and declined to comment for this article. But Mr. King said he sympathized with her relationship to her material. \u201cThere are two things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she likes the Harry Potter people, and it\u2019s a little bit hard for her to let go. And she\u2019s aware that there are millions and millions of people who loved those books. Writers feel responsibility to their readers, and some of that is a way of saying to the fans, \u2018If you want a little more, I\u2019ll give you a little more.\u2019\u201dIndeed, all this new material is proving very exciting to very many Potter fans. They can\u2019t get enough. The \u201cDumbledore is gay\u201d revelation, in 2007, became a major world news event. And now, even the smallest snippet of information about the play \u2014 the introduction of hand-carved sconces for each of the Hogwarts houses and of new wand designs, for instance \u2014 sends the internet into ecstasy.On May 2, Ms. Rowling issued a Tweet apologizing for killing off Remus Lupin, the reluctant werewolf, in the final book. So far, it has been retweeted more than 100,000 times and \u201cliked\u201d more than 140,000 times.Though the occasion was the anniversary of the (fictional) Battle of Hogwarts, the date for the last two years when Ms. Rowling has expressed sorrow over deceased characters, it also came at a time when excitement is building over the play.Details have been few and far between; Ms. Rowling likes to tease her fans by doling out information sparingly. Sometimes she\u2019ll respond to questions on Twitter, as she did recently when a follower asked if \u201cCursed Child\u201d would make him cry.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll be checking your vital signs,\u201d she replied, launching a thousand headlines about how she has revealed that the play will be \u201csad.\u201dAll those tidbits are just fine with Melissa Anelli, who runs the Leaky Cauldron fan website and also organizes a Potter-themed fan convention known as LeakyCon.\u201cI love everything about Harry Potter,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when I get one of those plot details or a new piece of writing, it\u2019s like a nice, full exhale.\u201d\u201cSome people say the canon is within the actual covers of the seven books and that anything she says afterward you should take as opinion,\u201d Ms. Anelli said. \u201cOthers say that anything she says is true, no matter if it\u2019s on Pottermore or on Twitter or wherever \u2014 no matter what she says, it\u2019s canonical.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Stiefvater said that she never acquiesces to fans\u2019 requests for extra information. \u201cSome people come up to me and ask me to give them material outside the books \u2014 for instance, what is Gansey\u2019s favorite ice cream flavor?\u201d she said, referring to one of her teenage protagonists. \u201cI never respond to them. Personally, I think it\u2019s unfair \u2014 it rewards only some readers and not those who don\u2019t dig through all the archives to find the new little factoids.\u201dShe counts herself a Rowling fan and considers Harry Potter\u2019s world to have closed after \u201cDeathly Hallows.\u201d\u201cI have such respect for what J. K. Rowling has done,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I engaged with her series at a moment in time, like a lot of people did. And if you return to it, it feels like it\u2019s stretching on \u2014 people aren\u2019t remembering the series as much as the cultural phenomenon.\u201d Of the new details that have emerged over the years, she said, \u201cthey ripple throughout fandom, and for fandom it\u2019s highly rewarding, but as a reader it\u2019s not how I engage with books.\u201dWith a new set of movies on the horizon, some fans worry that Ms. Rowling will make the same mistake that George Lucas did after the three original \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, producing inferior work that detracts from the brilliance of the original.But to Ms. Anelli, who was a teenager when the books were published and is now 36, there can\u2019t be enough new material.\u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s a prophet who\u2019s being handed down something from someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s creating it, and whatever she creates becomes part of the story. As long as she wants to make it, as long there\u2019s more story coming from her, I\u2019m super-happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Susan Faludi\u2019s \u2018In the Darkroom\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The message wasn\u2019t entirely a shock; Faludi had heard about her father\u2019s operation from another relative. Nevertheless, it was puzzling, because Faludi hadn\u2019t previously had any idea that her father identified as a woman. \u201cDespite our long alienation, I thought I understood enough of my father\u2019s character to have had some inkling of an inclination this profound,\u201d she writes. \u201cI had none.\u201d\u201cIn the Darkroom\u201d is Faludi\u2019s rich, arresting and ultimately generous investigation of her father, who died in 2015. It is partly an inquiry into the meaning of gender, a subject Faludi, the famous feminist, sees very differently from Stef\u00e1nie, who hewed to traditional notions of masculinity and femininity both as an overbearing patriarch and as a coquettish old woman. But in trying to understand her inscrutable father \u2014 Jewish Holocaust survivor and Leni Riefenstahl fanatic, man and woman, a sly fantasist whose tallest tales turn out to be true \u2014 Faludi transcends feminist debate. The book, which traces the decimation of her father\u2019s prosperous, assimilated Jewish clan during World War\u202fII, his improbable survival and then reinvention in Denmark, Brazil and America, and his gender metamorphosis at 76, becomes a complex act of forgiveness. (Faludi uses male pronouns when describing her father pre-transition.)Stef\u00e1nie is obsessed with Hans Christian Andersen, and initially \u201cIn the Darkroom\u201d has the otherworldly menace of a fairy tale. A few months after her father re-enters her life, Faludi visits her in Budapest. Stef\u00e1nie lives in a chalet with an elaborate alarm system behind a gate in the Buda Hills. The thick drapes seem \u00adalways to be closed. For several days she hardly leaves the house, and is resentful if her daughter tries to go out.Inside, Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s world feels claustrophobic and sordid. She once made her living as a photo developer and retoucher, and delights in showing her daughter pictures of her own face montaged onto various female bodies. \u201cStefi in a pink tutu and ballet slippers, captured in mid pli\u00e9,\u201d Faludi writes. \u201cStefi in another maid\u2019s outfit, this one belonging to a little girl, who was being disciplined by a stern schoolmarm in tweeds and lace-up boots.\u201d Her father keeps stacks of printouts of online \u201cforced feminization\u201d fiction \u2014 stories in which men are turned into women as a means of sexual humiliation \u2014 with the protagonists\u2019 names replaced by Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s own. She constantly lets her robe fall open, barges into her daughter\u2019s room in lingerie, and objects to her sleeping with the door closed. \u201cBecause I want to be treated as a woman,\u201d Stef\u00e1nie says. \u201cI want to be able to walk around without clothes and for you to treat it normally.\u201dThese scenes are both unnerving and politically volatile. Many religious conservatives, as well as some groups of radical feminists, insist that trans women aren\u2019t really women, but men with fetishes. That\u2019s one of the rationales for discriminatory laws like the one in North Carolina, which mandates that trans people use bathrooms and locker rooms matching the gender on their birth certificates.Beleaguered campaigners for trans rights, in turn, furiously reject the idea that anyone transitions to fulfill an erotic fixation. \u201cA reigning tenet of modern transgenderism holds that gender identity and sexuality are two separate realms, not to be confused,\u201d Faludi writes. Yet in her father\u2019s fantasy world, she encounters what she calls \u201ca transgender id in which becoming a woman was thoroughly sexualized, in which femininity was related in terms of bondage and humiliation and orgasm, and the transformation from one gender to another was eroticized at every step.\u201dWhat to make of this? Faludi searches the canon of transgender autobiography for a story that might offer insight into her father, but ends up frustrated. \u201cThe one plotline of I-have-always-been-a-woman was trumping all the other motivations that might reflect the crosscurrents of the human psyche,\u201d she writes. She struggles to square the idea of innate femininity, which she\u2019s not even sure exists, with her memories of her father, who had been violent and controlling in asserting masculine prerogatives.As Steven Faludi, her father had refused to let his wife work. When her parents separated, Steven smashed through the front door with a baseball bat, then repeatedly stabbed a man that Faludi\u2019s mother was seeing. During the divorce, he turned the incident into proof that Faludi\u2019s mother was unfaithful, which freed him from paying alimony. \u201cAs I confronted, nearly four decades and nine time zones away, my father\u2019s new self, it was hard for me to purge that image of the violent man from her new persona,\u201d Faludi writes.Stef\u00e1nie herself has an exhibitionist streak, but is resistant to introspection. She demands that Susan watch a graphic video of her Thai surgery, but speaks of womanhood in shallow clich\u00e9s, happily embracing the sort of sexist stereotypes Faludi has spent her life fighting. \u201cMen have to help me,\u201d she crows. \u201cI don\u2019t lift a finger.\u201d She adds: \u201cYou write about the disadvantages of being a woman, but I\u2019ve only found advantages!\u201dIn contemporary popular culture, Faludi writes, you are supposed to take people at their word about their identity: \u201cThe womanhood of male-to-female transsexuals was asserted as an inviolable absolute.\u201d For Faludi, however, her father\u2019s new identity is less a truth to be accepted than an enigma to be probed. In doing so, she excavates Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s past, discovering a person fractured amid the loss and degradation of the Holocaust. Stef\u00e1nie isn\u2019t even her father\u2019s first new name; before he was Steven Faludi he was Istv\u00e1n Friedman, only son of an aloof, self-\u00adindulgent Jewish couple in Budapest who lost everything but their lives under Nazism.Faludi knows it\u2019s far too pat to suggest that the psychic disturbance of the Holocaust made Stef\u00e1nie trans. Nevertheless, there are oblique connections between the various ruptures in her father\u2019s identity. At one point, her father implies that woman\u00adhood protects her from anti-\u00adSemitism: \u201cIt helps that I\u2019m a woman. Because women don\u2019t provoke,\u201d she says. Her insistence that her rebirth renders the past moot seems like a desperate effort to wall off trauma. \u201cWhy would I be angry?\u201d she says about her wartime history. \u201cEveryone is very nice to me. I am accepted better now as a woman than I ever was as a man.\u201dFaludi isn\u2019t the first to connect the trans experience to the Jewish one \u2014 it\u2019s a major theme of the Amazon series \u201cTransparent.\u201d But where \u201cTransparent\u201d uses Nazi Germany to show how different types of oppression can mirror each other, \u201cIn the Darkroom\u201d is after something subtler. In linking the forcible destruction of one of Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s identities to the willful jettisoning of another, Faludi seeks to understand the limits of self-reinvention. \u201cCould a new identity not only redeem but expunge its predecessor?\u201d she asks.Penetrating and lucid as it is, Faludi\u2019s book can\u2019t answer this question. By the end, however, it seems less urgent, because Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s prickly, particular humanity comes to overshadow concern about categories. Faludi even develops some appreciation for Stef\u00e1nie\u2019s audacious ability to assume new identities, which, Faludi learns, allowed for real wartime heroism. Her father would tell her a story about dressing up as a Hungarian Nazi to rescue his parents from the fascist Arrow Cross; Faludi hadn\u2019t entirely believed this tale, but she comes to learn that her father understated his valor. She never reconciles her conception of gender with that of her maddening parent, but she reconciles with her, which matters more.Michelle Goldberg is a columnist at Slate and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Goddess Pose: The Audacious Life of Indra Devi, the Woman Who Helped Bring Yoga to the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holland Festival Tackles the Enigma That Is Europe", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 \u201cWhat is left of the dream of European unity?\u201d said Ruth McKenzie, gesturing broadly.The festival opened on June 4 at the Stadsschouwburg with a wordless play by two Estonian directors, based on a work by Peter Handke. When it closes on June 26, it will have offered 45 pieces of theater, music, dance and digital works, 12 of them premieres \u2014 and dozens of talks, events, encounters and parties. Organizers expect to have roughly 75,000 visitors this year.The Holland Festival, like the Edinburgh Festival, was founded in 1947 in the shattered wake of World War II, as a demonstration of a belief in the power of art to heal and restore notions of common humanity. \u201cI find it incredibly moving that in 1947, people who were literally starving \u2014 they were eating bulbs because there was nothing else \u2014 turned to culture and decided they needed international artists to inspire them,\u201d Ms. McKenzie said.Unlike the Edinburgh Festival, however, the Holland Festival has not acquired a serious international following, though it is regarded by theater programmers and culture seekers as an important place to discover new, often experimental work. As Ms. McKenzie talked, she often paused to greet theater directors and artists from all over the world, many coming to see a matinee of Jo\u00ebl Pommerat\u2019s epic French Revolution drama, \u201c\u00c7a Ira.\u201dAmsterdam \u201cis a city with the most fantastic cultural life and several world class institutions \u2014 the opera, Dutch National Ballet, the Koncertgebouw orchestra, the Toneelgroep,\u201d Ms. McKenzie said. \u201cIn bringing international work here, you have to be adventurous, surprising and different. One of my aims is to find you an experience that you won\u2019t forget.\u201dOver four and a half hours, we move from the attempt by Louis XIV and his finance minister to raise taxes for the bankrupt state of France; their efforts to get the nobility and clergy to pay taxes alongside the bourgeoisie or third estate; the eventual formation of the representative Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the fight to write a declaration of the rights of man versus the urgent needs to address famine, fear and lawlessness.Mr. Pommerat, whose work should be much better-known to English-speaking audiences, manages to make a thrilling edge-of-the-seat drama out of the political infighting and partisanship that forged a democratic process. It is politics as riveting theater, the best history lesson you\u2019ve ever attended. It is also entirely relevant to the issues now confronting Europe: austerity, nationalism, refugees, the rise of ultraright political parties, and conflicting ideas about the meaning of freedom, equality and fraternity.Mr. McBurney is alone on stage, alternating between incarnating Loren McIntyre and reverting to himself as he muses on the workings of memory and the nature of time, and deals with his (invisible) 7-year-old daughter who keeps demanding food, drink and stories. It is a compelling, and often moving, performance, and a work that asks you to think about technology, belief systems, social customs, rapacious materialism, the environment and theater itself. You can see Mr. McBurney creating the effects before your eyes; you know a team of technicians is hard at work. Nonetheless, it\u2019s the imagination that does the transporting.That wasn\u2019t the case with \u201cPrivacy,\u201d a coproduction by two Dutch theater companies, Die Warme Winkel and Wunderbaum, which featured two naked actors (Wine Dierickx and Ward Weemhoff) talking about their sex lives, toilet problems and fertility issues. It was clearly an attempt to explore the boundaries of what can be said onstage (the fertility conversation feels most painfully wrong), but it felt more like a workshop than a realized piece.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Louis D. Brandeis: American Prophet,\u2019 Moral Vision and a True Believer\u2019s Zeal", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesLouis Brandeis geared up for combat when J. P. Morgan\u2019s New Haven Railroad tried to buy the Boston and Maine lines. Brandeis hated the thought of what he called \u201ca monster corporation controlling all transportation facilities of New England,\u201d and lobbied fiercely against the merger. Morgan prevailed, \u201cbut it took all the power of the Republican machine and of the bankers\u2019 money to do it,\u201d Brandeis wrote, \u201cand I am well content with the fight made.\u201dBrandeis would win many other battles on behalf of his people: consumers, workers, small-business men and other common folk. He rode his success as \u201cthe people\u2019s lawyer\u201d into President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inner circle as an influential economic adviser, and then onto the Supreme Court, where he was the first Jewish justice and a progressive champion.The brilliant, crusading Brandeis is the subject of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s excellent \u201cLouis D. Brandeis: American Prophet.\u201d The book, part of the Yale Jewish Lives series, is not a full biography \u2014 that ground is already well trod \u2014 but rather a concise and sympathetic exploration of Brandeis\u2019s main intellectual causes. It is well titled: Brandeis resembled an Old Testament prophet \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt called him \u201cold Isaiah\u201d \u2014 with his highly articulated moral vision and true believer\u2019s zeal. It is also well timed: Mr. Rosen persuasively makes his case that recognizing Brandeis as an \u201cAmerican prophet\u201d \u201cseems more important today than ever.\u201dBrandeis was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1856, to immigrant Jewish parents. Like many Southerners \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, whom he revered \u2014 Brandeis developed a strong sympathy for farmers and state governments, and a mistrust of big government and big business.It was not long after Brandeis graduated from Harvard Law School, at the top of his class, and began practicing law in Boston that he developed the first of his intellectual passions. He and his law partner wrote a groundbreaking Harvard Law Review article, \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d which warned that cutting-edge technologies like \u201cinstantaneous photographs\u201d were infringing on what he proposed as a new legal right: \u201cthe right to be let alone.\u201dAt first, Brandeis represented corporations, but he soon found another of his causes: the plight of workers. He won a major victory in 1908, in Muller v. Oregon, when he persuaded a pro-business Supreme Court to uphold a maximum-hours law for women. Brandeis, who had a reverence for facts and a deep interest in the real-world impact of law, transformed legal advocacy by filing what would later be known as a \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d: one with more facts and sociology than legal precedents.Brandeis\u2019s concerns about big corporations went beyond their labor practices: He saw them as antithetical to America\u2019s democratic ideals. In his view, it was the size of these corporations that was the problem \u2014 and this became another cause, a career-long battle against what he called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d Brandeis\u2019s prescription was aggressive trustbusting, and his public advocacy and work for President Wilson helped clear the way for the landmark Clayton Antitrust Act.There was one more cause Brandeis was passionate about: Zionism. When he represented striking New York garment workers, he got to know immigrant Jews who had fled the pogroms of Eastern Europe. Hearing their stories firsthand, Brandeis came to believe that the Jews needed a homeland where they could control their own destiny \u2014 and he soon became the leader of the American Zionist movement.Mr. Rosen is particularly original on this subject, showing how Brandeis rooted his Zionist thinking in American values of democracy and pluralism \u2014 and emphasizing Brandeis\u2019s insistence that any Jewish state had to proceed in a spirit of equality, with full political rights and economic inclusion for its Arab citizens.Wilson appointed Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916, and he was confirmed over the opposition of corporate interests and anti-Semites. On the court, he had many opportunities to give voice to his deeply held beliefs, sometimes in dissent.In Whitney v. California, a case about free-speech rights for radicals, Brandeis wrote a concurrence that is often called the most eloquent opinion ever written on the value of freedom of expression. His dissent in Olmstead v. United States, an early wiretapping case, was perhaps his most visionary, warning that \u201cdiscovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\u201dBecause of his deep distrust of big government, Brandeis was not always a reliable progressive vote on the court, and not all of his decisions have stood the test of time. He joined the majority in striking down a federal law aimed at ending child labor, and later voted to declare three New Deal laws unconstitutional in a single day, delivering a major blow to Roosevelt\u2019s plans for combating the Great Depression. In his deference to state legislatures, Brandeis voted to uphold some highly illiberal state laws, including \u2014 though his reasons for doing so are unclear \u2014 Virginia\u2019s 1924 law authorizing eugenic sterilizations.But despite Brandeis\u2019s occasional misfires, his philosophies, as Mr. Rosen convincingly argues, speak powerfully to our times \u2014 in his views on the threat that technology poses to privacy, on the importance of pluralism and equality in the Middle East and, perhaps most of all, on economic matters.Today\u2019s polemics about what unfettered capitalism is doing to ordinary Americans \u2014 from Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right \u2014 is terrain Brandeis covered, more deeply, with more cogent suggestions for reform. And his warnings about the \u201ccurse of bigness\u201d speak powerfully to an age in which the internet appears structurally inclined to create category-killing behemoths: Google for search, Amazon for retailing and Facebook, it seems, for just about everything else.Most of all, what the Gospel of Brandeis offers is a conviction that fact-based analysis and enlightened policy-making can help to set the world right. Brandeis never abandoned his pure faith that, with hard work and due deliberation, all things are possible. After all, he observed at an arbitration proceeding, \u201cmost of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.\u201dAdam Cohen, a former member of The New York Times editorial board, is the author, most recently, of \u201cImbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck.\u201dLouis D.

Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software company\u2019s finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets became more uncertain, investors preferred that companies going public turn a profit.Twilio had $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.Bessemer Venture Partners first backed Twilio in 2009 and is its largest shareholder, owning about 25 percent of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Fidelity Investments and Union Square Ventures also hold significant stakes. These entities, as well as certain executives, hold 98.6 percent of the voting power after the public offering because of their ownership of supervoting stock.Jeff Lawson, 38, founded the company eight years ago and is its chief executive. Before Twilio, he started Nine Star, a retailer of equipment and apparel for the skate, ski, surf and BMX sports crowd. He also worked for Amazon as technical product manager and was chief technology officer at StubHub.The company plans to use the net proceeds to expand its engineering, sales and marketing and customer support teams, and potentially to acquire businesses or other assets.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase managed the offering.

I\u2019m seriously considering switching to Android, that\u2019s how annoying this is to me. O.K., now you go and tell me why Apple would do this. It seems like a real strong way to alienate users.So basically it looks like the new iPhone will be roughly the same phone we have now, with one major thing missing. What is Apple thinking? We won\u2019t know exactly until it releases the new phone later this year, but this seems bad to me. Sales of the iPhone are already flat. The company needed something big this year. Now it\u2019s creating a device that many might consider a downgrade rather than an upgrade.Yeah, sure, but that argument doesn\u2019t really hold for the audio jack, because it is basically perfect in its current state, and honestly I can\u2019t see any reason for upgrading. As you point out, today\u2019s headphone jack works on just about every device you have (including airplanes). One based on Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning connector will work only on iOS devices and not anywhere else \u2014 not even current Macs, which lack a Lightning port. So guess what? You\u2019ll need to get a little adapter, or dongle, to carry with you all the time. And what about wireless headphones? Well, those work on today\u2019s iPhones, and getting rid of the headphone jack doesn\u2019t somehow make them better.Advertisement"}

The question now is not just who will buy it, but what exactly they will be paying for.But while company\u2019s public image \u2014 and troubles \u2014 have centered around its aggressive and boundary-testing flagship news site, Gawker.com, potential buyers may be interested in a less visible part of its business: e-commerce.In recent years, Gawker Media has tried to build up its e-commerce revenue \u2014 earned from lucrative commissions taken from referrals to sites like Amazon \u2014 as a hedge against an increasingly uncertain online news environment, in which platforms like Google and Facebook take ever-larger shares of advertising revenue.But while that kind of revenue was growing, Gawker Media\u2019s commerce plans never fully came to fruition. The effort was hindered by an obsessive focus on developing Kinja, the company\u2019s internal content management and commenting system, as well as the creation of numerous subsites with distinct brands, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s financial situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.Now, with financial independence off the table, Gawker Media\u2019s e-commerce operation may nonetheless play an outsize role in determining the company\u2019s fate. Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, a technology publisher that entered a first bid for the company \u2014 reportedly between $90 million and $100 million \u2014 wrote in a memo to staff that \u201clike us, GMG is heavily active in driving commerce-based revenues, and has an impressive publishing and commerce platform with Kinja.\u201dMr. Denton also referred to the consumer component in his own announcement.While affirming his site\u2019s commitment to \u201ctelling the true stories that underpin credibility with our millions of readers,\u2019\u2019 he also wrote, \u201ca combination would marry Ziff Davis\u2019 strength in e-commerce, licensing and video with GMG\u2019s premium media brands.\u201dZiff Davis, a major presence in the pre-blog technology and gaming press, filed for bankruptcy itself in 2008, and is now, in a substantially different form, a subsidiary of the internet services and publishing conglomerate j2 Global. The company\u2019s interest in a deal was fueled by Gawker\u2019s portfolio of tech, lifestyle and gaming sites that together, through e-commerce and advertising, make up 85 percent of Gawker Media\u2019s total revenue, according to another person briefed on the finances.If it was difficult to imagine Gawker Media, the persistently antagonistic outsider, as part of a larger and more risk-averse company, Mr. Shah\u2019s memo provided some clues.\u201cThe additions of Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Kotaku would fortify our position in consumer tech and gaming,\u201d Mr. Shah wrote in his memo. \u201cWith the addition of Jalopnik, Deadspin and Jezebel, we would broaden our position as a lifestyle publisher.\u201dThe memo did not mention Gawker.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind the Gold Curtain of Donald Trump\u2019s R\u00e9sum\u00e9", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyAndrew Beal, a billionaire banker and investor, called me the other day to talk Trump. I had been leaving messages for every prominent business executive I could find who has publicly expressed support of the Republican candidate.Before I could ask my first question, Beal told me he wanted to get something out of the way. He knew that I would ask about specifics. \u201cEverybody wants to be real specific,\u201d he said. But Beal\u2019s support for Trump has nothing to do with specifics. He grants that he doesn\u2019t know much about Trump\u2019s policy goals or about whom he might choose for key economic positions. He doesn\u2019t even think Trump knows. And that, he explained, is exactly why he supports him. \u201cAll these politicians with all these specific plans,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s total [expletive].\u201dHis point was that business doesn\u2019t run this way: If you\u2019re hiring someone to be a chief executive, you don\u2019t ask them to lay out every decision they\u2019ll make, years ahead of when they\u2019ll make it. You hire someone whom you trust, and you let them run things. Beal says he knows that Trump will do the right things to make the economy perform better. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say, \u2018How?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. I know that sounds crazy. That\u2019s how the real world operates.\u201dNow that Trump has sewn up the nomination, a looming question is whether he can consolidate the support of business people behind him. During the last election cycle, Mitt Romney\u2019s business background was a major reason he became the candidate of choice for corporate America; he received huge donations from nearly every major bank, many business-advocacy groups and countless chief executives. But at least so far, such eminences have failed to rally around Trump. The only large corporate donor named in his federal election filings is Aon, the insurance giant; when I called its public-relations office, a seemingly exasperated spokeswoman wanted to make very clear that one employee had given that money and that it did not reflect the views of the company.I asked Trump\u2019s campaign for a list of prominent businesspeople and chief executives who have endorsed him. I was emailed a quote from Trump. \u201cI have too many to mention,\u201d it read. \u201cI get along with everybody.\u201d After further prodding, a campaign spokeswoman provided a list of 10 names, including the chief executives of Nascar and Marvel, as well as several other businesspeople, like Rupert Murdoch and Jack Welch, who opposed Trump for most of the campaign but have recently (and not especially enthusiastically) made statements about party unity.Does he? By many accounts, Mitt Romney did. Romney was an undeniable superstar in the field of private equity, and former business associates praised him as someone who could see a business problem more clearly than others and create powerful, profitable solutions. The professional biography of Trump, by contrast \u2014 though the man is clearly exceptional at something \u2014 hardly inspires such confidence.Trump\u2019s primary claim to fame is as a Manhattan real-estate developer. He inherited this profession (and his economic worldview) from his father. But it\u2019s worth stressing that within the world of Manhattan real estate, Trump is a relatively minor player. Yes, there are about a dozen buildings in New York City that bear his name, but nearly all are branding relationships, not actual ownership. He sits so far down the pecking order of Manhattan real estate that Adam Pincus, head of research at the industry publication The Real Deal, doesn\u2019t recall ever including Trump or his companies in their major rankings of developers, owners or property managers. Likewise, Trump\u2019s importance in the industry of casinos and luxury resorts is far below what his public reputation might suggest. After multiple bankruptcies, Trump no longer owns any casinos; he owns only nine hotels, with three more said to be \u201ccoming soon.\u201dThrough Trump Productions, he has enjoyed remarkable success with his TV show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d But of course, that series does not fundamentally belong to him: It was created by Mark Burnett, who cast Trump in the lead. And while Trump\u2019s television franchise at least enjoyed one successful idea before petering out, most of his brand-specific businesses have simply failed outright. The frenetic, panicky way in which he thrusts his name on different products pell-mell \u2014 steaks and ties and wine and bottled water and suits and fragrance \u2014 has engendered what any corporate branding expert would call \u201cbrand confusion.\u201d (What are you communicating when you wear a Trump-branded suit \u2014 $143 on Amazon \u2014 to a job interview? That you are brash and ambitious? Cocky on the cheap? Or that you don\u2019t know much about suits?)His scattershot approach to branding might also hint at cash-flow issues. As a certified billionaire, Mark Cuban recently said in a radio interview: \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting your name on steaks, you\u2019re putting your name on water, you\u2019re putting your name on playing cards, you\u2019re putting your name on all this nonsense, right, you\u2019re not going to make big bucks, no matter what.\u201d He recalls asking Trump: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Are you that desperate for money?\u201d Based on his read of Trump\u2019s election filings, which showed only $165 million in liquid assets, Cuban harbors doubts about whether Trump is even a billionaire as he claims.Recent revelations about Trump University, the failed for-profit college that Trump founded in 2005, have centered around the savagely cynical manner in which sales reps separated students from their money, with an array of high-pressure tactics that included encouraging financially challenged prospects to open up new credit-card accounts in order to pay. But the more striking question is Cuban\u2019s: why a man with as much money as Trump claims to have, presiding over as many successful ventures as Trump claims to own, would stoop to start up a boiler-room business like Trump University, squeezing out revenues from would-be students a few thousand dollars at a time. The fact that he did \u2014 even if that decision doesn\u2019t point, as Cuban suggests, to an outright desperation for cash \u2014 speaks volumes about Trump\u2019s utter inability to calibrate risk and reward.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Birth Control via App Finds Footing Under Political Radar", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byA quiet shift is taking place in how women obtain birth control. A growing assortment of new apps and websites now make it possible to get prescription contraceptives without going to the doctor.The development has potential to be more than just a convenience for women already on birth control. Public health experts hope it will encourage more to start, or restart, using contraception and help reduce the country\u2019s stubbornly high rate of unintended pregnancies, as well as the rate of abortions.And as apps and websites, rather than legislative proposals or taxpayer-funded programs, the new services have so far sprung up beneath the political radar and grown through word of mouth, with little of the furor that has come to be expected in issues involving reproductive health.At least six digital ventures, by private companies and nonprofits, including Planned Parenthood, now provide prescriptions written by clinicians after women answer questions about their health online or by video. All prescribe birth control pills, and some prescribe patches, rings and morning-after pills. Some ship contraceptives directly to women\u2019s doors.Some accept insurance, including Medicaid for women with low incomes; some charge modest fees. Some send prescriptions to local pharmacies, where women can present their insurance information when picking up the contraceptives.A growing number of websites and apps enable women to obtain birth control without visiting a doctor. Answer these four questions to find out which one best fits your situation.\u201cI thought it was just a setup to get money,\u201d she said. But after she answered the health questions one evening, \u201ca doctor actually contacted me after office hours,\u201d and the next morning, she picked up three months\u2019 worth of pills.Efforts to eliminate hurdles to contraception \u2014 including the Obama administration\u2019s controversial requirement under the Affordable Care Act that all health plans pay for prescription birth control \u2014 have often been met with emotional political and religious opposition.Many health experts consider hormonal contraceptives safe enough to be sold over the counter. But efforts to make that happen have stirred opposition from some conservatives. And pursuing over-the-counter sales would entail manufacturers undertaking the yearslong application process to the Food and Drug Administration. Women\u2019s groups and others would also seek guarantees that nonprescription birth control would be covered by insurance.But the new websites and apps could reach many more women. They require no legislative approval since clinicians still write the prescriptions. The ventures must follow telemedicine regulations, which vary by state, and can only prescribe in states where their clinicians are licensed. But they are expanding rapidly (some handle nonreproductive health issues too), and now women in most states can use one or more of them.Sara Montoya, 21, a student at California State University at Fullerton, said she felt uncomfortable visiting a doctor because at 15, she and her mother had asked her pediatrician for contraception and he had discouraged them, saying, \u201c \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t want to be doing that. You\u2019re too young.\u2019 \u201dRecently, after a hiatus from birth control pills, she was unsure how to go about getting them again. \u201cIt\u2019s so untalked about, like a taboo thing,\u201d she said.As of Jan. 1, women in Oregon can get contraceptives directly from a pharmacy, without having to go to a doctor first. Here are answers to a few questions about the new law.\u201cThe website just made it so casual,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat? You just upload your picture, no background check or anything?\u201dNurx is expanding to other states, said Hans Gangeskar, a co-founder, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a ridiculous amount of traffic that we\u2019re struggling to handle.\u201dMany ventures hope to avoid controversy by being more restrictive than medically required. While Nurx has prescribed to 13-year-olds, most set older minimum ages. Prjkt Ruby\u2019s minimum age is a state\u2019s age of consent for sexual activity, ranging from 16 to 18.\u201cWe are being especially conservative by choice,\u201d said Dr. Jason Hwang, Lemonaid\u2019s chief medical officer. He said Lemonaid\u2019s minimum age is 18, \u201cnot based on clinical grounds; it was a political decision. We didn\u2019t want people who might be under 18, who might still have parents who would get upset if we were making decisions for them.\u201dPlanned Parenthood, whose every move is scrutinized by anti-abortion activists, has also introduced an app, Planned Parenthood Care, which requires video visits with doctors or nurse practitioners. About two-thirds of the roughly 19,000 users to date were new to Planned Parenthood, said Jill Balderson, the organization\u2019s vice president of online health strategy. While users of nonvideo apps appreciate the anytime-anywhere aspect, she said some Planned Parenthood Care clients like video encounters because, beyond contraception, they want \u201can in-depth consultation with an expert.\u201dSome experts committed to expanding contraceptive access, like Dr. Mark DeFrancesco of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, sounded a few cautionary notes. Dr. DeFrancesco, the immediate past president of the group, which endorses making contraceptives nonprescription, praised the services\u2019 convenience, but said he worried that women participating in the brief digital interactions with clinicians might think, \u201cNow, I don\u2019t have to go to a doctor\u201d at all.He added that, since some services do not take insurance, customers may pay fees they would not incur if they had received a prescription during a doctor\u2019s appointment.Some digital customers later decide to visit doctors, as did Kristina Campbell, 31, a mother of two, who used Lemonaid after moving to Lancaster, Pa., \u201ca conservative area where to find a doctor that I even agree with about using birth control was a little bit tough,\u201d she said. Ms. Hashem in Michigan scheduled a face-to-face physician\u2019s appointment because the pills caused her uncomfortable side effects.But for Jill Atilano, 39, a mother of two in Menifee, Calif., who works in a winery, the goal is saving time and costly co-payments. Her general practitioner said for contraception she would need blood work and a visit with a specialist.\u201cIt\u2019s been, for years, going through these nonstop hoops of fire to get birth control,\u201d said Ms. Atilano, who now uses Lemonaid. She said its only option, pills, is not her preferred method, \u201cbut if I went through my normal physician and the referrals, I would be six months pregnant before I would get my hands on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone would be just a well-made phone without the apps that allow people to personalize it with their favorite games, news, business, social and video services. Software makers need Apple, too: They badly want to be on the devices that people carry with them everywhere, especially as traditional websites and desktop computers fade in importance.When Apple\u2019s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\u201cIs Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \u201cTheir app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.\u201dAs the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Big outfits like Major League Baseball have always been treated well by Apple. The league had an app ready at the 2008 unveiling of the App Store, and Mr. Bowman said he talked regularly with Mr. Schiller and Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services.Fanify allows musicians to live-stream concerts, with viewers dropping tips into a virtual jar to compensate them \u2014 \u201clike a street artist, but in an app,\u201d as Ms. Schuman put it. She planned a June 1 release and had several artists lined up to promote the app during its first few days. She submitted the app for approval 10 days ahead of time to allow plenty of time for review.Apple\u2019s initial response was quick, but Fanify ended up in an extended back and forth as it tried to address various problems. At one point, Apple raised a fundamental objection, saying that Fanify\u2019s method for tipping artists, which used the online payment services Venmo and PayPal, violated Apple\u2019s requirement that all in-app payments be routed through iTunes so the company could take its 30 percent cut.Ms. Schuman and her developer had to rewrite the app to force users to buy tokens that they could then use to tip musicians. The app was finally approved on Thursday, nine days after the first concerts were supposed to have taken place.\u201cIt ruined our whole launch,\u201d she said.Apple declined requests to interview Mr. Schiller or other executives about its relationship with developers. The company said in January that the App Store had generated nearly $40 billion in revenue for developers since it was created.Getting an app noticed is one of the biggest problems for a small developer. The search function in the App Store follows no apparent logic in displaying results, leaving most apps lost in the pile. Apple\u2019s system for choosing which ones to highlight on the front page of the store is similarly opaque.\u201cIt used to feel like a frontier town where lots of people bought apps and tried new things,\u201d said Phill Ryu, who helped found the software studio Impending. \u201cNow it feels more like a lottery ticket.\u201dWhen an app maker wins that lottery, the benefits are tremendous.Apple asked Dr. Tashman to keep in touch as he developed the app over the next few years, and LiquidText was showcased in the App Store for two weeks when the app was introduced last September. \u201cWe got a banner right on top of the App Store,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 100,000 downloads in two weeks.\u201d When the iPad Pro was introduced in November, LiquidText received another round of promotion from Apple.The new search ads for the App Store will allow developers to buy attention if they are not lucky enough to get that kind of free publicity from Apple\u2019s editors. Although the ads will be available to everyone, it is unclear whether prime search terms will end up being bought mostly by big marketers. App developers, most notably game makers, spent $3 billion last year in the United States alone to promote downloads of their software inside Facebook, Twitter and other apps, according to eMarketer.Bryan Wiener, executive chairman of 360i, a digital advertising agency, predicted that airlines, retailers and video streaming services would eagerly pay for advertising slots in the App Store. \u201cSearch will be table stakes,\u201d he said.While overall app download trends favor a handful of top developers, Apple has made other moves to improve life for the smaller fry.The company is giving more guidance to developers about ways to market their apps, said Brian Mueller, who has been an Apple developer for three years. He makes the Carrot series of apps, including ones for weather, exercise and to-do lists.Apple is also more actively choosing what appears on the front page of the App Store, where popular, new and interesting apps are prominently featured. \u201cIt signals to users that the App Store is a place to check throughout the week,\u201d Mr. Mueller said. \u201cA lot of developers were asking and hoping for this.\u201dDevelopers say they still hope Apple will make more improvements. They want the company to continue to improve search in the App Store and let developers respond to user comments. They also say that communication with Apple is still largely one-way.\u201cYou can\u2019t fix overnight all of the grievances that piled up,\u201d Mr. Ryu said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201dWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201dIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201dEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201dBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201dYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201dIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Devices That Deserve to Go Along on Vacation", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byTech FixCHILDREN are usually forced to pick just one or two of their beloved stuffed animals to take with them on summer vacation. Adults should consider doing the same with their electronic devices.You don\u2019t want to weigh down your travel bag with gear you will barely use. And you probably should leave your more expensive gadgets at home, unless you want to become a target for muggers.What to do? My personal packing starts with devices that are compact and lightweight. The price tag should not exceed $500, and if my smartphone can capably perform a task, I don\u2019t bother with something that does the same thing.This happens too often: After cramming into your airplane seat, you shut your eyes to relax and a baby starts screaming behind you. You need a media device to drown out the noise with music or a movie.As for earphones, I will skip recommending a fancy pair of earbuds \u2014 just another small, valuable item to lose on a trip. The earbuds that came with your smartphone, like the Apple EarPods, should sufficiently drown out the noise.Most hotels include cable television, but after channel surfing for a few hours, you will realize that the only movies that ever seem to air are \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201dThe most annoying part of renting a car is all the upsells, particularly the extra fee for a GPS device and a mount \u2014 as if your smartphone did not provide maps already.When renting a house on Airbnb or a similar site like HomeAway, the situation may be different from a hotel if a large group and a kitchen are involved.This may sound odd, but I have found it extremely useful to pack a sous vide precision cooker on Airbnb trips. First, a primer: A sous vide cooker heats water to a precise temperature; you seal food like steaks and salmon into plastic bags and immerse them in the water to cook them evenly at that temperature.The benefit of bringing along a sous vide cooker is the amount of time it frees up for you to enjoy other activities instead of paying attention to your food. Imagine going hiking for three hours and returning to a perfectly cooked medium-rare beef roast. It beats going to a restaurant.When you\u2019re outside, you don\u2019t need much technology other than a camera. Assuming you bought a smartphone in the last few years, don\u2019t bother packing an extra camera like a GoPro \u2014 that\u2019s just extra space and another power cable to carry around.Advertisement"}
