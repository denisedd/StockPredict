{"Headline": "Tech Incubators on a Mission of Diversity", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipCHICAGO \u2014 Many tech start-ups are in the business of making themselves successful. But some entrepreneurs have set up businesses with the express mission of training others to be successful in the tech sector.Several of those start-ups have dedicated themselves to creating programs, incubators or accelerators to train blacks and Hispanics for tech jobs.Their efforts are coming at a time when Silicon Valley has increasingly been scrutinized for its lack of diversity. But instead of leaving it to the tech giants to solve the problem alone, some see their own connections as a way to address the issue.Founders of these start-ups say tech companies have to try new ways of seeking out talent. With the guiding hand of these programs, many alumni have gone on to secure tech internships and jobs or form their own start-ups.Angela Benton, founder of NewME, an accelerator for entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, said she faced skepticism about whether her business model was possible. Instead, Silicon Valley influencers encouraged her to scour elite institutions to find minority entrepreneurs to help.Ms. Benton said she discovered that some of the most talented entrepreneurs weren\u2019t aiming to create the next billion-dollar start-up. Rather, the entrepreneurs of color were content to begin a company worth a few million dollars.Over five years, the NewME accelerator has helped businesses raise more than $20 million in venture capital funding. It offers one-week programs and has more than 20,000 members so far.Many established accelerators and start-up incubators tend to be in regions and cities dominated by existing tech or business firms. For the new entrepreneurs, a key to success is setting up in underserved areas.Emile Cambry Jr., the founder of the nonprofit tech incubator Blue1647, chose to open its first location in Chicago\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood, a primarily Hispanic neighborhood southwest of the city\u2019s bustling downtown.The classes are not for dabblers. The company developed its curriculum to train students in Java, Ruby and other computer languages. It also provides a shared work space for entrepreneurs and connects students with internships, jobs and networking opportunities.Since its founding in 2013, the nonprofit has expanded to Chicago\u2019s Roseland neighborhood, as well as St. Louis and Compton, Calif. A low-income area of Austin, Tex., is next.Some alumni have interned at Google, Answers.com and other tech companies, while others have started their own businesses or landed tech jobs, Mr. Cambry said.Even with tech backing, many of these ventures initially faced hurdles, like raising money or finding the best way to publicize community outreach.Kenneth Watkins, chief strategy officer at Blue1647, said he noticed that the Hispanic girls shone the most at the group\u2019s internship accelerator programs, but there weren\u2019t enough organizations catering to their specific needs, like bilingual skills. So in 2014, he started Latina Girls Code, which also offers training in 3-D printing and creating wearable tech. The program has only trained 83 Latinas, most of whom are third-generation, in HTML, CSS, Javascript and other programming languages.But working with overlooked communities comes with unexpected challenges. For example, Mr. Watkins noticed that Chicago workshop locations discouraged some students and their families from participating because some feared being targeted by immigration officials or the police while traveling to the city.\u201cWe now have to do an Aurora thing and a Joliet thing \u2014 we have to do two different events, because they just can\u2019t travel but so far,\u201d he said.To expand, the founders of such ventures realize that collaborating with investors and tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google brings in more resources for their programs.Doing so takes networking in tech circles and reaching out to companies who aim to diversify their staff and directly asking for their support, Mr. Watkins said. For him, it meant going to meet-ups and emphasizing to tech giants that supporting his organization could help close the diversity gap.\u201cA lot of people like what you do until you start asking for money. Then it becomes quiet,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. \u201cYou really have to have people in those positions who can really be advocates.\u201dSome of the most successful graduates of the start-ups would never have considered careers in technology. Nehemiah Bishop, a Chicago South Side native who earned his accounting degree at the University of Illinois-Chicago, \u201cslept in hotels and lived in vans at one point\u201d in his life, but he received help from his brother and others to finish college.An accounting internship made him realize that it wasn\u2019t the field he wanted to pursue. He enrolled in Blue1647\u2019s HTML, CSS and JavaScript class and a Ruby on Rails class, which helped him land a Google internship. He was hired as an industrial engineer at UPS in May.\u201cAt Blue1647, when you come in to take a basic coding class, to get help with a start-up or to just come in for help with your homework, you come in to a family environment,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. The incubator provides \u201cthat extra help of guidance from individuals that look like you, individuals that care for you as much as your parents care for you and who believe in you without a doubt.\u201dMany of these ventures say that to really make a difference, more collaborations with established tech companies are necessary.\u201cThere\u2019s enough out there for everybody to eat,\u201d Mr. Liddell said. \u201cIf we stay in our neighborhoods instead of moving out, we get the jobs and go back and hire from our neighborhoods and train from our neighborhoods, then we have a better outlook over all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This fall, five states will vote on legalizing marijuana to one degree or another. The largest vote is in California, where pot is already allowed for a wide range of medical complaints.Marijuana legalization follows an interesting and little-noted curve in America\u2019s relationship with vice: Major recessions, which lower tax revenue, tend to create the legalization (and heavy taxation) of commonplace illicit practices. The Great Depression brought back drinking. State lotteries became widely popular in the long downturns of the 1970s. The recession of 2008 seems to have lit a million legal joints. Who knows what we\u2019ll get with the economic shock that doubtless lies a few decades hence.Microsoft isn\u2019t doing anything quite so bong-friendly, of course, but rather providing another service in its capacious offering of software for managing government functions. That is still a pretty big deal, because the official (and vocal) involvement of a mainstream American company in any part of the business helps legitimize it.It may have been easier for Microsoft than others, because it is headquartered in Seattle. Voters there said yes to legal marijuana in 2012, and the first store opened in 2014.Or maybe it could be one of history\u2019s oldest legal highs: the prospect of making a lot of money. As Mr. Popper reports, legal marijuana sales are expected to hit $6.5 billion this year, a 35 percent increase from 2015. If California and some others come in for recreational use, that figure could reach $25 billion. There\u2019s good money in software to tax Big Weed.Advertisement"}

Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

It puts LinkedIn\u2019s enterprise value at 79 times the social network\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the 12 months that ended on March 31.On the basis of that multiple, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIn\u2019s monthly active users. By comparison, when Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion two years ago, it spent $40 for every user.For LinkedIn, the attractions of the deal are obvious: Its shares fell nearly 42 percent from the beginning of the year through last week, as investors expressed disappointment over a weak earnings forecast for 2016. Finding a buyer with deep pockets dulls the pain of being a publicly traded company.The question is whether other suitors will emerge with rich offers in hand.One perennial subject of deal rumors is another social network: Twitter.Shares of Twitter jumped nearly 7 percent in trading on Monday, borne aloft by investors\u2019 hopes that the struggling tech company might finally receive a takeover offer.

{"Headline": "China Wins New Bragging Rights in Supercomputers", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers provides more evidence that the once-yawning technology gap between the United States and China is closing.Also for the first time, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer uses Chinese-made microprocessor chips instead of chips from Silicon Valley\u2019s Intel.Supercomputers are viewed in scientific circles as an indicator of national technology leadership, and they are vital for research in areas ranging from the development of new weapons and medicines, to the design of cars and consumer products. American computing experts and business executives have warned for years that leadership in supercomputing is vital to a range of national interests.\u201cToday even consumer detergent bottles are designed with supercomputers,\u201d said Eric D. Isaacs, a physicist and provost of the University of Chicago. \u201cThe Chinese are getting good at building these computers, and it\u2019s a competitive issue now for U.S. industry and national security.\u201dThe United States primacy on the Top500 list has slipped for a number of reasons. Government support for supercomputing has been slowed by long-running debates on the level of federal spending on basic scientific research, as well as opposition to funding for industrial innovation that is not directly related to national security.In the private sector, companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon invested billions of dollars in cloud-computing centers that don\u2019t focus as much on solving scientific problems.And last year, the United States blocked the sale of a number of advanced microprocessors to China over concerns they were being used in nuclear weapon development, which most likely accelerated the development of China\u2019s own technology, said Jack Dongarra, a University of Tennessee computer scientist who helped create the list of the world\u2019s fastest computers in 1993.The Top500 list is maintained by Dr. Dongarra and Erich Strohmaier, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Individual computing centers report descriptions and performance to them twice a year.In 2001, there were no Chinese supercomputers on the Top500. Now, China has 167 systems on the list compared to 165 from the United States. China also leads a more obscure category \u2014 total processing power, or the combined computing speeds of all of its supercomputers on the list.The fastest machine, the Sunway TaihuLight System, was installed this year at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, in China\u2019s Jiangsu province.Despite those achievements, Intel still provided the chips for 91 percent of the machines on the list. And China is still catching up with the United States in state-of-the-art technologies, like software and the networking that links the thousands of chips in a modern supercomputer.But that could soon change. Officials at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the Chinese government has an ambitious $150 billion program to acquire as well as develop new technologies in various kinds of chips.After years of neglect, the United States does appear to be taking the competitive threat seriously, said John Neuffer, president of the S.I.A. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to double down on supercomputing and get ourselves back on track,\u201d he said.While the Chinese have perfected the manufacture of traditional supercomputers pioneered by American companies like IBM and Cray, the United States may focus on new, more efficient supercomputers that might lead to machines intended for challenges like artificial intelligence, according to Larry Smarr, a physicist who directs the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego.One of the design challenges of the fastest computers is their vast power consumption. The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer in China, which could fill a large warehouse, requires the same electric power needed to run roughly 15,000 homes. An exascale supercomputer will very likely require more than twice that amount of power, or roughly the amount of power produced by the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, the largest producer of solar power in the United States.At the same time, even if the United States is able to design an exascale computer within the next decade, the Chinese could get there first. According to Dr. Dongarra, the Chinese government is committed to reaching the exascale goal by the end of this decade.Because of funding shortages and technology challenges, \u201cthere has been a delay in getting the exascale launched in the U.S., and as a result, we\u2019re further behind than we should be,\u201d he said.The Sunway supercomputer in Wuxi is a marvel of Chinese manufacturing prowess, Dr. Dongorra noted. The computer is based on 10.6 million processor \u201ccores\u201d spread across 40,960 microprocessors that work together. The chips are relatively slow individually \u2014 about the speed of the processor in Apple\u2019s iPhone 6.The Sunway machine does have its shortcomings. It has older memory-chip technology, meaning it is limited in the speed with which it can move data in and out of each processor when compared with the most powerful American supercomputers. And the new Chinese supercomputer is still based on American-made optical network technology that is used to connect the thousands of microprocessor chips.Despite the fact that the Chinese now have the most supercomputers on the list, the United States still dominates the top 20, with 10 machines. There are now 105 supercomputers in Europe. Japan has 29 systems on the list, down from 37 systems in November.Several American scientists compared what is going on now to the 1980s, when they worried that the nation was losing ground to Japanese supercomputers.\u201cScientists might be saying, \u2018I have to go to China to run my computations,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Smarr.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s a Valley term for a loose web of interconnected people, essentially a treasure trove of data and interaction. Microsoft has considered buying other so-called graphs in the past, like Twitter, which purports to be the key to our interests, or Facebook, which holds the key to our interpersonal relationships.To my knowledge, Microsoft\u2019s only real ownership over a graph has been through Xbox Live, itself a social network of gamers, but that business is ancillary and not central to what drives its core products, which Microsoft C.E.O. Satya Nadella has made clear are all about the cloud and business and getting things done. (Haha! Business!)So what does Microsoft buy with LinkedIn\u2019s graph? One possibility: Microsoft could use LinkedIn as a giant sales intelligence platform, mining the wealth of data LinkedIn has on how people and companies connect to one another, and use that to sell more of their enterprise products. Perhaps that gives Microsoft\u2019s sales teams far more leads, or a jump on competitors like Google or Amazon\u2019s sales prospects.Is all of that boring? Yes! But, like, we\u2019re talking about Microsoft buying LinkedIn. It\u2019s not going to be an action-packed affair. It\u2019s going to be about \u2014 haha! \u2014 business.There are two problems with that kind of system. First, it\u2019s annoying for users \u2014 unless you\u2019re actively looking for a job, there\u2019s no reason to look at LinkedIn, which means that the site must constantly spam you to keep your interest in it alive. Second, because it has no reason for being other than recruitment, LinkedIn risks getting replaced by all kinds of more useful online networks.For instance, software developers have GitHub, an online resource where people can share and talk about code \u2014 and where, crucially, recruiters can see exactly what programmers have done in their work lives. People in the media, meanwhile, have Twitter \u2014 a place to show our work and engagement in the news, making it far more useful than simply a list of past workplaces. (See, Twitter is good for our careers!)Granted, not every profession has such a place online, and maybe sales and marketing people will always have a special affinity for LinkedIn. But for most people, I think, LinkedIn will grow less significant over time, not more.Oh, and one more thing, Mike. Will you please never join my professional network on LinkedIn?

They originally planned for just nine, wary of the ballooning bill.This unwieldy club of nations \u2014 and such costly compromises \u2014 are a constant flash point in the debate over the European project. As Britain heads to the polls on Thursday over whether to leave the European Union, many supporters of the so-called Brexit consider Brussels a bloated bureaucracy that sucks funds and resources.They have a point, at least in some examples. While the group of nations professes mutual support, it is often hobbled by a lack of consensus that leads to dubious decisions.There are duplicate Parliament buildings in France and Belgium. The union\u2019s digital security agency is on a remote Greek island with direct flights to crucial European capitals only during the summer months. And a plan to streamline the top layer of the European Commission, the executive body in the administrative capital of Brussels, has been undermined by national infighting.The European courts are particularly good fodder for critics.Perched on a plateau above the city of Luxembourg, the court is composed of two main tribunals. The Court of Justice is a sort of supreme court for the bloc, while the General Court is the top appellate court and the first stop for companies like Microsoft when appealing fines imposed by Brussels for breaking antitrust laws.The headquarters is adorned with ostentatious (read: pricey) flourishes. A number of entryways are decorated with Baccarat crystal chandeliers and glittering chain mail wall coverings. Translators and administrators work in gold-tinted office towers. Judges are chauffeured to work and to meetings in a leased fleet of more than 80 cars.When the court first pushed to hire new judges in 2011, the political wrangling started immediately.At that time, the General Court was facing a serious backlog: Files of pending cases took up a third of a mile of shelving. Vassilios Skouris, the former president of the Court of Justice, proposed hiring 12 new judges, on top of the existing 28.Wary of the potential bill, governments agreed to nine new judges. But progress stalled when member states bickered over which of them would get to make the appointments.The deadlock eased three years later in 2014, when Mr. Skouris proposed one additional judge for each country as a \u201cstructural and lasting response\u201d to the backlog. The enlargement would mean justice is \u201cspeedier, more efficient and of consistently high quality\u201d and \u201calso allow the court to handle any sudden surge in filings,\u201d Koen Lenaerts, the current president, said in a statement to The New York Times.It was the sort of national horse-trading and jockeying for influence that has pervaded a number of decisions.Twelve times a year, under European law, more than 750 lawmakers and thousands of assistants shuttle from Brussels to a second locale, 220 miles away in the French city of Strasbourg. The arrangement adds at least \u20ac114 million every year to the bloc\u2019s budget to maintain a gleaming glass building used for legislative sessions less than two months a year.Sovereign priorities have also hindered efforts to streamline the European Commission. Since the bloc has mushroomed to 28 members from its original six, there are not enough influential jobs to go around. Portfolios overlap, creating tensions.During the last decade, member states moved to cut the commission\u2019s size by about a third and to take turns occupying fewer seats. But that idea mostly collapsed when Irish voters, sensitive about being left unrepresented in Brussels for any length of time, voted in a 2008 referendum to reject a revised European Union treaty containing those changes.Margaritis Schinas, the chief spokesman of the commission, said the makeup of the body and its size was determined by governments. The commission had \u201ctaken important organizational steps,\u201d he said, by grouping commissioners into teams, and by focusing more resources on issues of major concern.Quarreling over jobs and influence led in 2003 to the parceling out of 10 new agencies to member states, some of them far from Brussels. Greece won the right to host the digital crime agency and put it on Crete.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe Greek island is better known for tourism and farming than for 21st-century law enforcement. Even the head of the group, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, Udo Helmbrecht, calls the location a \u201cproblem for attracting people\u201d and estimates that consolidating it with a second office in Athens would save money.Hiring more judges also meant spending more money.The new judges at the General Court will earn basic monthly salaries of about \u20ac20,000, or about $22,460. With staff and offices, each judge costs about \u20ac1 million each year, and the expansion will add roughly 5 percent to the court\u2019s budget after other savings are taken into account. By contrast the original plan for nine judges would have cost about half as much.Naturally, the proposal provoked fury among some European lawmakers.The plan showed \u201cdeep contempt for European taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d and \u201cwould be poorly received by the European public,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Marinho e Pinto, the lead negotiator on the issue at the European Parliament, wrote in October 2015. German concerns about cost helped push the court to make additional internal savings.Governments finally reached a consensus late last year \u2014 or at least what counts for consensus in the European Union.Last December, a majority of member states including Germany approved the plan. Belgium and the Netherlands abstained. Britain protested that it would \u201cresult in greater demands being made\u201d on member states; it voted against the plan.\u201cEuropean institutions have so little good will to spare, so bulking up the court is shortsighted in the extreme,\u201d said Alberto Alemanno, a law professor at HEC Paris, a business school, and a former clerk at both tribunals. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine governments being able to agree to anything else, and that\u2019s just as worrying.\u201dBecause it took five years to reach an agreement, the judges had already begun trying ways to streamline the workload. They hired new clerks and cut back on hearings.The backlog has fallen slightly, and they are closing more cases. Some figures suggest a surge in productivity.Now, critics are warning that the new judges might not have enough work to do.By the end of 2014 the court had already \u201ceaten into the backlog without the addition of a single additional judge,\u201d one long-serving judge of the General Court, Franklin Dehousse, wrote in a critical report published in April by Egmont, a research organization. The doubling of the size of the court was \u201cmanifestly excessive.\u201dBut the \u201cincapacity to compromise on E.U. appointments is not limited to judicial ones,\u201d he added, saying this \u201cweakness has clearly become a source of useless spending by the E.U.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Decides All Bits Are Equal", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBitsTwenty years ago broadband might have been confused with a style of cummerbund. Now, a federal court has ruled, it is an essential part of American life.But of what kind?That means Netflix, Google and your neighbor\u2019s gardening blog all get treated the same, in terms of how fast they make it to a customer\u2019s device. And the company sending high-definition films, which use a lot of bits, can\u2019t be charged more or discriminated against by the service providers.It is clear that the Netflixes of the world, and probably most consumers, like this decision, since it means there aren\u2019t impediments on what can be shipped and seen.Equally clear is that the service providers are not happy, since this means they can\u2019t control their biggest users, whose increasingly heavy usage can force them to make expensive upgrades.Count on an appeal, and most likely a final decision by the Supreme Court, because the concept of net neutrality touches on key philosophical and pragmatic aspects of modern life.Is fast internet service now essential, since we need it to get a job or find out when the movie is on? Is broadband so essential that companies providing it must be regulated by the F.C.C. in how they treat customers?What sort of essential commodity is the delivery of bits \u2014 is it like electricity, which is often priced against periods of peak usage? Is it like water, which must be provided at all times, but has different costs around the country based on difficulty of delivery? Is it something new?On the other side, shouldn\u2019t a company developing a new product have to consider how many bits it will be using, or other constraints it is putting on a system counted on by millions of people? When companies build a network for one purpose, and the network is overwhelmed by a new digital product that uses more bandwidth, should the old pricing rules apply?The last is not an idle question. Just as high-definition video challenges a network used to, say, text-based email, the online gaming and virtual reality systems planned by the likes of Microsoft and Facebook will likely tax most existing service providers\u2019 systems.Advertisement"}

In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units \u2014 emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs \u2014 tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them.If emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media \u2014 film, TV or amateur video \u2014 and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs \u2014 those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation \u2014 feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising.Buying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet.The commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces.With Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue; Ansel Elgort pouting; Ansel Elgort wearing headphones.Meanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut.For the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other sport-themed glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode.\u201d\u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why LinkedIn Will Make You Hate Microsoft Word", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe companies\u2019 chief executives, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn, explained their reasons for the deal in a PowerPoint presentation distributed to investors. In the center of a graphic titled, \u201cA professional\u2019s profile everywhere,\u201d was a picture of an anonymous LinkedIn \u201cprofessional\u201d with arrows pointed outward to seven Microsoft products.Outlook and Skype were two of these, and the usefulness of bringing in information from LinkedIn to those applications is pretty clear \u2014 you could put faces to the annoyingly persistent invitations from strangers on LinkedIn \u2014 if a little underwhelming.But there were also arrows to Windows, to PowerPoint, to Excel and, most surprisingly, to Word. I\u2019m not a Microsoft shareholder myself, but I am one of the 1.2 billion users of Microsoft Office, and I was baffled to see my workhorse word-processing software show up in the rationale for this deal.Mr. Nadella supplied one explanatory clue in an email that he sent to Microsoft employees. \u201cThis combination will make it possible for new experiences,\u201d he wrote, such as \u201cOffice suggesting an expert to connect with via LinkedIn to help with a task you\u2019re trying to complete.\u201d He went on to predict that such experiences would \u201cget more intelligent and delightful.\u201d\u201cDelightful\u201d is not the first adjective that comes to mind here, or even the 10th. If I\u2019m working in Word, I can\u2019t see why I\u2019d welcome the intrusion of even a close friend, let alone a bot telling me about a stranger pulled from LinkedIn\u2019s database.My version of Word, a relatively recent one, is not that different from the original, born in software\u2019s Pleistocene epoch. It isn\u2019t networked to my friends, family and professional contacts, and that\u2019s the point. Writing on Word may be the only time I spend on my computer in which I can keep the endless distractions in the networked world out of sight.Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, an associate professor of English at the University of Maryland and author of \u201cTrack Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing,\u201d said the move reflected a failure to understand what writers need. \u201cMost of the most innovative writing tools now on the market position themselves precisely as distraction-free platforms,\u201d he said.But he also said that the idea of a LinkedIn-infused Microsoft Word was very much in keeping with the flawed \u201cOffice Everywhere\u201d strategy of Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessors, Steven A. Ballmer and, before him, Bill Gates. One of the hallmarks of the Gates-Ballmer years was the too-high priority accorded to new products closely tied to Windows and Office. That strategy invited antitrust suits, and it also helped prevent the company from creating new businesses wholly independent of the two cash cows.Until now, Mr. Nadella has actively eschewed that strategy and unwound many of his predecessors\u2019 bad decisions. But I suspect that both Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner are afflicted with extremely bad cases of Facebook envy. Every tech company, including Microsoft, contemplated buying, or actually tried to buy, Facebook in its early days, and all are haunted by the thought of the deal that got away. Today, Facebook\u2019s market capitalization is about $320 billion, not that far behind Microsoft\u2019s $394 billion.But if chief executives of the other tech companies can no longer buy Facebook, they can still borrow the language that its founder Mark Zuckerberg uses, especially his key phrase, the \u201csocial graph.\u201dIn a joint conference call with Mr. Weiner on Monday, Mr. Nadella spoke of \u201csocial selling\u201d and the \u201cMicrosoft graph,\u201d the latter of which Mr. Weiner immediately renamed the \u201ccorporate graph.\u201d That, in turn, is to be mated with LinkedIn\u2019s \u201cprofessional graph,\u201d producing a new thing, \u201cthe world\u2019s first economic graph.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s and LinkedIn\u2019s \u201cgraphs\u201d will be connected, Mr. Nadella said, and \u201cthat\u2019s when the magic starts to happen in terms of how digital work gets completed.\u201d What Mr. Nadella fails to see is how extending LinkedIn\u2019s \u201csocial fabric\u201d to Word will kill the magic, not speed it up.Advertisement"}

But the growth of the cloud and mobile devices has thrown the market wide open \u2014 first to alternative operating environments, and more recently to new collaborative software that threatens Microsoft\u2019s email, word processing and spreadsheet revenue. The company\u2019s efforts to move users to cloud versions of its programs may help, but its traditional dominance is under attack.Buying LinkedIn means Microsoft will control the best-known network where companies and employees \u2014 especially potential employees \u2014 interact. Making the LinkedIn bazaar operate smoothly with tools like Office, Skype and other services run on Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform is the overarching vision.LinkedIn has problems, though. Less than a year ago, its stock was trading nearly 30 percent higher than the agreed offer price of $196 a share. A growth warning, the reputational damage of a huge security breach and the introduction of new features that provide revenue but annoy users have hurt the company. The board\u2019s decision to sell suggests the stand-alone outlook was not especially alluring.Microsoft\u2019s history with acquisitions raises questions, too. It has written down essentially the entire $9.5 billion it paid for Nokia. In 2012, it wrote off nearly all the $6.3 billion shelled out for digital-advertising agency aQuantive. Those deals were sealed by Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steven A.

Some are renouncing their seats like conscientious objectors.The coolness toward Mr. Trump amounts to a remarkable rebuke. A broad range of party leaders are openly rejecting the man who will be their nominee. And the July 18-21 convention, usually a moment of public catharsis for political parties after contentious primaries, is shaping up to be another reminder of the disarray and disunity that is still rocking the Republican Party after a bitter 17-way fight for the nomination.Even the two highest-ranking Republicans in the convention\u2019s host state of Ohio \u2014 Gov. John Kasich and Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting to hold onto his seat \u2014 say they do not know if they will set foot in the convention hall.Several other of Mr. Trump\u2019s former rivals for the nomination have said they will not attend or have not committed. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, will not be there. Neither will Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fun, I\u2019m sure it will be entertaining,\u201d Mr. Graham said last week. \u201cAnd I can watch it on TV.\u201dSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is a delegate as well as a former presidential candidate, has yet to decide. \u201cT.B.D.,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe schedule is still being firmed up.\u201dAt least two former competitors of Mr. Trump\u2019s are expected to attend: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who last week offered his services as a speaker should they be wanted.Among those staying away include some major corporations like Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard.And some who do plan to be there might find the atmosphere somewhat uncomfortable.Donald J. Trump is set to be the Republican standard-bearer, but when it comes to some of his policies, he is out of sync with many Republican leaders in Congress.Scheduling conflicts seem to be a surprisingly common excuse for missing an event that was announced a year and a half ago. Others offered mushy noncommitments.Asked if Mr. Trump had anything to do with his reluctance, Mr. Johnson, who is in a heated re-election campaign, broke into a big smile and said, \u201cOh, of course not.\u201dMr. Snyder is one of at least nine Republican governors who are noncommittal or skipping the convention: Mr. Kasich, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Matt Mead of Wyoming and Nathan Deal of Georgia.Just about every Republican senator in a difficult race is staying away, fearful of what the association with Mr. Trump might do to reputations back home. Senator John McCain of Arizona will join four of the five living former Republican nominees in skipping the convention. \u201cI\u2019m in a very tough re-election campaign,\u201d he said last week, explaining his expected absence.Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, two of the most endangered Republican incumbents, will also be nowhere near Cleveland that week.Mr. Portman, another senator in a tight race, said his time would be better spent holding a miniconvention of his own in Cleveland, which he plans to do with events for veterans, the homeless and his volunteers.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken at every convention since 1996,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody listens, nobody covers it.\u201dThis mass avoidance might seem, on its surface, to be yet another example of party elites snubbing Mr. Trump in the kind of rejection that he would welcome as a professed political outsider. But it also reflects a deeper and more dangerous problem for him: Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with Republicans remains uncomfortably low.The Indiana delegate who renounced his place at the convention, Mr. Claybourn, would have been bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot, a step he said he simply could not stomach.\u201cDonald J.

Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.The policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.Last month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.Kanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201dMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.Opening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201dThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.Mr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.Apple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting from Mumbai and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

We know that it offers lossless file compression, which is appealing to anyone who doesn\u2019t want their music, movies and photos to bump against the memory limits of their computers, phones and other devices. But a lot of the cutting-edge concepts that make Pied Piper a technological breakthrough \u2014 the neural net, the peer-to-peer distribution cloud, the centralized data store \u2014 remains abstract and elusive. We trust that it will improve our lives, but how might the app actually work? And how can we be sure that its \u201cmachine-learning\u201d function won\u2019t lead to a robot apocalypse, like Skynet in \u201cThe Terminator\u201d?\u201cDaily Active Users\u201d exposes the failure underlying Pied Piper\u2019s success, the termites nibbling at the foundation. It turns out that Monica\u2019s misgivings about the beta were an outlier only because Richard and his team sent invites exclusively to other engineers. So while Pied Piper celebrates its 500,000th install, the crucial metric of daily active users is a woeful 19,000, suggesting that Monica\u2019s bafflement is shared by everyone else. Jack Barker\u2019s plan to confine Richard\u2019s revolutionary technology to a clunky box may have been bereft of imagination, but a storage box for corporate data is at least easily understood. It makes sense, then, for Barker and Gavin Belson to form an unholy union around a Hooli/Endframe box at the same time Pied Piper is struggling to define itself.Many of the jokes in \u201cDaily Active Users\u201d stem from a breakdown in communication. The Pied Piper \u201cTables\u201d ad that opens the episode is a masterpiece of obscure metaphors and vague platitudes: \u201cTables are made so a person can sit down and do something. Or nothing.\u201d Grapefruits, postcards, hugs, three-alarm chili. The ad tries to liken Pied Piper to a table for sharing \u2014 and a metaphor for all that\u2019s \u201cbeautiful and sad and hopeful and dangerous\u201d about life itself, for that matter \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t connect. After a flustered Richard blasts a focus group that\u2019s \u201ctotally freaked out\u201d by the platform, he needs an hourslong whiteboard tutorial to win them over \u2014 or, at a minimum, reassure them that Pied Piper won\u2019t become sentient and take over the world.With the finale next week, \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d leaves the gang once again on the brink of disaster, which by now is a familiar place for them to be. The near constant barrage of existential crises has become the show\u2019s formula, but that desperation and stress is a wellspring of comedy. We get poor Jared, unable to hide his anxiety under Gilfoyle\u2019s mirthless interrogation. We get Erlich making a rousing speech to the troops about strapping in and following Richard as he flies their plane into the side of a mountain. We get the sad spectacle of \u201cPipy,\u201d Pied Piper\u2019s answer to the old Microsoft Office assistant Clippy, showing users to how to complete a task in just six easy clicks.Down to core staff and diminished coffers, the fate of Pied Piper currently rests with a \u201cclickfarm\u201d in Bangladesh, which Jared has secretly funded as a stopgap measure to goose up usage numbers. It\u2019s a sly, dark joke about the ephemeral nature of our click-onomy, where success can be gamed and true value is elusive and perhaps unknowable. Even if users loved Pied Piper at an acceptable rate, none of them have actually paid a dime for it. It\u2019s all just vague potential, either a billion dollar company or completely worthless one.

The slogan \u201cThink Big\u201d is plastered on workers\u2019 T-shirts and on posters around the hangar in the desert outside Los Angeles, where the plane is being assembled. The effort is being financed by the jumbo fortune of Paul G. Allen, the billionaire space enthusiast and a Microsoft founder.The plane\u2019s nickname is Roc, after the gigantic mythical bird that carried an elephant in its talons, though Stratolaunch executives are not crazy about it; it sounds like something not known for staying aloft.A rare tour of the plane and hangar last week by executives working for Mr. Allen showed that the project was still underway, and on track to begin commercial operations before the end of the decade. But there are lingering questions about how Stratolaunch\u2019s business will work once its flying behemoth is ready for takeoff.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious undertaking,\u201d said Charles Beames, president of Vulcan Aerospace, the entity Mr. Allen created to oversee Stratolaunch and other space initiatives. \u201cA really big plane means carrying anything from a really big rocket to a smaller rocket. That allows us to serve a broader set of customers.\u201dStratolaunch bought two used Boeing 747s from United Airlines, removed most of their critical parts and is now reassembling them into one carrier plane with a new shell made of lightweight graphite composites. It is hoped that the plane will take off with a rocket slung underneath, which it would then drop from an altitude of more than 30,000 feet, sending it on its way to space.Stratolaunch executives said an airborne launcher would have other advantages, like the ability to simply fly to patches of clear sky to avoid foul weather that could scrub a mission. They also say their plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits, although the plane needs a landing strip that can handle its great size.There has been tumult around aspects of Stratolaunch.Its partnerships ended with SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Stratolaunch had worked with them both to develop rockets for blasting satellites into space from the plane. And questions have been raised about whether there would be enough business \u2014 given the trend toward smaller satellites \u2014 for such a large plane.In an interview, Mr. Beames said that Stratolaunch, which will be able to carry payloads of over 500,000 pounds, was the right size. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not overbuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the size gives us is flexibility in payload.\u201dBill Ostrove, a space systems analyst at Forecast International, an aerospace and defense research firm, says the real demand for Stratolaunch\u2019s services will be determined by its ability to serve the small-satellite launch market, which is extremely competitive.\u201cIf Stratolaunch can figure out its strategy and develop a working rocket, it should be able to capture some business, as long as the small-satellite market continues to grow and demand for launch vehicles continues,\u201d he said.During the tour last week, workers with Scaled Composites, the company founded by Mr. Rutan that is building the plane, were positioning panels on the twin fuselages of the plane and grinding surfaces down to a smooth finish. Over 300 people are working on the craft.The assembly of the plane, inside a cavernous hangar built especially for it, is more than three-quarters finished. The size of the plane is difficult to comprehend. The top of its tail wing is nearly four stories from the ground.Tucked away in corners of the hangar are the landing gear components from the two 747s. The new plane will use six of the eight Pratt & Whitney engines Stratolaunch acquired when it bought the 747s. The plane\u2019s cockpit is being outfitted with electronics, crew seats and windows from the 747s.Mr. Beames said Stratolaunch would announce new partnerships in the coming months that will fill out details about the project. He declined to say when Stratolaunch would begin test flights, but he vowed to meet a goal of Mr. Allen\u2019s to be up and running by 2020.\u201cCome hell or high water, you can be sure we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Mr. Beames said.Advertisement"}

But if you are like me, you may um and ah too much, spurred by the worry that nerves may get the best of you, that you might speak too fast or mess up in some way. So I have been practicing my public speaking with the help of some apps.Ummo can show a transcript of what you have said on the screen. To improve, you can tell the app to beep when you use a filler word and edit the list of filler words to include ones you know you overuse.Ummo can then give data like how many words were spoken and how often words were reused. It also displays your pace in words per minute, how loud you were, whether your volume was consistent and so on. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs, and if you tap on a point in the graph, you can see the words in the speech transcript at that moment. The idea is to learn when in the speech you faltered so you can practice and fix mistakes.Public Speaking, which is a virtual reality app, delivers an immersive 3-D video that moves as you look around. The videos make you feel as if you are standing in different public speaking venues, like a podium in a small boardroom or a theater, sometimes with video of people listening to you. The idea is to get someone accustomed to what it feels like to be presenting to a crowd, and thus prepare for the same situation in real life.This is not as simple as it sounds, and Amber Light gets it right with clear controls and custom timers. People can choose the different color alert times and the option to have the phone buzz if they prefer a physical rather than a visual alert.Lastly, don\u2019t forget the smartphone\u2019s camera app. Making a video of yourself speaking can be a powerful way to spot mistakes \u2014 assuming you can get over the sometimes icky feeling of watching yourself on camera.Advertisement"}

Mr. Licklider joined the Pentagon in 1962, and his ideas later formed the basis for the military\u2019s primordial internet work.Even a big-vision idealist like Mr. Licklider could never have imagined that more than 50 years later, we would be telling the internet our deepest secrets and our whereabouts, and plugging in our smartphones, refrigerators, cars, oil pipelines, power grid and uranium centrifuges.And even the early internet pioneers at the Pentagon could not have foreseen that half a century later, the billions of mistakes made along the way to creating the internet of today and all the things attached to it would be strung together to form the stage for modern warfare.It is rare to find a computer today that is not linked to another, that is not baked with circuitry, applications and operating systems and that has not \u2014 at one point or another \u2014 been probed by a hacker, digital criminal or nation looking for weaknesses to exploit for profit, espionage or destruction.There is plenty of raw material to work with. On average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of code in delivered software, according to Steve McConnell, the author of \u201cCode Complete.\u201d Today, most of the applications we rely on \u2014 Google Chrome, Microsoft, Firefox and Android \u2014 contain millions of lines of code. And the complexity of technology is increasing, and with it the potential for defects.The motivation to find exploitable defects in widely used code has never been higher. Governments big and small are stockpiling vulnerabilities and exploits in hardware, software, applications, algorithms and even security defenses like firewalls and antivirus software.They are using these holes to monitor their perceived enemies, and many governments are storing them for a rainy day, when they might just have to drop a payload that disrupts or degrades an adversary\u2019s transportation, energy or financial system.They are willing to pay anyone who can find and exploit these weaknesses top dollar to hand them over, and never speak a word to the companies whose programmers inadvertently wrote them into software in the first place.The leaks revealed a long customer list, including police departments, law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States, Europe and countries like Bahrain, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Morocco.But the market for exploitable bugs is much bigger than Hacking Team\u2019s client list, and nations have been paying huge sums to hackers willing to turn over those weaknesses to governments, and withhold them from software companies, for more than 20 years.Once Stuxnet and its motivations were uncovered \u2014 first by a security researcher in Belarus and then around the world \u2014 a Pandora\u2019s box was opened.Today, more than 100 governments have publicly acknowledged their own offensive cyberwar programs. Countries that were not in the market before Stuxnet was discovered are in it now.Iranian officials now claim to have the third-largest digital army in the world behind the United States and China. Those claims are impossible to verify, in large part because most countries keep such programs secret. But Iranian hackers have made plenty of demonstrations.The next year, Iranian hackers were blamed for a series of attacks on the United States banking system. And while security experts who have analyzed those attacks claim that the Iranians\u2019 abilities are still nowhere near those of the United States and its closest allies, they are steadily improving.Nations took a while to catch on to the wartime potential of the internet, but countries are now doubling down on their digital attack capabilities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Gaming Helped Launch the Attack of the Internet Trolls", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byBits Special SectionSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Tay is a chatbot \u2014 software designed to converse with people like a human \u2014 that Microsoft created and put on Twitter to learn about people.Did it ever.\u201cHitler was right\u201d is one of the few printable posts Tay was spouting within a day on Twitter. Its earlier optimistic declaration that \u201chumans are super cool\u201d had, after a racist, anti-Semitic, antifeminist, conspiracy-minded spewing of hate, devolved to \u201cI just hate everybody.\u201dOne could hardly blame it, though not everybody was at fault. Instead, Tay was exposed to a concerted effort by a small number of people who decided to turn Tay into a hatebot by overloading its learning mechanism with negative words and phrases.In other words, Tay got trolled.Trolling can refer to a range of online troublemaking, including posting provocative comments and purposely marring others\u2019 online experience, and it can include attacks on people as much as on software. The practice of ruining things for others, originally known as griefing in the online gaming world, has become a sadly abundant element of internet life.It can be confoundingly meanspirited. In 2008, someone hacked the support message board of the Epilepsy Foundation\u2019s website and put in moving images intended to give viewers migraines and seizures.In the gaming community, griefing might include repeatedly killing the same player so that the person can\u2019t move forward, reversing the play of newer gamers so they don\u2019t learn the rules, or messing with other people\u2019s play by blocking their shots or covering oneself with distressing images.\u201cGriefing was a way to have power over other people without any repercussions, since you can create multiple characters in the same game,\u201d said Jack Emmert, former chief executive of Cryptic Studios, a maker of online games. \u201cWhen there are no repercussions, some people will start to do crazy things.\u201dThat was basically acceptable when online communities and games were made up of small groups that understood one another\u2019s behavior, said Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor at Georgia Tech.\u201cFolks who are griefing or trolling feel like they are in a secondary universe that isn\u2019t the same as the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a \u2018safe space\u2019 for them, in which they did horrible things.\u201dThe problem is that the internet is part of the entire world, where those practices have a different force and meaning.\u201cThe world was not ready for the explosion of the internet from a bunch of small communities to something we all use,\u201d Mr. Bogost said. Besides the trolls exporting their behavior, he notes, \u201cthere\u2019s something about the internet that makes lots of us go too far \u2014 a customer complaint on Twitter usually sounds like the worst thing ever.\u201dThat tendency to overdo it became visible as the worst kind of trolling on the internet about a decade ago, when griefers exported their habits from the gaming world into the larger world. One typical gathering place to plan and launch group attacks was the site 4chan, where \u201canything goes\u201d is the norm.Griefers would go into virtual worlds like Second Life and cause trouble, like blocking imaginary hotel exits so players couldn\u2019t move from one place to another, or interrupting sessions in which people were interacting through their virtual characters.From there, attacking people head-on \u2014 though almost always cloaked in anonymity \u2014 wasn\u2019t a big leap. And so much more on the internet became like a game, only the score consisted of attention, outrage or approval from like-minded trolls.In 2012, Time magazine asked readers to vote online for Person of the Year. Thanks to trolls on 4chan, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, began to pull ahead, though the poll was not binding and the magazine eventually chose President Obama.It was little more than an irreverent stunt. When Mr. Kim was disallowed, however, the trolls hacked the site and inserted a code that distorted the results. The final list arranged the winners by their first letters, vertically spelling out \u201cKJU GAS CHAMBERS.\u201dBad habits tend to worsen as those engaged in them get diminishing returns from their efforts and must become more outrageous to be noticed. And so trolling has become broader and more personal.Anil Dash, an internet entrepreneur and activist who has been trolled for his outspoken comments about GamerGate, has made a study of his antagonists. He says trolling still has elements of its gaming roots, amplified by social media, where attention of any sort is viewed as winning.\u201cOnline culture rewards engagement with points and likes, and it doesn\u2019t differentiate if what you are doing is scathing,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a target is identified, it becomes a competition to see who can be the most ruthless, and the ones who feel the most powerless will do the most extreme thing just to get noticed and voted up.\u201dMr. Dash, who now sets aside time to monitor whether he is about to be attacked, has also seen others\u2019 personal information put online for others to exploit. Called doxing, this practice creates a sense of perpetual anxiety, he said, since it outlives the attacks.\u201cYou only need a list of about 1,000 words, and if one of them shows up, maybe something bad is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can identify people who get a lot of retweets in the middle of these things. They are probably instigators. Bullying is programmatically easy to identify.\u201dBesides Twitter, he said, YouTube comments and some parts of the user-generated news site Reddit could change the environment by using a combination of new algorithms and human editors. (Comments on articles in The New York Times are overseen by human editors.)A company spokesman said that artificial intelligence researchers had gone back to the drawing board with other experts from the company, including people from Xbox, who have dealt with griefers for years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Sneaker Wars, It\u2019s Also Curry (Under Armour) vs. James (Nike)", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessAre we about to see a new version of the infamous sneaker wars that Nike and Adidas fought in the 1990s?Back then, Nike beat back Adidas; indeed, it now has more than 90 percent of the basketball shoe market \u2014 a number that compares to Microsoft\u2019s monopoly over operating systems in its heyday. Now, however, Nike has a new challenger: a cocky upstart named Under Armour.In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Curry, one of the most popular players in the N.B.A., wears shoes made by Under Armour. But that wasn\u2019t always the case: When he first entered the league, in 2009, he was under contract with Nike. Over the next four years, he showed he was a terrific player, but, in part because of ankle problems, hadn\u2019t yet become what he is now: the N.B.A.\u2019s marquee player \u2014 an amazing shooter with a transcendent game and an appealing, down-to-earth personality.At a time when sales of basketball shoes have been sluggish, Under Armour\u2019s have taken off. They were up 95 percent in the fourth quarter of last year (compared with 2014\u2019s fourth quarter) and another 64 percent in the first quarter of this year. Its footwear revenue was $678 million in 2015, up from $127 million in 2010. Although Nike dominates the business of basketball shoes, Under Armour has made inroads.There are two things that are striking about Plank\u2019s initial business model. The first is that his shirts were aimed strictly at elite athletes rather than the general public; he was making \u201cperformance wear,\u201d as they say in the trade. The second was the way he built the Under Armour brand in the early days: by handing his shirts to football players he knew from high school or college who had gone on to the N.F.L.In other words, endorsements have been critical to Under Armour\u2019s success from the very beginning. The N.F.L. players who wore his shirts talked them up, which led teams, beginning with the Atlanta Falcons and the Giants, to start buying them for all the players. When the Miami Dolphins asked him to supply the team with free shirts, Plank said no. He needed to be able to sell to teams because they were his target market. (The Dolphins ended up buying the shirts.)Endorsements have been critical to Nike\u2019s success, too, of course \u2014 indeed, they\u2019ve been as much a part of the company\u2019s marketing as the \u201cJust Do It\u201d commercials.Now, of course, it has captured lightning in a bottle with Curry. During Under Armour\u2019s first quarter earnings call in April, Plank couldn\u2019t stop dropping Curry\u2019s name.Here\u2019s the thing, though. Nike didn\u2019t become a $30 billion company solely by relying on Michael Jordan. At a certain point in the 1980s, it went well beyond performance wear and began making shoes and clothes for people who had no athletic aspirations at all. According to Matt Powell, the sports industry analyst for the NPD Group, \u201conly 25 percent of athletic shoes are used for athletic activities.\u201d Walk through an airport and just look at how many people are wearing Nike shoes \u2014 not fancy athletic shoes, but everyday walking shoes, comfortable shoes that have nothing to do with Michael Jordan.But that\u2019s still a long way from Nike, which currently has a market value of $90 billion to Under Armour\u2019s $23 billion. Plank has said that the company wants to reach $7 billion in revenue by 2018. Nike is on record as wanting to hit $50 billion in revenue by 2020.Under Armour has spent 20 years selling itself as a \u201cperformance\u201d company, marketing to athletes and wanna-be athletes. To become a company generating Nike-type revenue, it will have to become a brand that appeals to everybody. Which means that Steph Curry, hot as he is right now, can only get them part of the way to the place they want to go.Email: nocera@nytimes.com Twitter: @NoceraNYTAdvertisement"}

Usually, the Republican National Committee likes to allow campaigns six weeks to prepare, and at this point in 2012, Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign had been in place in its arena for weeks. Republican officials, though, said they planned to move quickly.\u201cWe can literally be in the arena within hours of the last game,\u201d said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \u201cOur trucks will be pulling in as the ESPN trucks are pulling out.\u201dBut even if the arena was not still covered in Cavaliers signs and advertisements for Budweiser, Mr. Trump and the Republican Party would have a lot of ground to make up before the July 18-21 event.The Trump campaign, whose team of about a dozen staff members arrived in Cleveland after Memorial Day, is still working on its plans for where Mr. Trump will deliver his speeches. (He has said he may speak each night from a different city before arriving here.)The building of the stage, usually one of the most extensive mechanical undertakings of any convention, is taking place at an undisclosed location outside of downtown, and the stage will have to be moved into the arena in pieces shortly.The club-level bar where Mr. Trump and his family will sit during the convention smelled pungently of popcorn and was covered in advertisements for Effen vodka and its sponsor, the rapper 50 Cent. The large scoreboard and video display known as the humongotron will need to be hoisted higher into the rafters once Mr. Trump\u2019s team moves in. And the suite at the top level of the arena that will be handed over to radio hosts and producers is for now still the Budweiser Penthouse.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J.

And one giver, whom he declined to name, pulled out of a nearly $1 million contribution.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the effect of the presumptive nominee was fairly small for our overall fund-raising effort,\u201d Mr. Gilbert said, adding that he was confident the committee would hit its $64 million target.Still, he said, \u201cObviously, you\u2019re never breathing easy until every dollar is raised.\u201dBy their telling, the dozen newly dispatched members of the Trump campaign in Cleveland are working closely and collaboratively with the national committee\u2019s staff members who have been in place here for months.And despite Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation for being a demanding micromanager, he has taken a fairly hands-off approach so far, aides said.\u201cThey haven\u2019t changed a thing,\u201d said Ms. Kukowski, the R.N.C. spokeswoman.Actually, there was one thing.

{"Headline": "Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal Ignites Twitter Speculation", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseYouTube and Google.Instagram and Facebook.Tumblr and Yahoo.LinkedIn and Microsoft.Twitter and \u2026 ?In the relentless push toward consolidation in technology and social media, Twitter, the social networking site that allows users to send and receive short messages, or tweets, has been the perennial bridesmaid. But this week\u2019s megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs to attract a suitor or risk being overtaken by ever-larger competitors.\u201cIf current trends continue, it\u2019s inevitable that Twitter will get acquired,\u201d Robert Peck, managing director and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told me this week. Mr. Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely, and he renewed that prediction last week even before the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced. This week numerous analysts piled on to the notion.Investors seem to agree: At one point this week, Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $11.5 billion.But investors expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want to think twice.Given the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter, it\u2019s not hard to see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall. Until Monday\u2019s announcement, both companies\u2019 stocks were trading at relative bargain prices, both down about 42 percent in the last six months. (Before this week\u2019s rally, Twitter shares were barely half their $26 initial public offering price.)Both offer global reach and a large number of users: 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter (the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active users.)Apart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies, Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies, according to Statista. (Statista estimates LinkedIn\u2019s active monthly users at 100 million.)Twitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekend\u2019s massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.That kind of reach is extremely difficult to replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world. \u201cWe continue to believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity,\u201d said Ken Sena, managing director and consumer internet analyst at Evercore.Mark Mahaney, technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, agreed: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great brand, a large platform and a unique value proposition.\u201dA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter \u201cscale,\u201d which is becoming all-important in a Silicon Valley now dominated by a handful of tech giants.As the LinkedIn chief executive, Jeff Weiner, put it in his memo to employees explaining the deal, \u201cImagine a world where we\u2019re no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like to operate at their extraordinary scale \u2014 because we\u2019re one of them. Imagine a world where we\u2019re not reacting to the intensifying competitive landscape \u2014 we\u2019re leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveraging.\u201dFor Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter\u2019s founders and its chief executive, the right deal wouldn\u2019t even mean giving up his leadership role or independence. Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook, which have given considerable autonomy to the large operations they\u2019ve acquired, Microsoft promised Mr. Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a \u201cfully independent entity.\u201dThe Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, \u201chad me at \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weiner wrote in his memo.But if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling, why hasn\u2019t it happened yet? The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges, and just because it\u2019s a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to attract a suitor. Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months, and would-be buyers haven\u2019t exactly been beating down its door.For at least some of the all-important (to advertisers) millennial users, that may well be the case. Jacob Shiansky, 24, who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina, told me this week that he couldn\u2019t remember his Twitter password and hasn\u2019t visited the site in six months.\u201cIt\u2019s too much business and political promotions rather than a social media site,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to see Trump\u2019s ridiculous tweets, you can go on Facebook or CNN. You don\u2019t have to bother with Twitter.\u201dHe said his friends feel the same way. \u201cIt\u2019s all Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quick and they\u2019re fun. You don\u2019t have to waste your time typing.\u201dI can\u2019t say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific, even though I sometimes use it to comment on my column and to recommend stories by other journalists. But I\u2019ve stopped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel. Days go by when I don\u2019t look at the site.User engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers, because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users, enabling it to target ads better.\u201cWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them to rank internet platforms,\u201d Mr. Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, said. \u201cGoogle ranks first, Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list. That\u2019s been true for every survey,\u201d he said.Twitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction. That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking to extend its digital footprint, and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the stock this year. (News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materialized.)Few traditional media companies, though, are big enough to swallow Twitter at its current market value. News Corporation, one of the richest, has a market capitalization of just under $7 billion.Mr. Peck and Mr. Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer. The two companies already have many ties: Several Twitter executives used to work at Alphabet\u2019s Google, tweets appear in Google search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through Google\u2019s DoubleClick bid manager.Google\u2019s own social networking effort, Google Plus, hasn\u2019t caught on. Google undoubtedly has the size and scale to absorb Twitter.But Alphabet\u2019s founders have said repeatedly they don\u2019t want to create content. So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a real-time news and content site rather than a social media network, it doesn\u2019t fit into Google\u2019s strategic objectives. Those, of course, could always change.Both Google and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed. (Neither company would comment on those reports. Jim Prosser, a Twitter spokesman, also declined to comment for this column.)But Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitter\u2019s biggest competitor. A deal would raise antitrust issues, and it\u2019s not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its own.From a strategic standpoint, the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense. Both are big enough, both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence. But it\u2019s not clear either company has the expertise to solve Twitter\u2019s major problems, which are far afield from the cable network business.A lot of this week\u2019s deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter investors desperate for a LinkedIn-style exit strategy. That may be slow in coming. Even Mr. Peck of SunTrust doesn\u2019t expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest, because it\u2019s still early in Mr. Dorsey\u2019s latest turnaround effort.Others are even more skeptical. \u201cI can see the argument for it, but I\u2019m not betting on a deal,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t many logical buyers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Boy, we media people sure know how to pick \u2018em.Sure, there are exceptions like the Gawker-hunter and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who is a Trump delegate, but for the most part, Mr. Trump turns people in the Valley off. HP Inc. also said this week that it would not contribute financially to the Republican National Convention.Mr. Trump has attacked Apple, Facebook and Amazon, so his unpopularity in Silicon Valley is no surprise. But David\u2019s report also suggested that Hillary Clinton, who hasn\u2019t really championed the tech industry in her run, is also greeted with mild skepticism here. In the Obama era, tech companies have been revered \u2014 Google has easy access to the White House, and many Obama staff members have gone to work for the tech industry. But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically. So I wonder: Is that good?Don\u2019t you think that the tech skepticism among the major candidates reflects the bloom coming off the tech rose in general, and a yearning for a pre-internet era when everyone had good jobs and the future seemed so bright?We\u2019ve long feared that technology would eat our jobs, but platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit offer a dystopian look at what a future of fragmented employment might actually look like. And with wages and jobs at the center of much of the campaign for both Democrats and Republicans, there isn\u2019t much to love there. Data breaches scare the bejesus out of everyone.

{"Headline": "Buybacks by Companies Like Apple May Signal Danger, Not Growth", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStrategiesBut Apple and the stock market would probably be in worse shape now if not for an important factor: Companies like Apple have been buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of their own shares at a record-breaking pace, returning money to shareholders even as earnings lag.At the moment, corporate America is sitting on an enormous cash hoard. Many companies have been using the money in an epic share-buying spree \u2014 one that has increased in intensity even as earnings have declined. In the 12 months through March, operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped to $854.9 billion from $989 billion, but buybacks increased to $589 billion from $538.1 billion. That is the largest total for buybacks ever in a 12-month period, according to a report from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.While Apple ranked second in buybacks to Gilead Sciences in the first quarter, it has been the undisputed king of buybacks over some longer periods. Apple spent $36.8 billion on buybacks in the 12 months through March, more than double the $16.6 billion spent by Microsoft, the next-ranking company. And over the five years through March, Apple bought back $116.6 billion worth of its own shares, followed by Microsoft with $45.7 billion, Pfizer with $44.9 billion and Oracle with $43.7 billion.A recent surge in buybacks may have been stimulated by problems in the stock market, which fell sharply at the beginning of the year. In the first quarter, Mr. Silverblatt said, \u201cthe pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn.\u201d More than three-fifths of the S.&P. 500 companies bought back at least some of their own shares in the quarter, he said, and 139 bought enough over 12 months to reduce their share count by at least 4 percent.As a matter of simple math, reducing the number of shares by 4 percent will increase earnings per share by 4 percent, too, and will tend to bolster short-term prices.Buybacks are a critical part of Goldman\u2019s positive stock market outlook for the remainder of 2016: \u201cWe maintain our forecast that net buybacks will equal $450 billion in 2016 and remain the largest source of U.S. equity demand this year,\u201d the company said.Low and even negative interest rates resulting from the sluggish global economy and from the expansionary monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been enabling big corporations to borrow money cheaply, even when those companies\u2019 earnings have declined, and even when they have had no immediate productive use for the funds.Such maneuvers often produce good results for stocks over the short term. Over longer periods, however, unless earnings grow substantially, financial engineering like this will take you only so far.For now, buyback authorizations by American companies continue to increase, and there is so much cash on hand that the current trend can easily continue for many months. At some point, buybacks won\u2019t be an elixir for share prices. They will be a symptom of an overextended market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Microsoft Likes LinkedIn", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byBitsSo what does Microsoft get for $26.2 billion?Drug company deals are more straightforward though, and the price is usually based on what the acquirer hopes to squeeze out of the products and talent. Technology mergers tend to require a little more imagination to justify their cost.LinkedIn may have 400 million \u201cmembers,\u201d as the people who post their job data there are called, but in 2015 it had revenue of about $3 billion, and posted a net loss of $166 million. The year before it lost only $15 million on $2.2 billion in revenue. It is hard to see why Microsoft paid a premium of about 50 percent of Friday\u2019s LinkedIn share price.But think like a tech chief executive, using the key values of relevance, synergy, data and growth. Microsoft is in the midst of an epochal transition from the time of personal computers and computer servers to machine-based intelligence everywhere, via cloud computing and mobile devices. Where once it owned the desktop, now it strives with the likes of Google and Amazon for a $1 trillion prize, the global market for corporate computing.At the end of last March, Microsoft had $105 billion in cash, far more than the competition. Spending some of that on a well-regarded cloud company it can transition over to its own enormous cloud system makes Microsoft ever more relevant in this world.Unlike Google and Amazon, Microsoft already has a large presence in corporate software, and some of LinkedIn\u2019s functions will fit nicely into its human resources and financial planning products. Microsoft is also trying to increase the corporate utility of Skype, the online communications company it bought for $8.5 billion in 2011.Bolted onto LinkedIn, it could be a means not just of recruitment, but of organizing teams. Much of LinkedIn\u2019s proposition has been that it will be the core of a future in which there is much less lifetime employment and lots more freelancing, consulting and other independent contracting across the globe.LinkedIn already has probably the world\u2019s best trove of data on the work people are doing and looking for, and one of the best-regarded teams of data scientists in tech. That information and those people will now work with counterparts in areas like online search, gaming and artificial intelligence, or A.I.Data is not just inherently important these days; it is a key asset for improving the performance of A.I. systems. Big data sets lend themselves to better results (incidentally, a reason many in tech are starting to worry about the data owned by the biggest companies.) Buying LinkedIn didn\u2019t just improve the likely performance of Microsoft\u2019s own algorithms. It took a large potential data resource off the table for Amazon and Google.That is, in large part, the positive situation \u2014 which is how such enormous acquisitions should begin.

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away.Jonathan A.

The new device supports 4K video and is about 40 percent smaller than the original model. A special edition will be available in August and standard versions will come out later this year.Microsoft is competing fiercely against Sony in the console market, which has lost some of its shine as new forms of play \u2014 such as mobile games \u2014 come to the fore, but which remains a lucrative area with a dedicated demographic of hard-core gamers. Sony has sold about 40 million PlayStation 4s, which are its latest generation of consoles, with Microsoft estimated to have sold about 21 million Xbox One consoles, according to SuperData Research.The console makers are also trying to keep ahead of technology trends, with virtual reality regarded as a promising direction. Facebook, HTC and others have released virtual reality headsets and an early use of the technology is for games. Sony has already announced a virtual reality headset that will work with its PlayStation 4 console.Monday\u2019s Xbox announcements are Microsoft\u2019s attempt \u201cto catch up\u201d with Sony, said Joost van Dreunen, the chief executive of SuperData Research.The new machine will be the first Xbox to offer virtual reality and will most likely be more expensive, so it is unlikely to cannibalize sales from the lower-priced Xbox One, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.Microsoft also said that it expected more Xbox games to be compatible across all of its hardware products, and that many could also be played on platforms made by Apple, Google and Microsoft PC.The company also announced new communities and groups for Xbox game players, including realms for the popular Minecraft game that allow players to collaborate whether they use Xbox, iOS, Android or PC operating systems.\u201cXbox has become aware that it has to engage customers more,\u201d Mr. van Dreunen of SuperData Research said.Advertisement"}

Third-party antivirus and anti-malware tools can shield your computer to some degree, but inherent vulnerabilities in older software may leave parts of your system open to attacks.Depending on how many versions behind the current system you choose to stay, you may find some applications on your PC or Mac no longer receiving periodic updates from developers because the developers themselves have moved on to newer versions. Hardware manufacturers may also stop creating driver software that allows their peripherals to work on operating systems they deem too old.While newer features, better security and improved performance can come with a successful upgrade, upgrading to the latest version of Windows or OS X can be also a titanic aggravating hassle \u2014 and can lead to weeks of fussing with the computer to get it working as it once did. On the flip side of the compatibility conundrum, your older programs and devices may not function properly on the newer system unless their makers update their own software. You may have older programs that will never work on the newer system, which can be problematic if you depend on those applications in your daily computing life.In addition to breaking your stuff, an operating system update can also move things around on you, based on the new user interface and the way it organizes your files. The new system might even run like a turtle if you have an older computer.The learning curve becomes easier as you become more familiar with the new system. If you do not have any hardware or software incompatibilities in the mix, biting the bullet and upgrading should pay off with better overall security and a longer life cycle of program updates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byJust ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\u201cAmazon is very clearly positioning itself as a disrupter with this move,\u201d Mr. Patterson said.Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks \u2014 the inexpensive laptops that run on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system \u2014 have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.Already, nursery through high schools in the United States spend more than $8.3 billion annually on educational software and digital content, according to estimates from the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group. That spending could grow significantly as school districts that now buy physical textbooks, assessment tests, professional development resources for teachers and administrative materials shift to digital systems.In a phone interview, Rohit Agarwal, general manager of Amazon K-12 Education, said the new site was intended to make it easier and faster for teachers to pinpoint timely and relevant free resources for their classrooms.\u201cEvery teacher should be able to use the platform with zero training,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. He added: \u201cWe are taking a big step forward to help the educator community make the digital classroom a reality.\u201dThe site for teachers is not Amazon\u2019s first education venture. In 2013, the company acquired TenMarks, a math instruction site. (Mr. Patterson of Owl Ventures is also a partner at Catamount Ventures, a firm that was an investor in TenMarks.)In March, the New York City public schools, the largest school district in the country, awarded Amazon a three-year contract, worth an estimated $30 million, to provide e-books to its 1.1 million students.In the school market, however, Amazon is competing not just with rival tech companies but also with established digital education companies and ed tech start-ups.Mr. Agarwal said the company\u2019s new instructional resources site would be able to differentiate itself by being more intuitive for teachers who are Amazon users and by offering compelling new features.\u201cWith the technology, content and expertise that Amazon has, we believed we could provide value,\u201d he said.On Sunday, Microsoft said that it was working with ISTE to help schools introduce and integrate technology in the classroom. The project includes training programs for school administrators, online leadership courses developed with edX \u2014 a learning platform created by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and services to support schools as they adopt digital learning approaches.Google also introduced two new products for schools: Quizzes, an online form that teachers can use to give tests and automatically grade multiple-choice questions, and Cast for Education, a free Chrome app intended to promote class discussion by enabling teachers and students to share what is on their screens with one another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Finds Cancer Clues in Search Queries", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byMicrosoft scientists have demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they may in some cases be able to identify internet users who are suffering from pancreatic cancer, even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease.\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Dr. Horvitz said.The researchers focused on searches conducted on Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine, that indicated someone had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. From there, they worked backward, looking for earlier queries that could have shown that the Bing user was experiencing symptoms before the diagnosis. Those early searches, they believe, can be warning flags.While five-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer are extremely low, early detection of the disease can prolong life in a very small percentage of cases. The study suggests that early screening can increase the five-year survival rate of pancreatic patients to 5 to 7 percent, from just 3 percent.The researchers reported that they could identify from 5 to 15 percent of pancreatic cases with false positive rates of as low as one in 100,000. The researchers noted that false positives could lead to raised medical costs or create significant anxiety for people who later found out they were not sick.The data used by the researchers was anonymized, meaning it did not carry identifying markers like a user name, so the individuals conducting the searches could not be contacted.A logical next step would be to figure out what to do with that search information. One possibility would be some sort of health service where users could allow their searches to be collected, allowing scientists to monitor for questions that indicate warning flag symptoms.\u201cThe question, \u2018What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Horvitz, in a reference to the company\u2019s speech-oriented online personal assistant software service.Although the researchers declined to offer specific details, Dr. White is now the chief technology officer of health intelligence in a recently created Health & Wellness division at Microsoft.They acknowledged that health-related data generated from web search histories was still new territory for the medical profession.\u201cI think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data,\u201d Dr. Horvitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation.\u201dThe new research is based on the ability of the Microsoft team to accurately distinguish between web searches that are casual or based on anxiety and those that are genuine searches for specific medical symptoms by people who are experiencing them, he noted.Both a computer scientist and a medical doctor by training, Dr. Horvitz said he had been exploring this area in part because of a phone conversation with a close friend who had described symptoms. Based on their conversation, Dr. Horvitz advised him to contact his doctor. He received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died several months later.The availability of vast sets of behavior data based on individual web queries using the search engines offered by companies like Google and Microsoft has for a number of years been seen as a potential indicator of health-related information.The researchers are exploring evidence related to a range of devastating diseases. They also said that unlike the drug interaction data, which would be of direct value to the F.D.A. as an early alert, it was possible that symptom alert data might be made available as part of a broader online health service that a company like Microsoft might offer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cLet me explain why.\u201dJeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn \u201cto control our own destiny.\u201dBut there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn\u2019s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion, Reasserting Its Muscle", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft\u2019s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.The deal is Microsoft\u2019s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.It is also further evidence that Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, sees the company\u2019s future further and further removed from the PC software that once helped the company\u2019s co-founder Bill Gates turn Microsoft into the world\u2019s most valuable company.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition.\u201cThis deal is all about bringing together the professional cloud and professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a telephone interview.So valuable is the data that recruiters spend thousands of dollars a month to use it to fill job openings.\u201cThey know the interconnections of the business world,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \u201cThat could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.\u201dMicrosoft has bought its way into new businesses before, though most of its largest deals have not turned out well. In 2014, it paid nearly $9.4 billion for the smartphone operations of Nokia and some years earlier spent more than $6 billion for aQuantive, an internet advertising company, but ended up writing off most of the value of those deals after they performed poorly.In its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Nadella, who took over as chief executive in February 2014, was not involved in those deals. Since assuming leadership of the company, he has made mostly smaller acquisitions, with the exception of the $2.5 billion deal to acquire the maker of the game Minecraft.Mr. Nadella said that when Microsoft pursued deals that hewed closer to a strict set of criteria, one of which is that the acquired company operates in areas that are core to Microsoft\u2019s business, the deals have worked out.\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve gotten it right, we\u2019ve had success in those dimensions,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.In a joint interview, Mr. Nadella and Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, said that their conversations began in February, when the two began talking about different ways in which the companies could work together.Mr. Weiner, for his part, said he began thinking about a LinkedIn combination with Microsoft long before he sat down with Mr. Nadella. He and Mr. Nadella first met a couple of years ago at a conference for chief executives at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of admiration for the work Satya had done since taking over as C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.Microsoft was once a reviled company in Silicon Valley, where LinkedIn is based, but as its dominance in the industry ebbed it came to seem far less threatening.Mr. Nadella has further improved Microsoft\u2019s image in the technology industry by being more open to partnerships with once-bitter tech rivals like Salesforce.com. He has accelerated the company\u2019s shift from traditional software to cloud applications and services, and its stock has risen significantly under his leadership.And with more than $100 billion in cash and short-term investments as its disposal, Microsoft is an attractive suitor for companies that decide they are better off joining forces with a bigger entity.Microsoft is paying considerably less for LinkedIn than it would have just last fall, when LinkedIn shares were trading over $260 a share. Disappointing earnings helped slash the value of the company. The deal calls for Microsoft to pay $196 a share to buy LinkedIn, a healthy premium to the $131.08 its shares closed at on Friday.\u201cThis is a good time for LinkedIn to sell,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. \u201cThey lost money last year. They\u2019ve found it\u2019s very expensive to keep growing. They\u2019re probably as valuable as they will ever be.\u201dYet big challenges remain for the company in today\u2019s technology landscape, where new powerhouses like Amazon.com, the leader in cloud computing, have a significant head start.LinkedIn could help Microsoft accelerate its shift to the internet by giving it a large online property that has became the de facto standard for posting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s online. The site is heavily used by recruiters for finding new workers. Microsoft is one of LinkedIn\u2019s biggest customers.\u201cThe mission statements of LinkedIn and Microsoft have different words, but are essentially the same,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come at it from different perspectives. LinkedIn built a professional network. Microsoft built a professional cloud.\u201dLinkedIn will give Microsoft access to a lot of potentially sensitive information that it will have to be careful about guarding \u2014 for example, when LinkedIn users are talking to job recruiters.\u201cThe burden will be on them to put controls in place to ensure privacy is maintained,\u201d said Dimitri Sirota, chief executive of BigID, a start-up that provides privacy management tools.Microsoft was advised on the deal by Morgan Stanley and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, while Qatalyst Partners, Allen & Company L.L.C. and the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati advised LinkedIn.Microsoft\u2019s courtship of LinkedIn began to heat up in April. Wary of Microsoft\u2019s missteps with past acquisitions, the companies decided that allowing LinkedIn to operate independently was best.Mr. Weiner will remain chief executive of LinkedIn, which will operate as an independent brand, following the lead of other technology acquisitions like Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube and Facebook\u2019s buy of WhatsApp.In April, Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner had dinner to dig into details for how the deal would work, joined by Reid Hoffman, the co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn, and Qi Lu, a Microsoft executive who used to work at Yahoo with Mr. Weiner.On Sunday night, the Microsoft and LinkedIn executive teams had a final meeting together at Mr. Hoffman\u2019s house before the deal was announced. As a conversation starter, each participant had to share something with the group that was not on their personal LinkedIn profile.Advertisement"}

Few have attributed their decisions directly to Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but some have privately expressed worries about having their products associated with the candidate and his ideas.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s because of the company\u2019s use of Chinese manufacturing and its fight with the United States government over the encryption of data on its smartphones. One of those briefed on Apple\u2019s decision said the company objected not only to beliefs Mr. Trump has expressed on trade with China and data encryption, but also to his comments about Muslims and immigrants.Mr. Trump has promised to build a wall along the nation\u2019s border with Mexico, has characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals and has vowed to stop immigration from Muslim-dominated countries as a counterterrorism strategy.Asked to comment on Apple\u2019s decision, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee said, \u201cWe are working with a variety of major tech partners who are focused on being part of the American political process.\u201dApple\u2019s withdrawal is not by itself a large blow to the convention. It typically donates equipment; its contribution in 2008, for example, was valued at $140,000, according to federal election records. But it adds to the parade of major companies, including HP and Microsoft, curtailing or eliminating their monetary support of the Republican convention.Last week, Bloomberg Politics reported that JPMorgan Chase and Ford Motor would not sponsor the convention.Apple was still expected to provide support for the Democratic convention, though it was unclear Saturday if that decision was final.Some major technology firms, such as Google, are still planning to support the convention in some fashion.Mr. Trump\u2019s presence at the top of the Republican ticket has created a seismic split within his party \u2014 among down-ballot candidates, who do not want to answer to his frequent controversies, and among donors, many of whom do not want to fund the party as heavily as they have in the past. Last week, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that his endorsement of Mr. Trump was not a \u201cblank check\u201d and that he could rescind it.On Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the lack of support among other Republicans and took an unusual tack, threatening to stop raising money for the party and to self-fund his race.\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat Hillary, and it would helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, referring to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. He continued to criticize his party: \u201cI am raising a lot of money for the Republican Party, and there are a lot of beneficiaries of that. And I like doing it. But we have to have help.\u201dThe Trump campaign is relying heavily on the Republican Party apparatus to support his candidacy, in particular its field and data programs across the country, since he keeps a lean staff. Self-funding would require Mr. Trump to put up hundreds of millions of dollars, something he resisted for much of the primary race.\u201cIf the Republican Party, and I hope they all come together, because I want them to all come together, but if for any reason, they get a little bit like they don\u2019t want to help out as much, then I\u2019ll fund my own campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201dNick Corasaniti and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Cannes, the Ad Industry Confronts the Rise of Facebook", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byMediatorCANNES, France \u2014 The invasion has begun.In the gray light of a summer dawn, the invaders threw their great American force into action here, quickly taking the beach with their blue flags, white beach chairs and wood-slat cabanas, a sturdy if sumptuous operating base from which to storm this seaside resort \u2014 conference room by conference room, rooftop bar by rooftop bar.The frightened townsfolk \u2014 top executives from the biggest media companies and advertising agencies in the world \u2014 debated in whispers their grim choice between bloody resistance or total surrender.A correspondent broadcasting from the H\u00f4tel Barri\u00e8re Le Majestic here reported the words from the blue shirts\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 in a quivering voice: \u201cAs we connect the world, we believe very deeply in the importance of helping creators build businesses on Facebook [STOP] \u2026 We are only here to help [STOP] \u2026 Why don\u2019t you believe us? [STOP]\u201dThey capture the sense of siege that was palpable here last week during the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, where Facebook has one of the most visible pop-up headquarters along the beach, with a pier festooned with its logo and a club on the sand. But in this case, no one was prepared to view the seaside regiment as a liberating force.Therefore, the word of the week in Cannes was \u201cduopoly.\u201d You could understand why the gathered Mad Men and Women were so mad. For decades, they have enjoyed mutually beneficial relationships with their big clients \u2014 Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Unilever \u2014 reaping great riches by catering to Americans\u2019 wants and tastes, having divined them through focus groups and surveys.If I\u2019m you, the reader, I\u2019m wondering why I should care; isn\u2019t it like the old mob complaining about the new mob being unschooled in the honor code of omert\u00e0?Well, there are much larger questions at play. When one or two companies gain control over a market, it creates dangerous asymmetries that skew competitive balance. And the market we\u2019re talking about isn\u2019t making widgets. It delivers what we read and watch every day, and increasingly every minute: the news and information our democracy needs.While Google has usually been the chief villain here, Facebook seemed to have assumed the role of Frenemy No. 1. Two hours didn\u2019t go by here without some top executive telling me about how Facebook\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d makes it a new intermediary between brands and their customers, and between newspapers and their readers. That gives Facebook the potential to steal them all away if it ever chose to do so. (It says it won\u2019t.)Facebook, which maintained a fortresslike presence here within the Hotel Majestic as well on the beach, had a simple message: We Come in Peace, and we need the ad world.\u201cOur point of view on this is that the whole industry has to collaborate more than ever,\u201d Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global marketing solutions, told me. \u201cThere is a massive shift in the industry.\u201dThat shift is to mobile phones, where more and more digital advertising is going. But the industry hasn\u2019t quite figured out how to make us regularly watch more than three seconds of a telephone-based video ad, or to click on a mobile display ad on purpose.\u201cWe desperately need the agency ecosystem to support and drive this shift to mobile marketing,\u201d Ms. Everson said. Figuring it out is in everybody\u2019s interest.You can point to a clash between New York cynicism and West Coast idealism, but there is a history.But then it offered the brands a chance to increase visibility by paying for it \u2014 that is, to reach the customer fan base that Facebook had initially invited them to create free. You can imagine how that went over.Facebook has been doing a better job of avoiding such surprises, Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at OMD, told me at his company\u2019s beachside tent.But, he said, when Facebook is the mediator between advertisers and their customers, \u201cThey become Facebook\u2019s customers first and the brands\u2019 customers second,\u201d leaving the question, \u201cWho owns the customer data?\u201d The nearly universal complaint in Cannes was that Facebook was not doing enough to share that data, leaving an informational imbalance that, combined with Facebook\u2019s digital market share, gives it asymmetrical negotiating leverage.Ms. Everson said that Facebook\u2019s imperative to protect the privacy of its users precludes deeper sharing. But, she said, it has sophisticated tools to help its partners contact customers and likely customers without making them identifiable.Facebook\u2019s Madison Avenue \u201cpartners\u201d wonder if Facebook isn\u2019t hiding behind privacy to protect its own market advantage.\u201cWe fully understand that the users\u2019 privacy is sacrosanct,\u201d Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM Global, the huge advertising buying firm, told me. \u201cBut there are ways to share data without compromising it; everyone else has found ways to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley to Rate Employees With Adjectives, Not Numbers", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byFor years, Morgan Stanley employees were graded in part on a numerical scale that rated them from 1 to 5.Now, the Wall Street firm plans to change those evaluations \u2014 by taking away the numbers.Morgan Stanley told its staff on Thursday that it was overhauling how employees are assessed in several ways, including by discarding the number scale in favor of lists of up to five adjectives.The changes are the latest effort by a stalwart of corporate America to change how it evaluates employees. Some companies, like Microsoft and Morgan Stanley\u2019s longtime rival Goldman Sachs, have made their own changes, which have also included getting rid of numerical ratings.For Morgan Stanley, annual reviews are still helpful in determining how well employees do their jobs. But the current system \u2014 in which staff members were asked roughly eight questions and ranked, in addition to being questioned about \u201careas for development\u201d \u2014 was in need of a change.Evaluators will now be asked to list up to five adjectives that describe the employees. The aim is to give more direct feedback and better steer staff members toward areas of improvement.\u201cIt\u2019s about giving people more information and something they can do more with,\u201d Peg Sullivan, Morgan Stanley\u2019s global head of talent management, said. \u201cIt\u2019s more candid and memorable.\u201dMorgan Stanley will also put in place a dashboard that compiles all the information needed by supervisors to evaluate employees \u2014 like metrics measuring their behavior and data from risk and control functions \u2014 in one place.Other aspects of the performance evaluation process will remain unchanged, including providing \u201c360-degree\u201d reviews, drawn both from supervisors and colleagues.But the timeline for reviews will change. This month, Morgan Stanley employees will meet with their supervisors for face-to-face midyear performance reviews, rather than receive written ones. In November, managers will meet with and discuss the full 360-degree reviews with their staff members before submitting them and deciding on promotions and compensation.Employees will be evaluated not just on how much money they bring into the firm, Ms. Sullivan said, but also on a broad array of factors meant to measure their overall contributions to the firm.\u201cWe don\u2019t just think about what they\u2019ve contributed commercially,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think more holistically: their risk management, their leadership skills and what they\u2019ve contributed to our culture.\u201dThe move away from numerical scales toward adjectives was rooted in the practices of James P. Gorman, the firm\u2019s chief executive, who has sought in recent years more effective ways of evaluating prospective and current employees.His experiment started several years ago, when he began asking job candidates to name five of their positive attributes. Last year, he expanded his test by asking his operating committee to try the new system.Despite suggestions that similar changes at other companies were prompted in part by an effort to appeal to younger workers, Morgan Stanley executives said that was not behind their decision. After all, they noted, Mr. Gorman\u2019s circle of lieutenants is made up of parents of those kinds of workers.\u201cWhile I think the millennials will like it, it wasn\u2019t targeted at them,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upheaval Amid \u2018Alarming\u2019 Revelations at William Koch\u2019s Florida School", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byIt turned out, William I. Koch said in an interview, that a \u201cpower elites group\u201d in the school ran \u201cthe asylum.\u201dThe school, which has 580 students, has many perks, including a physical therapist on staff, chef-prepared lunches, an equestrian club and a flight simulator. The debate team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars traveling to competitions nationwide, Mr. Koch said.\u201cWe are finding alarming things of how money was misspent,\u201d Mr. Koch said at his company\u2019s offices. \u201cIf people think they\u2019ve got a honey pot, there\u2019s going to be a lot of bears around it, trying to get it.\u201dA few years ago, students requested that the school establish a football team, an idea the administration embraced. But that was when the troubles took off. An athlete who read at a third-grade level was given a full scholarship, the football team had its own locker room and the coach earned more than $200,000 a year, according to tax records and interviews with former employees.The former head of school, Robert C. Parsons, whose official title was president and chief executive, is a former chief financial officer at the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Parsons started at Oxbridge in 2011 with a compensation package worth $1 million, tax records show, seven times his academy salary. Eventually, he made about $600,000 a year at the school.But in interviews, former employees questioned Mr. Koch\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Parsons in the first place, because he was suspended for five days after a 2009 Naval inspector general report accused him and his former boss of operating a \u201cslush fund\u201d to pay for tailgate parties.Mr. Koch said he did not think Mr. Parsons\u2019 record at the Naval Academy was a red flag because the government is \u201call screwed up.\u201dTheir experiences underscore the pitfalls that confront business leaders whose professional success does not always translate into the education field.Mr. Koch has discovered similar challenges, though he had a personal motivation for starting Oxbridge.He said he founded the school to give his own children a better academic experience than he had. By his account, he went from being an awkward ugly duckling who was flunking out of middle school in Kansas, to a military academy cadet who embraced a love of study. He longed for a place where students, not teachers\u2019 unions or principals, ruled.He completed a Ph.D. at M.I.T., but acknowledges that he still cannot spell very well. And he chokes up just talking about the troubled students who have made a turnaround at Oxbridge, which his children attend and from which his son has just graduated.\u201cMy biggest failing is I\u2019m too trusting of people,\u201d Mr. Koch said.Oxbridge was created in less than a year on a 45-acre campus that once held a Jewish community center.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people appreciate how much happened here in five years,\u201d said Bob Kaufmann, the chairman of the school\u2019s executive committee, who has been given the task of reducing spending. \u201cThis is a happy place for children.\u201dOxbridge graduates have been accepted this fall to nearly all of the Ivy League universities. One senior won a $100,000 Siemens scholarship for inventing a water-purification method.Mr. Bodnar, who had been on the admissions committee, said the committee\u2019s recommendations were often overruled by the football coaches.He said that there were so many academically struggling athletes that tutors were overwhelmed, and that the players had to be put in classes separate from the rest of the student body.John Klemme, the academic dean who will take over as head of school, said that some of the struggling students \u201cwould have been written off\u201d at other schools, but had found their way to a superior education because of their football prowess.\u201cThis is not to be a rich kids\u2019 school,\u201d Mr. Klemme said.Mr. Koch said that about 40 percent of students \u2014 including those who do not play football \u2014 received some kind of scholarship.Phillip Taylor, 17, a junior, said he loved the school and the opportunities he had been given, such as spring break study at Cambridge University in Britain. Still, he said he resented the double standard on admissions afforded to football players.\u201cMy experience was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned so much. But it does bother me.\u201dHis mother, Cheryl Taylor, also had a daughter in the school\u2019s freshman class in the school\u2019s inaugural year. She said parents like her who are impressed by the education the school offered were startled by its cultural shift.\u201cAt first, you had to be academically qualified, but that changed dramatically about two years in,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cFootball began to outshine everything else.\u201dThe problems at Oxbridge, where tuition is $31,500 a year, went beyond sports. In interviews, several former employees said Mr. Parsons had created a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment. Employee turnover was high and tens of thousands of dollars were spent on severance packages, tax records show.\u201cIf he likes somebody and she\u2019s a pretty girl, they got a signing bonus or a higher salary or a bonus,\u201d Ulle Sinisalu Boshko, the school\u2019s former controller, said of Mr. Parsons.Reached by a New York Times reporter on the phone for comment last week, Mr. Parsons hung up. Reached on Sunday, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d and hung up again.After inquiries from The Post, Mr. Koch hired a team of accountants, lawyers and a retired F.B.I. agent to look into the conduct of school officials, including whether employees were rigging bids with vendors and whether they had broken rules by housing students in their homes.Mr. Koch said he had not been able to verify any \u201csuper sexual harassment\u201d beyond what he called \u201cPG-13\u201d comments like \u201cGod, that girl\u2019s hot\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s got a great behind.\u201d But the investigation, he said, turned up information that led to the firing of Mr. Parsons and the forcing out of the athletic director and the coach.Mr. Koch said the investigators did not find any evidence of kickbacks to employees from vendors. He said that if any evidence of grade-changing emerged, the employees responsible would be fired. He said budget watchdogs would be hired to cut costs and pay closer attention to spending.\u201cThe attitude that was there at the school was that they had a rich guy backing it and they could do whatever they wanted,\u201d he said.He also wants to figure out how to get others to donate to the school, he said. That was one reason he did not name the school after himself.An earlier version of this article misstated the dateline. It is West Palm Beach, not Palm Beach.Advertisement"}

Those results, based on the researchers\u2019 use of basic coding, came despite the individuals\u2019 expressed efforts to remove their names from online searches.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cThis poses a threat to whether the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 can be maintained in the long term,\u201d said Keith Ross, the dean of engineering and computer science at N.Y.U. Shanghai who led the project and who said he had contacted Google with his research. \u201cIf a hacker can easily find 30 or 40 percent of people\u2019s names from delisted articles, what is the point?\u201d he said in an interview.Both Google and the French privacy agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, declined to comment.To get around Europe\u2019s tough privacy rules, the academic team turned to computer science to analyze more than 280 links to British news articles that Google had removed from online search results after individuals had successfully petitioned for the information to be taken down. People can ask for links to be removed if the information is no longer relevant or is out of date. Celebrities and other public figures cannot take advantage of the privacy decision.Using basic coding, the researchers created an algorithm that cross-referenced the names in each report with every article\u2019s headline on Google.co.uk, the company\u2019s British domain. If a link to the online article did not show up in results, the academics said, they could deduce that the individual they had searched for had asked for the link to be removed.Dr. Ross said that for the 283 articles analyzed, his team was able to identify 80 people\u2019s names within 103 articles. He added that, for privacy reasons, he would not be releasing the names.\u201cSomeone with an undergraduate computer science degree would be able to do what we did,\u201d Dr. Ross said. \u201cIt would be relatively straightforward to find the delisted links and republish people\u2019s names online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The First Big Company to Say It\u2019s Serving the Legal Marijuana Trade? Microsoft.", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byAs state after state has legalized marijuana in one way or another, big names in corporate America have stayed away entirely. Marijuana, after all, is still illegal, according to the federal government.But Microsoft is breaking the corporate taboo on pot this week by announcing a partnership to begin offering software that tracks marijuana plants from \u201cseed to sale,\u201d as the pot industry puts it.The software \u2014 a new product in Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business \u2014 is meant to help states that have legalized the medical or recreational use of marijuana keep tabs on sales and commerce, ensuring that they remain in the daylight of legality.But until now, even that boring part of the pot world was too controversial for mainstream companies. It is apparent now, though, that the legalization train is not slowing down: This fall, at least five states, including the biggest of them all \u2014 California \u2014 will vote on whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use.So far, only a handful of smaller banks are willing to offer accounts to companies that grow or sell marijuana, and Microsoft will not be touching that part of the business. But the company\u2019s entry into the government compliance side of the business suggests the beginning of a legitimate infrastructure for an industry that has been growing fast and attracting lots of attention, both good and bad.\u201cWe do think there will be significant growth,\u201d said Kimberly Nelson, the executive director of state and local government solutions at Microsoft. \u201cAs the industry is regulated, there will be more transactions, and we believe there will be more sophisticated requirements and tools down the road.\u201dMicrosoft will not be getting anywhere near these kiosks or the actual plants. Rather, it will be working with Kind\u2019s \u201cgovernment solutions\u201d division, offering software only to state and local governments that are trying to build compliance systems.But for the young and eager legalized weed industry, Microsoft\u2019s willingness to attach its name to any part of the business is a big step forward.\u201cNobody has really come out of the closet, if you will,\u201d said Matthew A. Karnes, the founder of Green Wave Advisors, which provides data and analysis of the marijuana business. \u201cIt\u2019s very telling that a company of this caliber is taking the risk of coming out and engaging with a company that is focused on the cannabis business.\u201d\u201cEvery business that works in the cannabis space, we all clamor for legitimacy,\u201d said Mr. Dinenberg, a former real estate developer in Philadelphia who moved to California to start Kind. \u201cI would like to think that this is the first of many dominoes to fall.\u201dThe partnership with Kind is yet another bold step for Microsoft as its looks to replace the revenue from its fading desktop software business. On Monday, it announced that it was buying LinkedIn.Microsoft has put a lot of emphasis on its cloud business, Azure. The Kind software will be one of eight pieces of preferred software that Microsoft will offer to users of Azure Government \u2014 and the only one related to marijuana.Governments, too, have generally been relying on smaller start-ups to help develop technology that can track marijuana plants and sales.

The biggest business opportunity, though, will come from states that allow recreational use of the drug, as Colorado, Oregon and Washington already do.This fall, five states \u2014 including, most significantly, California \u2014 will vote on whether to join that club.Mr. Karnes, the analyst, said he expected legal marijuana sales to jump to $6.5 billion this year, from $4.8 billion last year. He says that number could climb to $25 billion by the year 2020 if California voters approve the recreational measure this year, as is widely expected.Ms. Nelson of Microsoft said that initially her company would be marketing the Kind software at conferences for government employees, but it could eventually also be attending the cannabis events where Kind is already a regular presence.\u201cThis is an entirely new field for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have to figure out which conference might be the premier conference in this space.
