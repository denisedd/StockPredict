But when C-SPAN\u2019s Steve Scully asked Mr. Sanders about speaking at the Democratic National Convention next month, the senator acknowledged that he was unlikely to best Mrs. Clinton, who has already been endorsed by a number of Democratic leaders, including President Obama.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that I\u2019m going to be the nominee, so I\u2019m not going to be determining the scope of the convention,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, adding that he has reached no agreement to endorse Mrs. Clinton but has been negotiating with her campaign. \u201cWhat our job is now is to have her listen to what millions of people in this country who supported me want to see happen. We\u2019ll see how that evolves.\u201dMr. Sanders did not acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton was going to leave the convention as the nominee, or that she would become the first woman presidential nominee of a major party.

She is more or less an establishment Democrat. It\u2019s kind of hard to deny that. And I think we\u2019ve got to move beyond that.\u201dThe senator also said he was not being vetted to become Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate. He did weigh in on who that person might be, without naming anyone specific. \u201cI think she should select, clearly, the most progressive candidate that she can find,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a terrible mistake for her to go to a candidate who has roots from Wall Street or has been backed by Wall Street.\u201dMr. Sanders also said his campaign had been in regular contact with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and planned to push for \u201cthe most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party,\u201d including planks on campaign finance, health care, higher education and the minimum wage.The senator also said he expected to address the crowd gathered in Philadelphia next month. \u201cI\u2019ve given a few speeches in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be nice to speak at the Democratic National Convention. If they, for whatever reason, don\u2019t want me to speak, you know, so what?

Ms. Cliff and Ms. Rich, the poet, were longtime partners.Ms. Cliff\u2019s entire creative life was a quest to give voice to suppressed histories, starting with her own. Her first essay, \u201cNotes on Speechlessness,\u201d written for a women\u2019s writing group in 1978, can be read as the keynote for her subsequent work, which navigated the complexities of her life situation \u2014 she was a light-skinned black lesbian raised partly in Jamaica and partly in New York, and educated in Britain \u2014 against the broader background of the Caribbean experience.Her aim, she wrote in the 1991 essay \u201cCaliban\u2019s Daughter,\u201d was \u201cto reject speechlessness, a process which has taken years, and to invent my own peculiar speech with which to describe my own peculiar self, to draw together everything I am and have been.\u201dMichelle Carla Cliff was born on Nov. 2, 1946, in Kingston, Jamaica. Her parents, Carl Cliff and the former Lilla Brennan, emigrated to New York soon after her birth, leaving her with relatives. She rejoined them when she was 3.In 1956 the Cliffs returned to Jamaica, where Michelle attended the St. Andrew High School for Girls. Inspired by Anne Frank, she kept a diary, which her parents discovered and read aloud before other members of the family, an experience that deeply traumatized her and kept her from writing for decades. The incident provided the starting point for the title story of the collection \u201cBodies of Water\u201d (1990).The family came back to New York in 1960 and settled on Staten Island, in a heavily West Indian neighborhood. After earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in European history in 1969 from Wagner College on Staten Island, Ms. Cliff worked briefly as a researcher at Time-Life Books and as a production editor at W. W. Norton.In her first book, \u201cClaiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise,\u201d published in 1980, she addressed the problems of identity, history and colonialism in a series of prose poems. \u201cThe Land of Look Behind: Prose and Poetry\u201d (1985) pursued many of the same themes.In her first novel, \u201cAbeng\u201d (1984), she introduced Clare Savage, a light-skinned 12-year-old Jamaican girl who befriends the dark-skinned Zoe, whose family squats on Clare\u2019s grandmother\u2019s farm. It is an idyllic relationship that cannot survive the harsh realities of race and class.\u201cEmotionally, the book is an autobiography,\u201d Ms. Cliff told the reference work Contemporary Authors in 1986. \u201cI was a girl similar to Clare and have spent most of my life and most of my work exploring my identity as a light-skinned Jamaican, the privilege and the damage that comes from that identity.\u201dHer later books included the short story collection \u201cThe Store of a Million Items\u201d (1998) and the essay collection \u201cIf I Could Write This in Fire\u201d (2008).\u201cI and Jamaica is who I am,\u201d she wrote in \u201cThe Land of Look Behind.\u201d \u201cNo matter how far I travel \u2014 how deep the ambivalence I feel about ever returning.\u201dAn obituary on Sunday about the writer Michelle Cliff misstated the century in which the social reformer Lillian Smith, a collection of whose writings Ms. Cliff edited, was active.

{"Headline": "De Blasio Defends Fund-Raising and Stokes Feud With Cuomo", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byHe played the role of press analyst and critic, offering clipped replies and a knowing smirk in response to questions about politics, motivation and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.For a combative but contained 17 minutes, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday offered terse answers to an abundance of questions from reporters, mostly dealing with the fallout from overlapping federal and state investigations into his administration, in a performance that in recent weeks has become a kind of house style for his embattled mayoralty.Seated at a blue table, the mayor restated the mantra that his administration would eventually be found to have done everything appropriately. He laid out dots but no names \u2014 referring to \u201ca particular reporter\u201d at one point, a state official with \u201ca particular employment history\u201d at another \u2014 and asked reporters to connect them, arguing by insinuation that they would lead back to Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat.\u201cA lot of good questions to follow up on there,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, suggesting as he has for weeks that an investigatory report from the State Board of Elections highly critical of his fund-raising on behalf of Democrats in the State Senate had been leaked by those close to the governor to damage him.The back and forth, at the tail end of an hourlong news conference on crime statistics at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, came on the second day of an increasingly open war of words between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, whose deepening feud has shown little sign of being repaired.\u201cHe, in my opinion, falsely and recklessly accused public servants who are just doing their job of being unprofessional,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI think he should apologize.\u201dSo, the mayor was asked the next day, would he apologize? \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, shaking his head. Later, he reiterated, \u201cNot going to happen.\u201dMr. de Blasio instead appeared to stick with the story of a state investigatory apparatus aimed unfairly at him, complaining of a \u201cdouble standard\u201d as he had in previous news conferences, and observing that party affiliation may not preclude the hand of the governor in the leak.\u201cThe lines between Democrats and Republicans often blur in Albany,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Over the past two days, both men also took their swipes when asked about supporting the other for re-election.\u201cI\u2019m not a city resident,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday.\u201cI\u2019m focused on 2016,\u201d Mr. de Blasio replied on Thursday when asked about endorsing the governor.Flanked by top police officials, Mr. de Blasio spoke as much through facial expressions that, at times, revealed his frustration: a pinched smile, a smirk, the movement of his eyes upward to the ceiling as he batted back questions.As Mr. de Blasio spoke, two top aides to the governor posted their own thoughts on Twitter, seemingly emboldened by the inspector general\u2019s report and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s words a day before to attack the mayor more directly.But for all the political tumult, Mr. de Blasio appeared more at ease on Thursday than in recent news conferences, emphasizing at several points how he and his team were \u201cvery comfortable\u201d that the inquiries would reveal no wrongdoing. \u201cThe truth is a very comforting thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re comfortable with the truth.\u201dAs if to underscore that point, Mr. de Blasio remained seated at the blue tables \u2014 with paper nameplates in front of each official \u2014 that in recent weeks have become a hallmark of his news conferences. The blue tables have appeared at police events and at those related to housing; uptown in Washington Heights and downtown at City Hall.\u201cThese are long, long proceedings,\u201d he said when asked about the tables. \u201cIt just makes more sense to sit down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Interest Rates Are Not as Low as They Look", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsInterest rates in Europe got a little crazier this week when the yield on the 10-year German government bond fell below zero.What this means is that investors buying the bond and holding it until it is repaid are guaranteed to lose money. This would seem to turn finance on its head. Lenders usually charge borrowers interest. Investors buying a bond with a negative yield are in effect paying the borrower. Not much in Germany\u2019s case, because the bond\u2019s yield was only minus 0.003 percent on Tuesday, but the benchmark bond crossed a historic line.Negative rates may not be as strange as they look. Indeed, interest rates may not be as low as they look.In economics, it is important to look at the value of something \u2014 gross domestic product, wages, the stock market \u2014 after it has been adjusted for inflation. The same can apply to interest rates. A company borrowing at 5 percent when inflation is 2 percent is paying a real interest rate of 3 percent. If the real borrowing cost goes up by a lot, companies will borrow less and the wider economy will suffer.Europe recently faced that danger, but for a reason that might not be obvious.At the start of 2015, the average corporate loan had a nominal interest rate of 2.44 percent, according to European Central Bank data, down from nearly 3 percent a year earlier. But in real terms, that 2.44 percent was actually 3 percent. That\u2019s because deflation \u2014 a decline in prices \u2014 was 0.6 percent in January 2015. Deflation, unlike inflation, makes loans cost more in real terms.In the last 18 months, the E.C.B. has introduced more measures that have helped bring down the average cost of a corporate loan. Nominally, its interest rate was 1.99 percent in April, but the real cost was 2.24 percent. However, this is still not particularly low. From 2003 till 2008, when interest rates were considered \u201cnormal,\u201d the real corporate borrowing rate was, on average, 2.1 percent.A caveat: A sharp decline in the real interest rate may not lead to more borrowing if other factors depress companies\u2019 appetite for debt. The real cost of borrowing declined below 1 percent in 2012, because interest rates were falling while inflation remained relatively high. But Europe was then gripped with fears of sovereign debt defaults; the economy stagnated; and investors and corporate managers feared deflation. Lending slumped in that period.Demand is high for German bonds in part because investors see them as safe investments. Nervousness about Britain\u2019s vote on leaving the European Union was probably behind the latest surge in demand for the bonds. Bond yields are also low in Europe because the E.C.B. has been buying a huge number of bonds in an attempt to stimulate the Continent\u2019s economy.Anyone holding bonds is probably doing pretty well right now (remember, the price of a bond rises as bond yields decline). Still, some investors contend that these negative yields are distorting markets and are doing little, if anything, for the economy..But there are now signs of life in Europe\u2019s credit sector. One way the E.C.B. can blow on those sparks is to keep buying bonds. This does crazy things like turning German bond yields negative. But it also pulls down borrowing costs for corporations \u2014 and as we have seen, when adjusting for inflation, companies are still not getting particularly cheap loans.Advertisement"}

But lawmakers here have made at least one demographic happy this week: the mimosa set.With precious little time remaining for the legislative session, which is to end on Thursday, the antepenultimate day in Albany was marked by the usual closed-door negotiations among Democrats, who run the State Assembly, and Republicans, who rule the State Senate.In the meantime, however, there was the issue of brunch.In a joint agreement between the Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \u2014 announced on Tuesday just after the breakfast shift, but before the lunch rush \u2014 the state will allow restaurants and bars to start serving drinks on Sundays at 10 a.m.Establishments with liquor licenses outside New York City will be allowed to apply for up to 12 special permits a year for even earlier sales, beginning at 8 a.m. \u2014 perfect for international soccer matches and unexpected visits from your in-laws.The Alcohol Beverage Control Law, which dates to the Great Depression, had made thirsty diners and dipsomaniacs wait until noon.The first call for alcohol, which was packaged along with a range of other changes to the law, came as a peculiar bookend to an agreement on how to deal with another addictive substance: heroin.State Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and majority leader, whose party has been aggressive in response to the heroin crisis, said the plan would \u201cbring hope to communities battling opioid abuse throughout New York.\u201dThe inertia has deeply frustrated government watchdog groups who have repeatedly gathered in the Capitol to push for anticorruption measures, and did so again on Tuesday. Their priorities: closing the campaign finance loophole that allows limited liability companies to donate like individuals, rather than businesses; limiting legislators\u2019 ability to earn money for jobs held outside the Legislature; and making the state budget process more transparent.One advocate, Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director of the League of Women Voters, appeared ready to concede defeat for now, leaving it to the voters to demand change during the fall elections and \u201cmake sure some of these people don\u2019t come back next January.\u201dAnd while the session has had little in the way of recent excitement, the Assembly speaker, Carl E.

{"Headline": "E.U. Countries Warn Britain on \u2018Brexit\u2019: You\u2019ll Pay if You Leave Us", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byIf Britons do vote in a referendum on Thursday to leave the European Union, they can expect a tough and unforgiving response, with capitals across the Continent intent on deterring other countries from following the British example, European officials and analysts said.In other words, Britain will be made to suffer for its choice.With other issues pressing, including Greek debt, the migrant crisis and terrorism, the largest and most powerful European nations will want clarity, and are not likely to tolerate a long period of post-referendum confusion.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, spoke apocalyptically about a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d to the German tabloid Bild. He said all members of the European Union would suffer, as would the postwar structure of Europe that had kept the peace.\u201cWhy is it so dangerous?\u201d Mr. Tusk asked. \u201cNo one can foresee what the long-term consequences would be. As a historian, I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the E.U., but also of Western political civilization.\u201dBritain would face at least seven years of limbo during painful negotiations about a new relationship with the bloc, Mr. Tusk said.Preparing for a British vote to withdraw, France and Germany are debating the immediate announcement of a joint initiative on European security, perhaps an operational command headquarters, to show, at least symbolically, that the European Union remains solid and will continue to progress without Britain.But Germany has rejected some ideas from the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy in Brussels, to respond by moving quickly toward more European political or fiscal integration, understanding that with Spanish elections this month and French and German elections next year, \u201cmore Europe\u201d is not what voters want.And no government wants treaty change, which would prompt more referendums at a time when populist, anti-Brussels sentiments are running strong across the Continent.Suggestions by British politicians favoring a departure that the rest of the European Union will give Britain more favorable terms in a new trading arrangement will be rejected out of hand by European leaders, who do not want to make further concessions to a country that has rejected them, officials said. This would ensure that the British example discouraged others tempted to seek a special deal for themselves.To that end, the main European Union nations are envisioning a two-stage negotiating process for a British exit, once the British government invokes Article 50 of the treaty governing membership in the bloc. Article 50 provides two years to haggle over the terms of a divorce from the bloc \u2014 something that has never happened.The European Union is expected to want to talk about a future trade agreement only after Britain and the other 27 nations in the bloc have made a decision about how to unwind British membership. That process would require resolving complex legal and financial issues and addressing all kinds of topics that would affect ordinary people \u2014 what happens to pensions and health coverage, as well as the immigration status of European citizens working and living in Britain, and that of British citizens in the bloc.Officials want to negotiate future trade and financial services arrangements with Britain as a nonmember; they do not want to allow Britain to use the status of European citizens in Britain and their rights as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations, which could take several years to conclude, beyond the two-year time limit for exit talks.Even then, Brussels would offer Britain one of the three existing models of varying closeness and mutual obligation \u2014 the bloc\u2019s arrangements with Norway, Canada and the World Trade Organization \u2014 rather than offer to negotiate something new, said Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a London research institution.France and Belgium, and probably Germany, are almost certain to reject any British proposal to remain within the European single market \u2014 even, or especially, for financial services \u2014 without at least an agreement that Britain continue to allow European citizens to live and work in Britain, analysts and officials said. In any case, such a trade-off, the so-called Norway model, is strongly opposed by British advocates of withdrawing from the bloc, in the name of controlling immigration.\u201cThere is no appetite to be nice on the day after,\u201d said Camille Grand, the director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. \u201cWhatever the British say or feel, there will be a price to pay, if only to prevent further attempts to exit the E.U.\u201dThe French message, Mr. Grand said, is like Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s: \u201cIf you leave, you leave. And we won\u2019t grant you the benefits of the single market. You won\u2019t move to an \u00e0 la carte membership.\u201dThe Germans and the Dutch, Mr. Grand said, \u201cmight be tempted to be more flexible, but in Paris, it\u2019s a divorce, and we must be tough with the British to prevent the Czechs or whomever from trying to make their own deals.\u201dBut it may be the political aspect of a British exit that worries Europeans the most, coupled with the expected financial shock, said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels.\u201cPopulists throughout Europe will celebrate this as a \u2018feast of democracy,\u2019 where finally the citizens get their say over the elites,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cPopulists all over Europe will gain in strength. And markets could react by saying, \u2018The first brick is out of the wall, and now let\u2019s bet on another brick.\u2019\u201dThe next brick, Mr. Wolff said, could be economically troubled Italy, and that \u201ccould set in motion a domino effect,\u201d with the euro dropping sharply in value along with the pound. So the European Central Bank would have to be prepared to prop up the banks and the euro against market pressure, just as the Bank of England would have to prop up the pound.No one in Germany thinks it would be good if the British left, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. \u201cIf the European Union is not able to prove that membership is worth having, and that in the end emotion wins over rational debates, this not only tells you something about public sentiment in Britain, but will have a contagion effect in other nations,\u201d she said.Added to European instability, Ms. Schwarzer said, the immediate economic shock could badly damage countries with high debt, like France, Italy and Greece.The effect on the bloc of a British departure would be threefold, Mr. Grant said.First, he said, a British withdrawal would be a big boost to nationalist, anti-European Union movements, with Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, already comparing a British exit to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the right will win power, but they\u2019ll feel they have history with them, and pro-European elites in government will be on the back foot and afraid of moves toward more integration,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cFederalism would be dead, and there would be no more referendums and treaty changes for generations, so it would be a new period of national power and not the federal future the European Commission wants.\u201dSecond, he said, without the counterweight of Britain, \u201cthe German problem becomes more acute.\u201d Rome, Paris and Warsaw fear that without Britain as a countervailing force in the bloc, Germany would become too powerful. The Germans themselves fear that an anti-German alliance would form.Third, he said, the European Union without Britain\u2019s free-market influence would be more French in its economic policy outlook and more protectionist, with little impetus for free-trade deals or for the extension of the single market to services.\u201cThe stakes are high, because what happens in Britain will set off a domino effect and possibly a cycle of disintegration,\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe European Union would look like a broken project, a declining power.\u201dRadoslaw Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, said a British departure from the bloc might have some benefits for those who want the nations of Europe to continue drawing closer.\u201cEurope could forge ahead with a common security policy, which the British have vetoed repeatedly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the countries of the eurozone would probably insist on all euro trade being moved out of Britain,\u201d which could help efforts by Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg to establish themselves as more important financial centers relative to London.But over all, Mr. Sikorski said, \u201cthe European Union is much better with Britain in it, providing liberal politics, liberal economics and a center of democratic political consensus of a kind needed now in Europe.\u201dAlissa J.

The letters that arrived contained several illuminating one-liners about money\u2019s relationship to everything from sex to gambling that you may find useful as you try to impart insight to your own loved ones.But like Mr. Olivier, other letter writers also asked something of their recipients: To recognize and own the strong feelings we all have about money. To be patient, careful, fair and generous. To want more but not be greedy. To revel in doing things and care less about having things.Feel free to borrow liberally from the following writers when it comes time to write your own letter:Mr. Olivier, 55, acknowledged that he did get serious rather quickly when writing to his niece, who will attend the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. \u201cMoney and finances typically are wrapped up in a lot of emotions for everyone, and your views on these subjects have been shaped since you were born,\u201d he wrote.And they do so long before they have much technical knowledge of how to manage money responsibly. Schooled in feelings before finance, is it any wonder they sometimes make emotional decisions about how much to borrow for college or what to spend once they get there and get out?So what links these two powerful forces, exactly? \u201cMaybe because, like having sex, money represents success to a whole lot of people,\u201d Mr. Bohmfalk, who is now 68, said in an interview. \u201cAnd money has become a medium of measuring one\u2019s worth, like sex appeal.\u201dRoughly two decades later, both of his sons have had no problems that he knows of with sex or money, and they never had to move back home.Mr. Bohmfalk also mentioned some related words to live by that a physician friend passed on to him many years ago: One spouse, one house. \u201cSo many of our friends had a beach house or a lake house or an airplane and a divorce or two,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly, they were having to work until they dropped.\u201dMr. Bohmfalk, a former neurosurgeon who lives in Charlotte, N.C., retired from the practice of medicine on his 50th birthday.His family has successfully taken on real estate risk over the years, whether it was his relatives who were developers outside of Washington or the bet he and his wife made on a Manhattan apartment and then a Brooklyn house.They\u2019ve also bet on stocks. But they prefer the index funds that feel less like a spin of a roulette wheel than individual stocks do. Hannah Berman, Mr. Berman\u2019s elder daughter, says he\u2019s fond of telling a story about buying stock in Marvel, the comics company, as a young man. \u201cHe immediately lost everything,\u201d she said.Parent and other relatives pass on hard-won financial wisdom.Why put it that way? In an interview, he talked about all of the books and movies his daughters take in that make the case that money doesn\u2019t matter. Money is the root of all evil! Marry for love! Chase your dreams!But then much of the rest of the culture sends the exact opposite message. \u201cI was trying to find the sweet spot that acknowledges the wisdom of both of those perspectives,\u201d he said.Wanting a bit more prestige or a bigger office has been a positive in many situations he had witnessed. \u201cWe want our kids to be ambitious and do stuff,\u201d he told me.She turned to the letter format for a couple of reasons. When she was younger, no one talked to her much about money or wrote anything down, so she wanted to do better as a mother. Plus, the personal budgeting talks with her daughter, who lives with her in Bethalto, Ill., have not quite hit home yet.A written letter, however, has a chance of lasting. That is something that she values after her health scares over the years.\u201cI will probably frame it, because I want her to know that it is a keepsake,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m probably not going to be there when she has kids of her own.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

In 2014, a federal jury concluded that he did.The outcome of Mr. McDonnell\u2019s appeal, which may be announced as early as this week, is being monitored by defense lawyers, particularly in New York, where the two former leaders of the State Legislature were granted reprieves in reporting to prison this summer pending the court\u2019s decision this month.If lobbyists no longer shamelessly buy lawmakers with cash-filled suitcases, influence-peddling today can still be persuasive given the vast amounts of money spent legally, particularly since Citizens United, when the court overturned the ban on outside groups paying for political advertising supposedly independent of a candidate\u2019s own campaign. Donald J. Trump has unabashedly boasted that his own lawful donations to candidates came with strings attached. (\u201cWhen I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them,\u201d he said.)The challenge for prosecutors has been to prove the pro between the quid and the quo.As Preet Bharara, a federal prosecutor in New York, has said, \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you have a written agreement, where someone says, \u2018I\u2019ll pay you this bribe, and you do this favor for me.\u2019 \u201dAbsent a direct link between a quid and a quo, when does a public official\u2019s favor for a benefactor devolve into a flagrantly corrupt exercise of government power in return for a bribe? At what point does the victor belong to the spoils?Mr. McDonnell acknowledged the quids \u2014 even maintaining that he had a First Amendment right to accept Mr. Williams\u2019s gifts, which were legal under Virginia law. But he flatly denied the quos (a claim the jury found hard to swallow after an email was introduced in which the governor asked Mr. Williams about a $50,000 loan and six minutes later emailed his own staff for an update on his university research request).The court is again being asked to what degree Plunkitt\u2019s distinction passes muster legally and to what extent the voters, less equipped than federal prosecutors, become the final arbiters of civic virtue and of what honest services public officials owe their constituents. In other words, in weighing what constitutes corruption, who gets to say, \u201cAnd no more\u201d?Sam Roberts is the urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Surprise Over \u2018Brexit\u2019? Don\u2019t Blame the Polls", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byPolitical CalculusHere we go again. Yet another failure in the world of election forecasting.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union on Thursday was a big surprise. As late as 6 p.m. Eastern in the United States, less than five hours before the results became clear, betting markets gave \u201cRemain\u201d an 88 percent chance to win the election, but it wound up losing by four percentage points.The forecasting error wasn\u2019t confined to bettors, either. Financial markets didn\u2019t anticipate \u201cBrexit,\u201d resulting in a decisive correction in equity and currency markets that usually would have already been priced into trading.In a sense, the E.U. referendum joins a pretty long list of election forecasting errors. But this one was a bit different: It was not a cataclysmic polling failure.The polls consistently indicated that there was a very real chance that Britain would vote to leave. Polling averages even showed \u201cLeave\u201d with a lead for most of the last month; over all, 17 of the 35 surveys conducted in June showed the Leave side with the edge, while just 15 showed Remain ahead.Yet at the same time, betting markets indicated that Remain was a clear favorite. The arguments for making Remain a favorite were understandable, but in retrospect, some look more like wishful thinking than a fair-minded assessment of the data:\u25a0 Polls in Britain had some poor results in the last few years, including in the Scottish referendum and recent parliamentary elections. In the United States, referendum polls can also often be less accurate than general election surveys. In itself, this wasn\u2019t a good reason to discount the possibility of Brexit. But it was used to discount the polls.\u25a0 There were plenty of undecided voters, and it was assumed that undecided voters would break toward the status quo. This was one of the prevailing interpretations of why the polls were wrong about Scottish independence, but oddly, it\u2019s the opposite of the conventional wisdom in American elections \u2014 that undecided voters break toward the challenger. There isn\u2019t a tremendous amount of evidence to believe that either interpretation is an especially solid rule of thumb.\u25a0 Most surveys showed that voters thought that Remain would win, and there is a fairly sizable body of evidence that this type of question \u2014 about who will win rather than who someone will vote for \u2014 does a pretty good job of predicting electoral outcomes. Not this time.\u25a0 Betting markets showed that Remain was favored, and again, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that betting markets are a fairly reliable predictor of election results. Obviously, they were not.It\u2019s not clear why the betting markets were so confident. Perhaps it was in part because of some combination of all of the previous points, but it might have been a dose of wishful thinking from a pool of relatively affluent globalist gamblers who simply didn\u2019t believe that Brexit could really happen.Of course, a 0.5-point lead really isn\u2019t much at all. But the late gains were enough to make Remain a fairly clear favorite in the minds of many \u2014 after all, Remain was favored even when it trailed in the polls.One could certainly argue that the polls were \u201cwrong\u201d in the sense that they tended to show a slight Remain advantage heading into the vote count. But it was clearly a distinct possibility that Brexit would win, based on the available survey data. So it\u2019s hard to argue that this was a big polling failure, and it\u2019s a bit strange that the financial markets appear to have been caught completely by surprise.If there\u2019s a lesson here, it\u2019s a fairly straightforward one: Don\u2019t get too confident in contests when the polls show a very tight race.There might be a somewhat more subtle lesson here as well, one that ought to resonate in the United States after the rise of Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee. Well-educated, establishment-minded analysts \u2014 whether in journalism, finance or betting markets \u2014 may have a tendency to discount the willingness of populist, conservative and less educated voters to support candidates and policies that previously seemed unfathomable, even when the polls say it could really happen.In the case of Mr. Trump, the early skepticism was justified \u2014 given that early polls are generally not accurate in primary elections. Perhaps the same skepticism of early E.U. referendum polls was justified as well.But by the time Election Day comes around, the polls aren\u2019t so bad that they can be dismissed out of hand. There was no reason to be surprised by the result, even if people believed that Remain was likelier to prevail.An earlier version of this article described the view of the betting markets on the British referendum incorrectly. The markets were giving \u201cRemain\u201d an 88 percent chance to win, not a 96 percent chance. And this outcome was predicted as late as 6 p.m. Eastern in the United States, not 7 p.m.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Republicans Unveil Long-Awaited Replacement for Health Law", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After six years of vague talk about a conservative alternative to the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans on Tuesday finally laid out the replacement for a repealed health law \u2014 a package of proposals that they said would slow the growth of health spending and relax federal rules for health insurance.Opponents began the \u201crepeal and replace\u201d mantra almost as soon as the Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010, and while they have voted dozens of times to repeal the health law, the replacement has been elusive.In finally presenting one, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and his Republican team did not provide a cost estimate or legislative language. But they did issue a 20,000-word plan that provides the most extensive description of their health care alternative to date.Many of the ideas \u2014 for \u201chealth savings accounts,\u201d \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d and sales of insurance across state lines \u2014 are familiar. Democrats in and out of Congress have for weeks been rehearsing their lines of attack.Others are sure to be contentious. House Republicans would gradually increase the eligibility age for Medicare, which is now 65. Starting in 2020, the Medicare age would rise along with the eligibility age for full Social Security benefits, eventually reaching 67.Following Mr. Ryan\u2019s budget plans of recent years, the health proposal would transform Medicare into \u201ca fully competitive market-based model known as premium support.\u201d The traditional fee-for-service Medicare program would compete directly with private plans offered by companies like UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana.In their blueprint, to be formally unveiled on Wednesday, House Republicans say they would eliminate the requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. They would offer a flat tax credit to each person or family in the individual insurance market, regardless of income or the premium for a particular insurance policy.House Republicans also said they would roll back the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary or a lump sum of federal money for all of a state\u2019s Medicaid program.In addition, House Republicans would allow states to establish work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid, requirements that the Obama administration has refused to permit. Under the House Republican plan, states could also \u201ccharge reasonable enforceable premiums or offer a limited benefit package\u201d and use \u201cwaiting lists and enrollment caps\u201d for certain groups of Medicaid beneficiaries.Using these options and others proposed by House Republicans, states could profoundly reshape the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to more than 70 million people at a federal cost of more than $350 billion a year.\u201cReforming Medicaid\u2019s financing with a per-capita allotment certainly will reduce federal spending, but just as importantly\u201d will give states more control over the program and more incentives to manage care and costs, the blueprint says.The health care package is one of a half-dozen planks in the platform that Mr. Ryan describes as \u201ca better way.\u201d It is more substantive than anything offered to date by Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and provides a possible framework for Republican action in 2017.Democrats say the package would reverse progress made in reducing the number of uninsured.One of the most important provisions of the 2010 health care law stipulates that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge high premiums because of a person\u2019s medical condition or history. The House Republican blueprint would replace this guarantee with more complicated, less stringent standards.No American could be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, the House Republican plan says. But the protection against higher premiums would apply only to people who maintain \u201ccontinuous coverage.\u201d If a consumer allows a significant break in coverage, insurers could charge more than \u201cstandard rates\u201d and take a person\u2019s health status into account in setting premiums.The House Republican plan would also change the tax treatment of some employer-provided health insurance, in a way that some employers are finding objectionable.Under current law, employees do not have to pay federal income tax on contributions that employers make to their health insurance. House Republicans said this open-ended subsidy had encouraged people to select more expensive coverage, driving up premiums.\u201cTo help lower the cost of coverage,\u201d House Republicans said, they would cap the value of tax-free benefits, but the cap would be so high that it would affect \u201conly the most generous plans.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act tries to discourage inefficient insurance plans as well, through a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage, a tax that was recently delayed until 2020.Republicans say their approach is better, but employers were quick to denounce the proposal.\u201cThis would be a new tax on benefits, on working families, and could eventually threaten the employer-sponsored health insurance that so many Americans enjoy,\u201d said James P. Gelfand, senior vice president of the Erisa Industry Committee, a trade association for large employers.House Republicans would relax age-rating restrictions in the Affordable Care Act. Under the law, insurers generally cannot charge older Americans more than three times what they charge younger people, other factors being equal. Republicans said this was \u201can unrealistic regulation\u201d that led to \u201chigher premiums for millions of Americans, especially younger and healthier patients.\u201dHouse Republicans would allow a ratio of five to one, with states permitted to set more or less restrictive rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guy Hands Testifies He Did Not Make Up Claims Against Citigroup", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Guy Hands, the founder of the private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners, denied in court on Wednesday that he had made up conversations he claimed he had with senior executives at Citigroup ahead of a disastrous deal to buy EMI in 2007.His firm is suing Citigroup in London over several misrepresentations that Mr. Hands claimed Citi executives had made to induce him to bid for and complete a deal to buy the storied music label.The acquisition \u2013 valued at 4 billion pounds, or about $5.8 billion \u2013 came at a high cost for Mr. Hands, damaging his reputation as a shrewd investor and erasing much of his personal fortune.EMI was seized by its lenders in 2011 as it faced a crushing amount of debt. It was acquired by the Universal Music Group the next year.Mr. Hands said on Wednesday that he had personally lost 200 million euros, or about $227 million, on the deal.On Wednesday, Citigroup\u2019s lawyers pressed Mr. Hands on the motivation behind his lawsuit against the bank and questioned whether a claim Mr. Hands filed against the lender in 2013 in Manchester while separately pursuing litigation in the United States was an attempted \u201cshakedown.\u201dAt the time, Terra Firma accused Charles O. Prince III, the former chief executive of Citigroup, of fraud. That claim is no longer part of the case.Mark Howard, a lawyer for Citigroup, questioned whether the claim against Mr. Prince had been filed to embarrass the bank and to force a settlement.\u201cThat is not correct,\u201d Mr. Hands said.This is the second time that Terra Firma has gone to court over claims that Citigroup misled Mr. Hands about EMI and the auction process.A jury in Manhattan found in 2010 that Citigroup was not liable in the matter, but that verdict was later thrown out by an appeals court.Citigroup has said that it believes that Terra Firma\u2019s lawsuit is without merit and that it did not make any dishonest statements to Mr. Hands or Terra Firma throughout the EMI auction.Terra Firma is seeking \u00a31.5 billion in damages, reflecting its full investment, as well as lost profits and management fees it claims it would have earned had it not invested in EMI in the first place. Citigroup provided \u00a32.5 billion in financing for the transaction.As part of the lawsuit, Mr. Hands said he was told by David Wormsley, Citigroup\u2019s head of investment banking in Britain and a longtime banker to Mr. Hands, that Cerberus Capital Management was prepared to bid 262 pence a share for EMI and that Terra Firma would need to make a higher bid than that to win the auction. Terra Firma ultimately was the only bidder for EMI in May 2007.Terra Firma also claims that two other former Citigroup executives made additional misrepresentations to Mr. Hands about the bank\u2019s view on the financial health of EMI to encourage him to complete the deal after winning the auction. Terra Firma injected \u00a3205 million in additional equity into the company after discussing financing with Citigroup, Mr. Hands said.On Wednesday, Mr. Howard pressed Mr. Hands on why his conversations with Mr. Wormsley \u2013 which Mr. Hands said were a driving force behind the deal discussions \u2013 were not documented in the minutes of meetings by Terra Firma\u2019s investment committee or the boards of its general partners.\u201cThe real reason there is no documentation is because none of it is true?\u201d Mark Howard, a lawyer for Citigroup, said.\u201cThat is not correct,\u201d Mr. Hands said.Mr. Hands said he did not always share the sources of his information with the committee.On Wednesday, Mr. Hands also said it was \u201cmarket practice\u201d for information to be shared by agents of selling companies about the price other bidders were willing to pay in a confidential auction, even when there was a confidentiality agreement in place between the parties.It happens \u201con an everyday basis in the City,\u201d Mr. Hands said, referring to London\u2019s financial center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Keeping Up Appearances Ruined a Former Dallas Banker", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseAt age 67, Thomas C. Davis should be enjoying all the perks of a long and distinguished career at the pinnacle of Wall Street and the Texas business elite. These include golfing at the prestigious Dallas Country Club and Preston Trail Golf Club, where he was a member; trips to Las Vegas and golf tournaments on the private jet he co-owned; and fractional ownership of two professional sports teams, the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars.What he faces instead is the prospect of 20 years or more in federal prison and millions of dollars in fines.Last month, Mr. Davis pleaded guilty to 12 felonies for a brazen insider trading scheme in which he leaked a stream of confidential information about the Dallas-based Dean Foods while he served as the company\u2019s chairman.When questioned by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, he lied, compounding his securities fraud by committing perjury. And after the F.B.I. agents left, he took a prepaid cellular phone he had used to leak the information and threw it into a creek near his Dallas home, destroying evidence and obstructing justice.Mr. Davis\u2019s crimes have received relatively little attention, in part because of the blaze of publicity that accompanied the flamboyant professional sports gambler William T. Walters, who was accused of being his co-conspirator, and the three-time Masters golf champion Phil Mickelson. (Mr. Mickelson wasn\u2019t charged but netted nearly $1 million from the Dean Foods tips and agreed to forfeit the proceeds plus interest.)Mr. Walters pleaded not guilty last week to 10 felony counts.What led to Mr. Davis\u2019s actions? His plea hearing, coupled with the S.E.C. and criminal complaints, and interviews with people who know him, offer some clues.For one thing, Mr. Davis was so desperate for money he even took from a charity. According to the S.E.C., Mr. Davis ran a charity that raised money for a Dallas shelter for battered women and children. The charity, tax records show, was Shelter Golf Inc., which held an annual one-day pro-am golf tournament at Preston Trail to benefit Genesis Women\u2019s Shelter & Support. The event typically raised over $400,000 and, after expenses, contributed about $300,000 a year to Genesis.Mr. Davis was a co-president and trustee of Shelter Golf; the golf legend Lanny Wadkins was one of five other trustees. According to the S.E.C., in August 2011, Mr. Davis told his assistant to write him a check for $100,000 on the charity\u2019s account, which he then used to cover an overdraft in his personal checking account of $80,000.\u201cThis $100,000 check resulted in a significant shortfall in the amount available for donation to the battered women\u2019s shelter,\u201d the S.E.C. said in its complaint. \u201cDavis first delayed the charity\u2019s donation to the shelter and later wrote a check for a partial amount only after prompting by the shelter leader and promising another $100,000 by the end of the shelter\u2019s fiscal year.\u201dMr. Davis eventually repaid the $100,000 using money he had obtained as part of the insider trading scheme.Many of his former colleagues on Wall Street were stunned by the charges against the distinguished white-haired Mr. Davis, a Harvard Business School graduate and a Navy veteran, who, in contrast to Mr. Walters and Mr. Mickelson, both known gamblers, was seen as a pillar of the business establishment.In addition to his long tenure on the Dean Foods board, culminating in being named chairman in 2013, Mr. Davis served on at least nine other corporate boards, including Triton Energy, Suiza Foods, and the Dallas-based Colonial Bank (now owned by BB&T Financial). He was chief executive of the Concorde Group and a founder of Bluffview Capital, both investment firms.Before that, he was a managing partner at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he was head of banking and corporate finance for the southwestern United States and handled many mergers and acquisitions. He left after Credit Suisse acquired the firm in 2001.\u201cHe, of all people, should have known better.\u201dBut the annals of insider trading are filled with people who knew better, from Ivan Boesky to Rajat Gupta. What\u2019s perplexing is their motives. Like Mr. Davis, they were already rich and successful beyond most people\u2019s dreams.At his plea hearing last month, Mr. Davis said he knew that his actions were \u201cwrong and unlawful\u201d but otherwise shed little light on why he turned to insider trading. But clearly, he needed money, despite his years of bonuses as a highly paid investment banker and his lucrative directors\u2019 fees.According to the S.E.C.\u2019s complaint, by April 2010 Mr. Davis was in \u201cdesperate\u201d financial straits. He owed the I.R.S. $78,000. His brokerage account was heavily margined, and he had run up tens of thousands in credit card debt. He owed $550,000 to one of his investment funds.Mr. Davis sought salvation in gambling and in Mr. Walters, whom he met decades earlier on a golf course. The two often played together, especially when they were both living in Southern California. The insider trading scheme began around June 2008, when Mr. Davis tipped Mr. Walters to Dean Foods\u2019 coming earnings.It isn\u2019t clear who came up with the idea, but Mr. Walters, an active investor, often expressed an interest in how Dean Foods was doing. There was no explicit agreement for Mr. Davis to share in any proceeds from Mr. Walters\u2019s trading. Rather, as Mr. Davis put it at his plea hearing, \u201cI expected that I would receive personal benefits in the form of business opportunities and a potential source of capital.\u201dAs Professor Coffee put it, \u201cThis is a perfect example of a favor bank, which is exactly how Wall Street works.\u201dHowever vague the terms of their deal, they clearly knew that what they were doing was wrong. Mr. Walters gave Mr. Davis a prepaid cellular phone for use when conveying inside information and told him to use the code \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d when referring to Dean Foods, the government asserted.Mr. Davis finally came knocking in April 2010, when he met with Mr. Walters in Las Vegas and asked for money. Mr. Walters arranged a loan of $625,000, which solved the immediate demands of the I.R.S. and his investment firm.But his spending continued. In just one month, March 2011, Mr. Davis ran up gambling losses of $200,000 at one Las Vegas casino. He owed $178,000 for the private jet. And he had to cover the $100,000 he had taken from the charity. (The overdraft had occurred when the casino cashed in his \u201cmarkers\u201d after Mr. Davis failed to make good on the gambling losses.)This time Mr. Walters guaranteed a $400,000 line of credit for Mr. Davis, who promptly drew down $350,000 of it. And Mr. Davis repaid Mr. Walters\u2019s $625,000 loan, with interest.Mr. Davis ultimately received over $1 million in \u201cloans\u201d from Mr. Walters, most never repaid. As it turned out, that was a pittance compared to the $43 million in profit Mr. Walters reportedly reaped from Mr. Davis\u2019s tips \u2014 a sum Mr. Davis learned of only in the course of the investigation. Despite Mr. Davis\u2019s reputation as a skilled deal maker, that will surely rank as one of the worst insider trading deals in history, and it may help explain why Mr. Davis is now cooperating with the government against Mr. Walters.A lawyer for Mr. Davis, Thomas M. Melsheimer at Fish & Richardson in Dallas, declined to comment.The government has shed little light on Mr. Davis\u2019s motive, other than that he needed money. The S.E.C. said he did little to adjust his expensive lifestyle after leaving Credit Suisse in 2001. He experienced a sharp drop in his income, went through an expensive divorce soon after and suffered big investment reversals during the 2008 financial crisis.None of that is a crime. Mr. Davis is hardly alone in trying to maintain the illusion of wealth and prosperity even as his personal finances veered out of control.But after a lifetime of success, Mr. Davis was too proud and too embarrassed to admit any of this and turn to his wealthy friends and fellow golf club members, though many would have been willing to help, according to a person close to him. (This person and others insisted on anonymity because the situation involved a pending criminal matter.)\u201cSome people would risk anything rather than suffer that kind of personal embarrassment,\u201d Professor Coffee said. \u201cAnd once you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re willing to risk anything, you can get into deep, deep trouble.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The deal with Easterly, which is putting about $200 million into Sungevity, is intended to bring more mutual funds and global institutional investors into the mix.\u201cSolar\u2019s now an economic proposition for tens of millions of homes across the markets that we serve, so the challenge for the industry now is, how do we scale?\u201d Mr. Birch said. The Easterly plan, he added, \u201cgives us access to the public market, and it gives us access to investors who are looking for exposure to that adoption curve.\u201dBut Sungevity\u2019s business model is simpler, requires less capital and should prove more appealing, said Darrell Crate, chairman of Easterly, which, in a similar transaction, created a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, develops and manages government-leased properties.Sungevity \u2014 which operates in 13 states, Washington D.C. and Europe \u2014 focuses on using software to assess sites for solar and then to design, monitor and manage the systems and customer relationships. It relies on a network of partners to handle financing and installation, rather than using its own employees and equipment.\u201cPublic shareholders appreciate simplicity, transparency and clarity,\u201d Mr. Crate said. \u201cThe wisdom of making this a software-based, technology-enabled company allows them to scale and capture the revenue growth without having to grow head count at an equal rate.\u201dExecutives said they expected the merger to go through by the end of the year, when Mr. Birch said he anticipated his company would break even. On approval, Sungevity\u2019s outstanding equity and convertible debt will become shares of Easterly common stock, and Easterly will change its name to Sungevity Holdings.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of states in which the solar panel provider Sungevity operates.

But as with many British industries and institutions, uncertainty prevails over what withdrawal will mean.People who make their living in the arts had been strong supporters of the Remain campaign, with a survey of members of the Creative Industries Federation showing that 96 percent backed Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union.\u201cThis decision has just blown up our foundation \u2014 as of today, we no longer know how our relationships with co-producers, financiers and distributors will work, whether new taxes will be dropped on our activities in the rest of Europe or how production financing is going to be raised without any input from European funding agencies,\u201d he added.The money helps finance production budgets, distribution and film festivals. Co-production, a relatively straightforward endeavor governed by a European convention, could become a far more complicated legal process. The British exit from the European Union is likely to affect the subsidies that both British and cinemas on the Continent receive to show films from member countries.Dance is also likely to be severely affected. Alistair Spalding, the artistic director of Sadler\u2019s Wells Theater, a major dance house in London, said the theater had received about $550,000 from the European Union program over the past five years.\u201cThe money is for collaborative projects that involve cross-European relationships,\u201d Mr. Spalding said. \u201cThese are important and enhance our programs, but are also part of bigger Pan-European collaborations that are now unlikely to happen.\u201dMr. Spalding said the extent to which visas and work permits would become a problem was unclear.\u201cDance companies are extremely multinational, and at the moment, no one from Europe needs anything to perform in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect at some point there is going to be a process for work permits, and that is a big burden of time and cost, and is a discouraging factor. It may be that directors are simply unable to employ the people they want.\u201dHe added that economic uncertainty was another major concern for Sadler\u2019s Wells, and dance in general. \u201cWe are very dependent on donors, and 90 percent of our income is vulnerable to economic ups and downs, so that is actually a big worry,\u201d Mr. Spalding said.In a recent interview, Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate art museums, mentioned that he, too, was worried about the impact that a withdrawal from the European Union might have on the Tate\u2019s ability to employ the best curators from all over Europe.\u201cIt is too early to say how the result of the referendum will affect Tate,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cHowever, our mission remains unaffected, and Tate has a responsibility to promote public interest in modern and contemporary art from across the world.\u201dThe office of John Whittingdale, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, who openly supported Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, declined an interview request on Friday.Advertisement"}

The National Theater in London jumped on board a few years later. But Broadway, facing both financial and philosophical obstacles, has been slow to join the trend.The event will be streamed by BroadwayHD, a new company seeking to broadcast theater performances, on June 30. It will be the first time a Broadway show has been streamed live, the company said. Unlike the broadcasts by the Met, the National Theater and several European opera and ballet companies, it will be available not in movie theaters but on the internet, Roku and Apple TV.\u201cI think it will create more interest in Broadway,\u201d said Todd Haimes, the longtime artistic director of the Roundabout. \u201cThere used to be this feeling, if a movie was made of a Broadway show, that would kill the Broadway show. Then something happened. It was called \u2018Chicago.\u2019 They made the movie, and the \u2018Chicago\u2019 sales went through the roof.\u201dBut the complications are daunting. Theater is a highly unionized industry, and figuring out how to compensate performers and creators has been hard. Despite widespread evidence that broadcasts increase ticket sales, many producers remain concerned about discouraging potential ticket buyers. And it is not clear whether any individual broadcast can be profitable. (The Met Opera, the National Theater and the Roundabout are all nonprofits.)Mr. Davenport said that as technology has improved, the value of broadcasting theater has increased. \u201cIt will never replace live performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe theater has survived the radio, the television, the internet and every other form of entertainment out there. But for people that can\u2019t experience it live, it\u2019s a great first taste.\u201dNonprofit institutions with subscribers have an incentive to support the broadcasts both as part of their mission \u2014 to reach wider audiences \u2014 and because they are building long-lasting brands. For commercial producers, the calculus is different.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely much harder there, because there is an expectation that it has to be a success immediately,\u201d said Emma Keith, the head of NT Live in London. \u201cHere, everybody was happy to say, \u2018Let\u2019s take a risk, and it might take time to generate profits,\u2019 whereas on Broadway it has to make money from Day 1.\u201dNonetheless, interest appears to be growing. \u201cWe see it as a great opportunity to have an additional revenue stream to the actors, and it also helps to raise the profile of American theater,\u201d said Lawrence Lorczak, a senior business representative at Actors\u2019 Equity.The actors in \u201cShe Loves Me,\u201d who include Laura Benanti, Gavin Creel, Jane Krakowski and Zachary Levi, will be paid extra, under contracts by both Equity and SAG-Aftra, for the broadcast of their work. BroadwayHD also had to reach agreements to compensate the authors of the musical (or their heirs, since some of them are no longer alive).Ms. Benanti said she welcomed the decision to broadcast the production. \u201cThe theater is such a vitally important part of our culture,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThe more people able to experience it, the better off we will all be.\u201d\u201cShe Loves Me,\u201d which was first presented on Broadway in 1963, is a much-loved musical with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, who are best known for \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d Adapted from a Hungarian play that also inspired the film \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail,\u201d \u201cShe Loves Me\u201d is about lovelorn parfumerie workers in Budapest who feud and flirt (and sing and dance).The \u201cShe Loves Me\u201d broadcast is being financed by BroadwayHD. Roundabout said it is spending nothing on the venture \u2014 in fact, it will receive a small amount of compensation.Mr. Lane and Ms. Comley said they chose \u201cShe Loves Me\u201d because of the quality of the production, because its cast members are well known, and because they had been looking to work with Roundabout, hoping to forge a continuing relationship with a producing entity that presents multiple theatrical works.Making the broadcast will require nine or 10 cameras in the theater for three performances (two are to test camera angles, lighting, and sound). Some seats will be left vacant for the cameras (\u201ckilled,\u201d in industry parlance), and audience members who are unhappy with the camera presence will be allowed to exchange their tickets, although many people welcome the opportunity to be at a performance that is broadcast.Andrew R.

{"Headline": "Guy Hands Abandons Legal Battle With Citigroup Over EMI", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Guy Hands, the founder of the private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners, abruptly abandoned his yearslong legal pursuit of Citigroup on Friday, a case in which he had claimed that the American banking giant misled him ahead of a deal to buy the music label EMI.The acquisition of EMI in 2007 turned out to be a disastrous one for Mr. Hands, damaging his reputation as a savvy investor after his clients lost all of their investment and personally costing him 200 million euros, or about $227 million, according to Mr. Hands.The storied music label, which counted the Beatles, Coldplay and Katy Perry among its artists over the years, was seized by its lenders in 2011 as it faced a crushing amount of debt. It was sold the following year to the Universal Music Group.Mr. Hands, who first took Citigroup to court in New York six years ago, had claimed that he was misled by Citigroup executives about the auction process ahead of the EMI sale and the bank\u2019s view on the music group\u2019s financial health as he moved to complete financing for the deal, which was valued at 4 billion pounds, or about $5.8 billion.At a special hearing in London on Friday, Terra Firma withdrew its fraud allegations against Citigroup and agreed to pay the bank\u2019s court costs.\u201cI\u2019m sure this is the right result,\u201d said Justice Michael Burton, the judge hearing the trial in London. \u201cPerhaps it will mean the parties will work together in the future.\u201dMr. Hands spent two days on the stand being grilled by Citigroup\u2019s lawyers, who called his memory \u201chazy\u201d and questioned whether claims he filed against Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup\u2019s former chief executive, were simply a \u201cshakedown\u201d to get the bank to settle.The claim against Mr. Prince was dropped ahead of trial, and Mr. Hands admitted on the stand that statements attributed to Mr. Prince in his complaint originally filed in Manchester were wrong and there was no proper basis for those claims to be filed.Terra Firma had been seeking the entirety of its investment, about \u00a31.5 billion, as well as potential lost profits from other deals the firm might have made if it had not bought EMI.\u201cThese claims were brought in good faith,\u201d Mr. Hands said in a statement on Friday. \u201cHowever, it has become evident that our documentation of the fast-moving and complex events, and memories of these events after nine years, are no longer sufficient to meet the high demands of proof required for a fraud claim in court.\u201dMr. Hands, who had attended every day of the trial this week, was not in court when his legal team announced on Friday that the case was being withdrawn.\u201cThe matter is now closed,\u201d Mr. Hands said. \u201cTerra Firma is looking to the future.\u201dTerra Firma declined to comment further.This is the second time he has pursued Citigroup, which was advising EMI and providing financing for the deal.A jury in Manhattan in 2010 found Citigroup not liable, but an appeals court later ordered a retrial. The parties eventually agreed to move the case to Britain.As he had in the New York case, Mr. Hands claimed he was misled by David Wormsley, Citigroup\u2019s chairman of investment banking in Britain and a longtime banker to Mr. Hands, about plans by Cerberus Capital Management to offer a competing bid in an auction for EMI.Terra Firma ultimately was the only bidder in May 2007.Mr. Hands also claimed in his case in London that he was misled by two former Citigroup executives about the financial health of EMI: Michael Klein, Citigroup\u2019s former head of global banking; and Chad Leat, then co-chief of Citigroup\u2019s global credit markets.Mr. Hands had claimed Terra Firma agreed to inject \u00a3205 million in additional equity into the company after discussions with Citigroup executives ahead of securing financing for the transaction. Citi provided \u00a32.5 billion in financing for the deal.\u201cWe have always maintained that the allegations made by Terra Firma were entirely baseless and that Citi, specifically David Wormsley, Michael Klein and Chad Leat, acted at all times with absolute honesty and professional integrity throughout the EMI transaction,\u201d Citigroup said in a statement. \u201cWe are very pleased that Terra Firma has unreservedly withdrawn the allegations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then, in 2014, liberal Berkeley, Calif., passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. Several measures, including one in New York, never won much support.But on Thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in Philadelphia, one of the country\u2019s largest cities \u2014 and also one of its poorest. Indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in Philadelphia.\u201cThis is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,\u201d he said in a news conference after the vote.\u201cIf we go five years ahead and look back, I think this is going to be a watershed moment,\u201d said Jim Krieger, executive director at Healthy Food America, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. \u201cThis is going to really provide momentum.\u201dSan Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; and Boulder, Colo., are considering soft drink taxes this year. Mr. Krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as Philadelphia.Mr. Kenney said he hadn\u2019t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. \u201cTie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,\u201d he said in his news conference. \u201cWhen it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less sugar-sweetened beverages, but tie it to things that people care about.\u201dThe Philadelphia tax of 1.5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. It is expected to increase prices \u2014 the tax is about 30 cents for a 20-ounce drink, or $2.16 for a 12-pack. If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year.The soft drink industry and its allies, including the Teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in Philadelphia. They held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran anti-tax ads on television and the radio, right up until Thursday\u2019s final vote. They branded the drinks tax measure a \u201cgrocery tax,\u201d suggesting that more food products were next.The soda industry has argued that Philadelphia\u2019s politics are unusual and that the vote here can\u2019t be seen as predictive.

While the computer scientists involved in the project are aiming to tweak the code that underpins Ether in a way that will recover the money, the theft is nevertheless prompting a bigger debate about the viability and principles of virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether.\u201cThis is one of the nightmare scenarios everyone was worried about: Someone exploited a weakness in the code of the D.A.O. to empty out a large sum,\u201d Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell who co-wrote a paper pointing out problems with the project, said on Friday.Central banks and financial firms have been exploring how to use the technology underlying virtual currencies \u2014 known as blockchain \u2014 to improve their own internal systems. The technology is considered to have advantages in terms of transparency and security. Just last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told central bankers at a trade industry conference that they should accelerate their efforts to explore blockchain.But the incident on Friday provided another reminder of how the code can be just as vulnerable to human greed and mistakes as paper bills.\u201cThe D.A.O. is being attacked,\u201d Griff Green, a community organizer with the company that wrote the project\u2019s software, Slock.it, wrote on a chat channel for the project Friday morning. \u201cThis is not a drill.\u201dThe money that the hacker moved appeared to be frozen on Friday as a result of a safeguard previously built into the code. The thief was caught in what might be thought of as a digital version of the airtight double doors that sometimes protect valuable sites (known in security circles as man traps).Programmers working on the Ethereum network, which hosts Ether, were debating on Friday whether to make a one-time change to the code to recover the frozen money. That faced immediate opposition from many virtual currency purists who were attracted to the technology because of its ostensible freedom from human meddling.If the leaders of the Ethereum project decide to move forward with a change to the code \u2014 known as a fork \u2014 they will need to win the support of the people who lend their computing power to the network, and who have what amounts to a vote over any changes to the Ethereum software.The hacking on Friday underscored the complicated governance structure employed by so-called cryptocurrencies. These currencies are not run by any company or individual but by the computers of anyone who chooses to support the network.The D.A.O. was supposed to be a further extension of this concept of group decision-making. Thousands of people around the world financed the project by sending in Ether. The D.A.O. was supposed to act as a sort of venture capital fund, investing in projects that were voted upon by people who contributed money. The attack on Friday took place before any projects had been funded.The specific mechanism the hackers used is known as a recursive call vulnerability, \u2014 essentially a malicious transaction that moves money away from the D.A.O. into a side fund in an endlessly repeating loop.The attack led to chaos on the online message boards where D.A.O. investors and Ether users gather.\u201cHow can we help and protect our funds?\u201d one user wrote on the Slack chat channel for D.A.O. investors.The programmers who wrote the D.A.O. code immediately suggested that investors vote to move their money to another, unrelated project known as Congo Split, primarily to protect their investments.\u201cThe community needs to spam the network so that it can mount a counterattack,\u201d Stephan Tual, an employee with Slock.it, wrote on that company\u2019s website. Programmers with Slock.it wrote the code for the D.A.O. but said they had no formal continuing role with the project.By the time it was over, the hacker had managed to gain control of 3.6 million Ether \u2014 more than a third of the 11.5 million that were there at the beginning of the day.\u201cThe D.A.O.\u2019s journey is over,\u201d Mr. Tual said in an email on Friday.The incident on Friday was a reminder of the dozens of hacking attacks and thefts that have rattled Bitcoin since it was released in early 2009. In 2014, Mt. Gox, which was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.The attacks on Bitcoin have generally led to a temporary lull in public interest in virtual currencies. But Bitcoin has bounced back each time. Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin has risen swiftly to the highest level since the Mt. Gox fiasco; it stood at $770 on Thursday night.Some of the recent demand for Bitcoin has come from anticipation of a coming event known as halving. Currently, the Bitcoin software releases 25 new coins \u2014 a block \u2014 every 10 minutes or so to computers helping support the network. In mid-July, the blocks will shrink to 12.5 coins. The shrinking supply has led some to assume that the price will go up.The price of Ether had been rising alongside Bitcoin over the last month, in part because of the interest generated by the D.A.O. On Thursday, both were up more than 60 percent over the previous month. But the attack Friday morning sent the price of Ether into a downward spiral.By Friday afternoon, the price of Ether had fallen 33 percent from its high a day earlier, to around $13. Bitcoin had also fallen, though less sharply, to around $750.The founder and lead programmer on the Ethereum project, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Friday that he supported a change to the code that would reclaim the money from the hacker. But he said he recognized that he might not win the argument.Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor, wrote: \u201cThere is no good solution here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Breakthrough Is Seen to Bolster U.S. on World Stage", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byNews Analysis\u201cOur national security and our economic security were very much at stake,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said of the showdown over the I.M.F. \u201cAnd as someone who for the last three years has gone to international meetings\u201d \u2014 where he was badgered by ministers frustrated by American inaction \u2014 \u201cI can tell you that it was ratcheting to the point where it was doing real damage.\u201dAs 2016 begins, much has changed.\u201cIt\u2019s been critically important to get this done,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview. \u201cThe I.M.F. is really the first line of defense, the first responder, in global economic and financial crises. And for 70 years the United States has played the driving leadership role in the organization.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. has an opportunity now to set what its strategy is internationally on the economic side, but also on the strategic side, the security side,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Lew\u2019s decision to work with Congress on the I.M.F. \u201cshows a kind of principled leadership.\u201d\u201cToo bad it took five years, to be sure,\u201d he said.That damaging delay, and conditions that Congress imposed, left Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs during the Clinton administration, with a glass \u201conly half full with champagne,\u201d he wrote after the I.M.F. measure\u2019s passage.\u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about trade or aid or finance or whatever, the politics of the country are in the direction of \u2018The world is dirty; let\u2019s wall ourselves off from it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Truman said in an interview.That was reflected, he said, in the \u201cstealth\u201d way that Mr. Lew had to work behind the scenes to ensure Republicans\u2019 assent, given the I.M.F.\u2019s unpopularity with conservatives. And it shows, he added, in the language of Republicans seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination: \u201cWe either want to say, \u2018Our way or the highway,\u2019 or we say, \u2018Build a wall.\u2019\u201dThe overhaul of the I.M.F., which now has 188 countries as members, will be the most significant since the organization was formed in 1945 as an international lender of last resort to foster global stability and reduce poverty after decades of world wars and economic depression.The changes, spearheaded in 2010 by the Obama administration, are intended to reset members\u2019 quotas for contributions and their voting shares to better reflect the current world. They would raise the status of emerging nations \u2014 in particular China, but also India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 at the expense of European and Persian Gulf nations. The United States would retain its veto power.While quotas would be doubled to buttress I.M.F. lending, that would cost the United States and other countries relatively little because emergency funds affluent countries provided in the crisis would be counted toward members\u2019 quotas.Yet after taking the lead in designing the overhaul, the United States was the holdout as the proposal languished in Congress. \u201cMy counterparts were saying, \u2018We trust you, but we don\u2019t know if we trust the United States to get this done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lew said.He pressed Republican leaders in Congress and by April had their commitments to help pass the overhaul in 2015. Mr. Lew said he took part in hundreds of calls \u2014 including a crucial round with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while he was in Armenia for the centennial of the Armenian massacre. With the phone system there overwhelmed by the throngs in the streets, the Americans kept losing their connections, Mr. Lew recalled.For months, a series of bills were considered and rejected as vehicles for an I.M.F. amendment, out of fear that the I.M.F. bill would endanger its carrier. In December, the overhaul got its ride on the year\u2019s last must-pass bill, which funded government operations through September.Mr. Lew said two factors crystallized the argument that American credibility and leadership were at stake. One was the need to persuade the I.M.F., and the emerging nations among its members, to aid Ukraine. The other was the rise of China\u2019s new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was poised to fill a vacuum left by the United States.While I.M.F. members and its managing director, Christine Lagarde, supported the change, Mr. Truman called it \u201ca horrible precedent\u201d for Congress to impose such conditions. Still, he applauded Mr. Taylor for his role in gathering Republican support.Mr. Taylor, for his part, said: \u201cThis is an international organization, and many parts of the country don\u2019t even know what it is. Members had to have a reason to vote for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His marriage was collapsing. So he decided to disappear.He told people he was going to California, to visit his uncles.

He spent time with what he described as the internal posse he carries around in his head \u2014 Robert Frost, Plato, T. S.

That was a moment of, \u2018All right, everything is just chilled out.\u2019\u201dMr. Silver, 53, hadn\u2019t contacted anyone he knew for roughly three weeks when he called his wife to say he would be home soon. (They ended up divorced.)Although Mr. Silver came to see that Havana was not the answer to his troubles, he believed he had gone through a genuine change during his time away. A confidence he had lost somewhere along the way returned to him in force.\u201cI was able to take a moment and say, \u2018I\u2019m being too affected by other people\u2019s weaknesses,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to Havana helped me to rethink and get clear about what kind of man I am and to come out swinging, hit it, when I came back home.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a day-to-day situation and dealing with people\u2019s problems, it\u2019s like having a bunch of rocks in your shoe. Whereas, if you\u2019re on your own, you can take out the rocks. Or you don\u2019t have to wear shoes at all.\u201dAfter feeling isolated in Los Angeles, Ross Langley found himself building a treehouse just outside Des Moines.\u201cThis was the happiest I\u2019d been since I was a kid,\u201d Mr. Langley said. \u201cI would sit in Des Moines at night, looking over cornfields, sipping whiskey and listening to sounds I\u2019d never heard before \u2014 like deer, which make very unpleasant sounds, but mostly loons in the lake. You\u2019d hear these loons at night and you\u2019re watching fireflies dance in the air, and you realize how unhappy life has been.\u201dMr. Langley was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Having trained as a classical actor, he went to Los Angeles with big ideas, only to discover he was unprepared for a life of near-constant auditions, few callbacks and superficial social interactions.In May 2014, an old friend called him with the idea of a road trip. Mr. Langley was hesitant. He worried that if he were to leave, if only for a day, he might miss out on something big.To support himself, he was working in construction. One lunch break, he told a co-worker about what he was going through, and the man said, \u201cIs that how you\u2019re going to live your life?\u201dThat was that. Mr. Langley joined his friend for a two-week trip through the American West. Upon his return, he received a call from a woman who asked him if he would be her date at a wedding in St. Louis. He said yes, using the new trip as a springboard for another journey.He stayed away from Los Angeles for close to two months, during which he built the treehouse, on property that belongs to his wedding date\u2019s father (she accompanied him for part of the trip). He also drove through the Badlands and the Black Hills, through Native American reservations and to Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. He spent time on an island off the coast of Washington that had once been a kind of family homestead, where he saw his grandparents\u2019 initials carved into a sea wall.He had dinner at campsites and morning coffee looking out onto lakes with people he had just met. No one cared about what roles he had gone out for.\u201cI think the whole experience, for me, was just about knowing who I was,\u201d said Mr. Langley, 26, who now works as a web designer in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling of being in a place like Glacier National Park and being dwarfed by nature that\u2019s equally terrifying and freeing. I realized the experience I was having in Los Angeles, even in an ideal world where I was successful as an actor, would never truly satisfy me.\u201dAfter college, Jonathan Kesselman returned to his hometown, Los Angeles, in 1999 with the notion that he would work for a while before attending the graduate film program at the University of Southern California.But he proved good enough at his job, working with medical databases, to earn six figures. When he was rejected by U.S.C., he felt the golden handcuffs tightening.He bought a one-way ticket to Australia. For three months, he traveled extensively with no clear idea when he might return. He drank, smoked marijuana, took Ecstasy. He danced on tables. He sky-dived. He slept around.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I discovered when you travel alone,\u201d said Mr. Kesselman, now 41. \u201cYou\u2019re only alone when you want to be alone. You make friends so easily, and when you get tired of people, you hop on a train for somewhere else.\u201dAfter his return, he was accepted by the U.S.C. program and went on to direct a cult comedy, \u201cThe Hebrew Hammer,\u201d and more recently, \u201cJimmy Vestvood: Amerikan Hero.\u201d\u201cThe person I was when I was in the states was not the person I was when I traveled abroad,\u201d Mr. Kesselman said. \u201cI had all the baggage from my formative years.

He had to get away from San Francisco, away from America, away from the news. And he had to be on a motorcycle.He found one, a BMW R1150GS, in Milan.

{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Investors Are Gripped by a Panic Last Seen in 2008", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 First came the shock. Then fear seized world markets. As frenzied selling accelerated in Tokyo, Hong Kong and London, unfathomable amounts of wealth vanished in a matter of hours.As economists pored over the rout like accident investigators dispatched to the scene of a crash, most offered assurances that a Lehman-style financial panic was not unfolding. In that debacle, investors indiscriminately fled all assets connected to the disastrous American housing bubble. Mortgages had been carved into exotic investments and peddled around the globe, meaning they lurked everywhere. Distrust spread like a virus.This time, the source of the trouble is both identifiable and relatively confined. Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union face significant uncertainty in their economic and financial dealings as they embark on complex divorce proceedings.Fears that drawn-out negotiations could disrupt trade prompted investors to push their money toward safety. As night fell in London, the British pound was down more than 7 percent. Stock markets plummeted around the globe; the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 3.6 percent in New York. London closed down a similar margin, and Tokyo surrendered more than 4 percent. Investors poured money into government bonds, seeking refuge.\u201cAs of now, this doesn\u2019t look like an end-of-the-world event,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, an independent research organization. \u201cIt looks bad, but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic game-changer similar to Lehman.\u201d Then he paused. \u201cYet.\u201dIn the best case, the plunge in markets represents an abrupt adjustment to the changing geography of global commerce. Britain has been diminished as a place for banking and business, and so the pound has lost some luster.In the worst case, investors have begun a fearful march away from risk, potentially starving emerging markets and stripping European countries of needed capital. It could last as long as the uncertainties dogging Europe \u2014 perhaps years.If recent traumas have clarified anything, it is the tendency for trouble to emerge unexpectedly. The global financial system is so intertwined that links can remain opaque.One key factor undergirds confidence that the so-called Brexit will not deliver Lehman-like troubles. In 2008, central banks on both sides of the Atlantic failed to recognize the mounting disaster. They failed to prepare adequate relief. While people may argue over the degree to which regulators have tamed the speculative excesses of finance, few dispute that improvements have been delivered.\u201cThe financial systems in the U.S. and Europe, including the U.K., are far more capitalized and less leveraged than they were in 2008,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThe proclivity to panic in ways that create financial instability are much more limited.\u201dThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank have tools they can wield to defuse threats to banks. They can simply print money and lend it out as needed.Less than an hour after markets opened in London on Friday, Britain\u2019s central bank governor, Mark J. Carney, stood before television cameras and struck a resolute pose as he promised to do what it took to stabilize markets. He announced that he was prepared to unleash another \u00a3250 billion (about $370 billion) in pursuit of financial tranquillity.\u201cWe expect institutions to draw on this funding if and when appropriate,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cThe bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses.\u201dThose words appeared to assuage fears, as the pound and stock prices both pared their losses.In recent years, the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have subjected financial institutions to so-called stress tests. They regularly scrutinize banks\u2019 portfolios and the money they hold in reserve to make sure they can hold up in various outbreaks of trouble.Yet, these are academic exercises.\u201cThis is the real stress test,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.The immediate run on stocks and currencies might yet grow into something worse, shaking consumer confidence and prompting households to limit their spending. As businesses lose profit opportunities, they are likely to put off investing and hiring.If that happens, it could create a spiral ending in recession, both in Britain and across Europe, adding to pressure on banks. The markets seemed to be warning of this possibility as they savaged the value of banking stocks on Friday.The greater the odds that the European Union will splinter, the more investors are likely to demand extra payouts for fresh loans to debt-saturated countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. That could squeeze businesses there, making it harder for them to borrow, further crimping their economies.\u201cThat could then spread to the banks and go global, and that could smell like a Lehman,\u201d said Markus Schomer, chief economist for PineBridge Investments, a global asset management firm. He put very low odds on this \u201creferendum contagion\u201d case.If history is a guide, hedge funds, private equity and other realms of finance will also suffer. There, aggressive players borrow enormous sums of money to place outsize bets. Crises have previously revealed those taking on outsize risk. Long Term Capital Management, which borrowed heavily, appeared robust before losses in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s brought it to the verge of a collapse that threatened the broader financial system and required a private bailout.As the prominent investor Warren E. Buffett once put it, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201dThose who had been paying attention to the American housing crisis were hardly surprised when Lehman\u2019s afflictions burst into public view. Lenders had been writing mortgages to seemingly anyone in possession of a signature. Lehman had been repackaging these loans and selling them for vast profits.The surprise was that Lehman actually went bankrupt, exposing its trading partners to losses. By contrast, polls had suggested that Britain might really walk. This is a source of hope, given that central banks, governments and investors had more time to prepare.\u201cLehman came out of the blue,\u201d said John Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \u201cThis is like a train wreck where you can see the trains coming together for a long distance and you\u2019re hoping the trains will swerve away.\u201dBut any comfort in that is sapped by the fact that Britain, one of the oldest democracies on earth, put itself in this spot through an exercise of free will. Now, the world waits to see how far the pain spreads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Uber Keeps Raising Billions", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byDealBookConsider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million.So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber \u2014 and the financial markets \u2014 that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds?Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uber\u2019s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uber\u2019s fund-raising efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: It\u2019s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers; it\u2019s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash.At the moment, Uber\u2019s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, \u201cWe can do it too.\u201d But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash \u2014 after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber \u2014 venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber.Uber\u2019s fund-raising arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns \u2014 private companies worth $1 billion or more. So there\u2019s clearly a rush to take the money while it\u2019s still available.\u201cIt\u2019s not the second inning or even the sixth, it\u2019s the 14th inning in a five-hour baseball game,\u201d Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: \u201cYou are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort.\u201dThe ride-sharing industry has long been seen as a zero-sum game because of the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.)The question is whether the financing game is zero-sum too. And the even larger question is whether Uber\u2019s eye-popping capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uber\u2019s competitors: Will they look at Uber\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there \u2014 and throw up a white flag?So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined.Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other \u2014 at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.)Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber.Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia \u2014 if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share.That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uber\u2019s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4.5 percent.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. That\u2019s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then.But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none.The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.Advertisement"}

In a telephone interview, Albert G. Horvath, the Smithsonian\u2019s under secretary for finance and administration, sounded vague. \u201cThe support of the former mayor, Boris Johnson, was tremendous,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are feeling the same support from the new mayor, Sadiq Khan.\u201dTim Reeve, deputy director and chief operating officer of the Victoria and Albert, said the museum had been eager to work closely with the Smithsonian ever since it heard about the institution\u2019s interest in Olympicopolis, a 4.5-acre waterside site close to the Olympic Stadium.\u201cIt\u2019s a great institution, enormous, with an incredible collection that is complementary to ours,\u201d he said, referring to the Smithsonian. \u201cIt seemed obvious to us from early on that some of the subjects we were keen to investigate would be better done together.\u201dThe Smithsonian \u201cstarted to move away from the idea of a real estate transaction and to the idea of a collaborative project,\u201d Mr. Horvath said.\u201cThe amount of annual operating overhead cast a big shadow over the primary objective: How do we get broader exposure for the Smithsonian internationally?\u201d he said. \u201cBut one of the main attractions early on was to be connected to a number of other cultural institutions.\u201dReferring to the Victoria and Albert, Mr. Horvath added: \u201cIt was astounding to us how similar our visions for the future are. We are both thinking about what a 21st-century museum should do, presenting content differently through digital media and technology, engaging audiences who might not be inspired to visit our institutions. To us, it seemed like a marriage made in heaven, and as time went on, we began to feel that it would be preferable to collaborate.\u201dMr. Reeve said that the two organizations had \u201clots of ideas\u201d about possible exhibitions that would be planned over the next year. While there was no decision on how the roughly 195,000-square-foot building would be divided up, he said, the Smithsonian would have significant space.\u201cIt\u2019s super, super exciting,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s great news for London.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Gas Tax in New Jersey: After Years of No, It May Be Time for Yes", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byAmid mounting alarm over how to pay for repairs to New Jersey\u2019s roads and bridges, state lawmakers are lining up behind a potential solution once considered politically unthinkable: raising the state\u2019s famously low gas tax.A new proposal from leading Democrats is forcing a showdown with Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has resisted calls to increase prices at the pump even as the state\u2019s transportation trust fund is set to run out of money at the end of the month. Under the proposal, the tax could rise by about 23 cents a gallon, bringing it closer to what neighboring states collect.\u201cWe are very much in crisis if this thing shuts down,\u201d said Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and the State Senate president, referring to the transportation trust fund.The transportation funding proposal announced in New Jersey this month included a sweetener meant to attract Republican votes: the repeal of the state\u2019s estate tax, which kicks in at a lower amount than in many other states.Even with that concession, Mr. Christie, who has about a year and a half left in office, said he opposed the proposal. He described part of the plan that would increase transportation aid to counties and municipalities as a \u201cpayoff\u201d by Democrats to local officials. But despite his characteristically blunt rhetoric, the governor appeared open to negotiation.\u201cThere is a lot of work that needs to be done,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters last week. \u201cThere is a lot of show-me that has to be done. But as you know, at the end of any session, miracles happen.\u201dSeveral Republican lawmakers have already expressed support for the proposal. Democrats, who control both the Senate and the Assembly, hope to pull together enough votes to override a potential Christie veto.\u201cNow that the fund is set to become insolvent, you\u2019ve really seen a considerable shift in public opinion, but also political will in the Legislature in terms of coming up with some kind of compromise solution,\u201d Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, said.At 14.5 cents per gallon, New Jersey\u2019s gas tax is the second-lowest in the country; the figure includes a 10.5-cent motor fuels tax that has not increased since 1988 and a 4-cent petroleum products tax first approved in 1990. The Democrats are proposing raising the tax to about 37.5 cents per gallon, still less than New York State\u2019s gas tax.New Jersey Transit, which runs the state\u2019s passenger rail and bus lines, has been plagued by problems and now has a $46 million budget gap. Riders have been frustrated by delays and fare increases. Rail workers nearly went on strike this year, and two major unions are in negotiations that could still result in a strike.New Jersey is lagging as other states in the region plan major investments in their infrastructure, said Mr. Sweeney, who may run for governor next year. (Mr. Christie is prevented by term limits from seeking another term.) He cited New York and Connecticut; leaders in both states have said they want to spend $100 billion on infrastructure plans.The gas tax proposal would allow the state to raise about $20 billion over 10 years, Mr. Sweeney said. As part of the deal, which includes several tax cuts, the estate tax that residents pay when they inherit money would be phased out by the end of 2019.Lawmakers from both parties have criticized elements of the plan. Some Republicans oppose any gas tax increase, while some Democrats say that eliminating the estate tax would remove an important source of revenue and create its own fiscal challenges.\u201cWhen I\u2019m being criticized by Democrats and Republicans \u2014 when you\u2019re criticized by both, you\u2019re usually in a good spot,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said.The authorization for the transportation trust fund, which pays for road, bridge and mass transit projects, expires June 30. The state Transportation Department would continue to receive federal funding, and work already underway would continue, Steve Schapiro, a spokesman for the department, said. But new state-funded projects could not be started.As Democrats seek votes outside their party, the gas-tax debate highlights a growing fissure among the state\u2019s Republicans. A vote by Republican lawmakers to override a Christie veto would be the first rebuke in both chambers of a once-popular governor who had buoyed his party\u2019s fortunes in a state that leans Democratic.Mr. Christie\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 27 percent in New Jersey amid his travels outside the state for his presidential campaign and now for Mr. Trump. In September, two of his former allies are set to go on trial in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal that has marred the governor\u2019s second term.At the same time, the jockeying to succeed him has already started. Philip D. Murphy, a former ambassador to Germany who announced that he would run for governor as a Democrat, and Steven Fulop of Jersey City, a Democrat who is expected to run, have said they generally support the idea of increasing the gas tax.Vincent Prieto, a Democrat who serves as Assembly speaker, said there were parts of the plan he found distasteful, but that it was time for a compromise.\u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t love everything in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut everybody can live with the final product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For-Profit-College Fiasco: Why a Watchdog Needs a Watchdog", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byA Failure to EvaluateLast year, the for-profit Corinthian Colleges chain collapsed under the weight of government investigations and allegations of fraud. Its demise left tens of thousands of Corinthian students with loans that will ultimately cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to forgive.This week, the private accrediting group that allowed Corinthian to stay open for business will face its own existential threat, when federal regulators decide whether to shut it down. That decision will go a long way toward determining whether education companies will continue to have free rein to profit from government financial aid programs.The list includes Miami-based FastTrain College, which hired exotic dancers to entice young male students, until its president was sentenced to eight years in prison for illegally enrolling high school dropouts and using the profits from their federal student aid money to buy a private plane and a 54-foot yacht.The rest of the Center for American Progress report is a long list of attorney general investigations, F.B.I. raids, illegal recruiting practices, deceptive marketing schemes, multimillion dollar legal settlements, falsified job placement statistics and student suffering. The one thing the various colleges had in common, other than enthusiasm for enrolling low-income student bearing hefty student loans, was that each was accredited in good standing by the ACICS group. Indeed, many were on its \u201chonor roll.\u201dDespite receiving over $150 billion in federal grant and student loan dollars every year, higher education is largely a self-regulated industry. Instead of directly determining whether colleges are good enough for federal funding, the government outsources that decision to private accreditors, which are governed and financed by colleges themselves. Accreditors set and enforce their own standards. For-profit colleges that operate nationwide can shop around to find the accreditor with the easiest terms.The national advisory committee\u2019s job is to accredit accreditors. It decides which accrediting organizations can, in turn, make colleges eligible to grant visas and receive federal aid. Over the years, the committee has been loath to kick anyone out, relying instead on a system of stern warnings and requests for additional paperwork when things go wrong. In this way, it has mirrored the philosophy of accreditors themselves, which rarely find that one of their dues-paying members should be banned from the club.No accreditor has ever come before the committee with as many problems as the ACICS group. If the group is allowed to continue operating, it\u2019s hard to imagine what would be bad enough to prompt loss of federal recognition.That\u2019s because higher education is a complicated market. It\u2019s easy to spend $3 on a cup of coffee that suits your tastes. It\u2019s a lot harder to make smart choices when you can\u2019t experience the college you\u2019ve chosen until after you\u2019ve taken out expensive, nonrefundable loans. Even if you\u2019re not enticed by exotic dancers. In a higher education market that worked better, FastTrain and Corinthian wouldn\u2019t have existed. Yet they did.Considering the scale of what went wrong for many students enrolled in ACICS-accredited colleges, it\u2019s hard to see how to fix things without government action. If the government\u2019s committee does intervene, it will need to establish standards for what constitutes \u201cbad enough\u201d in college accreditation \u2014 and, thus, in colleges themselves.Many accreditors and colleges would probably prefer this didn\u2019t happen. But given the severity of the problem, the committee may have no choice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Hints He May Fund Race Himself", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byIn Las Vegas last week, Donald J. Trump\u2019s Nevada headquarters stood dark. A sign taped to the door declared that it had moved, with \u201cno forwarding information available.\u201dOn a weekday morning in New Hampshire, another battleground state in November, a single worker hovered in Mr. Trump\u2019s main office in Manchester.And at the hub of his national campaign in Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has cloistered himself with a tiny group of relatives and longtime business associates, relying on a staff of about six dozen people to win over an electorate of more than 120 million.Even as Mr. Trump dominates the campaign on cable news and social media, drawing large crowds with incendiary speeches about immigration and national security, his candidacy has faltered in the all-important test of political organization. Having swept through the primaries and caucuses with a skeletal campaign staff and a budget funded largely out of his bank account, he must compete against Hillary Clinton, his presumptive Democratic opponent, with only a shadow of the financial and political infrastructure she has amassed.In crucial states, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign offices have withered. He has not yet put out a single television ad in the general election. He has about as much money on hand for his campaign as the Manhattan district attorney and the New York City comptroller each disclosed having in their last reports.The situation has grown so dire for Mr. Trump that on Tuesday, he suggested that he might tap his personal fortune to keep the campaign afloat. He disclosed on Monday that his campaign finished May with little more than $1 million in the bank. Mrs. Clinton reported having about $42 million.In a defiant statement, Mr. Trump said that he was just getting started as a competitor against Mrs. Clinton, and that there had been a \u201ctremendous outpouring of support\u201d from donors since the beginning of June. But he has mused publicly in recent days about funding the race himself, and on Tuesday opened the door wider to that possibility.\u201cIf need be, there could be unlimited \u2018cash on hand\u2019 as I would put up my own money, as I have already done through the primaries, spending over $50 million,\u201d he said.Even the stark disparity in cash on hand may understate the desperate straits in which Mr. Trump finds himself. His fund-raising, led largely by the Republican National Committee, has slowed. He canceled a fund-raiser with 90 people in Boston last week, after the shooting in Orlando, Fla.; it has been rescheduled for June 29.What\u2019s next for a campaign with a big fund-raising gap.Mr. Trump is to be feted at two fund-raisers in Manhattan this week, organized by Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, with one event featuring Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. But the ticket price for that event is only $500, a paltry sum for a presidential campaign, and only 260 people have signed up, according to a person involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was not intended for the public.Charles Spies, a Republican election lawyer who advised the \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supported Jeb Bush, said Mr. Trump would have to put in an enormous amount of his own money to jump-start his campaign and win over big donors. He suggested an appropriate figure would be $100 million to $200 million.Mr. Spies said Mr. Trump should also forgive the loans he had made to his campaign, to reassure contributors that he would not use their money to repay himself. Mr. Trump has already raised eyebrows among party donors by spending freely to hold campaign events at properties he owns, and for the cost of flights on his private jet.\u201cFor donors to invest in his campaign, he\u2019s got to show that he\u2019s investing in it also,\u201d Mr. Spies said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to have $500 million to run a bare-bones campaign, and that would mean getting outspent by Hillary Clinton and her allies, between two and three to one.\u201dDwight Schar, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s grim predicament came as little surprise. Mr. Trump never courted party donors during the primary season and accused them of seeking to buy influence in government, boasting that as a wealthy man he would be immune to their entreaties.\u201cI think Mr. Trump has got all the money, so he doesn\u2019t need any financing,\u201d said Mr. Schar, who said he was undecided about whether to back Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. He added, \u201cI think my mother used to say, \u2018What you sow, you reap.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump has reported that his net worth is about $10 billion, though it is unclear how much is in cash, or could readily be converted to cash, that could be used for a presidential campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers spent much of Tuesday morning huddled at Trump Tower to discuss the way forward, including a speech he has planned for Wednesday attacking Mrs. Clinton. The address, advisers said, will be the first of several speeches Mr. Trump plans to give, with the goal of regaining traction in the race.Mr. Trump\u2019s knack for commanding news media attention, however, is no substitute for a campaign organization. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s staff is larger than Mr. Trump\u2019s by nearly tenfold, and her stable of advisers includes the polling and advertising firms that steered President Obama\u2019s campaigns.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, by contrast, rolled from state to state during the Republican primaries, building pop-up operations as needed, but left few resources behind that he could now draw upon in the general election.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.In New Hampshire, for example, Stephen Stepanek, a state lawmaker who helped steer Mr. Trump\u2019s primary campaign, said there was catching up to do in the state. He predicted there would be 30 or 40 paid staff members in New Hampshire by July.\u201cTrump ran a very tight campaign, and we\u2019re very well aware of that,\u201d Mr. Stepanek said. \u201cAfter we got through with the primary in New Hampshire, the entire staff moved on to the next primary state. They\u2019re all drifting back now.\u201dIn New York, Mr. Trump has kept a tight circle of advisers and leaned heavily on familiar faces, including his children; Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer; and Paul Manafort, a veteran Republican operative with business ties to Mr. Trump that date to the 1980s.He has only the thinnest of communications operations, relying on Hope Hicks, a former spokeswoman for his daughter Ivanka, to handle the avalanche of daily news media requests.And Mr. Trump has struggled to expand his operation, facing cold shoulders and arch skepticism from strategists with deep campaign experience. He has sought to hire a communications director, but has been rebuffed by at least two seasoned operatives who were concerned that working for Mr. Trump could harm their careers, according to Republicans briefed on the hiring efforts.He has recently recruited the pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, as well as a strategist, Kevin Kellems, to oversee the activities of his campaign surrogates.But he has also shed staff, and late last month dismissed a recently hired political director, Rick Wiley, whom he viewed as insufficiently tough in negotiations with the Republican National Committee.On Monday, Mr. Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, tearing another hole in the architecture of his campaign. Mr. Lewandowski was a close adviser to Mr. Trump, but was viewed with distrust by national party leaders, other Trump advisers and members of the Trump family.The Trump campaign is said to favor hiring a new campaign manager to play a more conventional role, focused on ensuring that basic functions of the organization work together smoothly.There was no one lined up for the job at the time of Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s dismissal.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Denies Reza Zarrab\u2019s Bail Request for Self-Financed House Arrest", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byA federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday rejected a request that a gold trader from Turkey be granted an unusual form of release pending trial that would have allowed him to sign a $50 million bond, secured by $10 million in cash, and to live in a kind of self-financed gilded cage.Judge Richard M. Berman, in denying bail to the trader, Reza Zarrab, said his proposal to live in a recently leased apartment under 24-hour armed guard and GPS monitoring, all at his own expense, \u201cis unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.\u201dJudge Berman said prosecutors had shown that Mr. Zarrab, 32, posed a risk of flight and that no conditions, \u201cincluding privately funded armed guards, will reasonably assure his appearance at trial.\u201dMr. Zarrab, who was born in Iran and moved to Turkey as an infant, was arrested in March during a trip to Florida with his wife and daughter, and sent to Manhattan to face charges that included conspiring to violate the United States sanctions on Iran. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutors in the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had objected vigorously, arguing that Mr. Zarrab\u2019s proposal was \u201can attempt to use his tremendous wealth to obscure the flight risk through a facade of security that is beyond the reach of all but a small subset of fabulously wealthy defendants.\u201dThe government has said that Mr. Zarrab had amassed \u201ca considerable fortune,\u201d which included ownership in about 20 properties, seven sea vessels, horses, luxury automobiles, a private airplane and more than $10 million worth of artwork.The case had fueled a continuing debate in the United States over the disparity in how rich and poor defendants are treated in the criminal justice system.Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court said that if he were to approve Mr. Zarrab's special bail conditions, it would have helped to \u201cfoster inequity and unequal treatment\" in favor of \"extremely wealthy\" defendants.Mr. Brafman said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by Judge Berman\u2019s decision, but are intent on continuing to vigorously defend Mr. Zarrab, who we believe to be innocent. We are also carefully reviewing the court\u2019s decision on bail to see if an appeal is appropriate.\u201dMr. Bharara\u2019s office had no comment.Mr. Zarrab is being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal detention facility in Lower Manhattan. His case has been watched closely in Turkey, where three years ago Mr. Zarrab was detained by the Turkish authorities as part of a wide-ranging corruption investigation of businessmen with ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was then the country\u2019s prime minister and is now its president.Judge Berman said that while he was not reaching any conclusion about Mr. Zarrab\u2019s guilt or innocence, \u201cthe evidence against the defendant appears strong\u201d for the purpose of setting bail.\u201cThe court concludes that undermining U.S. sanctions against Iran may well pose a threat to the United States,\u201d the judge added, \u201cand that Mr. Zarrab\u2019s release may exacerbate that threat by, for example, enabling him to communicate with business associates or others at or from his New York City apartment.\u201dThe judge said that in deciding the bail issue, he found \u201cmost persuasive\u201d Mr. Zarrab\u2019s \u201clack of ties to the United States, his significant wealth and his substantial resources, his extensive international travel and his strong ties to foreign countries, including countries without extradition.\u201dSuch factors, the judge wrote, provided him \u201cwith the incentive and the wherewithal to flee and render him a flight risk.\u201dThe judge also noted that the use of private security raised \u201cserious issues of liability surrounding the use of force\u201d to restrain Mr. Zarrab, if he were to try to flee.Quoting a judge in another such case, Judge Berman wrote, \u201cWhat more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the defendant\u2019s appearance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Text of Statement by George Osborne, Chancellor of Exchequer, on \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byToday I want to reassure the British people, and the global community, that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength.That is because in the last six years the government and the British people have worked hard to rebuild the British economy.We have worked systematically through a plan that today means Britain has the strongest major advanced economy in the world.Growth has been robust.The employment rate is at a record high.The capital requirements for banks are 10 times what they were.And the budget deficit has been brought down from 11 percent of national income, and was forecast to be below 3 percent this year.I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held.Thank goodness we did.As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.That challenge is clear.On Thursday, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.That is not the outcome that I wanted or that I threw everything into campaigning for.But Parliament agreed that there are issues of such constitutional significance that they cannot solely be left to politicians and must be determined by the people in a referendum.Now the people have spoken and we, in this democracy, must all accept that result and deliver on their instructions.I don\u2019t resile from any of the concerns I expressed during the campaign, but I fully accept the result of the referendum and will do everything I can to make it work for Britain.It is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.In the analysis that the Treasury and other independent organizations produced, three particular challenges were identified \u2014 and I want to say how we meet all three.First, there is the volatility we have seen and are likely to continue to see in financial markets.Those markets may not have been expecting the referendum result \u2014 but the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have spent the last few months putting in place robust contingency plans for the immediate financial aftermath in the event of this result.Swap lines were arranged in advance so the Bank of England is now able to lend in foreign currency if needed. As part of those plans, the bank and we agreed that there would be an immediate statement on Friday morning from the governor, Mark Carney.As Mark made clear, the Bank of England stands ready to provide 250 billion pounds of funds, through its normal facilities, to continue to support banks and the smooth functioning of markets.And we discussed our coordinated response with other major economies in calls on Friday with the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7.The governor and I have been in regular touch with each other over the weekend \u2014 and I can say this this morning: We have further well-thought-through contingency plans if they are needed.In the last 72 hours, I have been in contact with fellow European finance ministers, central bank governors, the managing director of the I.M.F., the U.S. Treasury secretary and the speaker of Congress, and the C.E.O.s of some of our major financial institutions so that collectively we keep a close eye on developments.It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.But let me be clear. You should not underestimate our resolve.We were prepared for the unexpected.We are equipped for whatever happens.And we are determined that, unlike eight years ago, Britain\u2019s financial system will help our country deal with any shocks and dampen them \u2014 not contribute to those shocks or make them worse.The second challenge our analysis identified in advance was the uncertainty that a vote to leave would bring in the coming months and beyond as Britain worked with its European allies to create a new relationship.The prime minister has given us time as a country to decide what that relationship should be by delaying the decision to trigger the Article 50 procedure until there is a new prime minister in place for the autumn.In the meantime, and during the negotiations that will follow, there will be no change to people\u2019s rights to travel and work, and to the way our goods and services are traded, or to the way our economy and financial system is regulated.However, it is already evident that as a result of Thursday\u2019s decision, some firms are continuing to pause their decisions to invest, or to hire people.As I said before the referendum, this will have an impact on the economy and the public finances \u2014 and there will need to be action to address that.But no one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country. To all companies large and small, I would say this: The British economy is fundamentally strong, we are highly competitive and we are open for business.The third and final challenge I spoke of was that of ensuring that Britain was able to agree a long-term economic relationship with the rest of Europe that provided for the best possible terms of trade in goods and services.Together, my colleagues in the government, the Conservative Party and in Parliament will have to determine what those terms should be \u2014 and we\u2019ll have to negotiate with our European friends to agree them.I intend to play an active part in that debate \u2014 for I want this great trading nation of ours to put in place the strongest possible economic links with our European neighbors, with our close friends in North America and the Commonwealth, and our important partners like China and India.I do not want Britain to turn its back on Europe or the rest of the world.We must bring unity of spirit and purpose, and condemn hatred and division wherever we see it.Britain is an open and tolerant country, and I will fight with everything I have to keep it so.Today I am completely focused on the task in hand as chancellor of the Exchequer to bring stability and reassurance.In conclusion, the British people have given us their instructions.There is much to do to make it work.We start from a position of hard-won strength.And whatever the undoubted challenges, my colleagues and I are determined to do the best for Britain.Advertisement"}

Even if there were, doing that would transform an open society into one in which government monitoring is pervasive.So what can be done? One response lies in rigorous investigations and law enforcement, which have led to arrests as plots are developed and put in motion. This month, for example, three young Somali-American men from Minneapolis, a center for extremist recruitment in this country, were found guilty in federal court of trying to travel to Syria in 2014 to join the Islamic State. They could face life sentences. In all, federal prosecutors have publicly charged 20 people in Minnesota in connection with the Shabab, an African terrorist group; 10 others have been charged with supporting the Islamic State.But such arrests happen late in the process, after individuals become radicalized or succumb to the message of terrorist groups. The challenge is to try to identify those who are vulnerable to extremist ideologies and develop programs and strategies that could turn them toward a better path.The Obama administration has begun to take some important steps, including revamping the State Department\u2019s effort to counter the Islamic State\u2019s very successful messaging on social media, which drew thousands of mostly European youths to the battlefield. The plan is to put more money into the program, train more staff members and more precisely tailor messages to specific populations.In 2014, as the terrorist threat evolved from Al Qaeda\u2019s large-scale attacks to a more diffuse network looking for soft targets, the administration began reaching out to local communities that were already trying to confront the problem of young people attracted to violent extremism. Minneapolis, Boston and Los Angeles were chosen by the Justice Department for pilot programs that worked with local civic groups and leaders.Minneapolis has been a particularly difficult challenge: It has the country\u2019s largest Somali immigrant population, and more of its young people have left to fight with extremist groups than any other city\u2019s. Federal, local and corporate money has financed initiatives there, including mentoring programs for Somali youths with access to employment resources. A soccer league and a special nonprofit organization were established to forge connections among community-based groups, schools and public agencies. And imams are being urged by federal prosecutors to leave their mosques and engage young people in less formal venues.One complication to carrying out these strategies is the Justice Department\u2019s central role, which has raised suspicions about whether such efforts are aimed more at gathering intelligence than at providing real assistance. Experts say that is why community leaders must be at the forefront of all such initiatives.Identifying youths at risk for self-radicalization and turning them away from terrorist recruitment won\u2019t be easy, quick or cheap, but the country has to make this a priority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Noah\u2019s Ark in Kentucky, Dinosaurs Included", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAnd Mr. Ham said, let us build a gargantuan Noah\u2019s ark only 45 minutes away to draw millions more visitors. And let it be constructed by Amish woodworkers, and financed with donations, junk bonds and tax rebates from the state of Kentucky. And let it hold an animatronic Noah and lifelike models of some of the creatures that came on board two-by-two, such as bears, short-necked giraffes \u2014 and juvenile Tyrannosaurus rexes.And it was so.Mr. Ham\u2019s \u201cArk Encounter,\u201d built at a cost of more than $102 million, is scheduled to open on July 7 in Williamstown, Ky. Mr. Ham and his crew have succeeded in erecting a colossal landmark and an ambitious promotional vehicle for their particular brand of Christian fundamentalism, known as \u201cyoung earth\u201d or \u201cyoung universe\u201d creationism.But it was hardly smooth sailing. The state tried to revoke the tax rebates after learning that Mr. Ham would require employees to sign a \u201cstatement of faith\u201d that would exclude people who were gay or did not accept his particular Christian creed. Mr. Ham went to court and in January, he won.On a recent afternoon, the Australian-born Mr. Ham looked out on the workers in hard hats affixing pine planking to cover the Tyvek plastic wrap still visible on the stern. The ark stretches one-and-a-half football fields long, rises as high as a seven-story building and is said to be the largest timber-frame building in the world. Mr. Ham is betting it will become an international pilgrimage site, as well as a draw for the curious, the seculars and even the skeptics.\u201cThe reason we are building the ark is not as an entertainment center,\u201d Mr. Ham said in an interview in a cabin overlooking the construction site. \u201cI mean it\u2019s not like a Disney or Universal, just for anyone to go and have fun. It\u2019s a religious purpose. It\u2019s because we\u2019re Christians and we want to get the Christian message out.\u201dThe ark is also intended to serve as a vivid warning that, according to the Bible, God sent a flood in Noah\u2019s time to wipe out a depraved people, and God will deliver a fiery end to those who reject the Bible and accept modern-day evils like abortion, atheism and same-sex marriage. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming more like the days of Noah in that we see increasing secularization in the culture,\u201d Mr. Ham said.Young earth creationism gained currency only about 60 years ago, and has remained a marginal creed within Christianity. Even many Bible-believers and evangelicals accept the science showing that the universe is billions of years old \u2014 some reasoning that each of the six \u201cdays\u201d of creation in the Book of Genesis may have lasted millions of years, not 24 hours. And of course, many Christians accept evolution.Inside a cavernous warehouse in an office park in Hebron, a few miles from the museum, about 50 artists, designers, carpenters, sculptors and volunteers have been working six-day weeks to prepare the exhibits for the ark.A sculptor inserted stiff gray-brown hairs one at a time into the chin of what looked like a wild boar. Another wiped off the black dye on a bear\u2019s chest to make it look less like a contemporary black bear. A giraffe with a short neck was being baked in a large oven to set the dye on its fur.Tim Chaffey, a content manager and writer for the Answers in Genesis ministry, explained that most of the models do not resemble animals the way they look today, but extinct species. According to young earth creationists, the ark carried up to 1,400 kinds of creatures that gradually evolved into the animals we know today. Young earthers accept the notion that nature makes small adaptations over time \u2014 but do not accept that humans and chimpanzees descended from a common ancestor.The ark designers had to scale back their initial ambition to have live animals living on board to demonstrate the truth of the Noah story, said Mr. Chaffey, a graduate of Liberty University, a Christian college in Virginia founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.And there will be only about 30 pairs of stuffed animals on the Ark Encounter because there just isn\u2019t enough space. \u201cWe have to have dozens and dozens of bathrooms for visitors. Noah didn\u2019t have to have that,\u201d Mr. Chaffey said.Drawings of Noah and his seven family members hung on a wall. Their skin is \u201cmiddle brown\u201d and their faces are a blend of racial features because, as the only survivors of the biblical flood, all the races and ethnicities on earth would have descended from these eight people, Mr. Chaffey said. But in some of the displays in the warehouse, there were indications of the ministry\u2019s dark vision of humanity. An artist, Stephanie Fazekas, stood at a computer drawing figurines of women in togas. They were prostitutes for a diorama portraying the morally decadent society that the Bible says was wiped out in a flood.\u201cHe calls on Christians to participate in a culture war,\u201d Mr. Trollinger said, of Mr. Ham. \u201cHe says, if you\u2019re really going to be a Christian, you\u2019re in this war against the atheistic, humanistic enemy.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Ham railed against atheist groups for trying to prevent his project from receiving tax incentives from the state of Kentucky. Answers in Genesis claimed that the state\u2019s denial of those tax credits violated the group\u2019s First Amendment rights. Judge Greg Van Tatenhove of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky agreed, writing in his January decision that tourist attractions \u2014 even those that advance religion \u2014 meet the neutral criteria for the tax incentives.The ark is now in calmer waters. The workers, standing on hydraulic lifts, have covered over the Tyvek, and just in time. The Tyvek was printed all over with the slogan of its maker, Dupont: \u201cThe Miracles of Science.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb Vows to Fight Racism, but Its Users Can\u2019t Sue to Prompt Fairness", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Brian Chesky, chief executive of Airbnb, made a vow this month to root out bigotry from his business.But even as Mr. Chesky promised to stamp out racism from Airbnb, the company\u2019s class-action litigation policy makes it tough \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for customers to push the start-up to make any substantive changes on the issue. Airbnb requires that people agree to waive their right to sue, or to join in any class-action lawsuit or class-action arbitration, to use the service.The waiver clause can be broadly applied to many issues, not just accusations of discrimination. But class-action lawsuits have been particularly effective legal tools to press companies on their discrimination policies over the years, civil rights lawyers said, which would give Airbnb more cause to wield it as it grapples with the issue. In the past, such suits against Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Coca-Cola pushed those companies to change hiring and workplace practices.\u201cClass-action cases have been the only effective way to prove and remedy systemic discrimination because you can\u2019t prove a pattern of behavior with individually filed cases,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of New York Law School\u2019s Center for Justice and Democracy, who specializes in civil justice issues.The waiver clause and Airbnb\u2019s more prominent placement of it allows it to shield itself now from outside pressure around the discrimination issue and to handle the matter at its own pace and on its own terms.\u201cAirbnb can say it doesn\u2019t condone racism and even has an anti-discrimination policy, but right now that policy doesn\u2019t have teeth if the company is legally insulated from having to comply with the same anti-discrimination laws that real estate brokers must comply with,\u201d said Jamila Jefferson-Jones, an associate professor of law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City.A spokesman for Airbnb said that the company was open about its dispute resolution policies, including the waiver clause, and that \u201cthese provisions are common and we believe ours is balanced and protects consumers.\u201dAirbnb this month also hired Laura Murphy, the former head of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington legislative office, as an outside adviser to look at the issue. Ms. Murphy said Airbnb was examining its internal structures and technology, and its processes for identifying and handling discrimination incidents, and building relationships with organizations like fair housing, human rights and travel groups.Airbnb aims to have announcements in the next 10 days about preliminary actions it is taking on discrimination, and it plans to have a full report with proposed remedies in September, she said. Eventually, the company wants to have a division to handle and resolve discrimination complaints, Ms. Murphy added.\u201cLitigation is always an option, but we think it\u2019s better to take the time and effort to resolve problems if we can,\u201d she said in an interview.\u201cAirbnb is willing and eager to use the class-action waiver and arbitration clause,\u201d said Jeffrey Norton, the lawyer who filed that suit in February.Airbnb may soon test the waiver clause directly in a class-action discrimination suit, which was filed in May in the United States District Court in Washington. The chief plaintiff, Gregory Selden, who is African-American, claimed Airbnb violated civil rights laws that forbid housing discrimination when a host on the service denied him accommodation last year because of his race. Airbnb\u2019s response to the lawsuit is due by July 13.Ikechukwu Emejuru, the lawyer representing Mr. Selden, said, \u201cThe sharing economy has grown exponentially, and Mr. Selden\u2019s experiences of not being accommodated by Airbnb because of his race put in motion this country\u2019s most iconic civil rights laws.\u201d He declined to comment further and said Mr. Selden was unavailable to comment.Airbnb\u2019s expansion depends partly on whether people of different nationalities and ethnicities feel welcomed to the platform in the same nondiscriminatory way that they are welcomed at international hotel chains. Two rival room-sharing services, Innclusive and Noirbnb, are now marketing themselves as services that provide inclusive and safe short-term rentals for people of any race or ethnicity.Ms. Murphy, the Airbnb adviser, said the company recognized that eliminating discrimination was in its best interests. She said Airbnb\u2019s relative youth \u2014 the company was founded in 2008 \u2014 meant it could deal with the issue in a more agile way than companies with entrenched cultures that may have needed the pressure of litigation to do the right thing.\u201cAirbnb is part of a new area of commerce, and the conditions for transactions are still developing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get it right.\u201dAn article on Monday about allegations of conflict between Airbnb\u2019s vow to eliminate bias in bookings and its policy of barring class actions by customers misidentified, in some editions, the university at which Jamila Jefferson-Jones, a law professor who commented on the issue, teaches.

{"Headline": "After Brexit Vote, a Choice for Europe: Move Forward, or Fall Back", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIs \u201cEurope\u201d finished?But even if the pro-European Remain cause pulls out a victory, the popular hostility against the decades-long process of European integration \u2014 evident not only in Britain but across the Continent \u2014 underscores a defining weakness. Europe itself lacks a firm democratic foundation.Europe\u2019s leaders face a clear-cut choice: For their integration agenda to succeed \u2014 preserving the free movement of people within the bloc, forging ahead with the euro and the single market, keeping doors open to outsiders \u2014 the E.U. must figure out how to overcome the narrow national interests and mistrust that tie it up in knots every time a collective response is needed.That will require democracy on a European scale. If Europe\u2019s national governments remain unwilling to cede political power to regional institutions that have democratic legitimacy, the European Union will slide backward.\u201cWe need pan-E.U. politics,\u201d argued Mary Kaldor, professor of global governance at the London School of Economics. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we get there.\u201dBritish citizens will vote on whether their country should remain a member of the European Union. While a vote to leave would give Britain more autonomy, it could also create great economic uncertainty.\u201cPopular discontent with globalization in its many forms has been building up in the West for many years now,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Rourke, an economic historian at the University of Oxford. \u201cWe are seeing its effects everywhere.\u201dStill, the European Union\u2019s hapless response to its current social and economic challenges has made it an easy target. With no real European institutions of democratic accountability \u2014 the European Parliament serves little more than a decorative function \u2014 the only way voters can express their dissatisfaction is by pushing to leave and by supporting extremist political movements.\u201cIn many countries the perception is that national governments are powerless and that there is nothing at the European level to address problems,\u201d said Paul De Grauwe, a former Belgian member of Parliament now at the London School of Economics. \u201cBoth Europe and national governments lose legitimacy.\u201dWhat could the E.U. have done better? Things would be a lot easier if most of Europe were growing at more than a snail\u2019s pace. The inability of countries in the euro area \u2014 which does not include Britain \u2014 to stop the slow-motion implosion of Greece and other deeply indebted countries gives integration a bad name. The two are related.Germany\u2019s resistance to share in the costs of a collective solution to seriously write down the debts that Greece and other Southern European nations will never be able to pay off \u2014 insisting instead that the indebted countries and their beleaguered citizens bear nearly all the cost \u2014 has prolonged and deepened Europe\u2019s stagnation.\u201cBritons contemplate the crisis of the euro as a little bit of proof that they were right not to join,\u201d said Giancarlo Corsetti, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge.Immigration, however, can easily be deployed as an argument to leave the rest of Europe. More than half the 333,000 immigrants who arrived in Britain last year were E.U. citizens, free to be there as a matter of right under European law.\u201cThe Leave campaign made an argument that the only way to reduce this part of immigration is to leave the E.U.,\u201d noted Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an expert on immigration at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cAnd they struck a chord with the electorate.\u201dDealing with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war will never be easy. But Europe\u2019s reaction was notoriously unproductive. The E.U.\u2019s institutions again appeared irrelevant, as governments retrenched into their corners and failed to devise a collective, burden-sharing approach.How much integration do Europeans need? Dani Rodrik at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government notes that the E.U.\u2019s initial major goal \u2014 preventing France and Germany from drawing the world into another war \u2014 has been achieved. It also served as a democratic, capitalistic anchor for Eastern European countries to hang onto after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut today Europe\u2019s integration effort has lost sight of its political and social dimensions, he argues, narrowing into a raw effort to reduce market barriers. That\u2019s not enough to inspire popular support.There might be areas where collective action at the European level could make a difference \u2014 as a counterweight to colossal multinational companies that can challenge the authority of individual nations, or to prevent capital from effortlessly zipping across borders in an effort to avoid taxes. Indeed, the E.U. has taken a leading role confronting the world\u2019s most daunting collective action problem: climate change.The critical question is whether Europe will be able to achieve the kind of integrated decision-making needed to address these challenges. So far, it hasn\u2019t shown it can rise to the occasion. \u201cThere is not much appetite for further political integration,\u201d Mr. Corsetti said. Solutions to Europe\u2019s challenges must navigate around this constraint.The free movement of people inside the E.U. might be the first to go into reverse. \u201cRestricting the free movement of labor is not a taboo,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard told me. \u201cAnother way freedom of movement will be restricted is you will see more and more restrictions placed on the ability of citizens from other E.U. countries to claim welfare benefits.\u201dMaybe the European Union\u2019s future is more \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d \u2014 a set of coalitions of the willing, as it were. Rather than insisting on all or nothing, said Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations in New York, it might be better to consider \u201ca Europe that is not one size fits all, where the balance between national governments and Brussels is more flexible.\u201dThis may come as a disappointment to Europe\u2019s current leaders. But one way or another, the project\u2019s governance must come into line with what its people want. That\u2019s called democracy.\u201cEurope must either roll back the economic integration or roll ahead the political integration,\u201d Mr. Haass said, \u201cso people feel they have a say over the politicians who are driving changes that affect their lives.\u201dThe Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about challenges facing the European Union whether or not Britain elects to withdraw, gave an outdated academic affiliation in some copies for Kevin O\u2019Rourke, who commented on the issue.

{"Headline": "Law School a Solid Investment, Despite Pay Discrepancies", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorInstead, let\u2019s just accept that this is a world of haves and have-nots. Top law graduates are doing better than ever, while other law students have a steeper path to climb to earn that type of money.The latest round of salary raises began in early June, when the prestigious law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore bumped first-year associate pay to $180,000 from $160,000. This move had been rumored, and because Cravath has taken the lead in pushing up salaries for decades, it did not want to miss out.In the world of associates and salaries, big law firms are like lemmings. The top 50 or so all quickly moved to match Cravath, even raising the salaries for the summer associates who arrived from law schools the week the increases were announced.It is a time for celebration among the twenty-somethings who are benefiting from this extra cash. But it also highlights the dichotomy between those at the top and everyone else. The top graduates earn a median salary that will now start at $180,000, but that represented only about 17 percent of the reported salaries in 2014, according to data from the National Association for Law Placement.Cravath knew when it raised salaries that other law firms would quickly match it to avoid being viewed as less prestigious and to remain competitive. Big law firms are experiencing a talent drain to in-house corporate jobs, finance and venture capital, where the salaries or lifestyles are more attractive. The salaries and opportunities for top associates remain robust (we\u2019ll leave for another day the question of whether these jobs are worth the long hours and quality-of-life sacrifices).The rush by other law firms to meet Cravath\u2019s salary increase also reflects the winner-take-all society. Look at the salaries of more senior associates. Eighth-year lawyers at Cravath also got raises and will now be paid $315,000 a year. With bonuses that now average about $100,000, the average senior associate at a big firm is less than 35 years old and earning more than $400,000.I graduated from law school in 1995 with a starting salary at a big law firm of $81,500 and no bonus. Salaries with bonuses are now more than 50 percent higher, adjusting for inflation, but eighth-year salaries have grown even more, most likely outstripping the growth in law school tuition at most schools.For the lucky few who get jobs at these big firms, law school is a good investment. These young lawyers can earn more than $40,000 in one summer while they are still in law school and pay back their loans quickly. Many find that there are private firms willing to refinance their loans at rock-bottom interest rates (again, whether they are happy or not at these firms is another question).But let\u2019s be clear. Only the lucky 17 percent of graduates earn salaries this high. To be in this group, you needed to go to a top 10 school or graduate in the higher ranks of the top quartile of law schools.Things are harder for every other law graduate. Law firm starting salaries are bimodal \u2014 meaning that while 17 percent of graduates earned a median salary of $160,000 in 2014, about half had a median starting salary of $40,000 to $65,000.It is the fate of these graduates that drives the criticism of law school as a \u201cscam.\u201d They dream of big jobs but are often the lawyers who become solo practitioners, district attorneys, public defenders and other lower-paying jobs outside the big firms.The employment market has softened even for the big jobs, but for new lawyers on the lower end of the starting scale, it is worse. In 2014, graduates faced a 86.7 percent employment rate, according to the National Association for Law Placement.Either way, it is clear that it is harder out there for the lower-tier law schools and their graduates.Indeed, it is easy to visit a regional law school in the fourth tier of the U.S. News & World Report rankings and find a graduate who has not found a job or is struggling. This is often extrapolated into an argument that law schools are about to close wholesale (so far, not one has closed) or that law school is not worth it for 90 percent of those who attend and cannot be guaranteed a job at a big law firm. One pundit goes so far as to criticize anyone who goes to law school outside the top five or six schools.The fact that lawyers do reasonably well over time and better than they would have done had they not gone to law school is reflected in the low default rates on law school loans.To be sure, law school is not for everyone. People should be careful about the debt they take on. There are choices in law schools, and yes, there will sometimes be bad outcomes.But the question people should be asking is whether they are going to a school with a high-performance outcome. After that, they should look at the school\u2019s graduates and what they have done with their legal careers. Then they can choose which outcome suits them best. But let\u2019s not lump everything together. And let\u2019s recognize that for most, the data still shows that over the long term, law school can be a fruitful choice.Advertisement"}

American teenagers attempt suicide more often than youths in most other countries, and they are among the world leaders in violence, binge drinking, marijuana use, obesity and unhappiness, according to a Temple University professor, Laurence Steinberg.A survey of more than 123,000 students at 153 colleges by the American College Health Association in 2013 found that more than half experienced overwhelming anxiety and about a third felt deep depression during the academic year.How can they learn and thrive if they do not have the skills to handle their emotions or feel safe and supported enough to talk about them?This is, or should be, worrisome to educators and policy makers, not only because of the suffering that results but also because a large and growing body of research demonstrates that the way people manage their emotions \u2014 that is, their emotional intelligence \u2014 matters for personal growth and to the success of the broader society and economy.Emotions drive learning, decision-making, creativity, relationships and health. Mastering the skills of emotional intelligence paves the way for greater well-being, better relationships and overall effectiveness \u2014 for college students, for students from kindergarten through high school and for the adults who surround them, including educators and parents. The Nobel laureate James J. Heckman has written that teaching \u201cnoncognitive\u201d skills, including recognizing and regulating emotions, would be a cost-effective way to increase work force productivity and quality.Teaching emotional intelligence \u2014 or what\u2019s more broadly referred to as social and emotional learning \u2014 to children and adults has proven effective\u2014-and sorely needed.Given that, it\u2019s frustrating that policies to mandate and finance evidence-based approaches to social and emotional learning are slow to come. A few states, including Illinois and Alaska, have acted on their own. Leaders in Washington and across the nation need to listen to youth and work to change education to equip America\u2019s youth to be competitive for the global century well under way. Our future \u2014 and our children\u2019s future \u2014 depend on it.Marc Brackett is the director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and a professor in the Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Carnegie Hall, a New Leader With a Son Named Hendrix", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byHe owns one of Elton John\u2019s old pianos. He hired John Legend and Seal \u2014 and a youth orchestra \u2014 to perform at his wedding last summer on the Amalfi Coast. His youngest sons, Hendrix and Legend, are named after Jimi Hendrix and Mr. Legend. And he bought and refurbished a retreat in the Rocky Mountains that was beloved by jazz musicians, including Duke Ellington.\u201cCarnegie Hall is perfectly placed to champion not only artistic excellence, but also access and exposure to the best music in the world,\u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement.The election of Mr. Smith, 53, who played an old upright piano while growing up in Denver and was told that with enough practice he might make it to Carnegie one day, brings to an end a low moment at the hall. The billionaire Ronald O. Perelman served as its chairman for less than a year before stepping down last fall after he alienated the board by clashing with the hall\u2019s executive and artistic director, Clive Gillinson.Unlike Carnegie\u2019s most recent chairmen, Mr. Perelman and Sanford I. Weill, the former Citigroup chairman, Mr. Smith does not come from the world of New York finance, and he has not been a major fixture on the city\u2019s social scene \u2014 he is more known for flying in to attend events in the city and then flying out. But his work outside the city with investors and tech firms could provide entree to new potential donors in the coming years.Mr. Smith said his newfound willingness to exert his influence came from a sense of obligation to help those less fortunate.\u201cWhen I look at the folks that inspired me growing up, people like Frederick Douglass, they had to stand up and take positions in public in order to make a difference,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPart of the responsibility I have, because of the opportunities I\u2019ve been granted, is to take leadership positions and help expand access for others.\u201dHis path to Carnegie began at Petrossian, the restaurant a block north of the hall, where he had lunch a few years ago with Mr. Gillinson. A mutual friend introduced them, since Mr. Smith was interested in music education, a major focus for Carnegie. Mr. Smith joined the board in 2013. Since then he has donated money to expand Carnegie\u2019s Link Up program, which develops music curriculums for more than 90 orchestras around the country, and become a founding patron of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America, created by Carnegie\u2019s Weill Music Institute. He also had an idea for a new program.\u201cHis suggestion was that we should also be reaching out to kids in the areas where we\u2019re supporting the orchestras, offering lessons to kids who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to have lessons, and instruments if they need them as well,\u201d Mr. Gillinson said in an interview. \u201cWe added that dimension.\u201dLast month, Mr. Smith attended an all-star gala concert commemorating Carnegie\u2019s 125th anniversary and got a round of applause at the dinner afterward at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel when Mercedes T. Bass, who served as acting chairwoman after Mr. Perelman\u2019s departure, acknowledged him from the stage. \u201cOne person I\u2019d particularly like to point out is our board member, Robert Smith, who gave us a million-dollar check,\u201d she said.Joshua Nash, the chairman of the board\u2019s succession committee, said in a statement that his group unanimously recommended Mr. Smith.Until recently, Mr. Smith was little known outside the sleepy world of enterprise software. But in the years since the financial crisis, his firm, Vista, has outperformed titans of the industry such as K.K.R. and T.P.G.Growing up in Denver, Mr. Smith was exposed to music from an early age. His father attended the University of Denver on a band scholarship, playing percussion and piano, and Mr. Smith learned to play the piano from both his father and grandmother. By age 7, he was practicing conducting while listing to the radio, and soon became a fan of the pianist Andr\u00e9 Watts.His family vacationed at Lincoln Hills, a retreat in the Rockies that was popular with jazz musicians, including Count Basie. Mr. Smith later bought it, and now uses it to host underprivileged schoolchildren and musicians including Maceo Parker and Angie Stone. He counts Prince and Michael Jackson among his favorite pop artists, but also has a passion for classical music, especially Brahms and Debussy.His Fund II Foundation donates money to a variety of causes, including preserving African-American history and culture, human rights, the environment, sustaining American values and music education. Mr. Smith is also the chairman of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights, serves on the board of overseers of Columbia Business School, is a member of the Cornell Engineering College Council, and is a trustee of the Boys and Girls Clubs of San Francisco.He has supported musical groups including the Sphinx Organization, which promotes diversity in classical music; helped bring the Yehudi Menuhin International Violin Competition to the United States; and supports Ensemble ACJW, a collaboration between Carnegie Hall, the Juilliard School, the Weill Music Institute and the New York City Education Department.Mr. Smith\u2019s other charitable efforts reflect his commitment to preserving black history. When he was an infant, his mother carried him at the March on Washington, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Seven years later, his uncle was the victim of a racially motivated killing.In recent years, Mr. Smith has made substantial gifts to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is set to open in September; donated millions to restore African-American monuments in national parks; and supported the Louis Armstrong House Museum in New York.What awaits him at the Carnegie board, however, could test not only his managerial skills, but also his diplomacy and fund-raising prowess. When Mr. Perelman abruptly stepped down last year, hopes of landing a multimillion-dollar donation from him quickly evaporated as the hall worked to raise money for its education efforts. Now it must press forward with that, while continuing to grapple with questions of how to make classical music relevant and accessible, and over what the proper musical mix of its presentations should be.But Mr. Smith is known as a problem-solver. After talking himself into an internship at Bell Labs for college students when he was still in high school, he was once charged with diagnosing a faulty semiconductor. He was in over his head, but the experience, he recounted last year, helped shape his worldview.\u201cI learned not to fear complex problems,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to embrace them.\u201dAn article on Friday about the naming of Robert F. Smith as chairman of Carnegie Hall referred incorrectly to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, to which he has made substantial gifts. It is to open in September; it has not \u201crecently opened.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gawker, Filing for Bankruptcy After Hulk Hogan Suit, Is for Sale", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byGawker Media, the irreverent company that pioneered the wry tone and take-no-prisoners approach that came to embody a certain style of web journalism, put itself up for sale on Friday in an acknowledgment that its future as an independent news organization was in doubt.Gawker said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would conduct a sale through an auction. The company is under significant financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan and facing a determined foe in the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who is funding legal cases against it.Ziff Davis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid, which a person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans said was in the range of $90 million to $100 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sale process. Gawker expects a sale to close by the end of the summer.But even as Gawker took stock of its next steps, it remained, in typical fashion, defiant.Since its founding in 2002, Gawker has espoused a conversational tone that came to be mimicked across the internet and on social platforms like Twitter. Gawker and its affiliated sites \u2014 including the sports-focused Deadspin and Jezebel, which is aimed at women \u2014 have relentlessly and gleefully chronicled the lives of the powerful, and often delivered attention-grabbing, exclusive stories, some of them too over-the-edge for other publications. The company was also an incubator of talent: Employees went on to found websites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time.Gawker also had many detractors, who said it often went too far and published items with little news value that aimed to embarrass individuals. But over the last year Gawker.com has been going through something of a cultural transformation. Mr. Denton has vowed to make the site nicer and Gawker has shifted to politics and away from coverage of the New York media world and celebrity gossip.\u201cIt really was an incredibly bad year,\u201d said Hamilton Nolan, a writer who has worked at Gawker for eight years. \u201cI think they\u2019ll study this in journalism schools one day as being the single worst year in media company history.\u201dIn Gawker\u2019s new offices in Manhattan on Friday, the mood was somber. Around noon, Mr. Denton and Heather Dietrick, the company\u2019s president and general counsel, held a meeting to inform employees of the company\u2019s plans and provide reassurance that Gawker would operate as usual during the sale process.\u201cThey emphasized that the future is uncertain, but for now we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do, and that was useful for people to hear,\u201d said Alex Pareene, the editor in chief of Gawker.Employees said that few people had known before the meeting of the company\u2019s decision to file for bankruptcy. A keg of beer was brought in and pizzas were ordered.\u201cIt was not a raucous or even particularly depressing affair,\u201d Mr. Pareene said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more depressing meetings and we\u2019ve had more argumentative meetings.\u201dGawker\u2019s sites published posts assuring readers they were not going anywhere.Filing for Chapter 11 stays claims from creditors, including court judgments \u2014 meaning Gawker will not need to begin paying the $140 million that was awarded in March to Mr. Bollea.It also allows companies more time and more control as they reorganize themselves. In its bankruptcy filing, Gawker listed $50 million to $100 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. The company still plans to appeal the case.Also on Friday, a judge in Pinellas County Circuit Court in Florida granted Gawker\u2019s request for a stay of the judgment against it in the lawsuit, pending an appeal. That decision essentially became redundant once Gawker filed for bankruptcy.\u201cIt\u2019s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,\u201d Mr. Thiel said of his supporting Gawker\u2019s legal opponents. \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not return a request for comment on Friday. Gawker is also exploring at least one lawsuit against Mr. Thiel, according to the person briefed on Gawker\u2019s plans.The offer by Ziff Davis, whose online properties include IGN, Geek.com and AskMen.com, is what is known as a \u201cstalking-horse bid,\u201d essentially setting a floor in a court-supervised auction. Money from a sale would be held aside to cover creditor claims, including any damages after the appeals process.In an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, Ziff Davis\u2019s chief executive, Vivek Shah, said that under the terms of a potential agreement, the company would acquire Gawker Media\u2019s properties but none of its liabilities. When discussing its plans for Gawker Media, he referred to the benefits of having all of the company\u2019s sites, but conspicuously omitted any mention of Gawker.com.He said the auction would most likely take place at the end of July. Other bidders, which will probably include other media publishers, are expected, particularly with the threat of assuming legal claims removed with the bankruptcy filing.In January, Gawker sold a minority stake in the company to the investment company Columbus Nova Technology Partners, partly in preparation for the lawsuit by Mr. Bollea.Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over Gawker.com\u2019s publication of a black-and-white tape that showed Mr. Bollea having sex with a woman who was at the time the wife of a friend of his.In March, after a two-week trial, a Florida jury awarded $115 million in damages to Mr. Bollea. A jury later awarded $25 million more in punitive damages, bringing the total to $140 million.On Friday, some Gawker employees remained hopeful that a new owner might mean a fresh start, but there was also perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that Gawker as everyone knew it could soon be a thing of the past.\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be the magical happy ending to the story,\u201d Mr. Nolan said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to be the worst ending to the story, but we\u2019re not just going to go back to everything being how it was.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced, Nick Wingfield, John Koblin, Nick Madigan and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote Has European Workers in Britain Unsure of Future", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Filipe Graca hovered over an espresso machine at the British food chain Pret A Manger and frothed out a cafe latte for a waiting customer. Until last year, he had struggled to find any kind of a job in his native Portugal. But when he arrived in London, he was able to work almost right away.So were the young women from Hungary, France and Albania who cheerfully tended the cash registers. And the staff from Poland, Spain and Italy cleaning tables and preparing sandwiches for the lunch crowd. Only one thing seemed to bother them: the prospect that Britain might actually leave the European Union.\u201cI don\u2019t think the U.K. will vote for a Brexit, but if they do, it would be bad,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was working to help finance his studies for a computer science degree.\u201cLook around,\u201d he added, gesturing to colleagues who hailed from 10 nations across Europe. \u201cEveryone here is from another country.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dStep into nearly any London restaurant, hotel or retail shop and chances are that most people serving your meal, checking you in or ringing up your sale are not British. Peer inside a construction site, and a hive of nationalities is busy building. Even the British farm vegetables on your plate were probably harvested by European immigrants.For decades, the hospitality, retail, food and construction industries in particular have taken advantage of the bloc\u2019s rules allowing freedom of movement, meaning Europeans like Mr. Graca can work legally in any of the 28 countries that are members. Non-Europeans must obtain work visas under immigration rules that require graduate-level skills and a minimum annual salary of 20,800 pounds.While European nationals working in Britain make up just 5 percent of the 31.5 million-strong work force, compared to 11 percent from overseas, they have become a visible flash point in the overall debate about whether and what type of immigration really works for Britain.British businesses have faced criticism for hiring them. Greencore, Britain\u2019s biggest sandwich maker, drew fire for seeking hundreds of Hungarian employees for a new sandwich factory in Northampton, an hour north of London. Pret A Manger, whose stores dot street corners across Britain, has been faulted for employing relatively few British workers. (A spokesman for Pret A Manger declined to comment.)But for many Europeans grateful to have a job, what is considered a low wage in the eyes of some British is better than what they would get back home. \u201cThere are no jobs in Portugal,\u201d said Mr. Graca, who was hoping to be promoted to barista, which pays \u00a39.20 an hour, more than Pret\u2019s base pay of \u00a38.50 and higher than the \u00a37.20 rate considered a living wage. \u201cI\u2019m here to work and earn money,\u201d he said.Any \u201cout\u201d vote would not force Europeans to leave Britain, at least not right away. For the next two years, the British government would negotiate new treaties with the European Union over labor movement and other matters.Still, with the referendum looming, thousands of workers across the city are bracing for a potentially murky future. Employers are grappling with uncertainty about whether they will be able to hire Europeans as easily as before.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what is going to be the status of those people going forward,\u201d said Keith Howells, the chief executive of Mott MacDonald, a major construction services firm with projects in Britain and worldwide. Around 20 percent of his workers in Britain are from elsewhere in the European Union.\u201cWill they be welcome or not? Will they be subject to quotas or won\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially hugely destabilizing.\u201dThat\u2019s especially true for London\u2019s restaurants, bars and hotels, since Europeans make up most employees.A British departure from the bloc \u201cwould impact the industry big time, and those who work here,\u201d said Filippo Castellana, an Italian who manages the French restaurant Le Garrick in Covent Garden. On a recent day, patrons were served steak frites and onion soup by staff members from Poland, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania and France.\u201cWe depend on European workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be insane for Britain to leave.\u201dAround the corner at Suvlaki, a Greek restaurant specializing in grilled meat skewers and stuffed pitas, the owner, Yannis Theodorakakos, was preparing to tally the impact if he needed to obtain work visas for the 13 European citizens working on his staff.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world,\u201d Mr. Theodorakakos said. A former banker, he expects that an independent Britain would start operating like Switzerland, whose relationship with the European Union is framed by bilateral treaties giving it greater control over immigration. \u201cBut if I had to use visas in the future to hire from the E.U., it would cost us money as employers,\u201d he said.That argument riles backers of the \u201cleave\u201d lobby, who argue that European citizens distort the labor market in part because they are able to come into Britain with virtually no checks and start looking for a job.Recently, Britain\u2019s popular curry houses aligned themselves with pro-Brexit campaigners, complaining that skilled chefs from places like Bangladesh must get expensive, time-consuming visas while Europeans with little restaurant expertise can work right away. A Brexit would even an unfair playing field, they say.But to those who claim their business could be crippled without European labor, such talk is a feeble diversion from the elephant in the room in the Brexit debate.\u201cThe fact is we\u2019re doing jobs that most British people don\u2019t want to do,\u201d said Anna Pawelec, the manager of Pillars of Hercules, a 150-year-old pub on Greek Street near Soho that has British owners but is run almost entirely by Poles.\u201cMost of them wouldn\u2019t get out of bed for the money we earn,\u201d added Ms. Pawelec, standing behind a row of beer taps as the song \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d blared from loudspeakers.\u201cForeign people work hard,\u201d she added. \u201cWe contribute hugely to this country. So everyone is thinking the same thing: Don\u2019t tell me to leave.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Life, Animated\u2019 Shares a Family\u2019s True Fairy Tale", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt was essential,\u201d said Mr. Williams, who acquired the documentary rights to the book from Mr. Suskind. \u201cMy whole concept for the film was about bringing Owen\u2019s inner world to life.\u201dThe company is known for being protective of its characters and image. It helped that Kingswell, an imprint of Disney, published Mr. Suskind\u2019s book, which includes extensive use of the company\u2019s lyrics and dialogue, as well as Owen\u2019s drawings of Disney characters.The book details how Owen, after being given a diagnosis of regressive autism at 3, lost the ability to hold intelligible conversations. But he slowly learned language and emotional dynamics by studying animated sidekicks in Disney movies. The Suskind family \u2014 Mr. Suskind; Owen\u2019s mother, Cornelia; and his older brother, Walt \u2014 would speak to him using dialogue from those movies, and he would respond in kind. In addition to Owen\u2019s artwork, the book includes his own Disney-inspired story, \u201cSidekicks,\u201d which features a young boy not unlike himself.Disney, which owned the rights to characters in the book and was thinking about making a film adaptation, considered different ways \u2014 including big-budget features \u2014 it might adapt the book into a scripted film, said Sean Bailey, the president for motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios. The company was comfortable allowing its characters in a nonfiction film by Mr. Williams.Mr. Williams, an Academy Award winner for the documentary short \u201cMusic by Prudence,\u201d and Mr. Bailey shared ties to the Sundance Institute. Mr. Bailey is a trustee of the organization, which has supported some of Mr. Williams\u2019s films, and the two met in Mr. Bailey\u2019s office in the spring of 2014.After a follow-up presentation by Mr. Williams and his producer, Julie Goldman, to Mr. Bailey and several department heads, Disney agreed to take a hands-off approach to the project and the use of its characters. This agreement required \u201ca little bit of a leap of faith,\u201d Mr. Bailey admitted, especially considering Mr. Williams\u2019s vision for the film was still \u201cpercolating,\u201d as he put it.A deal to have Mr. Williams make his movie with A&E Indie Films was finalized in the spring of 2014. (Although A&E Indie Films, which is partly owned by Disney, financed \u201cLife, Animated,\u201d that connection was never a factor in Disney\u2019s decision to share its characters, according to Mr. Williams.)Jerry Beck, a professor of animation history at Woodbury University in California, said: \u201cIn another day, Disney would have come down and said: \u2018How dare you? We need to protect our characters.\u2019 But in this case it looks powerful if the movie is told from outside the gates.\u201dThe movies that the company is releasing now have large fan bases, Mr. Beck noted. \u201cMaybe they are going to be quietly allowed to express their fandom,\u201d he said.\u201cIt had to have its own authentic feel to it,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThey are Owen\u2019s interpretation of these characters.\u201d (The film also uses clips from Disney films like \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d for which the production paid a licensing fee.)The animated sequences show a 3-year-old boy being swept into an abstract world without dialogue as he\u2019s chased by an evil force. He finds shelter with sidekicks who are recognizably Baloo, the bear from \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d; Sebastian, the crab from \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d; and several others.With \u201cLife, Animated,\u201d Mr. Suskind said, \u201cDisney is saying, \u2018We trust you the viewer to see who we are through the eyes of this person who turned their movies into a vessel to make his way in the world.\u201dAnd yet this isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of change at the company. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read any corporate policy implications into this,\u201d Mr. Bailey said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen to Pay $14.7 Billion to Settle Diesel Claims in U.S.", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byVolkswagen has agreed to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle claims stemming from its diesel emissions cheating scandal, in what would be one of the largest consumer class-action settlements ever in the United States.The proposed settlement involving the federal government and lawyers for the owners of about 475,000 Volkswagen vehicles, includes a maximum of $10.03 billion to buy back affected cars at their pre-scandal values, and additional cash compensation for the owners, according to two people briefed on the settlement\u2019s terms.The cash compensation offered to each car owner will range from $5,100 to $10,000. Both the buyback price and amount of the additional compensation will depend on the cars\u2019 value before Volkswagen\u2019s public admission last September that its supposed \u201cclean diesel\u201d cars had been deliberately designed to cheat on air-quality tests.Despite the scope of the deal, which would still require the approval of the federal judge overseeing the case, the settlement would cover only a small fraction of the 11 million diesel cars worldwide \u2014 most of them in Europe \u2014 that Volkswagen has acknowledged contained the cheating software.But in the United States, \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable deal for Volkswagen owners who were defrauded by the company,\u201d said David M. Uhlmann, a former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section who is now a law professor at the University of Michigan.Rather than sell their vehicles back to Volkswagen, car owners in the United States can also choose to have their vehicles fixed to meet emissions standards, although doing so would probably reduce the engines\u2019 performance and gas mileage. And the methods for fixing the vehicles that Volkswagen has proposed are still subject to approval by the Environmental Protection Agency, one of the federal parties to the case.Volkswagen will also compensate previous owners who may have sold their diesel vehicles after the cheating became known last year \u2014 but at only half the rate of the compensation being offered to current car owners.Particularly attractive is the combination of the buyback offer and cash payment, which appears to be the better option for consumers, Mr. Uhlmann said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see why consumers would want to take advantage of the fix and not the buyback option, unless they just love their cars,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Volkswagen, it\u2019s an extremely expensive settlement, far more than many analysts predicted.\u201dVolkswagen would also pay $2.7 billion into an E.P.A. fund, the two people said, to compensate for the environmental impact of its cars, which were fitted with software that enabled them to pass emissions tests but exceed legal pollution limits in on-the-road driving. Volkswagen has also agreed to spend $2 billion on new cleaner-vehicle projects, an investment that the automaker could reap returns on.All told, the civil settlement would be the largest yet by an automobile company, dwarfing the $1.4 billion that Toyota paid to settle a class-action lawsuit over flawed accelerators and the more than $2 billion General Motors has paid so far to settle claims from owners of cars with faulty ignition switches. Toyota, in addition, paid $1.2 billion to settle criminal charges, while G.M. paid $900 million.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Volkswagen has said it has set aside 16.2 billion euros, or more than $18 billion, to cover fines and compensation to Volkswagen owners.And yet, Volkswagen\u2019s legal problems would be far from over.Volkswagen faces a criminal inquiry by the Department of Justice and an investigation by attorneys general in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The attorneys general are expected as soon as Tuesday to announce their own settlement with Volkswagen, for $500 million in penalties for defrauding consumers, according to a person briefed on the deal.Financial regulators in New York are also investigating whether Volkswagen overcharged consumers when the company leased or financed sales of diesel cars that it later admitted were designed to cheat on air-quality tests. In a subpoena sent to Volkswagen on Monday, the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services also sought information from the German automaker on insurance coverage required for Volkswagen and Audi cars financed or leased in New York.The automaker is under investigation in a number of other countries, including Germany and South Korea.Volkswagen acknowledged last year that it had installed illegal software in 11 million cars worldwide that made them capable of defeating pollution tests.The proposed settlement requires a review by United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer in California and must go through a period of public comment, during which terms could yet change.Affected Volkswagen owners are not bound by the settlement, and some may decide to press for better terms.Nor will the deal address terms for the owners of 85,000 Volkswagen and Porsche cars sold in the United States that had a different type of diesel engine but also had emissions problems. Negotiations over a settlement for those cars are still underway.Volkswagen faces increasing discontent from owners in Europe, meanwhile, who account for by far the greatest number of the 11 million vehicles with illegal software.As a result, the settlement talks in the United States present Volkswagen with a dilemma. Any agreement that satisfied American owners would only increase demands from restive Volkswagen owners in Europe.The automaker is recalling cars in Europe to make them compliant with air quality rules, but is not offering owners any compensation. Limits on nitrogen oxide are less stringent in Europe, so it has been easier for Volkswagen to find a fix that regulators will approve.Still, owners in Germany, France and other places have been trying to find ways to sue Volkswagen, even though European laws generally discourage class-action suits. Some political leaders in Europe have also been calling on Volkswagen to pay car owners.Advertisement"}

One group of ballots arrived late because stormy weather had delayed a boat carrying them on the Amazon.Both candidates had promised free-market reforms, but the election was closely watched because of Ms. Fujimori\u2019s candidacy. Her father, Alberto K. Fujimori, led Peru from 1990 to 2000, and during that time he crushed the Shining Path rebel group, which had long terrorized the country.Mr. Fujimori\u2019s legacy cut both ways for his daughter\u2019s standing among Peruvians.Growing concerns about crime in the country led many to see her as a strong law-and-order candidate. But a large contingent feared that another Fujimori presidency would mean a return to authoritarianism in Peru.During the last days of the campaign, Mr. Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker and finance minister, trailed Ms. Fujimori by five percentage points, according to polls. But last-minute endorsements and a campaign scandal involving aides to Ms. Fujimori tipped the scales, analysts say.Mr. Kuczynski will take office on July 28.Andrea Zarate contributing reporting from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Fires Corey Lewandowski, His Campaign Manager", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byThe exit occurred a month before Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is to secure the official nomination at the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland. It reflected a broader adjustment by the campaign as it grapples with a late start to fund-raising, anxiety among party leaders and a skeletal staff \u2014 all while Mr. Trump\u2019s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, swiftly builds out her operations in swing states.Mr. Trump had faced increasing concerns from allies and donors, as well as his children, over whether Mr. Lewandowski, who had never before worked on a national race, was able to direct a battle against Mrs. Clinton. Among those who had voiced concern was Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who told Mr. Trump last week that relations between his committee and Mr. Lewandowski had become increasingly strained, and that a change would be welcome, according to three people briefed on the discussion.Republicans across the spectrum welcomed the firing as a positive step, but they suggested that it needed to be followed by consistent changes in performance from the candidate himself.Mr. Lewandowski was fired at a Monday morning meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Trump\u2019s two older sons, Eric and Donald Jr., said two others briefed on the meeting,who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Trump and Mr. Lewandowski had what was described as a \u201cvery open conversation.\u201dIt was not immediately clear whether someone new would be named campaign manager, but it was clear that the existing Trump team believed most of the duties had already been assumed by other people, principally Mr. Manafort.\u201cUltimately, Paul is in charge,\u201d Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the experience to help get Mr. Trump across the finish line.\u201dAs a young Republican operative, Mr. Manafort helped manage the 1976 convention floor for Gerald Ford in his showdown with Ronald Reagan, the last time Republicans entered a convention with no candidate\u2019s having clinched the nomination. He performed a similar function for Reagan in 1980, and played leading roles in the 1988 and 1996 conventions, for George Bush and Bob Dole.Trump allies and critics alike regarded Mr. Lewandowski as a fierce defender of Mr. Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic approach to the presidential race. At a moment when many in the party have pressed Mr. Trump to soften his message and build a more conventional political operation, Mr. Lewandowski hewed closely to the mantra he had developed during the Republican primaries: \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201dThe limitations of that approach have been on vivid display in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has struggled to raise money from establishment donors, and he has drawn fresh criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his racial attacks on a federal judge and his revived proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in the wake of the gay nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla.With the Republican National Convention looming, he faces the task of broadening his team to include people with previous presidential campaign experience and uniting a party that is often not in lock step behind him.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cIt would be welcome if new people come in who have more experience and can move him to a more inclusive, more substance-oriented campaign,\u201d said Fred Malek, a fixture in Republican Party fund-raising.But he added: \u201cHow much the absence of a national kind of campaign is due to Corey and how much is due to Donald is kind of hard to tell. It looks to me like Trump drives his own train.\u201dIn announcing Monday morning that Mr. Lewandowski \u201cwill no longer be working with the campaign,\u201d Hope Hicks, the campaign\u2019s spokeswoman, said in a statement that \u201cthe campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication, and we wish him the best in the future.\u201dMr. Lewandowski was said to have resisted certain moves that would have increased the number of staff members, at times blocking Mr. Manafort from making hires or later undoing them.But the people briefed on Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s departure said the circumstances went well beyond any one episode or relationship. One stressed that the move had been in the works for many weeks, particularly since it had become clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee.Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. described the split as \u201camicable\u201d in an interview with NBC. And Mr. Lewandowski gave a series of interviews Monday afternoon in which he tried to brush aside questions about the internal particulars of his departure. He said he wished nothing but the best for Mr. Trump, and suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s doing well could only be good for him.\u201cIf Donald Trump wins, that\u2019s good for Corey Lewandowski,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN. He played down any suggestion of tension between him and Mr. Trump\u2019s children, and said every campaign expanded its operations for a general election.Few inside the campaign were given any warning about the dismissal of Mr. Lewandowski, who was on the campaign\u2019s daily 8:30 a.m. conference call on Monday, according to a person briefed on the developments.Mr. Bennett, the senior Trump campaign adviser, declined to predict whether there would be other significant changes. But he said Mr. Lewandowski deserved credit for helping Mr. Trump get where he is.\u201cThere is no doubt what Corey did in the primary was amazing \u2014 helping him get more votes than anyone else has ever gotten, a record turnout in 45 out of the 50 states, record low expenditures,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cNone of that\u2019s ever been done before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brooklyn School\u2019s Supporters Say the City Bet Against Its Progress", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWhen the New York City Education Department put a new Success Academy charter school in a building housing a troubled Brooklyn middle school in 2012, many believed the middle school was on its way to closing.But instead of dying, J.H.S. 50, in the Williamsburg neighborhood, is showing signs of revival.A new principal has added programs and activities. The school is hopeful about its performance on this year\u2019s standardized tests. And for the first time in many years, enrollment is expected to increase \u2014 112 sixth graders are registered for September \u2014 a sign that parents like what they see happening there.Now, in a twist, even as it grows, J.H.S. 50 will have to give up five classrooms next year, because the Success Academy school is expanding to fifth grade.\u201cWe doubled our incoming sixth-grade class,\u201d Mr. Honoroff said. \u201cSo I think that an equitable allocation would mean reconsidering some of those decisions.\u201dCity Councilman Antonio Reynoso, who graduated from J.H.S. 50 in 1996, when it had close to 1,100 students, said that when the department made the plan, it promised to adjust it if enrollment increased.\u201cThey said yes, that they would do that, and now we\u2019re facing that issue right now and they\u2019re saying no,\u201d Mr. Reynoso, a Democrat whose district includes Williamsburg, said in an interview.\u201cThey assumed that that wasn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d he added.Success Academy, through a spokesman, disputed the idea that space was unfairly allocated. The spokesman, Stefan Friedman, said that the charter school expected to add 110 students next year, and that even if J.H.S. 50 reached an enrollment of 270, the two schools would have roughly the same number of students per classroom. He said that the department\u2019s space allocations generally disfavored charter schools, and that several other Success schools in the city had many more students per classroom than traditional public schools in the same buildings.Over the past two decades, as the surrounding area evolved from a neighborhood of bodegas and discount stores, where half the residents received public assistance, into one of multimillion-dollar apartments and popular restaurants, J.H.S. 50 was largely left behind.Its students are mostly Hispanic and poor. Thirty-one percent have disabilities, and 29 percent do not speak English proficiently. In 2015, soon after J.H.S. 50 became part of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s school improvement effort, which the administration calls Renewal Schools, only 10 percent of the students passed the state reading tests and only 7 percent passed the math test.Mr. Honoroff, who became principal last year after working as a literacy coach at the school, instituted new math and English curriculums, added small-group reading interventions for all students four times a week, and made room in the schedule for teachers to meet in teams several times a week to examine students\u2019 work. While scores from this spring\u2019s state tests are not back yet, students made substantial improvement on internal reading tests during the year. Mr. Honoroff has also made debate a major focus, and the school\u2019s debate team recently won a citywide competition.To tackle its low attendance rate, J.H.S. 50 has paired frequently absent students with staff mentors, who call students or visit them at home when they do not show up and offer positive reinforcement when they do. The rate of chronic absenteeism \u2014 the share of students whose attendance is below 90 percent \u2014 declined to 31 percent in 2015-16 from 40 percent in 2014-15.J.H.S. 50 is also using the extra hour that all the schools in the Renewal program have added to their day to make going to school more appealing. Students can choose from a wide variety of extracurricular activities, including robotics, video game design, dance, mural painting, rock band and sports like soccer, baseball and basketball.Mr. Honoroff is worried about losing dedicated space for some of those activities as the school struggles to fit into a smaller footprint next year. J.H.S. 50 will probably have to turn its dance studio into a regular classroom. It is likely to lose a new computer lab Mr. Reynoso financed. And several rooms will need to do double duty, as both a classroom and a music room, for instance.To be sure, many schools in the city, both public and charter, struggle with space constraints. And the elementary school to which J.H.S. 50 is losing space, Success Academy Williamsburg, performs much better on state tests. Last year, 80 percent of its third graders \u2014 then its top grade \u2014 passed the reading tests and 99 percent passed the math tests. (The charter school has more white students and middle-class students, and fewer disabled students and students not proficient in English, than J.H.S. 50.)One morning last week, Mr. Honoroff pointed out five classrooms assigned to Success this past year that he said went unused and three others that he said were used only sporadically, for occupational therapy.A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Devora Kaye, said that the department was committed to supporting J.H.S. 50\u2019s growth and that it would review space requirements after enrollment numbers were confirmed in October. In the meantime, she said, the department would help the principal with renovations and room conversions to make the space work this year.But Mr. Reynoso said that having to squeeze into fewer classrooms could hurt the school\u2019s ability to increase enrollment further.\u201cWe\u2019re about to take away space that they were using to attract parents,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Early Signs of \u2018Brexit\u2019 Upheaval", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own \u201cremain\u201d vote \u2014 with his feet. Mr. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial start-up with him.The looming question on Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain\u2019s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment.The long-term business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the \u201cremain\u201d camp\u2019s warnings of economic tumult could come true.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo on Friday that in months to come \u201cwe may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\u201d Mr. Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000 employees in Britain might need to relocate.Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London\u2019s real estate boom.J\u00fcrgen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit.\u201cAll companies will be holding fire to see what happens,\u201d said Mr. Maier, Siemens\u2019s chief executive for Britain.For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their business-friendly, English-speaking beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany.Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a post-Brexit trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as right-wing parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain\u2019s coattails out of the union.It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain cheaper to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports.Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the \u201cleave\u201d forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe.But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive decision-making could be paralyzed and investment could come to a standstill.Britain\u2019s financial services industry, which employs 1.2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage.Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe.James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees \u2014 many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume \u2014 they said they might \u201cconsider adjustments to our operating model.\u201dEven Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,\u201d said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. \u201cAt this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there\u2019s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides.\u201dPerhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15,000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers.Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. \u201cThis is a lose-lose result for both Britain and Europe,\u201d said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. \u201cWe will review our U.K. investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201dOther sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. \u201cUncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,\u201d BP said in a statement Friday.United States technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1,000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe\u2019s common marketplace.The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany\u2019s third-largest customer for exports, after the United States and France.German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday.German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and Rolls-Royce are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen.Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the mid-1980s into a world-class factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475,000 vehicles, about a third of Britain\u2019s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union.Yet despite the European Union\u2019s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said on Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond.Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative.Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14,000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Mr. Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions.For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like self-driving cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out.\u201cThe question is more about future investment, future research and development,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThat\u2019s hanging in the balance.\u201dHe embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Mr. Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives.\u201cIt\u2019s usually a really buzzing office,\u201d Mr. Maier said. \u201cThis morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren\u2019t calling. That\u2019s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in.\u201dContributing reporting were Chad Bray and Stanley Reed from London, Nathaniel Popper and Michael Corkery from New York, Mark Scott from Rome and David Jolly from ParisAdvertisement"}

A Disney princess guided a girl to a patch of teal-colored pavement before snapping a photo with her.

The performers mostly obeyed the rules as police officers monitored the square.Not a single Elmo or Iron Man was seen being taken away in handcuffs or even clutching a summons. But the costumed characters were not happy about the new guidelines.Dressed as Olaf from the movie \u201cFrozen,\u201d Victor Aldea said the rules made it more difficult to make money.

The Spider-Men began to dance, drawing laughs from her group.Ms. Smith, 48, who was visiting from North Carolina, said she appreciated the new rules because she did not like being followed in the past by people who were selling tour-bus tickets. Now the decision was hers.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re being harassed,\u201d Ms. Smith said.As he walked through Times Square, Alex Diner said the performers did not bother him.

But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. When finance is hit by social and political crises, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend intervention. It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis. It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund.

What arrives at the table is a finely tempered bowl of soup clear but lush on the tongue, with no one flavor lording above the others.The baseline pho comes with round steak and Angus brisket, poached and cut into tissue-thin strips that shimmy when lifted and practically dissolve on the tongue. If you like, they will add skinny laces of tripe, which yield peaceably to the teeth, and knobs of gelatinous tendon, which do not. The broth is good, delicate and substantial at once, profound without belligerence.Still, it is but a shadow of the next pho on the list, the same broth transmuted by brisket patted down with five-spice and left to settle overnight, then smoked over wood chips and star anise for six hours. This has strange fathoms, as if you were drinking liquid cloud.The depth of the pho is something of a surprise at a restaurant whose other offerings seem slightly canted to please American palates. (The menu lists these mostly in English; the use of Vietnamese names can flummox the otherwise adept non-Vietnamese serving staff.)The balance so carefully monitored in the broth tips, elsewhere, toward the caramel that underlies many Vietnamese dishes. This is distinct from dessert caramel \u2014 the sugar is allowed to darken until a few shades shy of black, to bring a counterweight of bitterness. But I was conscious, throughout my meals here, of a commandeering sweetness.The best dishes favor salt, like shrimp deep-fried in the shell and given a lashing of butter in the wok, or ground lamb shoulder bundled in peppery leaves that the Vietnamese call la lot. These could almost be dolmades; the Liens use lamb instead of the classic beef as a salute to Astoria\u2019s Greek population.Father and son are attentive to ingredients. Suon nuong is made with a thicker center-cut pork chop, for more texture; smoke and salt leach from generous wedges of bacon into clay-pot rice. Presentation matters, too: Banh mi is deconstructed into a jar of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and grilled slices of baguette, with pickled pineapple and mango (from the Pickle Guys on the Lower East Side). Chicken curry, which gets its velvet from coconut milk and a touch of condensed milk, bears a halo of crispy sweet-potato strands.A sort of barbecued rice-paper pizza, a modern snack by way of Da Lat in the highlands of Vietnam, is still in the tinkering stage. The brittle skin rests under a broken egg, tiny woolly tufts of dried shrimp and pork floss, peanuts, fried shallots, bean sprouts, mango pur\u00e9e and avocado dressing. But something is missing: tang, heat, contradiction.District Saigon opened in February under the name District Mot, a nod to District 1 in Saigon, where Lam Lien grew up. (The name was recently changed to avoid confusion with the acclaimed District Mot restaurant in Berlin.) The Liens and a partner, Louis Leung, gutted a former 99-cent store and turned it into a sprawling room with a heavy cedar front door, live-edge wood tables and a spray-painted mural of terraced rice paddies.Written on the back wall is a Vietnamese phrase that translates as \u201cIt\u2019s great to be together.\u201d When Lam Lien fled Vietnam in 1979, he was separated from his family, who were given refuge in Toronto. In New York, he worked his way from dishwasher to server to prep cook at the Marriott World Trade Center. After Sept. 11, he joined the kitchen at New Pasteur, a Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown.His son, now 32, waited tables there while studying finance at Brooklyn College, before opening a Vietnamese restaurant of his own in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. The food there is \u201cvery fast,\u201d he said, nothing like the slow broths his father has taught him to make at District Saigon. \u201cI could never do something like this on my own.\u201dWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In California, a Lesson for Donald Trump and the G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaThis is the nightmare that has Republicans bolting upright: Donald J. Trump damages their party\u2019s reputation so severely that its national competitiveness is crippled \u2014 not just in 2016, but for years.Anti-Trump sentiment among Latino, Asian and African-American voters flashes clear warning signs. Because nonwhite voters keep growing as a share of the electorate, lingering impressions could haunt a generation of Republican candidates.The Sacramento-based strategist Rob Stutzman warns Republicans elsewhere about what he calls the \u201csoft racism\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign: \u201cStand up against it now, or pay the price for decades.\u201dIn fact, that\u2019s precisely what has happened to the party in California for the past 22 years, after a landmark race for governor in 1994.The Republican incumbent, Pete Wilson, seeking a second term, faced Kathleen Brown, the daughter and sister of former Democratic governors.Amid rising anxiety and anger about Latino immigrants, Mr. Wilson embraced a ballot measure denying some taxpayer-financed services to those who crossed the border illegally.Yet California Republicans have struggled ever since. The signal Mr. Wilson and his party sent in 1994 alienated Latino and other nonwhite voters as their political clout was swelling.Before 1994, Republican nominees had carried California in six of seven presidential contests. Since then, they\u2019ve lost all five, averaging 40 percent of the vote.Before 1994, Republicans had won three consecutive elections for governor. Since then, they\u2019ve lost four of five regularly scheduled contests.In the meantime, Republicans have lost all six Senate elections. In four of those races, Republican candidates failed to muster 40 percent of the vote.\u201cRepublican leaders and candidates were just too slow to understand what their demographic destiny was,\u201d said Mr. Stutzman.Lately, California Republicans have worked to lure back Asian-American voters, who at one time were attracted to the Republicans\u2019 economic and national security policies. And they have seen an increasing number of younger Latinos register with no party preference, rather than as Democrats.Enter Mr. Trump, with his call for a temporary ban on entry of Muslims into the United States, his description of some Mexican immigrants as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d and his remarks about the \u201cMexican heritage\u201d of a federal judge who was born in Indiana.Now Mr. Stutzman fears Mr. Trump may set Republicans back just as the Wilson campaign did in 1994, in California and elsewhere.The demographic shifts that have undercut California Republicans are reshaping the nation, too. Nationally, presidential exit polls showed the share of white voters in 2012 fell to 72 percent, from 87 percent 20 years earlier.The Census Bureau projects that whites will become a minority of America\u2019s population by 2044. The Republican National Committee itself, following its 2012 presidential defeat, called expanding Hispanic support \u201cimperative.\u201dMr. Trump, who flourished in Republican primaries by appealing to working-class whites, has not changed course since securing the party\u2019s nomination. He insists he can compete even in Democratic strongholds such as California, where Mitt Romney in 2012 drew just 37 percent of the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s an absurdity,\u201d Mr. Stutzman said. \u201cRepublicans will do better in California if he stays out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fraud Charges Against Jail Officers\u2019 Union Chief With a Taste for Luxury", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byAs federal agents tell it, the kickback scheme that led to the arrest on Wednesday of Norman Seabrook, the powerful leader of the New York City correction officers\u2019 union, was hatched one night in late 2013 in a hotel room in the Dominican Republic.The union president had been drinking and was delivering an earful to a well-connected New York real estate developer, according to the agents. For too long, Mr. Seabrook complained, he had been working hard to invest the union\u2019s money and had not received anything in return.It was time, he said, that \u201cNorman Seabrook got paid.\u201dWithin months Mr. Seabrook made an investment deal that made even union lawyers uneasy, putting $20 million of union funds in a high-risk hedge fund, according to a criminal complaint filed by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In exchange, prosecutors said, he was given $60,000, delivered in a Salvatore Ferragamo bag \u2014 one of his favorite luxury brands.Over the course of two decades as union president, Mr. Seabrook has gone from a jail guard patrolling the cellblocks of Rikers Island to an influential power broker, forming alliances across the political spectrum including with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat; former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent; and former Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.Just looking at him, it is clear Mr. Seabrook enjoys life\u2019s finer things. He is driven around town in luxury S.U.V.s, dines at upscale restaurants, smokes fine cigars and wears expensive tailored suits, often with a pocket square.Indeed, after Mr. Seabrook was arrested, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered a Ferragamo bag that matched the description of the one stuffed with cash, along with 10 pairs of Ferragamo shoes.At least some of Mr. Seabrook\u2019s luxuries were paid for by people seeking favors from him and the union, according to investigators. Plane trips to Las Vegas, California, Israel and at least two to the Dominican Republic were underwritten by Jona Rechnitz, the developer at the hotel that night in 2013. After that meeting, Mr. Rechnitz introduced Mr. Seabrook to a hedge fund financier named Murray Huberfeld, and helped arrange for the kickback, according to federal investigators.Mr. Rechnitz, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating in the Seabrook case, is also a central target in one of the investigations that are focused on the campaign fund-raising of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. He is not named in the complaint and is referred to instead as Cooperating Witness 1 or CW-1.Both Mr. Seabrook and Mr. Huberfeld, an associate at the hedge fund, Platinum Partners, have been charged with one count of honest services fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. Mr. Seabrook was released on $250,000 bond and Mr. Huberfeld on $1 million bond. Both have been ordered to remain in the New York City region.After the meeting at the hotel, according to prosecutors, Mr. Rechnitz went to Platinum promising to arrange a deal with the union to become a major investor. The catch, he said, was that Mr. Seabrook would have to be compensated. Mr. Huberfeld agreed to the arrangement and was willing to pay Mr. Seabrook 10 percent of all profits that the hedge fund made on the union\u2019s investment.Mr. Seabrook, whose salary is $300,000 a year with his union stipend, had one overarching concern, according to the complaint: how big his cut would be.Mr. Huberfeld told him it could be as much as $150,000 a year.In return, Mr. Seabrook would direct money intended to cover correction officers\u2019 pensions into a high-risk fund. Up to that point the union had maintained a traditional investment portfolio made up of conventional stocks and bond funds, government obligations and a real estate trust fund.The union\u2019s lawyers reviewed the proposal and pointed out that the union had never invested in a hedge fund before, nor had any other New York City retirement fund that they were aware of been involved in such a risky venture. Even so, they did not stand in the way of the deal.\u201cThe annuity fund, however, is not averse to being a trendsetter,\u201d the lawyers wrote to Platinum in February 2014.There were other red flags particular to Platinum. Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted of fraud in 1993 for arranging for another person to take a brokerage licensing exam on his behalf. He was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two years of probation. In a separate case, in 1998, he and a partner paid $4.6 million to settle a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged bank fraud.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Bharara said that Mr. Seabrook made his investment decisions \u201cbased not what was good for his union members but based on what was good for Norman Seabrook.\u201d\u201cFor a Ferragamo bag filled with cash, Seabrook allegedly sold himself and his duty to safeguard the retirement funds of his fellow correction officers,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.In the end, it was Mr. Seabrook who made the final decision on where the union money went. Over the years, he had consolidated absolute control over the operations of the union, often bypassing his executive board on even the most significant financial decisions.According to the authorities, he ultimately invested $15 million from the union\u2019s annuity fund, which is financed almost completely through annual contributions from the city, as well as another $5 million from the union\u2019s $12 million in assets at the time. \u201cThe investment decision was made by Seabrook alone,\u201d the union\u2019s treasurer, Michael Maiello, told investigators.By the end of 2014, according to the complaint, Mr. Seabrook began demanding a payout for his services. The hedge fund, however, was performing worse than expected, and Mr. Huberfeld could not immediately get his hands on the money. Instead, Mr. Rechnitz fronted his own money to pay off Mr. Seabrook with a promise from Platinum that he would be reimbursed. For accounting purposes, Mr. Rechnitz disguised the kickback as a $60,000 payment for a block of New York Knicks tickets.On Dec. 11, 2014, Mr. Rechnitz bought the bag from a Ferragamo store in Manhattan for $820. The handoff was made a few blocks away in Mr. Seabrook\u2019s Chevrolet Suburban, which is registered to the union.When Mr. Rechnitz \u201ctold Seabrook how much money was in the bag, Seabrook was angry that it was not as much money as he was initially promised,\u201d the complaint said.After the handoff, the men went out to dinner and attended a Torah dedication ceremony at a local synagogue.As the months went on, Platinum representatives kept pressing Mr. Seabrook to invest more union funds. According to investigators, the hedge fund was having cash flow problems and needed $44 million for investors seeking to pull out their money.On Jan. 27, 2015, Mr. Huberfeld, speaking on a phone that federal agents had wiretapped, told an associate to press Mr. Seabrook for more money during a lunch meeting.\u201cI\u2019m under some pressure,\u201d he said, according to the complaint.On May 19, 2015, the marketing director of Platinum sent an email to other executives noting that the meeting with Seabrook went great and that he \u201csaid he will send us more money shortly.\u201dBut before Mr. Seabrook could transfer more money, federal agents served subpoenas on the union and Platinum. \u201cNo further investments were made,\u201d the complaint said.The complaint does not make clear what happened to the $20 million the union invested.In a filing for a lawsuit brought last year by a former union official over alleged financial improprieties, he boasted that the investment had returned $475,000 in a recent three-month period. A union financial statement listed a return of just $47,529 for the same time.The union recently mailed out ballots for an election this summer listing Mr. Seabrook as running unopposed for president. But his future is unclear.On Wednesday, he was suspended as a correction officer, relieved of his shield and gun. He sat in a packed courtroom looking relaxed. He was dressed more modestly than usual: jeans, a collared shirt and sandals.When asked by a reporter at the courthouse how he felt, Mr. Seabrook replied, \u201cI feel like a million dollars.\u201dJ.

{"Headline": "One Economic Sickness, Five Diagnoses", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewEconomists, like physicians, sometimes confront a patient with an obvious problem but no obvious diagnosis. That is precisely the situation we face right now.Let\u2019s start with the problem.There is no simple way to gauge an economy\u2019s health. But if you had to choose just one statistic, it would be gross domestic product. Real G.D.P. measures the total income produced within an economy, adjusted for the overall level of prices.Here is the sad fact: Over the last decade, the growth rate of real G.D.P. per person has averaged just 0.44 percent per year, compared with the historical norm of 2.0 percent. At a rate of 2.0 percent, incomes double every 35 years. At a rate of 0.44 percent, it takes about 160 years to double.It may be tempting to blame the Great Recession of 2008-9 for the paltry 10-year growth rate. Indeed, this recession was a deep one.Yet the explanation for the poor long-run performance is not that simple. The recession of 1982 was also a deep one. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 percent in 1982, compared with a peak of 10 percent in 2009. But by the first quarter of 1989, as Ronald Reagan was leaving the White House, the 10-year growth rate was up to 2.1 percent.The difference: The 1982 recession was followed by a robust recovery, whereas the recession of 2008-9 has been followed by a meager one.So what\u2019s wrong with the economy? No one knows for sure. But numerous theories are being bandied about. Here are five of them:During the recent crisis, many feared another Great Depression would follow. We averted that catastrophe, but the anxiety may linger, causing businesses to be reluctant to borrow to finance risky investments and banks reluctant to finance them. The good news is that hangovers eventually dissipate, but patience is required.His solution? More government spending on infrastructure, like roads, bridges and airports. If the government takes advantage of lower interest rates to make the right investments in public capital \u2014 admittedly a big if \u2014 the policy would promote employment in the short run as projects are being built and make the economy more productive when they are put into use.This theory is the most pessimistic. If he\u2019s right, we may have little choice but to get used to slower growth.So there they are. One sickness, five diagnoses. Unfortunately, I have no idea which one is right. The truth may well involve a bit of each.N. GREGORY MANKIW is a professor of economics at Harvard.Advertisement"}

Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued strongly that trade agreements have been unfairly tilted against American workers.In March, the United States put a tariff of 266 percent on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost. And last month, in separate actions, the Commerce Department announced duties of 450 percent and 522 percent on some imports of Chinese steel.Referring to the excess capacity, Mr. Lew said on Sunday, \u201cChina\u2019s capacity to address that is central to China\u2019s economy, to the global economy and to the U.S.-China relationship.\u201dIn recent months, he noted, China has sometimes acted to strengthen the value of the renminbi, making imports into China more attractive, rather than weakening the currency. More recently, the yuan has weakened against the dollar to levels not seen in five years.The strategic dialogue began nearly 10 years ago in George W. Bush\u2019s administration as an effort for the United States and China to set an agenda for the most important issues and find a path to solving them. In 2009, it grew from an economic focus to include security issues. The meeting has evolved into a set of talks involving hundreds of officials meeting over several days to discuss issues as diverse as civilian aviation and the protection of elephants, as well as the big economic and security matters.But with Mr. Xi concentrating more power in his own hands, the usefulness of such a wide-ranging exercise may have outrun itself, some Americans said. Mr. Xi opened the dialogue with a speech, and his closest economic adviser, Liu He, met with Mr. Lew on Sunday.With the Obama administration in its final lap and a leadership transition looming in China next year, it is unlikely that this year\u2019s dialogue will result in any breakthroughs, said Eswar S. Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\u201cWhile the dialogue will include many top-level Chinese technocrats, there is a widespread perception that their influence on economic policies and reforms has been circumscribed by the rising concentration of power in the hands of President Xi and a close circle of his aides,\u201d he said.The new American president \u2014 whether Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 would be unlikely to continue the annual talks in such a broad manner, Professor Prasad said. Top officials on both sides probably view the dialogue this year \u201cas their last waltz together,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the participation of the Chinese delegation in the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing this week. President Xi Jinping\u2019s closest economic adviser, Liu He, is attending the talks; it is not the case that close Xi aides \u201cwill not participate directly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Morgenthaler, a mechanical engineer who became an early figure in the modern venture capital industry, died on June 17 in Cleveland. He was 96.His death was confirmed by his son Gary.Intrepid and intellectually curious, Mr. Morgenthaler (pronounced morgan-THAY-ler) worked in jet engine manufacturing and industrial metallurgy before he moved into investing, supporting nascent companies and entrepreneurs with his own money. He later opened his fund to outside investors.He founded his firm, Morgenthaler Ventures, in 1968, making early investments in several companies, including Apple Computer.But it was Mr. Morgenthaler\u2019s investment in Manufacturing Data Systems, which provided programs to run machine tools, that netted him his fortune. He invested $200,000 in the new business in 1969, a stake that became worth $20 million after the company went public in 1976. He helped orchestrate the company\u2019s sale to the oil-field services giant Schlumberger for just shy of $200 million in 1981.Mr. Morgenthaler\u2019s career took a more political turn when he worked with the National Venture Capital Association.As one of the organization\u2019s founding directors, he moved it from Chicago to Washington, where he helped push a legislative agenda that would shape the industry. He helped persuade Congress to lower the capital gains tax rate to 28 percent from 49 percent to encourage investment in small businesses, and to change laws in 1979 so that pension funds could invest in venture capital firms.\u201cBig business had lobbying in D.C. and was influencing legislation, but it was small business that was creating new jobs in the country,\u201d Gary Morgenthaler said. \u201cHe pushed the venture industry to have a mission and a purpose, to be the voice of small business in America.\u201dMr. Morgenthaler\u2019s passion for investing overlapped with his personal life after his eldest son, David, died of cancer in 1989. He began to invest more in biotechnology and life sciences companies that sought to cure disease.David Turner Morgenthaler was born on Aug. 5, 1919, in Chester, S.C., into a family of farmers. After his parents were divorced, he lived in several places in the South, including South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida.He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in mechanical engineering, and served with the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II.After the war, Mr. Morgenthaler worked at several start-ups before becoming an investor in new businesses.Over the years, his firm has broken into four separate investment groups. Morgenthaler Ventures is on its ninth venture fund and still makes investments in information technology. Canvas Ventures, another information-technology investment group, was spun out of Morgenthaler in 2013. The life sciences investment arm merged with Advanced Technology Ventures and is now Lightstone Capital Partners. MPE Partners makes private equity investments.For many years, Mr. Morgenthaler served on the board of the Cleveland Clinic, a nonprofit teaching hospital. He financed a professorship at Carnegie Mellon University, and a Stanford entrepreneurship prize, the David T. Morgenthaler Grand Prize, was established in his name. He also served on the Hoover Institution\u2019s board of overseers and on the Science, Technology and Economic Policy Board of the National Academies.In addition to his son Gary, Mr. Morgenthaler is survived by his wife, Lindsay Jordan, whom he married in 1945; another son, Todd; a daughter, Lissa; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.Reprinted from Sunday\u2019s early editions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Look Ahead at the Next Recession", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhat did we learn from the Great Recession? With economic growth creeping ahead at a glacial pace and another cyclical downturn looming not far in the future, questions about how to stimulate growth and protect the most vulnerable loom large on the list of priorities.The question is not just about how to reignite growth after the next downturn. Another very important question is about how to protect the most vulnerable when the next recession hits. The experience of the last one suggests our social safety net needs some redesigning. Too many disenfranchised people were left without assistance. The programs that we have missed too many.One of the most profound mistakes, I think, was Congress shifting toward austerity and producing a set of manufactured crises that hurt the economy. If you look at the combination of sequestration and the government shutdown, you are looking at likely over a million jobs lost as a result.At a time where the politics to do what we did in the aftermath of the Great Recession are arguably even harder, the automatic stabilization that can be provided in the safety net is even more important.The odds are better than 50-50 that we will have a recession within the next few years. What does the Fed normally do when that happens? The Fed normally cuts real interest rates by five percentage points. Is it conceivable that there is going to be room to do that, even maybe allowing for Q.E. [quantitative easing], even recognizing that maybe rates could become negative 50 basis points? I submit that it\u2019s not.So, changes in the fiscal monetary mix are essential. They are the only tools available when the next recession comes, and I would submit that they are desirable right now.What are the crucial elements of changing the fiscal monetary mix? One is a substantial increase in public investment. It is insane that federal investment in infrastructure is now net negative at a moment when interest rates have never been lower. And precious little is happening at the state and local level, either.Second, strong support for social insurance. When Keynes came to the United States in 1942, he pointed out that an important virtue of Social Security was that it could absorb the excess savings that would potentially hold back U.S. economic growth after the Second World War. Those considerations were not relevant in the succeeding 60 years, but they potentially are relevant in our current period of secular stagnation. Note that an expansion of pay-as-you-go Social Security does not raise the annual budget deficit, but in every economic model contributes to raising aggregate demand by enabling households to look forward to more secure retirements.Third, there is a strong case for doing what we can to promote housing investment. We are managing the cycle in the worst way possible from the point of view of housing. We got all of the lower-middle-income and poor people into their own houses when the price was going up and was a bubble. Then when the price plummeted, they all sold to private equity firms who rented the houses out at a 10 percent yield and earned tremendous capital gains. This is exactly the wrong moment for support for housing to be at a minimum rather than a maximum.Fourth, related to my first point, this is the moment to be maintaining the infrastructure we have. The one thing we know \u2014 if you look at airports, if you look at highways, if you look at the water system of Flint, Michigan \u2014 it is much more costly to defer maintenance than it is to do maintenance promptly. It is every bit as much a burden on my children\u2019s generation to defer maintenance as it is to issue paper debt, and I promise you that the costs compound far more rapidly with deferred maintenance than they do with the 13 basis points that represent the real interest costs of current long-term federal debt.The most important determinant of our long-term fiscal picture is how successful we are at accelerating the economy\u2019s growth rate in the next three to five years, not the austerity measures that we implement. People concerned with our long-term fiscal health should be redoubling their focus on the currently inadequate growth rate.I believe passionately in more infrastructure investment, but the concerns that government doesn\u2019t do it so well are not stupid concerns. There is a bridge right outside my office. It connects Harvard Square with Boston. The bridge is 232 feet long. It has been under repair, with traffic blocked, for four and one-half years. It took 11 months to build the bridge the first time.You\u2019re not going to get a commitment to a public sector-led fiscal policy strategy without also having a strategy that is about private sector activity and private sector investment.The basic truth is that giving people benefits does influence their behavior. There are a large number of people in our society \u2014 little children, people who are 75 years old, people who are disabled \u2014 who aren\u2019t going to work no matter what. Then there is what you can prudently afford to give to people where there are going to be large incentive effects. So there are a variety of incremental reforms that would broaden eligibility for various existing programs that I would support, but the universal basic income is one of those ideas that the longer you look at it, the less enthusiastic you become.Literally over decades you are seeing improvements of a third to a half in lifetime earnings from things like housing vouchers or others. If you think of the costs of someone not working, if you think of all the attendant health care, criminal justice and other impacts, the truth is that these investments may actually pay for themselves multiple times over.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Sea of Charter Schools in Detroit Leaves Students Adrift", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 On the face of it, Ana Rivera could have had almost any choice when it came to educating her two sons. For all the abandoned buildings and burned-down houses in her neighborhood in the southwest part of this city, national charter school companies had seen a market and were setting up shop within blocks of each other, making it easier to find a charter school than to buy a carton of milk.But hers became the story of public education in a city grasping for its comeback: lots of choice, with no good choice.She enrolled her older son, Damian, at the charter school across from her house, where she could watch him walk into the building. He got all A\u2019s and said he wanted to be an engineer. But the summer before seventh grade, he found himself in the back of a classroom at a science program at the University of Michigan, struggling to keep up with students from Detroit Public Schools, known as the worst urban district in the nation. They knew the human body is made up of many cells; he had never learned that.When his school stopped assigning homework, Ms. Rivera tried enrolling Damian at other charters, but the deadlines were past, the applications onerous. Finally, she found him a scholarship at a Catholic school, where he struggled to rise above D\u2019s all year. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hear the word engineering,\u201d she said.Michigan leapt at the promise of charter schools 23 years ago, betting big that choice and competition would improve public schools. It got competition, and chaos.Detroit schools have long been in decline academically and financially. But over the past five years, divisive politics and educational ideology and a scramble for money have combined to produced a public education fiasco that is perhaps unparalleled in the United States.While the idea was to foster academic competition, the unchecked growth of charters has created a glut of schools competing for some of the nation\u2019s poorest students, enticing them to enroll with cash bonuses, laptops, raffle tickets for iPads and bicycles. Leaders of charter and traditional schools alike say they are being cannibalized, fighting so hard over students and the limited public dollars that follow them that no one thrives.\u201cThe point was to raise all schools,\u201d said Scott Romney, a lawyer and board member of New Detroit, a civic group formed after the 1967 race riots here. \u201cInstead, we\u2019ve had a total and complete collapse of education in this city.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll either invest in our own children and prepare them to fill these jobs, or I suppose maybe people will migrate from other places in the country to fill them,\u201d said Thomas F. Stallworth III, a former state representative who steered the passage of the 2014 legislation that paved Detroit\u2019s way out of bankruptcy. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we are still left with this underbelly of generational poverty with no clear path out.\u201dThe 1993 state law permitting charter schools was not brought on by academic or financial crisis in Detroit \u2014 those would come later \u2014 but by a free-market-inclined governor, John Engler. An early warrior against public employee unions, he embraced the idea of creating schools that were publicly financed but independently run to force public schools to innovate.To throw the competition wide open, Michigan allowed an unusually large number of institutions, more than any other state, to create charters: public school districts, community colleges and universities. It gave those institutions a financial incentive: a 3 percent share of the dollars that go to the charter schools. And only they \u2014 not the governor, not the state commissioner or board of education \u2014 could shut down failing schools.Operators were lining up to get into the city, and in 2011, after a conservative wave returned the governor\u2019s office and the Legislature to Republican control for the first time in eight years, the Legislature abolished a cap that had limited the number of charter schools that universities could create to 150.Some charter school backers pushed for a so-called smart cap that would allow only successful charters to expand. But they could not agree on what success should look like, and ultimately settled for assurances from lawmakers that they could add quality controls after the cap was lifted.Twenty-four charter schools have opened in the city since the cap was lifted in 2011. Eighteen charters whose existing schools were at or below the district\u2019s dismal performance expanded or opened new schools.Ms. Rivera, herself the product of a failing Detroit public high school, knew none of that when she chose the school for her sons. \u201cI had no idea of the education system,\u201d she said. She presumed it was better because it was a charter; it did not get the bad press the public schools do about gangs and violence.Saginaw Valley State University, which chartered Cesar Chavez Academy, defended its decision to allow the school to expand, arguing that many of the students come in without English as a first language, and do better as they move into high school.\u201cThey trend positively academically throughout that system,\u201d David Lewis, the director of the university\u2019s charter school office, said. The Stanford data is national and \u201cis not reflective,\u201d he said, of Cesar Chavez.With about $1.1 billion in state tax dollars going to charter schools, those that grant the charters get about $33 million. Those institutions are often far from the schools; one, Bay Mills Community College, is in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, nearly 350 miles away \u2014 as far from Detroit as Portland, Me., is from New York City.\u201cPeople here had so much confidence in choice and choice alone to close the achievement gap,\u201d said Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust Midwest, which advocates higher academic standards. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re replicating failure.\u201dDawn Wilson\u2019s four oldest children have attended between five and seven schools each \u2014 not uncommon in Detroit \u2014 moving among charter schools, traditional schools, private religious schools and suburban districts that take Detroit students, and the dollars that follow them.She drives her children 130 miles a week to school \u2014 down from 200 last year, now that one daughter lives with another family in a suburb to attend private school. In between, she works as an entertainer for children\u2019s parties. (\u201cKuddles the Klown,\u201d she answers her cellphone.)\u201cWho else has time to take their kids to all these places to try to find quality education?\u201d she asked.Conflict with a teacher she found disrespectful prompted her to pull her children from one charter. One daughter spent six months at another, but returned to the Christian school she had attended earlier because there were so many fights.Then, at a bus stop for the private school, her daughter was recruited for a charter that promised college seminars and dual enrollment at local colleges \u2014 and rewarded her for enrolling with a raffle ticket for a $50 gift card.With all the new schools, Detroit has roughly 30,000 more seats, charter and traditional public, than it needs. The competition to get students to school on count day \u2014 the days in October and February when the head count determines how much money the state sends each school \u2014 can resemble a political campaign. Schools buy radio ads and billboards, sponsor count day pizza parties and carnivals. They plant rows of lawn signs along city streets to recruit students, only to have other schools pull those up and stake their own.A few weeks before the February count day two years ago, Detroit Public Schools sent a letter to families at a school in the state-run district, claiming, falsely, that their children had been reassigned to a public school. The state district cried foul \u2014 then copied the trick before the next count day.There are high-performing elite public schools that require entrance exams. A step below are some that require applications. Then come the neighborhood schools.Then there are charter schools, which are supposed to accept students by lottery. But the most selective often have lengthy applications, requiring students to submit test results and official documents or give their history of disciplinary problems or special education.Some schedule enrollment periods in January, even though most parents do not think about where to send their children until May. In a report commissioned by Excellent Schools Detroit, a nonprofit that has pushed for all schools to join a universal enrollment system, the director of one charter management company explained that his school published the required advertisement for its enrollment period in newspapers it knew would not be read by most Detroit families.The more successful schools are those \u2014 charter or public \u2014 that are more selective. Detroit Public Schools, meanwhile, educates most of the city\u2019s special education students, including Ms. Wilson\u2019s youngest son, the only one of her children who has not changed schools several times.Charter schools are concentrated downtown, with its boom in renovation and wealthier residents. With only 1,894 high school age students, there are 11 high schools. Meanwhile, northwest Detroit \u2014 where it seems every other house is boarded up, burned or abandoned \u2014 has nearly twice the number of high school age students, 3,742, and just three high schools. The northeastern part of the city is even more of an education desert: 6,018 high school age students and two high schools.In a city of 140 square miles, transportation adds another layer to school selection. Few schools offer busing. And Detroit, long defined by the auto industry, never invested much in public transportation.A mile and a half to school can become an hour-and-a-half journey, as it is for Deniqua Robinson and her three youngest children.Morning is often still dark when they catch a 6:10 a.m. bus around the corner from their housing project near the MotorCity Casino Hotel. They wake by 5:30 a.m., because if they miss the 6:10, the next bus will not come for an hour, and the Catholic school her son attends fines him for being late. Some days her youngest daughter is lugging her cello. (\u201cIt\u2019s like another person,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.)They change buses once, waiting at a weedy lot across the street from the old Kronk Gym, once a training ground for boxers like Thomas Hearns \u2014 a Hall of Famer known as \u201cthe Hitman\u201d \u2014 and now a concrete shell covered in graffiti. In a safer neighborhood, they could walk the last distance. But two years ago, Ms. Robinson\u2019s two middle children watched a dog maul a teacher after it ran out of an abandoned house across from the charter they attended nearby.\u201cI can identify the engines of what\u2019s behind me, because I\u2019m so on guard,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cI have to know what\u2019s going on around me so nobody\u2019s behind me trying to hit me upside the head and rob us.\u201dTwo Mondays a month, her son\u2019s school requires him to participate in a work-study program after school \u2014 or pay $100 for every session he misses. He has been working at the city\u2019s tourism bureau and loves the experience, but getting him there has disrupted the family\u2019s bus routine. So Ms. Robinson has him on a waiting list for a charter school downtown that would not require him to work.She estimates that her children miss 10 to 15 days a year because the buses do not come on time or it is too cold to wait. Some days she cannot afford the fare; a single mother, she supplements her child support payments by redeeming bottles for 10 cents each.\u201cI often describe this whole environment as \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 for schools,\u201d said Tonya Allen, president of the Skillman Foundation, which invests $17 million a year to try to improve the lives of Detroit\u2019s poorest children. \u201cYou get these kids who are moving three or four times in the elementary school years. I did that, but it was because my mother couldn\u2019t keep her rent together. Here, it\u2019s being incentivized.\u201dThat transience can prevent schools that want to be good from getting there. When there is always another option, families are inclined to take it.Many left a state-run school after New Paradigm for Education, one of the city\u2019s most successful charter school companies, took it over and raised academic demands, imposing requirements that are standard in suburban districts, like a parent\u2019s signature on a nightly reading log.\u201cParents have been victims for generations of failing schools,\u201d said Machion Jackson, the company\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what high expectations look like, you become frustrated.\u201dAfter about 150 students left one of the charter schools that Dawn Wilson\u2019s children attended, angry that the management company had changed, the school cut teacher salaries by 20 percent and combined grades in classrooms. Even then it did not meet its budget.Renee Burgess, the president of the new management company, Equity Education, said that every year about 35 percent of students in the company\u2019s three schools do not come back.\u201cImagine if G.M. had to hire 35 percent of its work force again every year,\u201d she said.She employs a full-time recruiter and expects principals to spend most of their time from April to October raising enrollment. Every staff member must make at least one personal contact a week with students over the summer to encourage them to return.\u201cIn a system that is more stable, you wouldn\u2019t need to invest in that,\u201d Ms. Burgess said. \u201cYou could invest those resources in another instructional coach, in more development and training for first-year teachers.\u201dLike others elsewhere, charter schools receive roughly the same per-pupil state dollars as public schools. But in Detroit, it is about $7,300 a year \u2014 roughly half what New York or Boston schools get, and about $3,500 less than charters in Denver or Milwaukee.\u201cWe\u2019re spreading the money across more and more schools; it\u2019s no wonder that every school struggles,\u201d said Dan Varner, the chief executive of Excellent Schools Detroit. \u201cThey\u2019re all under-resourced.\u201dThe hardest places to improve are the large urban public high schools like Frank Cody High School.Just off the retail-starved stretch of Joy Road that gangs call the \u201cSkudd Zone,\u201d where the McDonald\u2019s is known as the Murder Mac, Cody defines big city high schools in the worst way. Its concrete fortress occupies four square blocks, with metal detectors and security guards at the entrance and, inside, employees wearing boots in hot weather to keep mice from their ankles.For a time, it seemed competition might work as it was intended at Cody.Administrators visited charters in New York and Chicago to learn best practices and broke down the school into three smaller academies, each with about 100 students per grade.The Academy of Public Leadership, on the second floor, copied practices many charters use to create what they call a \u201ccollege-going culture.\u201d College pennants line classroom walls; signs in hallways tally scholarship money students have won.The academy\u2019s principal, Johnathon Matthews, eliminated security guards in the hallways in favor of \u201ccultural facilitators,\u201d more like parents or older siblings. Every student, he pledged, would be able to identify three caring adults at the school and have a teacher\u2019s cellphone number to call if the bus did not come or the electricity was turned off.Graffiti stopped. Gang activity calmed down so much that the owner of the gas station next to the \u201cMurder Mac\u201d asked Mr. Matthews if the school had closed. ACT scores nudged up. And Mr. Matthews started thinking about adding counselors who would not just get students into college, but follow them through to completion.Then came this year\u2019s senior class.Students needed 23 credits to graduate in June, but many had just 13 or 14 by January. One had just one and a half credits.At age 19, they join the ranks of \u201coverage, undercredited\u201d students and have to transfer to alternative schools. The graduating class started in September with 87 students, but just 52 received diplomas.Theirs was the class of students that started high school in the years of heavy churn \u2014 after the Legislature lifted the charter cap, the state created its new district and the city closed other public high schools as students fled to charters. By the time they arrived as sophomores or juniors, many students had three or four high schools on their transcripts and often gaps in their education: With no central record system, it takes time for schools or parents to track down the forms they need to re-enroll.In the six weeks between February count day and the end of March this year, the school had 34 new students, some pushed from charter schools, some from suburban choice districts.Teachers at the Academy of Public Leadership argue with Mr. Matthews about taking all comers, complaining that the school is judged for the performance of students who show up just weeks before state exams.\u201cWe have the savior of Detroit here as our principal,\u201d said Tracey Penick, the college counselor. \u201cAs admirable as it is, it\u2019s very stressful. When you get a child at this stage in the game, it\u2019s because they\u2019re a problem.\u201dLately, Mr. Matthews has been talking to a large bank about bringing a job training program to the school. The bank expressed concern about the low performance of students, and asked whether Cody might become an application school. It is hard for him not to be tempted.\u201cThe hidden ways to control who you get, that\u2019s where I really frown upon competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s created a caste system, and Cody has the untouchables. It\u2019s separate and unequal.\u201dThis winter, as Detroit Public Schools ran out of money, Mayor Mike Duggan, a pro-charter Democrat now in his third year, argued that the traditional schools needed a solution that would address the problems posed, and faced, by charter schools.Political conditions seemed promising.Backed by a coalition of philanthropies and civic leaders, the teachers\u2019 union and some charter school operators, the mayor got a Republican senator from western Michigan to sponsor legislation, including the commission. Governor Snyder, distracted and shamed by the scandal over the lead poisoning in the water supply of the mostly black and state-controlled city of Flint, was in no position to defend the state control of majority-black Detroit Public Schools, and supported the proposal.In February, four prominent Detroit Republican business executives, including two sons of former governors, testified in support of the plan before the Legislature, arguing that 20 years had proved that the free market alone is not enough to improve schools. One of them, Mr. Romney, likened schools to a public utility.\u201cThis is a public service, this isn\u2019t just a business,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the free market for police or fire.\u201dBut the Great Lakes Education Project and other charter school lobbying groups warned that the commission would favor public schools over charters and argued instead to kill off the Detroit Public Schools.In the waning days of the legislative session, House Republicans offered a deal: $617 million to pay off the debt of the Detroit Public Schools, but no commission. Lawmakers were forced to take it to prevent the city school system from going bankrupt.For parents, the search remains for good schools \u2014 charter or public.After her experience with the failing charter school in southwest Detroit, Ms. Rivera moved her younger son, Omar, to another charter nearby.

{"Headline": "Cuomo Seeks Fixes to \u2018Rampant\u2019 Problems in New York\u2019s Campaign Contribution System", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 With little movement on state ethics laws, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a late push in the legislative session on Wednesday to tighten restrictions on election laws governing money given to candidates through so-called independent expenditure committees.In particular, the governor will suggest clarifying criteria \u2014 via a legal opinion and legislation to be introduced \u2014 for determining if a candidate is improperly coordinating with a committee, including whether the candidate and committee have overlapping donor bases, past staff members in common or the same consultants.Shared office space or information would also be considered evidence of improper coordination under the governor\u2019s plan, outlined in a speech given on Wednesday at Fordham Law School, as would similarities in campaign material produced by a candidate and a committee.The plan \u2014 laid out in an opinion from his counsel, Alphonso David \u2014 would also set up a so-called safe harbor provision for independent committees to list their donors and other information so as to avoid the appearance of conflict between the committees and candidates. If made into law, such violations would be felonies, according to the governor\u2019s office.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, framed his remarks as an attack on Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that profoundly loosened limits on political contributions, saying that the decision created a \u201cfiction\u201d that independent expenditure committees \u201cwould actually, truly act independently\u201d and mocking a campaign finance system in which \u201cnobody knows who anybody is.\u201d\u201cThe collusion, the coordination, the subterfuge, the fraud in the current political system is rampant,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. He added that Congress, the Federal Election Commission \u201cand even the states have done a poor job in policing \u2014 and I include our state in that as well.\u201dThough not an exact rebuttal, the governor\u2019s speech seemed to touch on issues under examination by federal authorities and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, who have been looking into whether Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, or those acting with him, exceeded donation limits by funneling money to Democratic candidates through county party committees during the 2014 election cycle. Emma Wolfe, the mayor\u2019s director of intergovernmental affairs, has been subpoenaed in relation to the investigation.Legislators in Albany have found little consensus in drafting new ethics laws despite the corruption convictions late last year of Sheldon Silver, the Democrat who had long led the State Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, the former leader of the State Senate\u2019s Republican majority. The single point of agreement seems to be a possible bill to strip convicted lawmakers of their pensions, though even that idea has not yet passed both houses of the Legislature.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration, now in its sixth year, has had a mixed record on ethics, though he says the blame lays primarily with the Legislature.On Wednesday, government watchdog groups said that while changes to rules for independent expenditure groups were welcome, an even more pressing concern lay in the \u201cL.L.C. loophole,\u201d which allows for corporate interests to funnel almost unlimited funds through multiple limited liability companies, and which Mr. Cuomo himself has been a beneficiary of and has urged closing.Dick Dadey, the executive director of one such group, Citizens Union, called the governor\u2019s proposal \u201cthoughtful,\u201d but added that \u201cwhat is needed most immediately is a comprehensive solution to corruption in the state capital.\u201dIn a statement released shortly after the governor\u2019s speech, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who succeeded Mr. Skelos as the Senate majority leader, said he welcomed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal and agreed that there was a need for more transparency. The independent expenditure groups \u201ccannot be fronts for coordinated efforts of candidates,\u201d Senator Flanagan said.The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, echoed that, saying \u201cthis is a priority that must be addressed before the close of the 2016 session.\u201dTime is short; the legislative session is scheduled to end next week.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo challenged lawmakers to make changes in light of the scandals surrounding Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver.\u201cThis Legislature wants to say: \u2018We can be trusted. We understand, that was an anomaly,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to do it than to pass real reform that makes a real difference with ethics and takes on the No. 1 challenge in this nation, which is Citizens United.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Celebrating the National Park Centennial", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayLast year, the National Park Service shattered its previous attendance record by 14 million, attracting more than 307 million visitors. This year, traffic is already up nearly 3 million in year-to-date comparisons. And while the service won\u2019t project another record-breaking year, 2016 is shaping up to be perhaps its busiest summer, as judged by events created to celebrate its centennial year.Yellowstone National Park, dating back to 1872, preceded the National Park Service, which was established 44 years later, on Aug. 25, 1916, to oversee the management of a growing roster of parks. That list now stands at 59, though the National Park Service oversees 411 sites, including national seashores, monuments, historic sites, trails and more. It\u2019s those lesser-known sites that the administration hopes to popularize through its anniversary campaign, Find Your Park.\u201cMost Americans understand National Parks to be a few places out west,\u201d said Alexa Viets, the centennial coordinator for the National Park Service. \u201cThey know Yellowstone and Yosemite and the Grand Canyon. They don\u2019t necessarily understand the breadth of the National Park Service and the wealth of places set aside for enjoyment and to tell American stories. We are making a concerted effort to celebrate across the system.\u201dIn addition to a few national programs, sites were encouraged to develop centennial events or hitch their perennial affairs to the birthday bash to call attention to the range of activities on offer throughout the country.Big or small, celebrated or obscure, many National Park Service sites will mark the 100th in events related to volunteering, the arts, history and, of course, nature.\u201cWe\u2019re inviting everyone to find your park,\u201d Ms. Viets said. \u201cThat includes very particularly the next generations. The document that created the park service in 1916 has the language \u2018for future generations.\u2019 \u201dOf the 411 National Park Service holdings, 126 \u2014 including 35 national parks \u2014 charge admission fees of up to $30 a vehicle.

{"Headline": "Venezuela Casts a Long Shadow on Elections in Spain", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byMemo From SpainMADRID \u2014 Europe is facing a migration crisis, the threat of Islamic terrorism and the prospect that Britain will exit the European Union. But the big foreign policy issue before Spain\u2019s national elections next Sunday? Venezuela, of course.Candidates have visited Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to grandstand. Spain\u2019s governing conservative party has met in Madrid with opponents of Venezuela\u2019s leftist government. There have been charges of a virtual Venezuelan infiltration of Spain\u2019s politics.The shadow cast by Venezuela has been so long that its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, recently invited Spain\u2019s politicians to hold their election debate in Caracas \u201cso that I can also participate, and perhaps I will win the elections in Spain.\u201dThe leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, fired back in a televised debate that his opponents were ignoring the issues that could really affect Spain, starting with a possible British exit from the European Union.Podemos may be poised to do just that. After recently forming an alliance with a radical party, United Left, it could now leapfrog over the Socialists into second place, behind the conservative Popular Party of the caretaker prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, according to recent opinion polls. Such an outcome would overturn the two-party political order that has prevailed since Spain\u2019s return to democracy in the late 1970s.Given the troubles in Greece, which is negotiating yet another international bailout, opponents of Podemos have made much of the connection to Syriza. But it is the link to the former Ch\u00e1vez government that has been a special focus.A handful of Podemos leaders \u2014 including Mr. Iglesias, Juan Carlos Monedero and I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n \u2014 once used their academic credentials as political scientists to work as advisers to the government of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013. They also did advisory work in Bolivia and Ecuador, while studying how far-left politics could reshape Latin American nations.Opponents of Podemos have attacked the party over its finances and possible links to foreign governments, particularly Venezuela. Such accusations have been rejected by Podemos, which has instead built part of its campaign on denouncing the corruption of established parties financed by construction kickbacks.Before Podemos entered the Spanish political scene, Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Errej\u00f3n sat on the board of a Spanish research institute financed by the Venezuelan government.In April 2015, Mr. Monedero resigned from the leadership of Podemos amid ideological differences, but also after he had to pay 200,000 euros (about $227,000 under the current exchange rate) in back taxes and fines for receiving \u20ac425,000 as payment for consulting with the Ch\u00e1vez government in 2010 to develop plans for a new regional currency.Mr. Monedero and other Podemos leaders were never charged with wrongdoing. However, during the recent televised debate, Mr. Rivera, the leader of Ciudadanos, repeated previous allegations that Podemos had relied on Venezuela\u2019s money.\u201cIt is immoral that a foreign regime finances a party,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. A visibly angry Mr. Iglesias responded that it was a \u201cvery serious\u201d offense to accuse his party of illegal financing, particularly since it was an issue that had been already cleared by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court.Mr. Rivera has recently issued the strongest statements over Venezuela during the Spanish election campaign, taking over from Mr. Rajoy, who last month convened his security council to review the safety of the 200,000 Spaniards living under the state of emergency in Venezuela.With the help of Spain\u2019s conservative establishment, the Venezuelan opposition has also made its presence felt in Spain, led by Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a Venezuelan politician who was jailed in February 2014.This month, Ms. Tintori, a former television presenter, gave public speeches in Salamanca and Madrid, hosted by the Popular Party as well as a conservative newspaper, La Raz\u00f3n.\u201cTwo years and three months ago, we came to Spain and other countries and nobody paid attention to us,\u201d she said before an audience that included three ministers from Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, as well as Mr. Rivera.Even as Podemos has distanced itself from Venezuela, it has not joined other parties in condemning Mr. Maduro\u2019s policies. This month, the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the release of Mr. L\u00f3pez and other political prisoners in Venezuela.The lawmakers of Podemos abstained, while those of its ally, the United Left party, voted against the resolution, arguing that it was designed to further destabilize Venezuela.Podemos is making \u201ceconomic proposals clearly similar to those of Venezuela,\u201d Francisco de la Torre D\u00edaz, an economic adviser to Ciudadanos, said.Among those proposals, he said, is \u201cthe idea that it would be worth getting out of the euro.\u201d He also mentioned that Podemos advocates a \u201cmassive increase in public spending,\u201d as well as a plan to nationalize some strategic corporations.Mr. Iglesias has denied having any plan to drop the euro, dismissing warnings by Mr. Rivera and others as fallacious scaremongering.Podemos has gradually watered down its demands for an economic overhaul. Its latest party program seeks an increase in public spending of \u20ac60 billion, less than its previous proposal of \u20ac96 billion.Despite this, some conservative associations have recently been formed to help prevent Podemos from turning Spain into the next Venezuela.\u201cWe want to denounce the situation in Venezuela and warn about what could happen in Spain,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Redondo, the president of an association called Let Us Save Democracy, which was formed in Madrid last year.\u201cWe want Venezuelans to share their experience with Spaniards,\u201d he said, \u201cso as to make voters here, particularly the young, wake up and realize that all the terrible things happening there are now happening here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Campaign Showed How to Turn Viral Moments Into Money", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a serendipitous moment during an otherwise uneventful Bernie Sanders campaign rally in Portland, Ore.: A small bird landed on Mr. Sanders\u2019s lectern mid-speech and locked eyes with him before flying away to applause from an appreciative crowd.As Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters posted photos and videos of the amusing interruption to their social networks, his small digital team sprang into action. They edited the video and pushed it out on Twitter to more than two million followers. They created animated graphics of Mr. Sanders and his new friend, \u201cBirdie,\u201d depicted with a scraggly white coif of hair to match the candidate\u2019s. They sent emails and created Facebook ads asking supporters to donate in exchange for stickers and images of \u201cBirdie.\u201dIn doing so, they turned a viral moment into a small-dollar fund-raising windfall: The Sanders campaign raised $3.6 million in just a few days, all of it from online donations. It was illustrative of the approach the campaign took throughout the Democratic presidential primary, during which it raised roughly $216 million of its nearly $230 million total online.But the campaign was also able to harness social media networks \u2014 which, until recently, most candidates had used primarily for messaging purposes \u2014 and turn them into fund-raising engines, allowing Mr. Sanders\u2019s team to raise money almost exclusively online.\u201cIn those early days, when he had just launched and he was still a novel concept, we were bombarding liberals on social media, people who we thought would like his message, and it was just going gangbusters,\u201d said Keegan Goudiss, the campaign\u2019s director of digital advertising and a partner at Revolution Messaging.Mr. Goudiss said that early on, more than 40 percent of the money being raised was driven by digital ads. And unlike most campaigns he had worked on, where converting supporters into donors was a prolonged process, he said, \u201cwith Bernie, especially early on, people were signing the petition and giving right away.\u201dThe initial success allowed the Sanders campaign to invest much more heavily in its online fund-raising operation and eschew traditional donor events. His team held just nine in-person fund-raisers during the entire campaign and did not have a single staff member dedicated to in-person fund-raising.Though digital advertising costs much less than broadcast, it still requires a significant investment. The campaign spent $15 million on these efforts and had a digital budget of more than $30 million.\u201cTheir campaign spent substantially more building and maintaining a community of online donors,\u201d said Matt Lira, a digital strategist who has worked with Republican candidates. \u201cAs with both Obama and Romney in 2012, this community will echo long past their campaign, creating an advantage for candidates they support.\u201dThe decision to invest heavily, and eventually almost exclusively, in digital advertising was made very early in the campaign.\u201cThe room was silent,\u201d Mr. Goudiss recalled, but Mr. Sanders and his closest advisers recognized the immediate impact. \u201cWe left that meeting with a commitment of $250,000 and a promise for more if we could prove the value of the ads we were placing,\u201d Mr. Goudiss said.They would not have to wait long: Millions of dollars began to flow steadily through the apparatus of the fledgling campaign, propelling Mr. Sanders from a fringe candidate to a cash-rich populist powerhouse who would win 22 primaries and caucuses.The campaign learned early on that digital platforms and social networks were where his supporters could be reached. Mr. Sanders\u2019s digital team made ads for Snapchat, the video messaging service, and tailored their emails and donation pages to a mobile-first audience, efforts that paid off: 43 percent of donations were made from mobile devices.The reach of Mr. Sanders\u2019s online ads also allowed his team to wait before releasing more expensive broadcast ads. In July 2015, for example, a promoted ad on Facebook that focused on health care quickly received 46,000 likes, significantly higher than the normal reach of a post. Ads like this kept the campaign afloat and climbing in the polls for the first six months, and Mr. Sanders did not run a television ad until November.Though the campaign put significant resources behind its online advertising and social media outreach, its email program was still the king in terms of fund-raising, accounting for more than $114 million in donations.\u201cWe scrapped the draft we had, even though there were 200,000 that already got the initial email mid-debate,\u201d said Michael Whitney, a senior strategist at Revolution Messaging who serves as digital fund-raising manager for the Sanders campaign. \u201cWe were out with a new email within 15 to 20 minutes.\u201d The campaign raised $2.5 million in the 24 hours after that debate.The Sanders team was not alone in its ability to capture moments and turn them into money; the Clinton campaign turned Donald J. Trump\u2019s accusation that Mrs. Clinton was playing the \u201cwoman card\u201d into millions of dollars, for example.The online successes point to a new reality for digital campaigning, one that future candidates can expect to build on.\u201cThe bird thing, it\u2019s like, you have this envy of the technology available and their prowess and the moment,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who ran Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign. \u201cIf that had happened in 2004, there is not a damn thing we could have done. Now, you have the prowess to take advantage of it and the network that they built on, and you can do amazing things with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bob Kerrey\u2019s War Record Fuels Debate in Vietnam on His Role at New University", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 The appointment of former Senator Bob Kerrey to lead a new American-backed university in Vietnam has set off a sharp debate among Vietnamese over whether he should be disqualified because of his part in killing women and children as a Navy SEAL during the Vietnam War.\u201cWhile the Vietnamese are willing to let bygones be bygones,\u201d Ton Nu Thi Ninh, Vietnam\u2019s former ambassador to the European Union, said by email, \u201cthe decision to appoint Bob Kerrey to be chairman of the board of the first American-style university in Vietnam strikes me as insensitive to the Vietnamese at best, and taking us for granted at worst.\u201d\u201cIt was not a military victory,\u201d Mr. Kerrey acknowledged in speech then. \u201cIt was a tragedy, and I had ordered it.\u201d\u201cI have been haunted by it for 32 years,\u201d he said.The discussion of Mr. Kerrey\u2019s war history \u2014 which has bubbled up in posts on Facebook and in articles at online news portals \u2014 threatens to reopen old wounds from what is known in Vietnam as the American War. About three million people died in the war, including more than 58,000 Americans.\u201cI cannot look at his face,\u201d Pham Thuy Huong, 40, of Hanoi, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAll the gruesome details of that genocide are still there.\u201dBut since the war ended in 1975, the Vietnamese government and many Vietnamese have adopted an attitude of forgiveness, and that view was also widely represented.\u201cIt is easy to hate Bob Kerrey and ask him to resign as the head of the board of Fulbright University Vietnam,\u201d Luong Hoai Nam, an aviation businessman, wrote in a column in the online newspaper VnExpress. \u201cI can do that. But after a half-day of thinking, I decided on the harder choice. That is to forgive. I forgive Bob Kerrey, and I want many Vietnamese also to forgive him.\u201dResponding to questions by email, Mr. Kerrey said that he would resign if he felt his role was jeopardizing the American-Vietnamese joint education venture.\u201cIf I have cause to believe that remaining chairman puts this project at risk, I will step down,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to admire the Vietnamese people greatly and intend to continue doing all I can to help them.\u201dHe said he had been involved since 1991 in establishing the university, including helping win congressional financing while in the Senate. He said his primary role as board chairman would be helping the university raise money.The university aims to accept its first students in the fall of 2017.Mr. Kerrey was a gung-ho Navy SEAL lieutenant when he led his squad, known as Kerrey\u2019s Raiders, into Thanh Phong on Feb. 25, 1969. Their mission was to hunt down a Viet Cong leader believed to be operating in the village.The squad members first encountered a hut they had not expected. To avoid giving away their position, they used knives to kill five people, witnesses said, slitting the throats of an elderly couple and stabbing their three grandchildren.Although Mr. Kerrey has taken responsibility for ordering the killings as squad leader, he has said he did not participate in them. However two other members of his unit say Mr. Kerrey helped kill the grandfather, later identified as Bui Van Vat, 65.When they reached the main part of the village, they encountered women and children. According to Mr. Kerrey\u2019s account, someone fired on the squad and the commandos returned fire, killing the civilians in the darkness and confusion.\u201cThe baby was the last one alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were blood and guts splattering everywhere.\u201dMr. Kerrey was later wounded on another mission and lost part of a leg. He and his raiders were never held to account for the killings.Mr. Kerrey served as Nebraska\u2019s governor and senator, ran for president in 1992, and retired from elective office in 2000. He served as president of the New School, a university in New York City, from 2001 to 2010.Bao Anh Thai, a lawyer in Ho Chi Minh City, said that leading a university was not the proper place for a man with Mr. Kerrey\u2019s war record.\u201cPlease tell me the name of any prestigious university in this world, where a killer in cold blood of women and children \u2014 he admitted it and he is not charged for it \u2014 could be the president,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\u201cIt is not about the Vietnam War, it is not about reconciliation between the two countries, it is a common sense of education.

{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Partnership Supporters Pin Hopes on Lame-Duck Vote", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The same harsh politics that have spawned obituaries for President Obama\u2019s signature trade agreement between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations could actually help win its ratification in Congress in a lame-duck vote late this year, advocates are hoping.That dynamic, along with recent behind-the-scene developments assuaging some fence-sitters\u2019 concerns \u2013 on Japanese pork subsidies, Mexican labor rights and financial companies\u2019 data, notably \u2014 is keeping hope alive for advocates from the White House to the Republican-controlled Congress, and in pro-trade business and agriculture groups.\u201cRight now you have a president, a majority leader and a speaker who are all pro-trade,\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s trade ambassador, Michael B. Froman, said in an interview, reflecting a seize-the-moment recognition of the changed lineup ahead.He is not alone in that reckoning, although many people in both parties declined to be quoted by name given the tenuous politics of the issue. Besides a new president, the Senate could have a new majority leader next year, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, if Democrats win control, and he is unlikely to promote an issue that so divides the union-friendly party.\u201cThere is a pathway forward here,\u201d Mr. Froman said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re trying to do right now is just maximize the likelihood that we\u2019ll be able to walk down that path successfully.\u201dWhether that is wishful thinking or a real prospect will have to come into focus well before November because supporters would likely need to begin congressional hearings in September to clear the path for a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress after Election Day.And the forces do seem aligned against the pact\u2019s approval.Months ago, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who is pro-trade but worried about keeping Republican seats, ruled out a vote before the election. The so-called T.P.P. would phase out thousands of tariffs, open markets and impose new trade rules, including for labor rights and environmental standards, on signatory nations that span both sides of the Pacific, including Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, Chile and Mexico.Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, House Democrats\u2019 point person on trade, was blunt. \u201cT.P.P. cannot pass this session as negotiated,\u201d he said.\u201cThere were always major problems as they negotiated it,\u201d he added, \u201cso I don\u2019t want people to think it\u2019s simply because of the presidential race.\u201dMrs. Clinton, by her stand, has forsaken the New Democrat trade legacy that her husband as president and now Mr. Obama forged for their less-than-receptive party by introducing labor, human rights and environmental protections into trade agreements.Trade supporters have long counted on action in a lame-duck Congress. But they did not count on Mr. Trump being the nominee. His election could likely doom the accord, T.P.P. advocates concede, by dissuading Republican leaders from advancing an issue their party\u2019s standard-bearer so opposes. But some Republicans do not rule out a vote, because, they say, the deal deserves consideration or because Mr. Trump will not be elected.Mr. Obama, in Vietnam recently, predicted that Congress would ratify the accord. A big reason for administration confidence is that Congress a year ago narrowly voted to give the president so-called trade-promotion authority, which puts T.P.P. on a legislative fast track, ruling out amendments and requiring just 51 votes in the Senate, not 60.And with T.P.P. in hand, supporters are pointing to potential gains for American exporters. \u201cWe think there\u2019s some opportunity to pick up some people, given the specific benefits to their districts,\u201d Mr. Froman said.For example, supporters hope the strong backing of beef producers and other agriculture groups will hold down defections among House Republicans in rural districts who fear Mr. Trump\u2019s backlash.\u201cT.P.P. is going to take our tariff rate from 38\u00bd percent to 9 percent\u201d for American beef sold in Japan, said Kent Bacus, director of international trade for the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association. That would erase Australia\u2019s advantage in Japan since the two nations reached a separate trade agreement last year, costing American exporters roughly $300 million in market share.Agriculture groups will hold pro-T.P.P. events in lawmakers\u2019 districts this summer, Mr. Bacus said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to listen to their constituents. We\u2019re not going away,\u201d he said.Mr. Froman for months has been meeting with lawmakers to address their complaints and with other nations\u2019 trade ministers, to goad their countries to act on their T.P.P. commitments now \u2013 on labor rights, for example \u2013 so that he can reassure Congress\u2019s doubters.Mexico\u2019s president recently sent legislation to his Congress that would address American complaints about its restrictions on unions. Such reforms have been a priority of Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the pro-trade lead Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee responsible for T.P.P., although they are unlikely to satisfy most American unions.Just last week, the administration, the financial services industry and its backers in Congress settled on a policy addressing other nations\u2019 requirements for local storage of companies\u2019 financial data abroad. The administration also has allayed concerns among dairy groups and among pork producers concerned about new subsidies in Japan for its industry.That leaves one main issue to settle, supporters say, over provisions reducing American pharmaceutical companies\u2019 monopoly control of advanced drugs known as biologics. The industry opposes the change and has a prime ally: Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee.In a statement, Mr. Hatch said, \u201cIf the president wants T.P.P. to be approved, he will need to work with Congress to address concerns. I\u2019m hopeful that, at the end of the day, I, along with many of my colleagues, will be able to support a strong T.P.P.\u201dHis House counterpart, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, in a statement extolled the agreement. But he said he would \u201ccontinue to work with the administration to resolve members\u2019 outstanding concerns.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firebombs and Accusations Fly in \u2018Ruthless\u2019 Election Campaigns in Mexico", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Trailing badly in the polls, and with elections just around the corner, Roxana Luna reached for transcendental salvation.In a ceremony outside the government headquarters of Mexico\u2019s Puebla State, Ms. Luna, a candidate for governor, unleashed a troupe of Aztec dancers across the colonial building\u2019s cobblestone forecourt. They hopped around wearing leather skirts and spectacular feather headdresses. One drew designs in the air with smoke from burning tree resin. Another blew a conch shell.Ms. Luna explained to bemused onlookers that the event last week was a purification ritual intended to flush out \u201cthe curse\u201d of bad government, along with fear, coercion, vote buying, apathy and violence.\u201cPeople who feel desperate turn to ritualistic cleansings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been cursed.\u201dIt is election time in Mexico again, with voters going to the polls on Sunday for municipal and regional elections, including the governorships in 12 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states.While some might quibble with Ms. Luna\u2019s technique, few would argue against her appeal to clean up Mexico\u2019s electoral politics. Mexican political campaigns have never been for the faint of heart, and this year has been no different, with rough-and-tumble contests that have made a certain presidential contest north of the border look almost quaint in comparison.The official campaign period in Mexico, which by law lasted only two months and ended on Wednesday, was marked by \u201ca dirty war,\u201d to use the favored term of the Mexican news media and political class. Candidates all over the country have hurled accusations of corruption at one another, including charges of graft and financing by drug traffickers. In the governor\u2019s race in Veracruz, one candidate even accused his main competitor of being a pedophile.Some contests also featured violence and intimidation, including the firebombing of a party leader\u2019s office in Veracruz. Dozens of local and regional candidates withdrew from races, reportedly because of threats from drug traffickers.A lot is at stake. More than 1,300 seats are up for grabs, with the governorships the most important. The outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote could also serve as a prologue for the 2018 presidential election. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party holds nine of the 12 contested governorships, but he is polling lower than any president in the past two decades, and his plummeting popularity could hurt his party\u2019s chances on Sunday.Luis Carlos Ugalde, the director of Integralia Consultores, a political consultancy in Mexico City, said the level of invective and the prevalence of corruption allegations had increased in recent electoral cycles. This year\u2019s tone was \u201cthe most negative\u201d he had seen, he said.The rancor of the current campaigns is likely to influence the tenor of the presidential election, said Mr. Ugalde, who served as president of Mexico\u2019s election commission in the 2000s. \u201cThis could cause a very troubled atmosphere in 2018,\u201d he predicted.Arguably, the most contentious race this year has been for governor in Veracruz, a state wracked by corruption and violence. The front-runners are two cousins who, despite their family ties, have lobbed accusations and insults at each other.H\u00e9ctor Yunes Landa, the candidate for the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party, has accused his opponent, Miguel \u00c1ngel Yunes Linares, the candidate of a coalition between the Democratic Revolution Party and the National Action Party, of being a pedophile, warning voters to \u201ctake care of the safety of your children,\u201d according to local news media. Mr. Yunes Linares, who is trying to break the rival party\u2019s 87-year hold on the state\u2019s governorship, has denied the charges.Officials in Mr. Yunes Linares\u2019s campaign have accused his cousin of vote buying and of underreporting his wealth in a public declaration of his assets.Mr. Yunes Linares\u2019s chances may have improved in light of a recent investigation by the news site Animal Pol\u00edtico, which found that the state\u2019s current administration funneled about $35 million to ghost companies. The governor, Javier Duarte, has denied any wrongdoing.In the northern border state of Tamaulipas, the leading candidates for governor and their parties have been accused of having links to drug cartels.The Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s candidate for governor, Baltazar Hinojosa Ochoa, has been accused of receiving money from the Gulf Cartel during a mayoral run in 2002 in the municipality of Matamoros. He has denied the allegations.Mr. Hinojosa Ochoa\u2019s party has accused his main rival, Francisco Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, the candidate for the National Action Party, of having his own links to organized crime. To support its accusations, the Institutional Revolutionary Party submitted a photo to government investigators showing gunmen riding around in a truck decorated with the symbol of the rival party. A Revolutionary Party official later admitted that the photograph had been taken in another state and, in any case, had been doctored.Candidates for governor in several other states \u2014 including Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa \u2014 have also had to parry accusations of corruption and links to organized crime.The war of words has been punctuated by violent threats and attacks.On Tuesday, a group of armed attackers firebombed the offices of the Veracruz state leader for the National Action Party. \u201cThese are the costs of challenging a corrupt, unscrupulous system,\u201d the party leader, Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Mancha, said in a statement after the bombing.In Puebla, an official from the Institutional Revolutionary Party was wounded in a shooting while he was driving. A party leader, Jorge Estefan Chidiac, blamed the state administration, led by the National Action Party, for the attack, saying it \u201cwas part of a strategy of the state government to destabilize, intimidate and threaten the people of Puebla.\u201d National Action Party officials denied responsibility.In Sinaloa, a candidate for the state legislature said his house had been shot at, and an office linked to the campaign of a mayoral candidate was ransacked by burglars, according to local news media accounts. In Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa, someone spray painted death threats against a candidate for governor on the walls of a university.During a radio interview on Thursday, Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, Mexico\u2019s interior secretary, called the campaign period \u201cthe most ruthless of any electoral processes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand this kind of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in competition, and when there\u2019s an accusation and there are problems, you have to say something.

{"Headline": "Hints of Deal Emerge as Lawmakers Make Late Push in Albany", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byA final announcement seemed just out of reach as the Legislature settled in for a late night on Thursday, the last official day of the 2016 legislative calendar, and lawmakers were told to return on Friday for a final gallop of votes.Still, the silhouette of the package started to appear on Thursday, with lawmakers in serious discussions about supplying extra funding for the State University of New York and the City University of New York and releasing millions in state money for supportive housing for the homeless.For a state capitol that began the legislative session shellshocked by the convictions on corruption charges of two of its most powerful leaders, Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, the most significant action was perhaps the pension-forfeiture measure, which had fizzled last year. The Assembly passed a resolution approving pension forfeiture late Thursday, and the Senate was expected to follow suit on Friday.Yet the ethics deal was also conspicuous for its gaps: Despite discussions early in the session about more ambitious reforms that would limit the income legislators could make from other jobs or even transform the Legislature into a full-time institution, lawmakers could ultimately muster agreement only on what many described as a no-brainer. More than 30 New York elected officials have been forced to leave the Legislature after corruption scandals or other misconduct since 2000.With the major reforms he had proposed struggling to make it out of theoretical territory, Mr. Cuomo suggested a more manageable campaign finance measure that would tighten rules surrounding independent expenditure committees. He was still pushing for it on Thursday evening.The Republican-led Senate approved a broad version of pension forfeiture last year, only for it to wither in the Democrat-dominated Assembly, where some have worried that it could affect members of public-employee unions as well as elected officials.In order to become a constitutional amendment, the resolution must pass both houses this year and after a new Legislature is seated next year. It must then be approved by the voters.The Legislature\u2019s workweek \u2014 which began on Tuesday, because the Jewish holiday Shavuot fell on Monday \u2014 was preceded by a symbolic lowering of expectations from the governor\u2019s office, which issued a letter to lawmakers with six end-of-session priorities.While his administration can claim several major accomplishments from the session, including raising the minimum wage and establishing paid family leave, the scope of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s end-of-session wish list seemed somewhat diminished next to the vision he outlined at his State of the State address in January, which included nearly 150 proposals.Mr. Cuomo seemed to anticipate this unfavorable comparison in his letter. \u201cWith all we have done, we have more to do,\u201d he wrote.\u201cAs the old skeptic\u2019s adage goes, \u2018That\u2019s great, but what have you done for me lately?\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t rest on our laurels.\u201dThe deals he and the legislative leaders struck earlier this week included a package of efforts to combat opioid and heroin addiction, a growing scourge across the state; a push to expand access to mammograms and other methods of breast-cancer detection; and an agreement on improving safety at rail crossings, which carried all the political excitement of, well, rail crossings.Watchdogs, however, fumed that precious time had been spent debating mimosas instead of ethics reforms.But there was much else for lawmakers to consider.Advocates for the homeless were urging the governor and legislative leaders to sign an agreement that would release millions of dollars in state funding for 20,000 supportive-housing units statewide, saying that with lawmakers headed home to campaign for re-election this fall, there was little chance that the deal would materialize after the session ended.Though lawmakers had also promised to revisit an expired tax break, known as 421-a, that was supposed to spur affordable-housing development in New York City, it, too, seemed to be languishing in the end-of-session rush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s Memoir Reveals Tactician\u2019s Approach to Politics", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Once, when Mitch McConnell was dishing privately to me on the congressional crisis of the moment, I thanked him for his candor and insight.\u201cWell,\u201d he said in his distinctive drawl, \u201cyou know I\u2019m only telling you this because it helps me.\u201dI did know. But it also helped me as a reporter. Still, even given my long experience with the canny Kentucky Republican, I was a little surprised to see this frank admission on the first page of his new memoir, \u201cThe Long Game\u201d:\u201cI only talk to the press if it\u2019s to my advantage,\u201d Mr. McConnell wrote, putting it more bluntly than most politicians, even the ones who see it the same way.Mr. McConnell wasn\u2019t always so dismissive of the press. On another occasion, he recounted to me how, as a new senator, he was envious as he watched senior colleagues being shadowed and pestered by reporters, making him yearn for the kind of stature where someone would pay him similar attention. Nowadays, Mr. McConnell will stroll purposefully past inquiring reporters without so much as a glance in their direction.The senator has a steely discipline not only when it comes to the news media, but with life itself. His book chronicles his successful struggle against polio as a child, his first neighborhood fistfight, his early obsession with politics, his embrace of civil rights and his slow but steady climb to the position he always coveted and now holds \u2014 majority leader of the United States Senate. No White House ambition for him, an attribute that separates him from many of his colleagues.The book also has a few surprises. It reveals that young Mitch McConnell favored sporty cars \u2014 a \u201clittle red Corvair,\u201d a 1961 two-seater MG and a 1966 Ford Mustang. He also discloses that he seriously considered not running for re-election in 2014, fearing his could be the defeat that would keep Republicans in the minority. A funny moment occurs when he, as the chairman of the 2001 presidential inaugural, and George W. Bush, the soon-to-be president, briefly panic over the absence of a speaker\u2019s lectern on the inaugural platform, not realizing it would rise from beneath the stage.Then there is a not-so-surprising revelation to those who have watched Mr. McConnell stubbornly refuse to budge from talking points and doggedly spend day after day on the Senate floor hitting the same rehearsed points.\u201cGood politics is repetition,\u201d he writes.Mr. McConnell recognizes that he often plays the villain in the narrative of the contemporary Senate \u2014 the charisma-challenged, die-hard foe of overhauling the campaign finance system and the king of the filibuster. He finds victories in the arcana of legislating, gloating that he was the first to realize he could thwart campaign finance legislation by blocking once-routine motions to open conference committee negotiations with the House.He sees employing such tactics as an obligation, not an obnoxious stalling maneuver.\u201cFilibustering is sometimes presented as an obstructionist tactic by its opponents, but in my view, if legislation as awful as this bill is brought up for consideration, there is a duty to obstruct its passage,\u201d he says.On the other hand, Democrats, led by Mr. McConnell\u2019s archrival, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, were \u2014 in Mr. McConnell\u2019s partisan telling \u2014 guilty of ruining the Senate when they used their numbers and procedural skills to stymie Republicans and push President Obama\u2019s agenda.\u201cIt was utterly depressing to watch what Harry Reid had done to the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell writes. Mr. Reid has since called Mr. McConnell classless for his criticism.Mr. McConnell\u2019s skill as a political tactician belies his low-key manner. Near the end of his book, he recounts another episode I was involved in that led to one of his more memorable political comments.One reason Republicans were not able to capture control of the Senate in 2010 and 2012 was that hard-right conservative challengers had knocked off establishment-favored candidates in party primaries only to fall to Democrats in the general election.Brought into the Republican leader\u2019s office for an interview in March 2014, I asked how he expected the party to fare against another round of threatening primary challenges, including one to his own candidacy in Kentucky.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to crush them everywhere,\u201d Mr. McConnell, not typically known for pungent sound bites, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.\u201dWe proceeded with the interview as I mulled over the comment. I later gave his staff members a heads-up that my article would focus on his bold prediction, a cringe-worthy moment for some of them.Mr. McConnell acknowledges in his book that his staff was uncomfortable, fearing the remark would be seen as a provocative rejection of the Tea Party voters crucial to Republican prospects.\u201cRegardless of how my staff felt about it, I believed what I\u2019d said,\u201d he writes. \u201cI had no animosity toward the Tea Party, because we all wanted to achieve the same things. My problem was with the groups who hijacked their agenda for their own profit.\u201d\u201cAnd I did it,\u201d Mr. McConnell declares proudly about his success in snuffing out threats from the right and finally becoming majority leader after election wins that November.The book ends on that triumphant note, before the rise of Donald J. Trump and the threat his presidential candidacy poses to vulnerable Republican incumbents in the Senate.Mr. McConnell has endorsed Mr. Trump. But he must be concerned that the presumptive nominee\u2019s brash and unpredictable style could now crush Mr. McConnell\u2019s own chances of remaining majority leader.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled, in two places, the name of a politician pictured in 1984 just after he had been elected to the Senate. He is Phil Gramm, not Phil Graham.Advertisement"}

While the timing appears intended to highlight the influence of the mining industry in politics \u2014 Australia\u2019s campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of donations to major parties until months after the fact \u2014 the report does not refer to any contributions in the current election.The report\u2019s primary focus is on the Liberal National Party, led by Campbell Newman, which governed Queensland from 2012 to 2015, and his successor, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Labor Party, who took office there in 2015.Queensland is home to several large and contentious mining projects, including in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland. Two new mines there could add an additional 120 million tons a year to Australia\u2019s thermal coal exports.One of the mines would be Australia\u2019s largest and, environmentalists say, will damage the Great Barrier Reef.The project\u2019s developer, the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in India, donated $52,139 to the Queensland Liberal National Party and to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, from 2012 to 2015, the report said.The report said Adani officials met with Anthony Lynham, the state\u2019s minister for natural resources and mines, at least seven times and had 12 other meetings with state ministers in 2013 and 2014.In late 2014, the government of Queensland agreed to invest up to $220 million in rail and port projects to support the new mine. It also changed the legislation to remove the right of the community to object to mining projects, the report said.After an outcry from scientists and legal action by conservationists, the dredging decision was reversed. The dredge spoils will now be dumped on land.But the report said Adani\u2019s donations had \u201cinfluenced the approval process, encouraging successive governments to ignore concerns regarding their suitability to operate.\u201dMs. Palaszczuk defended her government\u2019s actions, saying it had lowered the reporting requirement for political donations to $738 from $9,458, making government more transparent. And in a written statement, a spokesman for the Queensland government said it had restored laws to allow communities to weigh in on proposed mining projects.The spokesman said the approval process for mining projects was extensive and transparent. It includes public consultation, environmental impact studies and strict conditions to protect the environment. Mine lease applications must also meet public interest requirements.The mines minister for Queensland, Anthony Lynham, was on vacation and was not available for comment. Adnani officials did not respond to a request for comment.The Adani case was just one example cited in the report.Two oil companies, Beach Energy and Linc Energy, and the mining companies Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal also made donations, according to the report, which says the companies received favorable treatment in return. Another company, Sibelco, spent money campaigning to support its sand mining operations ahead of the state election.A spokeswoman for Sibelco, Helen Stanley, said the company had made no direct donations to political parties but had funded an electorate campaign in support of its sand mining operations on North Stradbroke Island. She said the campaign was run in 2013. In 2015, the Palaszczuk government said it would end sand mining on the island by 2019.Beach Energy, Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal did not respond to questions. Linc Energy is in receivership, a company spokeswoman said, adding she could not answer questions about the company\u2019s political donations policy.Over all, the report said, the Queensland Liberal National Party received more than $700,000 in donations from mining companies from 2011 to 2015. The mining industry also donated nearly $2.2 million to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, which now leads the national government, in the five years since July 2011. The Queensland Liberal National Party and the Liberal Party of Australia are not one and the same.The Queensland Labor Party received $68,000 and the federal Labor party received $890,000 from donors connected to the mining industry over the same period.A spokesman for the Liberal Party said in a written reply on Wednesday that he would not comment on a report he had not read, but pointed out that the Australia Institute, a research center, employed former Greens Party supporters in important roles.Large mining projects often require state and federal government approval, especially if threatened species and their habitats are placed under duress by the proposed operation.\u201cThe report demonstrates that money doesn\u2019t just buy access, it buys outcomes,\u201d said Lindy Edwards, a political scientist from the University of New South Wales. She said state laws around political donations should be overhauled, \u201cat the federal level, the secrecy is so bad it is almost impossible to uncover corruption.\u201dDonations to any political party higher than $9,774 must be declared on the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s public register. But those declarations are made months after the money changes hands. Funds donated to the federal Liberal coalition, Labor party or Greens party leading up to national elections on Saturday will not be made public until February 2017.Also, it can be difficult to track how much money and when a donor made a contribution.The report cited the meetings that mining company executives had with senior politicians based on minutes from ministers\u2019 diaries, which are publicly available.\u201cA farmer whose ground water is about to be drawn down or whose land is about to be polluted rarely has the money to secure that sort of access,\u201d Mr. Ogge said.Ms. Edwards said many factors determined whether a mine gained approval. \u201cRoyalties from the mine to the state government, jobs, the state\u2019s economic welfare are all factors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is an issue around ensuring that everyone\u2019s voice is heard. Mining companies should not get better access to government decision makers than people in the community, who are concerned about the environment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watchdog That Shepherded Panama Papers Now Constrained by Finances", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byThe financial pinch has created dual realities for the consortium, damping morale and escalating long-simmering tensions with its parent, even as the impact of the Panama Papers has dramatically increased its global profile.The consortium\u2019s problems also represent a potential setback in the search for new ways to finance and pursue journalism at a time when traditional news organizations, and even new digital operations, are seeking workable business models. In the nonprofit segment of the industry, which has inspired hope as a way forward, it has exposed a particularly hard truth: Financing even the most successful investigative reporting unit is hard and often inconsistent.\u201cYou always want more staff and more funding,\u201d the consortium\u2019s director, Gerard Ryle, said. \u201cBut I have to accept the situation as it is. My job is to get on with things no matter what.\u201dFinancial uneasiness is nothing new for the Center for Public Integrity, which ran yearly operating deficits from 2005 to 2007, and again in 2011.But Bill Buzenberg, who led the center from 2007 to 2015, disputed that assessment, saying that a deficit in general support is not unusual for nonprofits. It becomes a problem, he said, when annual fund-raising from specific programs and objectives declines.\u201cI kept telling them, you have to raise money like crazy this year for next,\u201d Mr. Buzenberg said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that happened.\u201dThe center is expected to raise $9.3 million this year, down from around $11 million last year, Mr. Bale said, noting that grants to the center are often paid out over multiple years.He has had to consider cuts anywhere he can find them, not just at the consortium. The Center for Public Integrity laid off two prizewinning senior investigative reporters of its own in May and is delaying hiring for open positions.The financial woes have strained the relationship between two organizations that David E. Kaplan, who ran the consortium from 2008 to 2011, says have always been awkward partners. The consortium was founded in 1997 as a branch of the center to focus on international investigations, but it quickly developed its own ethos.\u201cThese are two different organizations in culture, structure and methodology,\u201d said Mr. Kaplan, who resigned in protest in 2011 during a period of particular tension between the groups.The differences have only intensified as the consortium has grown under Mr. Ryle, an Irish-born investigative journalist who worked in Australia before taking the position. Its budget has roughly tripled, to almost $2 million this year, and its staff has grown threefold, to about a dozen, including contractors, after the cuts.It has also deliberately moved away from the journalistic model of its parent organization, in search of a more effective way to investigate and distribute stories across borders at a relatively low cost.The Panama Papers also brought a new level of renown to the consortium. And it prompted peers and supporters to wonder whether the organization could provide a model for a segment of the journalism industry particularly hard hit by shrinking budgets and other market forces.\u201cGiven the need to operate within the budgets we have, I.C.I.J. has done an astounding job,\u201d Mr. Bale said of the consortium, adding that he hoped the Center for Public Integrity could incorporate some of its techniques.Mr. Bale acknowledged that tensions between the two groups had increased and might fan the desire by some at the consortium to spin off into a separate organization. That, he said, would be a mistake; the center\u2019s board opposes such a move.Fund-raising could help, and both Mr. Bale and Mr. Ryle said they hoped the consortium\u2019s increased profile would attract support to help stabilize the center\u2019s overall finances.But for now, the cutbacks at the consortium are particularly painful. The group has spent much of the last two weeks moving up five floors from its own offices into the center\u2019s. And though Mr. Ryle said he hoped to be able to hire back some of the contractors he had let go, for now, he said, he would have to make do with less.\u201cIt gives you an enormous amount of freedom in the journalism,\u201d Mr. Ryle said of the nonprofit model, \u201cbut you have to accept that there is a cost sometimes on the other side.\u201dFor Ryan Chittum, one of the three contractors who left last month after more than a year working on the Panama Papers, the timing is as frustrating as it is ironic.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do on that story \u2014 it\u2019s just kind of an unfortunate commentary on the fragility of journalism,\u201d Mr. Chittum said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I make huge dollars, but we don\u2019t have money to do it right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Dropout Army", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHE battle between Gawker and the tech titan Peter Thiel has made him look like a spiteful manipulator with a bully wallet. But this characterization is incomplete. The stakes and ambitions of Mr. Thiel\u2019s back-room lawsuit-jiggering are fairly trivial compared with many of his endeavors \u2014 some stealthy, some gleefully public \u2014 to rewire the world to his liking.For Mr. Thiel, business is never just business. His original vision for PayPal, which he helped found in 1998, was to create \u201ca new world currency, free from all government control and dilution \u2014 the end of monetary sovereignty.\u201d He considered his prescient investment in Facebook, in 2004, as \u201ca means to create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states.\u201dHow seriously should we take this billionaire libertarian who recently signed on to be one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s delegates? As one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most influential investors and talent-spotters, Mr. Thiel says he wants to steer entrepreneurs away from quick-and-profitable apps, toward ambitious, world-changing technology. In the manifesto for his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, he lamented, \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d But is Mr. Thiel capable of meaningfully changing the world \u2014 or even Silicon Valley?Consider his beef against academia. He has two degrees from Stanford \u2014 a B.A. and a J.D. \u2014 but in a conversation with me last year, he compared elite universities to the pre-Reformation Catholic Church. \u201cYou have this priestly class of professors who aren\u2019t doing a whole lot of work, supported by a system dedicated to convincing people to buy indulgences and amass enormous debt for the dubious salvation that a diploma represents,\u201d he said.America\u2019s approximately $1.3 trillion in student debt \u201chas gone mostly to pay for lies that people tell about how great their education was,\u201d he added. He argues that the pressures of financing college often draw the best students into less useful careers like investment banking, \u201cholding back innovation and leading to a technology deficit that could have catastrophic economic consequences.\u201dIn 2010, this would-be Martin Luther announced his solution: The Thiel Fellowship, which each year would offer 20 \u201cuniquely talented\u201d teenagers $100,000 to forgo college and pursue \u201cradical innovation that will benefit society.\u201d Today\u2019s future Zuckerbergs shouldn\u2019t be wasting time in lecture halls and football stadiums; they should be building businesses.The idea is, according to Larry Summers, a former president of Harvard, \u201cthe single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade.\u201d Yes, there is a need for reform, Mr. Summers told me recently, \u201cbut the idea of using philanthropic dollars to bribe people to drop out of college is a very dangerous one.\u201dFellows were selected via a competition that culminated in a two-minute pitch to Mr. Thiel and a team of judges \u2014 a gentler version of \u201cShark Tank.\u201d The winning dropouts included the 17-year-old biology prodigy Laura Deming, who had entered M.I.T. at 14 with the goal of eliminating aging-related disease \u2014 a pursuit that has become one of Mr. Thiel\u2019s core personal and investment interests. \u201cIt\u2019s theoretically possible for humans to live for hundreds of years,\u201d Ms. Deming told the judges. \u201cI want to figure out how.\u201dThese fellows were an impressive lot; they drew on their benefactor\u2019s connections to capitalize projects that ranged from cancer immunotherapy to a device for synthesizing genomes to artificial neural networks that can \u201cdream.\u201d\u201cPeter Thiel promised flying cars, we got caffeine spray instead,\u201d wrote the technology writer and entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa.To have a lasting impact, Mr. Thiel must move past the first iteration of Silicon Valley and toward the hardware and science revolutions that will usher in Silicon Valley 2.0. We already have enough OKCupids. We don\u2019t have enough of the desperately needed inventions \u2014 nuclear fusion energy or cancer cures \u2014 that emerge when credentialed scientists tinker away for years on expensive machines that have nothing to do with Snapchat. Of course, this sort of tinkering most often happens in the academic institutions that Mr. Thiel reviles, despite their role in the foundational breakthroughs \u2014 such as the internet \u2014 that enabled Mr. Thiel to build his $2.7 billion fortune.As his fellowship program matures, each class begins to look a little more like the creator himself; there are fewer ambitious research projects, and more of the kind of tech start-ups that fed Mr. Thiel\u2019s appetite for investing. Such a drift may have been inevitable. But there\u2019s also the fact that hard science is \u2026 well, hard.\u201cIt\u2019s true that civilization won\u2019t get to the next level if we\u2019re just doing thin software solutions,\u201d Mr. Thiel acknowledged. \u201cBut we need to consider not just whether an idea can change the world, but also whether it\u2019s feasible and has a clear path to market.\u201dMr. Thiel\u2019s fellow PayPal founder, Elon Musk, has managed to do both, parlaying his dot-com profits into space exploration, solar power and electric cars.Then again, if Mr. Thiel\u2019s role is limited to provocateur, that may not be a bad thing. It may be enough that he is forcing conversations \u2014 about news media misbehavior, about the costs and benefits of higher education, about the shape of future societies \u2014 that we need to have.\u201cEven if the fellowship has been just a $15 million P.R. campaign to get parents to think more cogently about their investments in their children\u2019s futures,\u201d said Dale J. Stephens, a Thiel Fellow who founded an experiential learning program called UnCollege, \u201cthen I think it\u2019s been wildly successful.\u201dOf all Mr. Thiel\u2019s social-engineering enthusiasms, one I would have most loved to see play out is Seasteading, an initiative to create libertarian utopias on artificial islands in the middle of oceans. In 2008 Mr. Thiel and the activist Patri Friedman founded the Seasteading Institute, with the goal of building these communities. Seasteading, Mr. Thiel wrote, could \u201ccreate a new space for freedom\u201d where entrepreneurial leaders, working beyond the reach of governments and their pesky laws, could take society forward.Recently Mr. Thiel suggested that he\u2019d gone cold on Seasteading, because of cost and practicality. Unmentioned was the possibility that the experiment would have come to an ideologically inconvenient conclusion: that a small island \u2014 whether created by nature or man \u2014 would be an astonishingly bad place to live without rules.Perhaps there are some conversations Mr. Thiel would rather not push too far.Advertisement"}

Feinberg, the secretive financier and founder of Cerberus Capital Management, and Peter Kalikow, the politically connected real estate magnate. Neither man had publicly announced his support for the Republican presidential candidate and presumptive party nominee, until now.The joint Republican National Committee and Trump fund-raiser will take place on Tuesday, at an undisclosed location in the city, according to an invitation seen by The New York Times. Tickets are going for $50,000 a person, though the hosts are paying $250,000 a couple. Additional details, the invitation said, will be disclosed when a reservation for a seat is made.With enormous coffers, hedge fund and private equity founders have become some of the biggest political donors in this election. Some of these executives have already pumped tens of millions of dollars into \u201csuper PACs\u201d supporting candidates, often with the hope of helping to shape the views of the political candidates they have backed.Other hosts of the fund-raiser next week will include the distressed-debt specialist Wilbur L.

The only problem, he said, is that he is most likely to find his opportunities limited in part because of his outsider status as an African-American, and a Muslim, in the world of classical music.\u201cThere is greater openness in Germany,\u201d he said over Thai food in Manhattan recently. \u201cI had hoped that by working abroad and doing so well, that would translate into more opportunities from where I\u2019m from.\u201d\u201cA lot of people say \u2018diversity is great,\u2019 and those are all nice taking points,\u201d he added. \u201cBut as far as making sure the opportunities are given to everyone \u2014 that still falls quite short.\u201dThat is why he jumped at the chance when the Westchester Philharmonic contacted him more than a year ago about conducting Brahms\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Mozart\u2019s \u201cJupiter\u201d Symphony. The concert would provide the opportunity to conduct a first-rate regional orchestra in the core repertory, which he said some orchestras were patronizingly reluctant to offer minority guest conductors.\u201cIt\u2019s just a straight program,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said yes. I love to do that.\u201dAlso this month, the New York State Council on the Arts has been holding events around the state, including in New Rochelle, where it has been promoting a new diversity initiative, Arts Career Development Fellowships for Underrepresented Communities. Under it, financing is available to arts organizations to hire diverse administrative staff members or creative artists.\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of urgency in the music community among those concerned about those issues,\u201d said Robert Baron, the arts council\u2019s director of music and folk arts programs.The council\u2019s meetings follow two conferences, convened this spring, at which those who work in the arts discussed increasing orchestras\u2019 diversity. At the April conference, Mr. Baron said, Joshua Worby, executive director of the Westchester Philharmonic, made a compelling case for taking immediate action by recruiting diverse guest artists.Mr. Baron said of Mr. Worby, \u201cHe has been a strong advocate and voice for diversity and addressing it right now.\u201dMr. Worby said that the lack of diversity reflected \u201cpassivity by well-intended people of good will who don\u2019t necessarily see or understand how lack of action, or failure to be proactive, can be part of the problem.\u201dThe Westchester Philharmonic\u2019s roster of 59 musicians, he said, includes three African-Americans and four Latinos, which translate into percentages that are higher than the League of American Orchestras\u2019 averages. But turnover is slow, Mr. Worby said.Since becoming executive director in 2006, he has recruited a diverse group of guest artists. The black artists include three singers, four instrumentalists and three conductors: Chelsea Tipton III, Kwam\u00e9 Ryan and Mr. Abdullah. The Latinos include the conductors Alondra de la Parra, Tito Mu\u00f1oz and Jorge Mester. A principal conductor, Jaime Laredo, is from Bolivia.Mr. Laredo, who was guest conductor twice before becoming a principal in the 2014-15 season, is a prominent figure on the classical music scene; signing him has been a boon to the orchestra. The other diverse artists, among them up-and-coming musicians, have been readily accepted by orchestra members and audiences alike, Mr. Worby said.Mr. Abdullah\u2019s booking makes sense musically, Mr. Worby said, given his work with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, in Aachen and as a guest conductor with the likes of the Cincinnati and Pittsburgh symphonies. It also strikes a blow for diversity and, with Mr. Goldstein on board, for pairing artists who come from communities who are in conflict elsewhere in the world.Mr. Worby, speaking before the massacre in Orlando occurred, repeated remarks made by Leonard Bernstein after he conducted Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony in the days following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy: \u201cThis will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.\u201dThe matching of Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Goldstein seems a promising one. They share training, having both attended the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. In separate interviews, they expressed similar ideas about interpreting the Brahms concerto, both likening it to a kind of chamber music rather than a showpiece for a soloist. And both said they were eager to get to work.But beyond the Westchester concert, Mr. Abdullah said he had no concerts booked in the United States. All of his guest-conducting for the 2016-17 season will be in Europe and Asia \u2014 a fact he wryly characterized in an unsolicited email, sent while he was in an airport waiting for a plane to visit his mother in Indiana in the run-up to the Westchester concert, as \u201cvery interesting.\u201d\u201cI do not know and cannot say if that has any relevance,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I will say that I am grateful for the Westchester Phil giving me the chance to work in my own country, and the chance to do a nice program, with a great soloist. Kudos to Mr. Worby.\u201dAn article in some editions last Sunday about efforts to improve diversity in the Westchester Philharmonic included an incorrect figure from the League of American Orchestras for the percentage of Latinos in American orchestras.

{"Headline": "After 147 Years, Goldman Sachs Hangs a Shingle on Main Street", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byYou used to need $10 million to become a customer of Goldman Sachs.Now you can get in with a dollar.At a time when many storied firms on Wall Street are asking themselves profound questions \u2014 such as, What does it mean to be a Wall Street firm in this day and age? \u2014 one of the most elite institutions in the business is opening an old-fashioned, deposit-taking bank catering to the little saver.It is the crystallization of an extraordinary moment in the halls of American finance. Goldman, like other marquee banking companies, is hunting for new business as its traditional ones falter. Regulations rolled out since the 2008 financial crisis have put a crimp in deal-making, Wall Street\u2019s traditional expertise. The high-powered bond trading desks that generated most of Goldman\u2019s precrisis profits now make only a fraction of what they did before.Over the last year, Goldman executives have been preparing to introduce 401(k) accounts, loans for people saddled with credit card debt and new investment funds that can be purchased by anyone with an E-Trade account. It will all be online only. In fact, Goldman thinks one of its advantages will be that it does not have the historical baggage \u2014 read, expense \u2014 of traditional branches and tellers.All of this has prompted some head-scratching in the industry, given that Goldman has so little experience in the hotly competitive field of retail banking. Not least among the challenges: Getting Americans to warm to a bank that has been maligned as a symbol of Wall Street greed during the 2008 crisis.At least one new customer dismissed that worry. \u201cOf course they get blamed for stuff,\u201d said Daniel Sigal, a 24-year-old college student in the Los Angeles area who calls himself a Wall Street hopeful. But \u201cGoldman Sachs is the Nike of finance,\u201d he said \u2014 a brand everyone knows. Its foray into banking is \u201cvery, very positive,\u201d he said.He also liked the 1.05 percent interest rate on savings accounts that Goldman offered, which dwarfed the 0.01 percent he was getting from Wells Fargo. The average is 0.54 percent, according to Bankrate.comGoldman will have to pull in many people like Mr. Sigal to make even a tiny difference in its annual revenue, which tends to be measured in the tens of billions of dollars.The senior Goldman executive overseeing all of this said that none of these businesses were lines that he could have imagined the firm getting involved in even five years ago. \u201cWe had an opportunity to take a clean sheet of paper and draw out what we might do,\u201d said that executive, Stephen Scherr, the chief of strategy for Goldman and the chief executive of its federally insured bank.Before the crisis, Goldman did not even have a federally insured bank; it was forced to open one as a condition of receiving bailout funds during the financial crisis. Initially, the bank was viewed by executives as a drag. More recently, though, Goldman has come to view the bank as one of its brightest opportunities.\u201cOver the years, it became clear that the bank had greater potential to help grow the firm,\u201d Mr. Scherr said.Behind the scenes, Goldman executives have been debating how far they want to expand their new retail offerings and if they eventually want to end up with something that would look more like a full-service online bank. The company is in the earliest stages, and it could back off if the initial experiments fail.So far, interest has been strong. Mr. Scherr said that the bank had opened tens of thousands of new accounts in its first few weeks, in addition to the 150,000 accounts it acquired from GE Capital. (Goldman bought the online banking arm of General Electric\u2019s financial services subsidiary this year, acquiring about $16 billion in deposits as part of the deal.)Goldman\u2019s\u2019 way forward is likely to be anything but easy, even with billions backing it. It faces lots of entrenched competitors and has almost no experience in the human elements of this kind of banking, such as customer service.Goldman is betting that its investments in technology will help it take advantage of big changes in the financial industry over the last five years, during which banks have moved away from a business model based on relationships and branches and toward one that is more reliant on smartphones and software.Mr. Scherr said that Goldman was looking broadly at businesses where it could use its technology to provide a cheaper banking product. He cited small-business lending as a particularly attractive area for potential expansion, calling it \u201cripe for technology disruption.\u201dThe strategy of offering what are essentially discount financial products is a somewhat unexpected one for Goldman, given that it has long been known as the most upscale firm on Wall Street. This is somewhat like Maserati making a push into the motorized bicycle market. But the offerings, if successful, could provide a valuable public perception payoff for Goldman by softening the firm\u2019s image as a remote bastion of power and wealth.The first big test will come later this year when Goldman starts offering a lending product targeting people who need relatively small personal loans of around $15,000 to $25,000. Overseeing that effort is an executive hired from the credit card company Discover, Harit Talwar, who runs a team of about 50 people working on the so-called Mosaic project on the 26th floor of Goldman\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. Many of the employees are coders working on sophisticated ways to gauge the credit quality of potential borrowers.Last fall, Goldman introduced its first low-cost exchange-traded funds, which are managed according to computer algorithms and can be purchased through any brokerage account. Then, a few months back, Goldman purchased a small start-up, Honest Dollar, that offers inexpensive accounts for retirement savings, aimed at freelancers and other part-time workers in the so-called gig economy.Mr. Sidhu, of BankMobile, said he was not expecting big things but was watching with curiosity. \u201cIf Goldman wants to be a retail bank for every six-pack Joe, I wish them a lot of luck, because they will need it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How China Fell Off the Miracle Path", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOpinionFOR years now, Donald J. Trump has been sounding the alarm on China, calling it an economic bully that has been \u201ceating our lunch.\u201d The crux of Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep it cheap and give Chinese exports an unfair advantage. But that narrative is so last decade. China is now a threat to the United States not because it is strong but because it is fragile.Four key forces have been shaping the rise and fall of nations since the 2008 financial crisis, and none of them bode well for China. Debts have risen dangerously fast in the emerging world, especially in China. Trade growth has collapsed everywhere, a sharp blow to leading exporters, again led by China. Many countries are reverting to autocratic rule in an effort to fight the global slowdown, none more self-destructively than China. And, for reasons unrelated to the 2008 collapse, growth in the world\u2019s working-age population is slowing, and turned negative last year in China, depleting the work force.It will be difficult for any country to grow as rapidly as 6 percent, and all but impossible for China. Nevertheless, in an effort to exceed that target, Beijing is pumping debt into wasteful projects, and digging itself into a hole. The economy is now slowing and will decelerate further when the country is forced to reduce its debt burden, as inevitably it will be. The next step could be a deeper slowdown or even a financial crisis, which will have global repercussions because seven years of heavy stimulus have turned the world\u2019s second largest economy into a bloated giant.In Beijing, confidence has given way to a case of nerves. Local residents often sense trouble coming before foreign investors and are the first to flee before a crisis. Chinese moved a record $675 billion out of the country in 2015, some of it for purchases of foreign real estate. If China were eating America\u2019s lunch, its people would not be rushing to buy safe-haven apartments in New York or San Francisco. Far from conspiring to cheapen its currency, as Mr. Trump charges, Beijing is struggling to keep the weakening renminbi from falling more, which would further erode local confidence and make a crisis more likely.The seeds of China\u2019s current problems were planted in the months after the global economic crisis of 2008. When I visited Beijing in September of that year, just before the Wall Street implosion, the country\u2019s economy was slowing, but the city was calm. Beijing had hosted the Summer Olympics, and in preparation had temporarily shuttered smokestack industries and eased censorship. The skies were clear, the conversation much more candid than it is today.The nation had good reason to feel confident. Like Japan, South Korea and other Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economies, China had generated a long run of double-digit growth by investing in export industries. But Wen Jiabao, then prime minister, was not complacent. He was warning that after three decades of heavy industrialization, China was \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201cunbalanced,\u201d with too many factories belching too much smog. Many prominent Chinese recognized that with per-capita income rising above $8,000, their nation would face a natural slowdown, as Japan and South Korea had when they reached a similar middle-income level. Meanwhile, among outsiders, there was hopeful talk of how China would evolve into a democracy as it grew richer \u2014 again following the path of earlier Asian miracles.Then, two weeks after I left, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States, tipping the global economy into recession. Demand collapsed across the world, crushing export growth in China. The leadership in Beijing panicked, apparently fearing that if the recession reached its shores, social unrest would follow. Mr. Wen reversed course and doubled down on the old industrial model \u2014 fueling investment in factories with trillions in state lending and spending.At first, the bet appeared to work. In 2009, China managed once again to beat its longstanding growth target of 8 percent, as the West struggled to recover from its deep recession. The rapid spending unleashed by Beijing contrasted sharply with the relative gridlock in Washington and the global elite, gathering for their annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, in 2011, marveled at the benefits of state capitalism. China, they said, was proving that unchecked autocracies had an advantage in managing the economy, particularly in a crisis.But looking back, we can see that this was the moment China began to fall off the miracle path.As its debt mania progressed, more of the lending was diverted into wasteful speculation. Normally, frenzied borrowing occurs amid excitement about a new innovation like the internet. But this spree spread on conviction that Beijing, obsessed with hitting its growth target, would not let lenders or borrowers fail. More and more unqualified players got in the game. The state banks soon had to compete with \u201cshadow banks,\u201d including crowdfunding websites that offered ordinary people a chance to invest in debt for as little as one renminbi (15 cents), promising fantastic returns.Try as the Chinese authorities might to steer the money into industry, they could never fully commit to stopping shadow banks from financing an increasingly questionable array of borrowers speculating in real estate. When I visited Shanghai in August 2010, I was stunned to see apartment blocks rising two to three rows deep all along the 110-mile route to Hangzhou. Many of the biggest debtors are front companies set up by local governments to evade national regulators. Small cities are borrowing to build futuristic museums, aquatic centers and apartment blocks that exceed local demand and are often as empty as ghost towns.My research shows that during the 30 worst debt manias of the past 50 years, private debt \u2014 which in China is often held by local governments \u2014 rose over five years by at least 40 percentage points as a share of gross domestic product. In all 30 cases, the economy slowed sharply, typically by more than half, in the next five years.China\u2019s mania is now the largest ever in the postwar emerging world. After holding steady at around 150 percent of G.D.P. for much of the boom, China\u2019s public and private debts surged after Mr. Wen\u2019s about face in 2008, rising to 230 percent of G.D.P. by 2014. That 80-percentage-point increase is also more than three times the increase in the United States before its bubble collapsed in 2008. Since then, United States debt has held steady as a share of its economy. Though many Americans still think the nation is drowning in debt, its burden is much less worrisome than China\u2019s because it is not growing.Paradoxically, the authoritarian form of government that helped guide China to those years of economic growth may now be undermining its economic stability. My research suggests that compared with democracies, autocracies generate far more unstable growth, and that\u2019s the risk in China now. Looking at the available records going back to 1950 shows that extreme swings between fast and slow growth are much more common under autocratic regimes. On a list of 36 countries that have been whipsawed between rapid growth and recession throughout the postwar era, three out of four were autocracies.Because these governments face no check on their powers, they can force feed periods of strong growth. But they can also veer off in the wrong direction with no one to set them straight. In the early stages of China\u2019s boom under Deng Xiaoping, Beijing did what authoritarian governments do best, suppressing opposition to breakneck development, steering the people\u2019s savings toward building export factories and commandeering land to build the roads and bridges to bring the manufactured goods to market. But the same decision-making process, centralized in a small circle in Beijing, allowed the government to impulsively shift course in 2008 and push through the lending campaign that put China on the increasingly unstable path of more debt, and less growth.ON my recent trips to China, I keep looking for Beijing to snap back to reality, but in vain. As the economy grows more unstable, the authorities have tried to control the business cycle with an increasingly heavy hand that extends into its financial markets. In late 2014, hoping to give its struggling companies a new lift, Beijing began to praise buying stocks as a patriotic act. Millions of ordinary Chinese signed up to play the market for the first time, many unaided by a high school degree, and started borrowing to buy shares as prices rose. When the bubble burst last June, Beijing did not let it implode, as it had in 2008. It ordered people not to sell or even to speak critically of stocks. The market collapsed anyway.Afterward the Davos crowd finally started to question whether Beijing could simply command its economy to grow. It looked as if the lesson might be learned in China, too, but when I visited this April, authorities had begun a new stimulus campaign, and debt was still growing three times faster than the economy. Against this backdrop, residents spoke of dizzying price rises in Shanghai and Beijing real estate and in obscure markets like steel rebar futures. Their intention was to keep dancing until the borrowed money stopped flowing.The sputtering global economy is one shock away from slipping into recession. In the postwar period, every previous global recession started with a downturn in the United States, but the next one is likely to begin with a shock in China. Through heavy stimulus, China was the largest contributor to global growth this decade, but it is fragile. China\u2019s miracle growth period is over, and it now faces the curse of debt.Ruchir Sharma is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

They toiled under the direction of Gutzon Borglum, the designer and chief engineer, and his son Lincoln, and their names are listed at the monument as part of a team effort.Cameron Sholly, the director of the Midwest region for the National Park Service, which includes South Dakota, said that when he assumed the position last year he began reassessing Del Bianco\u2019s role at the request of the carver\u2019s 53-year-old grandson Lou.Correspondence provided by Lou Del Bianco, who lives in Port Chester, and research by park service historians, convinced Mr. Sholly that for whatever reason, Luigi Del Bianco\u2019s contribution had been overlooked.\u201cHe is worth any three men I could find in America, for this particular type of work,\u201d Borglum wrote, in documents that Lou Del Bianco and an uncle, Caesar Del Bianco, discovered at the Library of Congress. \u201cHe is the only intelligent, efficient stone carver on the work who understands the language of the sculptor.\u201dDel Bianco was born in 1892 aboard a ship near Le Havre, France, as his parents were returning to Italy from the United States. Raised in Meduno, northeast of Venice, he studied stone carving in Vienna and Venice starting when he was 11. He immigrated to Vermont when a cousin wrote that skilled carvers were in demand there.He returned to fight for Italy in World War I, went back to Vermont in 1920 and finally settled in Port Chester, where a fellow carver introduced him to Borglum, who hired him to work at his studio in North Stamford, Conn., as well as to his future wife, Nicoletta Cardarelli.Del Bianco and Borglum worked together briefly on the Confederate Memorial on Stone Mountain in Georgia, and on the Wars of America Memorial in Newark (Del Bianco was a model for a number of the figures). In 1933, Del Bianco was recruited to Mount Rushmore, eventually as chief carver at $1.50 an hour, or $72 a week. (He quit twice when financing ran out.)As chief carver, his priority was refining the facial expressions on the presidents\u2019 60-foot-high heads. He fixed a foot-deep crack in Jefferson\u2019s lip with a patch and he sculpted Lincoln\u2019s eyes, highlighting the pupils with wedge-shaped granite stones to reflect the light.\u201cI know every line and ridge, each small bump and all the details of that head so well,\u201d he told The Herald Statesman of Yonkers in 1966.In 1941, the elder Borglum died, financing dried up, plans to carve the torsos of the presidents to the waist were abandoned and Del Bianco returned to Port Chester, where his company carved hundreds of tombstones. He died in 1969 at 78 of silicosis, which is caused by inhaling dust from crushed stone.\u201cThe doctors were amazed that he lived as long as he lived,\u201d his daughter Gloria told National Public Radio in 2012, \u201cbecause the dust in his lungs was like a rock.\u201dA campaign by Luigi\u2019s son Caesar to rectify the official oversight began in the late 1980s after he read Rex Allen Smith\u2019s \u201cThe Carving of Mount Rushmore,\u201d in which his father\u2019s role was ignored. Caesar, who died in 2009, enlisted his nephew Lou.Mr. Gladstone, the author of \u201cCarving a Niche for Himself,\u201d said that was like writing about the Yankees without mentioning Joe DiMaggio.\u201cAfter years of being dismissive to the family, the agency at last did the right thing,\u201d Mr. Gladstone said.The recognition on Facebook was also welcomed by Joseph Scelsa, the founder and president of the Italian American Museum in Manhattan.\u201cAfter 25 years, the National Park Service has finally acknowledged that Luigi Del Bianco was in fact the chief carver,\u201d Lou Del Bianco said. \u201cPermanent recognition at the mountain is what we are really after, but this is a breakthrough and a start in the right direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is Just the Start of the Brexit\u2019s Economic Disaster", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 A few weeks before Britons voted on whether to remain part of the European Union, Michael Gove, one of the leaders of the Leave campaign, was asked why he should be trusted over the overwhelming number of economists and international authorities who opposed Brexit. \u201cPeople in this country have had enough of experts,\u201d he replied.Experts are, of course, known to make mistakes. But in this case, the people who voted for Brexit will pay a big price for ignoring economic expertise. The harmful effects of this vote are both immediate and lasting.Britons are already worse off. The pound has \u2014 so far \u2014 plunged by nearly 9 percent against the dollar, slashing the value of British assets, with higher import prices likely to follow. The stock market has also taken a hit. The prices of property, most British people\u2019s main asset, are almost certain to fall, too. While Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has already pledged 250 billion pounds (about $345 billion) to support the financial system and has said he could offer more if necessary, central bankers cannot protect against an enduring economic shock.Rarely have businesses faced such uncertainty. Britain\u2019s economy had already slowed as they put investment decisions on hold ahead of the referendum. Now, a country renowned for its political and legal stability is descending into chaos. The future prime minister is unknown, as is the direction his or her policies will take. The favorite to replace David Cameron, Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who opportunistically campaigned for Brexit, styles himself as pro-market and pro-globalization, but in the lead-up to the vote he said he supports curbs on European Union migration, tariffs on Chinese steel and higher public spending. The future terms on which Britain will trade with both the European Union and all the countries with which it has negotiated trade deals on Britain\u2019s behalf are uncertain. Domestic regulations on everything from finance to environmental protection may change.All that uncertainty is amplified by the prospect of a second referendum on Scottish independence, which may this time be won. In Northern Ireland, the political party Sinn Fein has already called for a referendum on a united Ireland.Faced with such uncertainty, businesses are likely to continue to put investments on hold. Consumers may pull back, too. The resulting downturn will cause the government\u2019s budget deficit, already large, to swell. The pound\u2019s depreciation, which might have been expected to boost exports, is unlikely to do much to cushion the blow. Its huge decline in 2008 failed to boost exports and Brexit will dent them.This unpredictable situation will not be brief. Once triggered, the formal process of leaving the European Union is supposed to take two years. But extricating the union\u2019s second-biggest economy from 43 years of European Union legislation is a daunting task.Negotiating a new trade relationship with the European Union is equally tricky. Britain seems certain to lose access to the single market \u2014 with which it does nearly half its trade \u2014 because this is conditional on accepting the free movement of people and contributing to the European Union\u2019s budget. (These were key issues for pro-Brexit voters.) That will jeopardize the foreign investment and good jobs predicated on single-market membership. Britain-based financial institutions will lose their rights to operate freely across the European Union.Brexit\u2019s supporters are deluded when they argue that Britain could cherry pick what it likes about the European Union and discard the rest. Since exports to the European Union (13 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) matter much more to Britain than exports to Britain (3 percent of G.D.P. in 2014) do to the European Union, the European Union will call the shots. Other governments have every incentive to be tough, both to steal a competitive advantage and to deter others from following Britain out the door.A fallback position is trading with Europe on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, as the United States does. But that entails tariffs on good exports \u2014 up to 10 percent on car exports, for example, most of which go to the European Union \u2014 as well as non-tariff barriers that gum up trade. It offers little access to Europe\u2019s markets in services, in which Britain specializes. Less open markets will stunt competition, crimping productivity growth and living standards.Brexit\u2019s supporters claim that a deregulated Britain that trades with the rest of the world would prosper once unshackled from Brussels\u2019s overregulation and protectionism. But Britain has the least regulated labor markets in the European Union and the second-least regulated product markets, so any potential benefits from deregulation are likely to be meager. Moreover, Britain is likely to end up with worse access to markets in the rest of the world. While it won\u2019t be hamstrung by protectionist interests in the European Union, its relatively smaller economy, largely open markets and desperation for new deals will weaken its clout in trade negotiations.The young, the higher educated and city dwellers, the most dynamic members of Britain\u2019s economy, voted to Remain. They were outvoted by the old, the less educated and non-urban English, who often rely on taxpayer largess. With economic opportunities stunted, everyone will suffer for Leave voters wrongly blaming hard-working, taxpaying European migrants for everything they dislike about modern Britain and wrongly trusting economic charlatans like Mr. Gove.Philippe Legrain is the author of \u201cEuropean Spring: Why Our Economies and Politics Are in a Mess and How to Put Them Right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veterans Use Battlefield Experiences to Build Businesses", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byAfter years of operating within a regimented chain of command, many veterans are ready to become their own bosses. Many would-be business owners are finding that the skills and experiences honed in the military are directly translating into start-up ideas.These veterans are adapting tools and strategies they learned during their service for civilian applications, and some have been inspired to start companies to address problems they witnessed on the battlefield.Veterans have a long tradition of starting businesses. Nearly 50 percent of World War II veterans owned and operated businesses after leaving military service, according to research from the Institute for Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University.Some of that could be a result of the emphasis that transition programs have made. In Mr. Scheel\u2019s experience, headhunters tried to place junior officers like himself in finance, consulting or manufacturing jobs, even though he had no interest in these sectors.In 2011, during the Arab Spring, Mr. Scheel was stationed in Djibouti, where he used a military tool called Blue Force Tracking. The system uses GPS to track soldiers\u2019 locations in real time.Two years later, Mr. Scheel had finished his service and was working for a large construction company in a copper mine in northern Chile when he realized he could adapt the concept behind Blue Force Tracking to improve efficiency on construction sites.Construction had fascinated Mr. Scheel since his boyhood days in Cincinnati, when his father sold construction equipment in four states. Traditionally, foremen log hours in notebooks that are then transcribed to timecards, which are entered manually into a computer and finally audited at a later stage.The mobile application developed by Rhumbix allows workers to submit timesheets through their smartphones, and foremen can approve them instantly. This information, often combined with workers\u2019 phone GPS data, helps foremen analyze how much work was done where. They can also pinpoint the locations of delays, allowing them to improve efficiency.For instance, during the construction of prefabricated bathrooms as part of a recent expansion of Riverside Community Hospital in Southern California, foremen used Rhumbix to reorganize how and where they set out building materials. This decreased the number of trips needed for workers to fetch materials and cut the overall construction time for each bathroom by 75 percent.Rhumbix has tested its mobile tools on 20 construction projects in California, Colorado, Texas and South Carolina, and will introduce its first commercial product in July. The company, which is based in San Francisco, now has 24 employees and has raised $7 million in financing.Other veterans have developed business ideas to help the military directly. For Doug Moorehead, a former Navy Seal from Cambridge, Ohio, the number of soldiers killed while escorting fuel convoys in Iraq motivated him to start a business.Fuel was a precious resource, which also made those transporting it prime targets for insurgents. In Iraq, one soldier was injured or killed for every 39 fuel convoys, according to the Army Environmental Policy Institute, which is part of the military.\u201cI needed to find a way to reduce the number of soldiers, sailors and Marines in harm\u2019s way on the battlefield,\u201d Mr. Moorehead said.His experiences led him to develop a hybrid generator that runs more efficiently. His new generators use 50 to 70 percent less fuel than previous models.Several oil and gas companies have already purchased FlexGen generators, and the company is currently in discussions with various hospitals and mining companies around the world.While he and others have started growing businesses, many veterans have found few contacts and role models to help them get started.In the last two years, however, many more resources have become available to aspiring veteran entrepreneurs. In 2013, the federal Small Business Administration introduced a national program called \u201cBoots to Business,\u201d a two-day introduction to entrepreneurship followed by an eight-week online course.About 42,000 people have taken the two-day introductory class, which is offered on 200 military installations around the world, and 3,300 have taken the longer course.The S.B.A. also helps veterans find the right local contacts to navigate the process of getting clearance if their new business ventures are closely linked to their service and contain classified information from that context.Several new nonprofit organizations, like Patriot Boot Camp and Bunker Labs, also help veterans find mentors, investors and other entrepreneurs. Many of these groups grew out of start-up accelerators.Veteran-run start-ups also have a special understanding of how to help those in the military adjust to civilian work.\u201cWhen you\u2019re no longer in the trenches and no one is shooting at you, how you speak to people has to change,\u201d Mr. Dunnigan said.The chaplain, a familiar feature in any military unit, spends time addressing this topic with new employees through an internal program named \u201cFrom the Man to a Man.\u201d He also functions as a \u201cbeacon of calm,\u201d Mr. Dunnigan said, for some veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder.The top-down nature of the military has helped some veterans develop businesses that require creating order from chaos.During 13 years in the Air Force, two of those as a major, Angela Cody-Rouget developed a special interest in how the military organizes people and objects.\u201cIn foreign operating bases, there is always a central command post where all data and papers are processed and handled,\u201d said Ms. Cody-Rouget.In 2006, Ms. Cody-Rouget started a business called Major Mom, where she helps busy parents organize their homes.Major Mom has organized 1,100 homes; the company\u2019s most popular package costs $2,888 for up to 46 hours of organizing.Like many start-ups, Ms. Cody-Rouget said that branching out on her own could have been smoother if she had used role models.\u201cMy biggest mistake was not plugging into other veteran resources,\u201d Ms. Cody-Rouget said. \u201cIt would have saved me so much time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Netanyahu family attorneys in the law office of Dr. J.

Mr. Saidoff was also a defendant in the case decided on Tuesday.The Netanyahu family responded to the police announcement in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cContrary to the press reports Mrs. Netanyahu has not committed any crime.\u201d It added, \u201cThe various allegations raised by the news media will turn out to be baseless, like all the other allegations leveled against the Netanyahu family over the years.\u201dThe report also said that the Netanyahus had bypassed regulations to hire the electrician for repairs at the couple\u2019s private residence in Caesarea on weekends and holidays.The latest report by the state comptroller, published last week, revived long-running suspicions relating to some of the Netanyahu family\u2019s travels more than a decade ago, when Mr. Netanyahu was finance minister.Those suspicions, known as \u201cBibi Tours,\u201d involve allegations that Mr. Netanyahu, who is nicknamed Bibi, had private donors and organizations cover many of his flights abroad, and sometimes pay travel expenses for his wife and children, without informing the parliamentary authorities.The prime minister\u2019s office responded that after \u201cyears of bombastic headlines\u201d and reams of press reports, \u201cthe mountain has turned out to be a molehill. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s trips involved no conflict of interest, no double billing, nothing illegal.\u201dThe Netanyahus have accused critics in the Israeli news media of a long campaign to besmirch them and to undermine the Likud\u2019s hold on power. Many Israelis view Mrs. Netanyahu, a psychologist, as a highhanded, hot-tempered boss who has grown accustomed to the good life and wields immense influence over her husband.Mr. Netanyahu has won election after election. He is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all.Lawyers for the Netanyahu family said that because Mrs. Netanyahu was not a party to the case brought against the state by the former maintenance worker, Guy Eliyahu, she was unable to defend herself and bring \u201cdozens of witnesses\u201d who, according to the lawyers, would have refuted the allegations \u201cone by one.\u201dAccording to the court ruling, Mr. Eliyahu endured \u201creprimands, shouting, humiliation, excessive and even unreasonable demands.\u201d It said there was \u201can atmosphere of fear in the residence\u201d during the period of Mr. Eliyahu\u2019s employment, from June 2011 until June 2012, and that he was also made to work extraordinarily long hours.Mr. Eliyahu, who was awarded compensation of about 120,000 shekels (more than $30,000) from the state and the contracting company that employed him, was not the first to complain. In February the same court awarded compensation to a former caretaker of the prime minister\u2019s official residence, Meni Naftali, on similar grounds.Mr. Eliyahu told the court that one night he had gone home after midnight, but that Mrs. Netanyahu called him back to the residence because he had received the prime minister\u2019s permission to leave but not hers. In another episode, Mrs. Netanyahu is said to have pulled the tablecloth off a table that had been set on a patio for a Saturday lunch because she feared dust had gotten into the salads. She told Mr. Eliyahu and another worker to pick up everything and reset the table within five minutes, which they did.Advertisement"}

Republicans had made the complaint that prompted Ms. Sugarman to investigate, a detail not lost on Mr. Cuomo, who suggested to reporters in early May that it was the Republicans, rankled by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising for their opponents, who were responsible for the leak.Ms. Scott was appointed by Mr. Cuomo.Mr. Flanagan and other Senate Republicans have not hesitated to punish Mr. de Blasio for trying to oust them from the majority in 2014. They have used the Senate\u2019s authority over New York City and the state budget to block the mayor\u2019s agenda on issues including mayoral control of public schools and state aid to the City University of New York.In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Sugarman said that she had asked the inspector general to investigate the leak immediately after The News\u2019s article appeared. \u201cAllegations were made primarily by the New York City mayor that I leaked the report due to political motivations,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we know the facts, I hope the mayor will apologize for maligning my integrity and professionalism.\u201dThis drew a quick retort from Laurence D. Laufer, the election lawyer who has represented Mr. de Blasio during his mayoral campaign and his re-election bid.The inspector general\u2019s report \u201cconfirms that Ms. Sugarman\u2019s office failed to secure the confidentiality of the memo and raises serious questions about the B.O.E.\u2019s management and policies,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIf anyone should apologize, it is surely the B.O.E.\u201dOther staff members at the board denied being involved in the leak, the report said, though several, including Mr. Conklin, testified that because of the board\u2019s conflicting and imprecise policies, they had not been sure whether documents produced by its enforcement division, such as the memo, were confidential.The report found that testimony about such confusion \u201clacked credibility,\u201d noting that the board\u2019s employee handbook and other regulations include policies governing how to treat confidential materials.Still, the inspector general\u2019s office recommended that the board clarify its policies about how the enforcement division\u2019s documents are handled and that the board require employees to receive training on the procedures.The inspector general\u2019s office interviewed more than 25 elections board employees and commissioners under oath, according to the report, and also reviewed documents and computer records. The inquiry concluded that after Mr. Lovett asked to see documents relating to the allegations against Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Conklin emailed him the confidential memo without consulting anyone else at the Board of Elections first. Mr. Conklin also sent the memo to a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, the report said.A lawyer for Mr. Conklin, Michael Koenig, declined to comment.The Manhattan district attorney and the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York have opened inquiries into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising; the inspector general has referred its findings to the Manhattan district attorney and the State Joint Commission on Public Ethics.William K.

{"Headline": "Nation\u2019s Biggest Banks Would All Withstand Recession, Fed Says", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe nation\u2019s biggest banks have all built up big enough buffers to weather a severe recession in decent shape, United States regulators said on Thursday.Yet even with those losses, regulators said, all of the big banks would remain in relatively good financial health \u2014 and well above minimum regulatory requirements \u2014 as a result of the big cushions of shareholder money they have stockpiled in the last few years.Nearly eight years after the financial crisis, a widespread public perception persists that not enough has been done to overhaul the institutions that are \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Calls to break up the biggest banks can be heard among politicians, analysts and even policy makers.For their part, banking regulators have instead been quietly focusing on steadily pushing up an arcane but vital measure of the losses a bank could withstand in a crisis: its capital. Capital levels can be built up either by retaining profits or by raising money from investors.The results of the annual stress tests are a marker of just how much progress the regulators have made in pushing banks to beef up the capital buffers that will protect the financial system in any future crisis.And this years\u2019 tests were \u201carguably the most stressful stress tests yet,\u201d said Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist, noting that the big banks \u201cmust weather a downturn more severe than the Great Recession.\u201dThe test results came as the banks themselves were preparing for a real-world stress test, Britain\u2019s referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Given London\u2019s importance to global finance and markets, the banks were preparing contingency plans if they needed to move their European bases.Among the largest banks, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase all suffered big losses in the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. But all remained above their regulatory minimums.And in one important measure \u2014 the Tier 1 leverage ratio \u2014 the 33 banks together would be 67 percent above the required minimum level even in the worst case of the stress test.But even as the banks prove they have adequate capital, they are not out of the woods.Next week, they will all have to pass another type of test from the Federal Reserve that is a more subjective measure of the banks\u2019 planning and management processes. In the past, these so-called qualitative reviews have tripped up banks including Citigroup, which failed in 2014 even after demonstrating it had adequate capital.On top of that, several Fed officials have recently said that for the nation\u2019s biggest banks, future tests will become even more difficult, with stricter capital requirements.Even with $526 billion losses, stress tests found that all of the big banks would remain in relatively good financial health.\u201cWe need to have those eight most systemically important institutions more resilient than other banks in the economy,\u201d he said.The constant raising of capital requirements each year reduces the likelihood that the banks will ever need another round of taxpayer bailouts.But the ever-evolving requirements have confounded bank executives and shareholders, who complain that the regulations are making it impossible for the banks to generate consistent profits.Even as the economy has remained relatively stable over the last few years and the legal issues and losses from the crisis have been resolved, the share prices of large institutions like Bank of America have languished.On Thursday, the banking industry\u2019s trade group suggested that the stress tests had become unnecessarily burdensome.Some analysts have questioned whether regulators are purposely ramping up regulations to the point where it will no longer make sense to keep large commercial and investment banking operations as one entity \u2014 thus ending the threat of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions.In the short term, Thursday\u2019s stress test results, which are mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law of 2010, could portend good news for the banks\u2019 investors. The banks will probably be allowed to increase their dividends and buy back stock as part of their annual capital plans. The Fed will release its decision on whether to approve those capital plans next Wednesday.In past years, a handful of banks have failed the tests and had to scale back their payouts to shareholders. The figures released on Thursday indicated that the banks were likely to show improved results this year.The Fed looked at how the banks would do this year in a recession that would lead to big losses in consumer banking, which has been an increasing concern in recent months.The test also looked at how they would deal with negative interest rates, which have become more of a concern as central banks have struggled to raise the rates and depart from the policies they adopted immediately after the financial crisis. The test assumes that the banks could not make up for negative rates by charging their customers more to hold their deposits.These assumptions posed less of a danger to banks with big trading and Wall Street operations, but led to bigger consumer losses.While the tests posed extreme hypothetical events, real concerns about weakening consumer credit have plagued banks in recent months.Investors have worried that weakening employment could bring about an end to a period of low defaults, particularly in automobile lending and credit cards \u2014 which have been two areas of growth for the banks.Advertisement"}

There, the rich red tones juxtaposed with animal print fabrics exuded glamour, and glitterati clutched colorful cocktails and champagne flutes while eyeing the happening scene. Maybe they hoped for a star sighting? Leonardo DiCaprio, Madonna and Rita Ora had recently been at the hotel. Who would show on this night? As the evening wore on, the line outside the bar swelled.If the hotel wasn\u2019t the epicenter of Miami that night, it seemed to come close. In fact, if Alan Faena, the Argentine co-owner, has his way, the property and surrounding blocks in the city\u2019s Mid-Beach neighborhood would have this level of buzz all the time.The Faena district, which received official designation as a Miami Beach district in late 2014, is a 10-minute walk north of South Beach and the centerpiece of Mid-Beach\u2019s emerging status as a hot destination.For Mr. Faena, the area\u2019s potential for reinvention was crystal clear from the outset. \u201cThis prime part of Miami with the most beautiful beach was sitting there undeveloped,\u201d he said, wearing his signature off-white suit and Panama hat as he surveyed the glossy crowd in his namesake hotel.He and Mr. Blavatnik have collaborated since 2000 when they started reviving the abandoned docklands of Puerto Madero in Buenos Aires into what is now one the city\u2019s most attractive neighborhoods. It includes a cultural quarter, residences and a hotel.The Faena Hotel Miami Beach opened last November and occupies the former Saxony Hotel, a mainstay in the 1950s and \u201960s for Hollywood icons such as Frank Sinatra. The film director Baz Luhrmann, his wife, Catherine Martin, an Academy Award-winning costumer designer, and Mr. Faena conceived the Art Deco fantastical aesthetic. The property has all the frills of luxury, such as butler service for every guest and a spa. More distinctive are the 150-seat theater, home to a cabaret-style show on weekends, and a pristine 100,000-square-foot swath of beach.The Faena district\u2019s other components surround the hotel; Casa Claridge\u2019s and the condo Faena House are open, while the others are still to debut.For some locals, all the Faena hype is justified. Lee Schrager, a longtime Miami resident and founder of the well-regarded South Beach Wine & Food Festival, says that he was skeptical when he heard about the project more than three years ago but is impressed as it\u2019s come to life. \u201cI thought the Faena district was a lot of talk, and even without it being fully done, it has turned Mid-Beach, a neighborhood no one really knew about, into the place to be,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Relief Measure Clears Senate, Goes to Obama", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just two days before Puerto Rico plans to default on a large debt payment, the Senate on Wednesday passed and sent to the White House a relief measure to help the financially desperate island surmount its fiscal crisis, ending a grueling, monthslong effort to rescue the commonwealth.The Senate, eager to follow the House out of town for a long Fourth of July weekend, voted 68 to 30 for the legislation on Wednesday evening after a test vote that morning showed by a wide margin that critics in both parties did not have the numbers to block passage. President Obama will sign the measure, which his Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, had negotiated and lobbied for since December.\u201cI could write a bill that I think would be a better bill, but I don\u2019t know that anyone could write a better bill that would pass the Congress that also solves the problem,\u201d Mr. Lew said in an interview.The rescue package will not prevent Puerto Rico from missing the payment due on Friday on a $2 billion debt, and Republican congressional leaders labored to the end to reassure conservatives that the bill is not a bailout. Instead, the legislation would allow the island\u2019s government to restructure its $72 billion total debt so it can manage payments, and create a bipartisan oversight board mostly of outsiders to guide what is sure to be a painful recovery process.Crucially, given the imminent missed debt payment, the bill also would bar lawsuits by creditors for nonpayment retroactive to December \u2014 to provide Puerto Rico \u201cthe breathing room,\u201d as Mr. Lew put it, for its government and the control board to restructure the crippling debt and devise a new budget plan.The Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, opened the day\u2019s debate by describing what he saw as the high stakes. \u201cThe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is in crisis, it owes billions of dollars in debt, and it could be forced to leave residents without essential services like hospitals and public safety resources without prompt congressional action,\u201d he said.\u201cThis bill won\u2019t cost the taxpayers a dime,\u201d Mr. McConnell added. \u201cWhat it will do is help Puerto Rico restructure its financial obligations and provide much-needed oversight to put into place reforms.\u201dThe new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.Final Senate approval was thrown into some doubt in recent days because the House passed the bill last week and then left for its holiday. That meant that any changes the Senate made would force the bill\u2019s return to the House, extending the legislative process and delaying action until House members return next week.Yet a number of senators were demanding changes. Coal-state senators from Ohio and West Virginia wanted an unrelated amendment to protect coal miners\u2019 pensions and health benefits, which are threatened by the industry\u2019s economic travails.Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, opposed much of the Puerto Rico bill, and other Democrats found fault with various provisions. The seven-member oversight board, which at least initially will include four Republican and three Democratic appointees, was criticized as undemocratic for giving too little representation to the 3.5 million Puerto Rican-Americans. Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, compared the board to \u201ca colonial master\u201d for the island.Democrats also objected to Republican-sponsored provisions setting a lower minimum wage for young workers and limiting overtime pay on the island, attacking them as counterproductive to a stronger economy. The Senate voted down opponents\u2019 motions against the bill.If the Senate had failed to clear the measure for Mr. Obama\u2019s signature, it would have been the second time in two days that crisis-related legislation was blocked in the polarized Congress. On Tuesday, Democrats blocked a House-passed measure to finance efforts against the Zika virus \u2014 another crisis facing Puerto Rico \u2014 because Republican congressional leaders had made changes to the bill in final negotiations, from which Democrats were excluded.In the case of the Puerto Rico relief bill, the compromise was worked out between Republicans and the Obama administration, led by Mr. Lew. Yet, as the bill hung in the balance on Tuesday, both Mr. Lew and Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, lobbied senators to urge their support.Mr. Lew said the bill\u2019s loss would mean \u201cdescent into chaos.\u201d Top Democratic leaders announced publicly late Tuesday that they would support the legislation.On the final vote, dissenters included both liberal and conservative senators. What made the issue problematic in both parties was the deep unpopularity of perceived federal bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis, and the disconnect of most Americans from Puerto Ricans.\u201cI\u2019ve been having town hall meetings in Oregon recently. No one has asked a question about Puerto Rico, and we have a very small population of Puerto Ricans,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I also think that Congress has a responsibility to back American citizens. That\u2019s what this is about, backing American citizens. And that\u2019s important wherever they live.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret Power Behind Local Elections", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byOpinionYet the rise of dark money may matter less in the race for president or Congress than for, say, the utilities commission in Arizona. Voters probably know much less about the candidates in contests like that, which get little news coverage but whose winner will have enormous power to affect energy company profits and what homeowners pay for electricity. For a relative pittance \u2014 less than $100,000 \u2014 corporations and others can use dark money to shape the outcome of a low-level race in which they have a direct stake.In 2006, 76 percent of outside spending in these six states was fully transparent. In 2014, just 29 percent was, according to our analysis of data compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics.This ability to dominate a race with high stakes at low cost and with no oversight can facilitate corruption.The ultimate cost of elections overrun by hidden interests may be the loss of voters\u2019 faith in the political process and governing institutions.When two seats on the commission were at stake in 2014 elections, $3.2 million was spent on dark money ads. That was more than double the combined spending of all six candidates, and almost 50 times the $67,000 in dark money spent in the 2012 election, before the popularity of the solar program was clear.Persuading the Supreme Court to overturn recent decisions such as Citizens United, which empowered donors to spend unlimited amounts via opaque business and nonprofit entities, would go a long way toward fixing the problem.But until that happens, there is evidence that states, through strong disclosure laws and enforcement, can make it very difficult for spenders to conceal their identities from the public, even if they can\u2019t eliminate dark money.California\u2019s success provides a model for much of what a strong disclosure regime should do: close nonprofit loopholes, require that election advertisements bear the names of top funders, make disclosure rules reasonable and proportional to enable compliance and enforce the law.Chisun Lee is senior counsel and Lawrence Norden is deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Democracy Program at the New York University School of Law.Advertisement"}

You Might Need a License", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported bySCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 \u201cI usually start behind the neck,\u201d Grace Granatelli said from her plump brown sofa. \u201cThere\u2019s two pressure points back behind the ears that help relax them a little bit.\u201d In her lap, she held the head of Sketch, her mixed beagle rat terrier, as her fingers traced small circles through his fur.Ms. Granatelli, whose passion for dogs can be glimpsed in the oil portrait of her deceased pets and the bronzed casts of their paws, started an animal massage business during the recession after taking several courses and workshops. Her primary form of advertising was her car, with its \u201cK9 RUBS\u201d license plate and her website, Pawsitive Touch, stenciled onto her rear window.But in 2013, Arizona\u2019s Veterinary Medical Examining Board sent her a cease-and-desist order, demanding that she close up shop for medically treating animals without a veterinary degree. If not, the board warned, every Swedish doggy massage she completed could cost her a $1,000 fine.To comply with the ruling and obtain a license, Ms. Granatelli would have to spend about $250,000 over four years at an accredited veterinary school. None require courses in massage technique; many don\u2019t even offer one.Animal masseuses are hardly alone. Over the years, states across the country have added licensing requirements for a bewildering variety of jobs, requiring months or years of expensive education, along with assessing costly fees.The Obama administration and the conservative political network financed by the Koch brothers don\u2019t agree on much, but the belief that the zeal among states for licensing all sorts of occupations has spiraled out of control is one of them. In recent months, they have collaborated with an array of like-minded organizations and political leaders in a bid to roll back licensing rules.On Friday, the White House announced that it would provide $7.5 million in grants to organizations interested in working with states to reduce overly burdensome licensing and make it easier for licensed practitioners to work across state lines, an issue of particular importance to military families.\u201cThis grant is the first time the federal government has directly gotten involved to help states that want to reform their licensing practices,\u201d Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \u201cIt was something a Democratic president proposed and a Republican Congress passed.\u201dIn Tennessee, a license is required to shampoo hair; in Florida, to sell a yacht. In Montana, you need the state\u2019s approval to be an egg candler; in Utah, to repair upholstery; in Louisiana, to be a florist.No one disputes that health and safety concerns make licenses indispensable in certain demanding professions, like nursing or flying a commercial airplane, and they are sometimes helpful in improving standards and providing quality assurance to consumers.Security guards in Michigan need to have three years of training; none is needed in New Hampshire and Ohio.\u201cWhy in the world do we regulate barbers?\u201d asked Mark Hutchison, a Republican and the lieutenant governor of Nevada, which shares billing with Arizona as one of the states with the most burdensome licensing requirements, according to the Institute for Justice. \u201cA bad haircut is the last thing that a person is going to put up with and return to. It is the ultimate example of self-regulating industry.\u201dThe most regulated states, paradoxically, are red. \u201cEven Republican governors with Republican legislatures in pretty conservative states have still found it extremely difficult to effect change,\u201d said Dick M. Carpenter, strategic director of the Institute for Justice. \u201cWhen there is an effort to dial back legislation, then the licensed industry turns out with huge counterattack. This is the same story that plays out in every state.\u201dOnly rarely are licensing requirements removed. Last month, though, Arizona agreed to curb them for yoga teachers, geologists, citrus fruit packers and cremationists.But dozens more professions escaped the ax. \u201cArizona is perceived as a low-regulatory state, but this was the most difficult bill we worked on this session,\u201d said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the Republican governor, Douglas Ducey.Licensing boards are generally dominated by members of the regulated profession. And in Arizona, more than two dozen of the boards are allowed to keep 90 percent of their fees, turning over a mere 10 percent of the revenue to the state.\u201cThey use that money to hire contract lobbyists and P.R. people,\u201d Mr. Scarpinato said. \u201cThis is really a dark corner of state government.\u201dThey are often joined in their campaign by lobbyists from industry trade associations and for-profit colleges, which sell the required training courses.Economists like Mr. Kleiner say there are less burdensome ways to highlight quality. For example, certification, with an exam to ensure a certain skill level, could be required to use a particular job title \u2014 like certified tour guide or chartered financial analyst \u2014 without prohibiting others from offering the service, perhaps at a lower price.The court\u2019s decision may prompt some states to monitor licensing boards more closely, said Robert C. Fellmeth, executive director of the Center for Public Interest Law at the University of San Diego.Once the lawsuit is finished, Ms. Whitmore said, it is possible the board will offer more guidelines.Ms. Kelly, whose strong hands can zero in on a knotted muscle like a heat-seeking missile, said she was continuing to work despite the order from the licensing board. She grew up around horses at her father\u2019s riding stable in Long Island and has taken several courses and workshops in equine massageLocal veterinarians have frequently referred horse owners to her. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d said Ms. Kelly, who charges $55 for an approximately 90-minute massage. \u201cIt takes too long.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Secure Loans, Chinese Women Supply Perilous Collateral: Nude Photos", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Women in China are sending naked photographs of themselves holding their ID cards to peer-to-peer lenders as collateral, Chinese state media have reported, in a trend that may involve thousands of people.A call seeking comment to Jiedaibao, a leading company in China\u2019s flourishing peer-to-peer lending market, was not answered late on Wednesday in Beijing.Beijing Youth Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Youth League, said the practice was an \u201copen secret.\u201d\u201cAn investigation by Beijing Youth Daily shows that in some money lending groups, female university students\u2019 \u2018naked holding\u2019 has already become an open secret,\u201d it wrote, referring to the practice of women photographing themselves naked holding their ID card as a guarantee of repayment.\u201cWith \u2018naked holding\u2019 they can get two to five times the amount of money, but when they can\u2019t repay some have been threatened with publishing the photographs, and some lenders are even demanding the female students provide sexual services,\u201d Beijing Youth Daily wrote.It described the case of a university student from Jiangsu Province in central China, whom it gave the pseudonym of Lin Xiao. Her troubles began, it said, when she borrowed 500 renminbi, about $75, from a lender in February to open an online store. At 30 percent interest on the one-week loan, she quickly needed more money to repay the debt, eventually borrowing about 120,000 renminbi from 15 people, a sum that soon ballooned into 250,000 renminbi (about $38,000) at the high interest rate.Eventually, the woman supplied a nude photograph of herself in exchange for a larger loan to try to escape her debt, including personal information such as contact numbers and addresses for family members. When she could not repay, the lender threatened to show the photographs to her family and friends, the newspaper reported.As the circle of debt widened, so did the distribution of the naked photographs, until they were in the hands of three online lenders, Beijing Youth Daily reported. At that point she told her family and, with their help, began to clear the debt. \u201cBut I still owe about 60,000 renminbi,\u201d she said.The story could not be independently verified.\u201cHigh interest, \u2018naked holding\u2019 and so on are the private actions of users; this company cannot interfere,\u201d Beijing Youth Daily quoted Jiedaibao as saying in response to the reports of such behavior among users. \u201cRisks are the borrowers\u2019 responsibility,\u201d it said.On Wednesday, Beijing Ninth Uncle posted a Weibo message calling on the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Some victims had \u201cdisappeared,\u201d he said, meaning their cellphones were off or were ringing unanswered.\u201cI call on the police to set up a special group, give the victims confidence, investigate thoroughly, dredge out the criminals,\u201d he wrote.

{"Headline": "Stratolaunch\u2019s Gargantuan Flying Launchpad Edges Toward the Skies", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byMOJAVE, Calif. \u2014 The world\u2019s largest airplane by wingspan sits in a cradle of scaffolding as workers fit the remaining parts that will turn it into a flying launchpad for firing rockets into space.Everything about this project, called Stratolaunch, screams bigness. The slogan \u201cThink Big\u201d is plastered on workers\u2019 T-shirts and on posters around the hangar in the desert outside Los Angeles, where the plane is being assembled. The effort is being financed by the jumbo fortune of Paul G. Allen, the billionaire space enthusiast and a Microsoft founder.The plane\u2019s nickname is Roc, after the gigantic mythical bird that carried an elephant in its talons, though Stratolaunch executives are not crazy about it; it sounds like something not known for staying aloft.A rare tour of the plane and hangar last week by executives working for Mr. Allen showed that the project was still underway, and on track to begin commercial operations before the end of the decade. But there are lingering questions about how Stratolaunch\u2019s business will work once its flying behemoth is ready for takeoff.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious undertaking,\u201d said Charles Beames, president of Vulcan Aerospace, the entity Mr. Allen created to oversee Stratolaunch and other space initiatives. \u201cA really big plane means carrying anything from a really big rocket to a smaller rocket. That allows us to serve a broader set of customers.\u201dStratolaunch bought two used Boeing 747s from United Airlines, removed most of their critical parts and is now reassembling them into one carrier plane with a new shell made of lightweight graphite composites. It is hoped that the plane will take off with a rocket slung underneath, which it would then drop from an altitude of more than 30,000 feet, sending it on its way to space.Stratolaunch executives said an airborne launcher would have other advantages, like the ability to simply fly to patches of clear sky to avoid foul weather that could scrub a mission. They also say their plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits, although the plane needs a landing strip that can handle its great size.There has been tumult around aspects of Stratolaunch.Its partnerships ended with SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Stratolaunch had worked with them both to develop rockets for blasting satellites into space from the plane. And questions have been raised about whether there would be enough business \u2014 given the trend toward smaller satellites \u2014 for such a large plane.In an interview, Mr. Beames said that Stratolaunch, which will be able to carry payloads of over 500,000 pounds, was the right size. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not overbuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the size gives us is flexibility in payload.\u201dBill Ostrove, a space systems analyst at Forecast International, an aerospace and defense research firm, says the real demand for Stratolaunch\u2019s services will be determined by its ability to serve the small-satellite launch market, which is extremely competitive.\u201cIf Stratolaunch can figure out its strategy and develop a working rocket, it should be able to capture some business, as long as the small-satellite market continues to grow and demand for launch vehicles continues,\u201d he said.During the tour last week, workers with Scaled Composites, the company founded by Mr. Rutan that is building the plane, were positioning panels on the twin fuselages of the plane and grinding surfaces down to a smooth finish. Over 300 people are working on the craft.The assembly of the plane, inside a cavernous hangar built especially for it, is more than three-quarters finished. The size of the plane is difficult to comprehend. The top of its tail wing is nearly four stories from the ground.Tucked away in corners of the hangar are the landing gear components from the two 747s. The new plane will use six of the eight Pratt & Whitney engines Stratolaunch acquired when it bought the 747s. The plane\u2019s cockpit is being outfitted with electronics, crew seats and windows from the 747s.Mr. Beames said Stratolaunch would announce new partnerships in the coming months that will fill out details about the project. He declined to say when Stratolaunch would begin test flights, but he vowed to meet a goal of Mr. Allen\u2019s to be up and running by 2020.\u201cCome hell or high water, you can be sure we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Mr. Beames said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Bill Is Blocked by Senate Democrats Upset Over Provisions", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a federal spending bill that would have provided $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, saying Republicans had sabotaged the legislation with politically charged provisions. The move raised the possibility that no new money would be available soon to fight the disease as Southern states brace for a summer outbreak.The stalemate, accompanied by a sharp war of words on the Senate floor, raised the prospect that the partisan divide in Congress was hindering the government\u2019s ability to respond effectively to a pressing public health emergency.Democrats said they blocked the bill because Republicans were using the must-pass legislation to score political points, jam through unpalatable policy changes and cut money from other programs, including provisions that would hinder access to contraception for women and weaken environmental restrictions on pesticide use.Republicans, in turn, accused Democrats of manufacturing excuses for blocking the bill, but they did not dispute that some of the provisions favored Republican policy positions.Democrats and the White House have been pushing since February for the Republican majorities in Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency financing to fight Zika, which can cause brain damage and other serious defects in infants born to infected mothers.The Democrats reacted with disbelief on Tuesday as Republicans tried to turn the tables and blame Democrats for delaying the money because they had blocked the legislation.\u201cWe have a public health crisis descending on our country,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said after the vote. \u201cPregnant women all across America are looking at this with dismay, utter dismay, as we sit here in a partisan gridlock manufactured by the other side.\u201dThe Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, was incensed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what universe my friend is living in,\u201d Mr. Reid said, referring to Mr. McConnell. \u201cWhat does he think? Does he think we\u2019re all stupid? The American people are dumb?\u201dScientists increasingly believe that the Zika virus may cause birth defects in infants. Here\u2019s why.The sniping continued as Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, declared, \u201cOur Democratic friends block it because they are sore losers.\u201dPublic health officials reacted with their own dismay at the breakdown on Capitol Hill.\u201cIf we don\u2019t get new money, we won\u2019t be able to do things at a pace that is necessary and appropriate to the urgency of this threat,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is working on three potential vaccines against the Zika virus and overseeing a study of thousands of pregnant women infected with the virus.House Republicans, in turn, adopted legislation providing $622 million, with most of the money cut and redirected from other federal programs \u2014 a move opposed by Democrats who said the money for Zika should be treated as an emergency expenditure.Ultimately, Democrats were willing to go along with the Senate version, but in talks controlled strictly by Republicans, House and Senate negotiators agreed last week to provide $1.1 billion, with $750 million in cuts and policy changes.Democrats charged that Republicans had booby-trapped the legislation by adding provisions that would restrict the role of Planned Parenthood, the women\u2019s health organization, and similar clinics in providing contraceptive services related to fighting the Zika virus, which can be transmitted sexually.The Democrats also said that Republicans had inserted a provision cutting $540 million in financing from the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, and that they had stripped a House provision that would ban the flying of the Confederate battle flag in federal cemeteries.Another provision of the bill that Democrats disliked was a further reallocation of money from Ebola programs, totaling $107 million. Democrats have long maintained that money previously appropriated to fight Ebola is vitally needed.Even as officials brace for the arrival in the continental United States of mosquitoes carrying Zika, the Obama administration does have some flexibility in reapportioning funds among different health programs \u2014 in addition to the nearly $600 million already taken from Ebola programs \u2014 while waiting for Congress to act.The White House has been reluctant to specify how much money it might be able to temporarily redirect to fight Zika \u2014 or how long it would be able to make do \u2014 because that could ease pressure on Congress to approve the new money.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.Whichever side is more to blame, it was clear that no new government funds would be approved to fight the Zika virus until after Congress returned from a recess for the Fourth of July holiday. And even then, the prospects of an agreement are uncertain.With Southern states expected to be hit hardest by Zika, lawmakers representing Florida have been among those pushing hardest for bipartisan action. But even Floridians were divided on Tuesday.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Republicans had poisoned the chances for moving ahead by blocking money for Planned Parenthood, knowing Democrats would never agree.\u201cThey\u2019re just not living in the real world, and they\u2019re just not facing the fact that this is an emergency,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. He noted that at least five babies had been born with microcephaly in the United States \u2014 the most recent one in Florida \u2014 but said he expected the disagreements to continue.\u201cWe go until enough of these horrible cases are born that it is finally beginning to penetrate their hard heads,\u201d he said.Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Nelson\u2019s Republican counterpart from Florida, blamed Democrats\u2019 political motives for sinking the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a talking point that they want to take into the July Fourth recess, unfortunately,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Democrats on Tuesday morning urged renewed negotiations, but Mr. Cornyn, speaking to reporters off the floor, said matter-of-factly, \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be another opportunity to deal with this for the near future.\u201dThe vote on Tuesday morning was 52 to 48, with Republicans falling short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster and advance the bill to a final vote.The debate was so sharp that Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, accused Democrats of favoring insects over people in their opposition to easing the pesticide restrictions.\u201cThe Democrats are more focused on protecting the mosquito than they are protecting people,\u201d he said.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting from Washington, and Donald G.

{"Headline": "Pedro Kuczynski Declares Victory Over Keiko Fujimori for Peru Presidency", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 A former Wall Street banker and finance minister declared himself the winner of the presidential contest in Peru on Thursday after narrowly edging out the daughter of an imprisoned former president.The former banker, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, 77, appeared to have prevailed against Keiko Fujimori, 41, after a second-round contest on Sunday whose result remained in suspension for much of the week because of a near-even split between the two candidates.\u201cThank you, Peru,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski exclaimed on Twitter on Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s time to work for the future of our country.\u201dWhile the election authorities still had not certified a winner, officials said Thursday that 99.7 percent of the ballots had been counted. It appeared unlikely that Ms. Fujimori could surpass her rival with the few outstanding votes despite a first-place finish in the first round and a lead in polls before the vote. The winner will take office July 28.Ms. Fujimori did not release a public statement on Thursday. Several party members said they would challenge some ballots because of irregularities, which they did not specify.The margin between the two candidates \u2014 roughly 41,000 votes out of 18 million cast on Sunday \u2014 was one of the narrowest in recent memory.Analysts said it underscored a deeply divided electorate. The candidates espoused similar free-market views but came from divergent backgrounds. Mr. Kuczynski, an economist, ran as a technocrat; Ms. Fujimori, a populist, is the daughter of one of the country\u2019s most controversial leaders.Her father, Alberto K. Fujimori, ran Peru with an iron fist from 1990 to 2000 in an effort to crush the Marxist rebel group Shining Path.While the insurgency was largely defeated during those years, many argue that his rule, which included eliminating the Constitution, damaged the country\u2019s democracy. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison for corruption and human rights abuses.During the campaign, Mr. Kuczynski portrayed himself as a stable alternative to Ms. Fujimori, whom he accused of being a populist eager to return to her father\u2019s authoritarianism.An Oxford-educated economist who speaks three languages and plays the flute and piano, Mr. Kuczynski is described by those who know him as having an academic personality shaped by years in the United States.\u201cHe has an impressive ability to prioritize the most critical aspects of each problem \u2014 he is very pragmatic,\u201d said Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos, a former Peruvian ambassador to the United States who worked with Mr. Kuczynski.Peru\u2019s economy has been a bright spot in a region suffering from declines of commodity prices, and Mr. Kuczynski has vowed to push its growth through state spending.He has said he wants to invest in large infrastructure and education projects while lowering sales taxes to create an incentive for businesses operating outside the formal economy to register with the government.Yet his goals may be difficult to achieve. Ms. Fujimori\u2019s party, Popular Force, won a large congressional majority in the election\u2019s first round.\u201cWhat worries me most is that he might maintain a technocratic style that makes governing a difficult task,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at Pontifical Catholic University in Lima.Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s work for American banks \u2014 he was a chairman of First Boston in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 has been a concern for some. During the election, his critics said that in previous stints in the government, he offered natural gas concessions at terms too favorable to businesses.Victor Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Belaunde, a congressman from the Popular Action party, said Peru\u2019s president would face difficult decisions over concessions to developers of its natural resources.\u201cI\u2019m afraid the government loses control or supervision and that big companies that are dedicated to concessions might have more advantages,\u201d he said.Others saw Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s past in the financial world as an asset.\u201cHe is essentially an executive and an excellent executive,\u201d said Richard Webb, a former president of Peru\u2019s central bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In American Markets, Panic Begins to Subside", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byThe market panic that initially met Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union showed signs of subsiding on Monday.While stocks continued to slide for a second trading day, by the close of business Monday a measure of calm appeared to be returning to certain significant corners of the market.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was stable for most of the day after dropping around 2 percent in the first minutes of trading. It ended the day down 1.8 percent. Markets in Japan and China finished Monday in positive territory.A gauge of expected future volatility in the markets, the so-called VIX, fell on Monday after spiking on Friday, and remained far below the level it reached last summer when problems in the Chinese economy came to the fore.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting contagion here,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, the chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, based in Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty well insulated,\u201d he said of the American economy.The outlook was less sanguine in Europe.Investors continued dumping European stocks and seeking out the safety of gold and bonds on Monday, despite comments from British and European officials intended to calm markets.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke for the first time since the so-called Brexit vote, before markets opened on Monday. He said that while Britain\u2019s public finances would be affected by an exit from the bloc, the broader economy was still in good shape.\u201cOur economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces,\u201d Mr. Osborne said. \u201cIt is inevitable, after Thursday\u2019s vote, that Britain\u2019s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in.\u201d\u201cWe were prepared for the unexpected,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are equipped for whatever happens.\u201dBut Mr. Osborne\u2019s comments appeared to do little to shore up the nation\u2019s currency. The British pound fell on Monday to its lowest level against the dollar since the 1980s.In another blow to the British economy, the Standard & Poor\u2019s rating agency announced on Monday that it was stripping Great Britain of its AAA rating. The country\u2019s rating was dropped two notches, to AA.Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts said in their report that the vote last week \u201cwill weaken the predictability, stability, and effectiveness of policy making in the U.K. and affect its economy, G.D.P. growth and fiscal and external balances.\u201dThere is still enormous uncertainty about how exactly Britain\u2019s exit will play out, and how it will ripple through the economy. The most obvious victims are likely to be the big European banks, which have relied on an ability to operate easily across borders.Trading in financial stocks like Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland was briefly suspended on Monday because of precipitous declines.Barclays fell 17 percent on Monday on top of its 17 percent decline on Friday. That brought the bank\u2019s stock below the bottom it reached during the 2011 eurozone crisis, though it remained far above the trough reached during the financial crisis.\u201cBanks are one of the most exposed sectors to Brexit,\u201d Andrew Coombs, a Citigroup analyst, said in a research note distributed on Monday.He noted that British banks were particularly vulnerable \u201cgiven the likely headwinds of a deteriorating domestic economy, and higher risk premia associated with a less predictable political and economic landscape.\u201dBut, he warned, \u201cthe European investment banks are also not immune, with sizable operations in London, which may now need to be reviewed.\u201dItalian officials said on Monday that they were looking at creating what amounted to a bailout fund to help struggling banks in the country.Throughout Europe, however, investors have not been assuming the worst \u2014 they seem to have reserved their harshest punishment so far for bank stocks. By contrast, a broad index of European shares, the Euro Stoxx, fell 2.8 percent on Monday but was still above the lows it reached earlier this year.In the United States, the S.&P. 500-stock index finished down 1.8 percent, or 36.87 points, at 2,000.54 on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent, or 260.51 points, to 17,140.24. The Nasdaq composite was down 2.4 percent, or 113.54 points, to 4,594.44.Some economists said that the turmoil in Europe could slightly stunt American growth. Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that they had reduced their estimates for American economic growth in the second half of 2016, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent.But other analysts were far more optimistic. Pantheon Macroeconomics said on Monday that it still anticipated American economic growth to gain steam this year, driven by improving consumer confidence.For American investors, the biggest fallout from the British vote may be the influence that it has on the Federal Reserve and its plans for raising interest rates in the economy.Traders were betting on Monday that the Fed would have to keep rates lower for longer, which could help stimulate the economy. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was supposed to attend a meeting of central bank chiefs this week in Portugal, but she called that off after the British vote last week.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held an emergency meeting on Monday with officials from the nation\u2019s central bank and Finance Ministry to discuss how to contain the fallout from the vote in Britain, which pummeled markets in Japan and elsewhere on Friday.Japan was hit especially hard. The Nikkei suffered its biggest one-day point drop in 16 years and the yen jumped about 5 percent against the dollar.On Monday, Japanese authorities issued their strongest warning yet that they were prepared to intervene in the market to curb the rise of the yen. Markets elsewhere in the region were mostly little changed. Japan, however, generally fears an excessively strong currency, which can hurt the country\u2019s economy by making its exports more expensive and consequently less competitive.\u201cThere is still uncertainty and risk in the financial markets, and it\u2019s important that we continue to work for stability,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters after a meeting at the prime minister\u2019s office.He added that he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to \u201ccoordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how much Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose on Monday.

{"Headline": "Novel Strategy Puts Big Soda Tax Within Philadelphia\u2019s Reach", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthPhiladelphia is poised to become the first large American city to pass a soda tax.If the measure passes a final vote next week, as it is expected to do, it will impose a tax of 1.5 cents for every ounce that includes sugar or artificial sweeteners \u2014 about 30 cents for a 20-ounce drink or $2.16 for a 12-pack. On Wednesday night, it was passed on a voice vote by the City Council\u2019s \u201ccommittee of the whole,\u201d which includes the entire council.Soda taxes have usually been proposed as public health measures to discourage people from drinking sugary beverages, which have been linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. They have been introduced in cities around the country, including twice before in Philadelphia, but repeatedly failed. Berkeley, Calif., is the only American city with a tax on sugary drinks; the Philadelphia tax would be considerably higher.That choice appears to have paid off, but it may come with some consequences. Because the measure was cast as a revenue-raiser, the final deal is not exactly what public health experts might prefer. Council members, in negotiations, altered the spectrum of taxed products to hit budget targets. The measure that passed Wednesday taxes not just sugary drinks but also diet drinks. It exempts juice drinks from the tax as long as they have 50 percent juice, even if they also have added sugar. Minutes before the final vote at 8 p.m., the city\u2019s finance department revealed that some soda-tax revenue would also be used to plug a budget shortfall.\u201cIt was always about the revenue,\u201d said Lauren Hitt, Mr. Kenney\u2019s spokeswoman, who said the mayor was comfortable with the council\u2019s modifications to the proposal, which were negotiated into the evening.Other cities have been tracking Philadelphia\u2019s proposal. San Francisco; Boulder, Colo.; Oakland, Calif., and several smaller communities are planning to introduce soda tax measures this year.\u201cThere has been much discussion around the world and within the U.S. to adopt soda taxes,\u201d Kelly Brownell, the dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, and a soda-tax advocate, said in an email. \u201cPhiladelphia has now created an entirely new level of momentum.\u201dDarrell Clarke, the City Council president, had strongly opposed earlier soda tax measures, but helped negotiate the final deal this time. He opened the committee hearing by warning: \u201cThe action we take will probably leave some people with a sour taste in their mouth.\u201d Asked after the vote how other cities might look at soda taxes, he said, \u201cI think there will be a strong conversation.\u201dThe proposal faced substantial opposition from the beverage industry, the Teamsters union and local grocers. Together, the anti-tax forces spent millions of dollars on advertisements and lobbyists. Opponents of the tax held a rally outside City Hall in the morning, and chanted and booed during public testimony on the measure. It is possible that the industry will bring lawsuits challenging the tax once it has passed.Supporters were also well organized; they, too, raised and spent substantial sums. They assembled a group of preschoolers at City Hall for a \u201cread in\u201d Wednesday, and packed the council gallery bearing handwritten signs. When the vote was over, they cheered and applauded.An earlier version of this article misstated the day the vote took place. It was Wednesday, not Tuesday.Advertisement"}

The decision, his letter implied, was driven in part by the preferences of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government.\u201cWhile I was open to seeing these developments through, on due reflection, and after consultation with the government, I want to share with you that I will be returning to academia when my term as governor ends on Sept. 4, 2016,\u201d the letter read.\u201cI will, of course, always be available to serve my country when needed,\u201d the letter added.Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted the 2008 global financial crisis three years before it happened, to an incredulous audience of prominent bankers and economists.He took over the Reserve Bank of India in 2013. At the time, India\u2019s economy was considered one of the \u201cfragile five\u201d emerging markets, and the rupee was in free fall. The technocratic Mr. Rajan was credited with reining in double-digit inflation and winning back the confidence of international investors. Indian journalists called him a \u201crock star economist\u201d and, in a reference to India\u2019s benchmark index, said he had \u201cput the sex back in Sensex.\u201dBut though India\u2019s growth has been strong by international standards, many of those who backed Mr. Modi have expressed frustration that Mr. Rajan did not do more to stimulate growth.Mr. Swamy, a former commerce minister and law minister, was jubilant on Saturday, saying a change in leadership would probably lead to swifter economic growth.\u201cI certainly wanted him out, and I made it clear to the prime minister, as clear as possible,\u201d he said, adding that he expected a positive reaction from India\u2019s industrialists.\u201cHis audience was essentially Western, and his audience in India was transplanted westernized society,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople used to come in delegations to my house to urge me to do something about it.\u201dThe public attacks on Mr. Rajan, analysts said, coincided with a growing conviction among Mr. Modi\u2019s inner circle that with inflation under control, the time was ripe to loosen monetary policy and publicly celebrate India\u2019s robust growth.Mr. Rajan was not inclined to do so. In interviews, he continued to urge the government to undertake structural reforms to the banking industry and to warn against complacency.In April, when Mr. Rajan was asked to comment on India\u2019s new status as a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the global economy, his response was notably sober.\u201cWe have this saying, \u2018In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,\u2019\u201d he said. Shortly afterward, one of Mr. Modi\u2019s top lieutenants rebuked Mr. Rajan for offending the visually impaired, and Mr. Rajan publicly apologized.He also raised hackles by warning in a speech against \u201canyone imposing a particular view or ideology because of their power,\u201d a remark that was viewed as stepping outside his area of expertise and into the realm of politics.\u201cThey wanted him to be the purveyor of good news, rather than a sense of realism, and that did not go down well at all,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cNow that there is a sense the economy has turned a corner, the view that he was dispensable had come to take hold.\u201dMr. Rajan is the first central bank governor since 1992 to opt not to seek a second term.The finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has said an announcement on a successor will come \u201cshortly.\u201d Markets were expected to open lower on Monday on the news, as investors wait to see who will replace Mr. Rajan.Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC Bank, called it \u201ca sad day for all of us.\u201d He said he expected to spend Monday responding to calls from upset investors, but said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to convince them that the macroeconomic factors are extremely strong.\u201d\u201cIf this had happened when India was weak, it would be chaotic, it would be terrible, it would be catastrophe,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can take it at this time. The hit will be minimal.\u201dAmong those who expressed regret at Mr. Rajan\u2019s decision was Palaniappan Chidambaram, a senior leader of the opposition Congress Party, who said he was \u201cdisappointed and profoundly saddened,\u201d but not surprised, by the news.\u201cThe government had invited this development through a craftily planned campaign of insinuations, baseless allegations and puerile attacks on a distinguished academic and economist,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government did not deserve Mr. Rajan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Hamilton\u2019 Inc.: The Path to a Billion-Dollar Broadway Show", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byThe show\u2019s cast members were invited to the White House and have become regular guests on late-night talk shows. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical\u2019s creator, was on the cover of Rolling Stone. Fans and enterprising line-sitters camp outside the theater around the clock, hoping to snag last-minute seats. Tickets are almost impossible to come by, except those resold at highly marked-up prices. And celebrities have streamed in: Beyonc\u00e9. Barbra. Bernie.All that enthusiasm means a lot of money for the men and women who brought the show to Broadway. Months ago, \u201cHamilton\u201d recouped the $12.5 million it cost to mount. It is now making an estimated $600,000 a week in profit, and every indication is that its touring productions, which begin in Chicago in September and in San Francisco next March, will be highly profitable, too.Even if \u201cHamilton\u201d isn\u2019t playing in Bangkok decades after its debut (as was the case with \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d), it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that Mr. Miranda\u2019s unlikely hit will ultimately generate upward of $1 billion in sales.Forecasting the future for \u201cHamilton\u201d is risky, but the show\u2019s current fortunes, and the model provided by other shows, are instructive. Here, based on documents filed with government agencies and interviews with people familiar with various aspects of the musical\u2019s finances, is a look at how \u201cHamilton\u201d makes money and where that money goes.\u2018The revolution\u2019s happening in New York.\u2019On Broadway, \u201cHamilton\u201d is consistently selling out all 1,321 seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater and is currently grossing about $1.9 million a week in ticket sales. Simply by maintaining that pace, the show would bring in nearly $100 million a year (that\u2019s grosses, not profits). But there is reason to expect that figure to rise. In a bid to blunt profiteering \u2014 the widespread scalping of tickets at highly marked-up prices \u2014 the show may soon raise prices above the current ceiling of $475 for premium seating.\u2018We create. You just wanna move our money around.\u2019The hottest ticket on Broadway cost, on average, $172 during the week that ended June 5. But that\u2019s just what the initial purchaser paid. Many theatergoers pay considerably more by purchasing resold tickets on sites like StubHub, Craigslist and Ticketmaster. Those tickets are being listed for as much as $5,018 each, but most are sold for considerably less. The average resale of \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets on StubHub is roughly $872, according to a New York Times analysis, a markup of $700 above the current average original ticket sale price.For any given performance, roughly 13 to 22 percent of the seats at the Richard Rodgers \u2014 somewhere between 180 and 300 tickets \u2014 are available on the secondary market, according to The Times\u2019s research and interviews with ticket sellers. So for each performance of \u201cHamilton,\u201d ticket sellers and brokers are reaping roughly $150,000. With the Broadway cast putting on more than 400 shows per year, that means these sellers could reap about $60 million per year, just in New York \u2014 money the producers, investors and Mr. Miranda will never see.\u2018Tomorrow there\u2019ll be more of us.\u2019\u201cHamilton\u201d is moving quickly to take advantage of its moment. The Chicago production will begin just 13 months after the Broadway opening and run indefinitely. The PrivateBank Theater in Chicago, where \u201cHamilton\u201d will play, is much bigger than the show\u2019s Broadway house, meaning that even if ticket prices are somewhat lower, revenues could be strong, and that run could nearly double the show\u2019s weekly profitability.\u201cHamilton\u201d is also planning two separate North American touring productions: one beginning in March in San Francisco, and one beginning in Seattle in 2018. The theaters on the road are likely to price tickets lower than in New York, but many of them hold more people, so these two tours, on top of Chicago, could dramatically increase the show\u2019s current revenues and profits.The show\u2019s producers will soon announce a fifth production, in London, and if \u201cHamilton\u201d follows the path of other monster musicals, it will eventually explore the possibilities of productions in Asia, Australia or Continental Europe. Profits from foreign productions are difficult to forecast, and given that \u201cHamilton\u201d is a lyrically dense musical about American history, its appeal outside the United States, and in languages other than English, is uncertain.\u2018Can I buy you a drink?\u2019From T-shirts to CDs to books, fans cannot get enough \u201cHamilton.\u201dThe cast album has sold over 428,000 copies domestically, according to Nielsen. Track downloads have topped 212,000; on-demand streams from sources like Spotify and Apple Music have eclipsed 365 million. Together, that\u2019s roughly $11 million in gross retail sales.Many of those who manage to get inside the Richard Rodgers Theater visit the gift stand, which sells hats, magnets and mugs. And goodies are available even to those who can\u2019t get inside the theater. Bloomingdale\u2019s is selling \u201cHamilton\u201d apparel in New York, and plans to do the same in other cities as the show tours. Online, there is a thriving market for unlicensed \u201cHamilton\u201d tchotchkes: perfume, dolls and key chains made by enterprising fans.\u2018Who provided those funds?\u2019The vast majority of profits from \u201cHamilton\u201d is going to the producers and investors who put up the $12.5 million to finance the show.The producers are also entitled to 3 percent of the adjusted gross from \u201cHamilton,\u201d which amounts to about $52,000 weekly, or $2.7 million annually, from the Broadway production. (Producers commonly get both a royalty and a share of profits.)For Mr. Seller, it doesn\u2019t end there. His production company, Adventureland, is entitled to another 5 percent of net profits, or about $1.6 million a year, from the current production. Adventureland receives these so-called torchbearer points in recognition of his role in the show\u2019s development.The investors who backed \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 a group of about 100 people that includes Robert Greenblatt, the NBC Entertainment chairman, as well as the power publicist Ken Sunshine \u2014 split another 42 percent of the profits, or about $13 million annually, from the Broadway production. (The list of \u201cHamilton\u201d investors has not been made public.)Those are big numbers for the theater world, but they are likely to get much bigger in the coming years, as the show opens productions beyond New York.\u2018Why do you write like you\u2019re running out of time?\u2019Mr. Miranda, the show\u2019s 36-year-old creator, wears an unusual number of hats: He came up with the idea; he wrote the music, book and lyrics; and he is, for now, the star. That means he gets a salary (as an actor), as well as authorship royalties and profits that ordinarily would be split among multiple people. He is expected to leave the cast this summer and will then lose his salary (an undisclosed amount), but he will continue to receive the royalties and profits for as long as the show runs.He is likely to make at least $6.4 million from the Broadway production over the next year; his earnings will grow considerably when the other productions begin.Mr. Miranda is also the ultimate rights holder for \u201cHamilton.\u201d After the show\u2019s commercial life ends, he will own the rights for productions in regional theaters and schools, which can generate considerable revenue over time.\u2018I never had a group of friends before. I promise that I\u2019ll make y\u2019all proud.\u2019Mr. Miranda rewards loyalty. The director, choreographer and orchestrator for \u201cHamilton,\u201d as well as the show\u2019s costume, lighting and sound designers, all worked on \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d All of them \u2014 and the show\u2019s set designer \u2014 are entitled to royalties, and all are likely to make millions of dollars over the life of the show.Thomas Kail, the director, has known Mr. Miranda since the two were introduced after both graduated (a few years apart) from Wesleyan University. Mr. Kail helped develop \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and \u201cHamilton.\u201d He is entitled to 2.5 percent of the adjusted gross revenue from \u201cHamilton,\u201d or about $2.3 million a year just from the New York production. Mr. Kail also receives 1.5 percent of net profits, currently about another $470,000 annually.Andy Blankenbuehler, the show\u2019s choreographer, receives 1.75 percent of gross sales and 0.5 percent of profits \u2014 currently totaling $1.7 million or so annually.Mr. Miranda\u2019s musical partner, Alex Lacamoire, gets just under 1 percent of gross sales, currently about $790,000 annually. And the show\u2019s costume, lighting and sound designers \u2014 Paul Tazewell, Howell Binkley and Nevin Steinberg \u2014 receive between 0.37 and 0.5 percent of gross sales, currently worth about $336,000 to $454,000 per year.As with all of the royalty and profit-sharing arrangements associated with \u201cHamilton,\u201d the value of the creative team\u2019s cut will increase significantly when the productions in Chicago and beyond begin.\u2018We\u2019ll give the world to you, and you\u2019ll blow us all away.\u2019The details are still being ironed out, but probably the opening-night casts at the Public Theater and on Broadway, and perhaps participants in pre-opening workshops at the Public Theater, will share 1 percent of the profits from the Broadway production and will also share a portion of the profits of touring productions.The profit-sharing is likely to affect about 30 people, including not only actors and dancers but also stage managers. It\u2019s not clear how much they would get, but perhaps about $10,000 a year from the Broadway production alone. That is not a lot of money compared with what others are earning, but it is still significant to performers, many of whom work for relatively low salaries and have long periods between roles. (On Broadway, actors make a union-mandated minimum of $1,900 a week; the performers in \u201cHamilton\u201d are making more than that. But many performers spend much of their careers Off or Off Off Broadway, where salaries are considerably lower.)The \u201cHamilton\u201d performers worked hard to get a profit-sharing promise \u2014 after they were unable to negotiate a deal as the Broadway production was opening, they hired a lawyer to represent them. It took them eight months after the Broadway production opened to win an agreement; they had argued that it was not fair, given their contributions to the show, to exclude them from sharing in its success.\u2018Don\u2019t forget from whence you came.\u2019\u201cHamilton\u201d has proved lucrative for three others who helped along the way: Ron Chernow, a historian whose biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired and formed the basis for the musical; the Public Theater, the Off Broadway nonprofit that nurtured the show\u2019s late-stage development and presented its pre-Broadway production; and, most surprisingly, Luis A. Miranda Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s father.Mr. Chernow, who is the musical\u2019s historical consultant and its tireless champion, gets 1 percent of the show\u2019s adjusted grosses as a royalty \u2014 currently about $900,000 a year.The Public Theater, which famously lived for years off the profits from transferring \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d to Broadway, gets 5 percent of the profits and 1 percent of the adjusted gross \u2014 currently totaling about $2.5 million a year. The Public says it is putting most of the money into its cash reserves rather than its operating budget.In each case, the value of their share will increase as the show adds productions.\u2018The art of the trade. How the sausage gets made.\u2019Even before the profits or the royalties for \u201cHamilton\u201d are distributed, there is a more fundamental expense: the cost of putting on the show.Winches and chain motors are $3,200 a week.Dressers are $20,000 a week.And electrics and sound cost $28,000 a week.\u201cHamilton\u201d pays about $295,000 per week for the Richard Rodgers, a fee that covers rent as well as the house staff, musicians, stagehands and more.The show\u2019s cast and crew are paid about $220,000 altogether a week. Advertising costs a relatively low $80,000 per week, thanks to all the free publicity. But things like taxes, pensions, lawyers and equipment rentals add up.On the scale of Broadway musicals, \u201cHamilton,\u201d with its modest set and midsize cast, has moderate running costs. All in all, it costs about $650,000 a week to present the show on Broadway, or about $34 million a year. But it\u2019s proving to be one of the best investments in town.An article last Sunday about the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d misstated the point at which the show\u2019s performers began collectively pressing for profit-sharing. It was in August 2015, as the Broadway production was opening, not before the Off Broadway production opened.Ben Sisario, Alexandra Alter and Tiff Fehr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After MetLife Ruling, Regulators Push Back on \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byThe Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of regulators led by the Treasury Department, said in April that it would contest the decision, shortly after the ruling was handed down. Late Thursday, the government filed its first substantive brief in its appeal.The Dodd-Frank Act gave the council, which includes the heads of the banking agencies, the authority to designate large nonbanks as \u201csystemically important\u201d to prevent the kind of fallout seen from the near-collapse of American International Group during the height of the financial crisis. The institutions so designated will be subject to greater capital requirements and regulatory scrutiny.\u201cThe district court overturned the collective judgment of the heads of the nation\u2019s financial regulatory agencies that material distress at MetLife could pose a threat to the country\u2019s financial stability,\u201d the council, which is being represented by the Justice Department, said in the brief. \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling leaves one of the largest, most complex and most interconnected financial companies in the country without the regulatory oversight that Congress found essential.\u201dIn addition to MetLife, regulators have designated A.I.G., Prudential Financial and General Electric\u2019s finance unit, though G.E. has applied to have the \u201csystemically important\u201d label removed after shedding significant assets.MetLife, which filed its case against the government in January 2015, is the only company to combat the label in court so far. Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ultimately ruled in favor of the insurer in March.The judge said that the council had failed to assess the likelihood of MetLife\u2019s going under and the impact that severe material distress at the company would have on the financial system at large. Judge Collyer also said that regulators should have weighed the costs and benefits of the designation.The council sought to address those concerns head-on in its filing on Thursday with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, calling the lower court judge\u2019s analysis of its efforts \u201cprofoundly mistaken.\u201d It also argues that the financial reform law does not require the council to take into account costs or \u201cany other effect of designation on the company\u201d as part of its decision process.A MetLife spokesman declined to comment except to say said that the company \u201cwill respond to the government\u2019s brief in its own filing by Aug. 15.\u201dSupporters of the council will file amicus briefs with the court next week. A date has not been set for oral arguments, though the hearing is likely to be scheduled for sometime this fall.\u201cWe continue to believe that the council acted well within its legal authority in designating MetLife and are vigorously defending the council\u2019s work on appeal,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bitter \u2018Brexit\u2019 Campaign Could Turn on Record Number of Voters", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Politicians campaigning for and against British withdrawal from the European Union fanned out on Wednesday in a final, frenetic effort to build support on the eve of a referendum that could reshape the nation\u2019s place in the world and upend the Continent\u2019s dreams of closer integration.With polls showing a statistical dead heat, both sides went all-out to motivate their supporters to vote on Thursday, while financial markets and European leaders braced for the possibility that Britain could be the first nation to leave the 28-member bloc. Reflecting the stakes and the tension about the outcome, the tone of the campaigning remained negative to the end, complete with invocations of economic ruin and an allusion to the Nazis.Voters will be asked a single, simple question in the referendum: \u201cShould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u201dPrime Minister David Cameron closed out the campaign for remaining in the European Union with an argument that Britain will be more prosperous if it stays in the single European market of 500 million people \u2014 and he warned that there was no going back from a decision to leave.\u201cYou can\u2019t jump out the airplane and then clamber back through the cockpit hatch,\u201d he told the BBC.John Major, a former Conservative prime minister who also supports staying in the bloc, said that while the voters\u2019 wishes must be respected, \u201cIf they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the gravediggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer.\u201dBritain is voting on whether to remain in the European Union. How many countries are in the bloc? Can the queen vote? Test your knowledge of these and other important questions.The former London mayor Boris Johnson, a Conservative who is the most prominent face of the Leave campaign, crisscrossed the country on Wednesday, starting at London\u2019s Billingsgate fish market. He got a rousing ovation when he declared in a televised debate on Tuesday night that \u201cThursday can be our country\u2019s independence day.\u201dNigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, who has long campaigned against membership in the bloc, denounced the European Union as a project of elites, declaring, \u201cThis referendum is the people versus the establishment.\u201dBritain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dFinancial markets have been more confident that Britain will vote to stay in the bloc, with the pound rising in value against the dollar this week. On Wednesday, the pound held steady, close to its high against the dollar this year.Bettors, too, have been putting their money on the Remain camp\u2019s winning. On Wednesday afternoon, the odds implied an 80 percent chance of Britain voting to stay with Europe.One sign of hope for the Remain campaign: Most polls before the September 2014 referendum on whether Scotland should secede from the United Kingdom showed that contest to be neck-and-neck, but voters broke fairly decisively \u2014 55.3 percent to 44.7 percent \u2014 in favor of the status quo. Some analysts say the same tendency of late-deciding voters to break toward the safety of the status quo and away from the risk of change will be at play this time around.The general assumption is that those voters who want to quit the European Union, including older people, are more motivated than those who prefer to stay in Europe, including younger people, and that the Remain campaign will therefore face the bigger challenge in turning out its supporters.The Leave campaign\u2019s base of support is expected to be among low-income voters, those without university degrees, and older people. It is expected to run strongest in England.The Remain camp is likely to do well in London and other big cities, and with better-educated and more cosmopolitan voters. It is expected to perform strongly in Northern Ireland and in university towns, where students see advantages in being able to work freely in other European nations.Scotland is also strong territory for the Remain camp, though there is some evidence of political fatigue there.\u201cMy worry is turnout in Scotland and U.K.-wide,\u201d said Alyn Smith, a member of the European Parliament with the Scottish National Party, who backs the Remain camp. \u201cIt is quite clear that the people who have committed themselves to leave will crawl across glass to get to the polling stations and on the Remain side it\u2019s much more, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 \u201dLeaders in Europe have largely tried to avoid intervening in the referendum, though they have nearly universally urged British voters to remain, fearing a domino effect if Britain leaves, and a boost to populist parties that are growing in popularity, from Germany and the Netherlands to Greece and Spain.But Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, said in a televised interview on Tuesday that \u201cI would vote for Brexit, even though I believe that France has a thousand more reasons to leave the European Union than Great Britain does.\u201d She cited France\u2019s membership in the passport-free Schengen zone and in the eurozone. (Britain is not part of either.)\u201cWhat does it mean, whatever the result: that the European Union is decaying, that there are cracks everywhere \u2014 what do we do?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo we wait for the flood, do we wait for the explosion? Or do we get around a table and build the Europe of nations, which will replace the totalitarian European Union to which we are subjected today?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Executives see little overlap between the two businesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dan Schulman, Symantec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chairman, said in a news release. Blue Coat had filed plans to go public and did not formally put itself up for sale, but it received interest from potential buyers and held talks primarily with Symantec. The prospectus for its initial public offering said that Blue Coat lost $289 million on top of $598 million in sales for the 12 months ending April 30. But the company has been trying to expand under Bain Capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis represented a compelling opportunity for us because we could realize some gains for our investors but also reinvest into the combined company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital. Brooke Buchanan, a representative for Theranos, said the company would continue to do business using the stand-alone retail locations it already runs, apart from the Walgreens stores. It has five such locations in Arizona and one in California, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has rejected Theranos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best interests to terminate our partnership,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brad Fluegel, senior vice president of Walgreens, said in a news release. The 40 blood-draw sites inside Walgreens stores in Arizona were a primary source of revenue for Theranos, as well as mark of credibility. Having easily accessible locations in corner drugstores was part of Theranos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grand plan to upend the laboratory testing business. For its part, Walgreens had hoped to add lab testing to increase traffic to stores and pick up some of the cachet of being associated with a cutting-edge Silicon Valley start-up.  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story  end .ru-story Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israel Approves Additional Funding for Settlements in West Bank", "Date": "2016-06-19", "News": "Supported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli government on Sunday approved about $20 million in additional financing for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, underlining its strengthened right-wing orientation and raising the ire of political opponents and the Palestinians.In remarks before the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu, the leader of the conservative Likud Party, said the assistance plan was intended to strengthen security for the settlements, as well as to bolster small businesses and encourage tourism.Yariv Levin, the tourism minister, said in a statement that some of the money would \u201cprovide financial support for the construction of hotels in the main tourism areas in Judea and Samaria,\u201d referring to the West Bank by its biblical name.Israel considers the West Bank territory that it conquered from Jordan in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 to be disputed, not occupied, and says the fate of the settlements should be determined in negotiations.Under growing international pressure, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Lieberman recently affirmed their commitment to the principle of \u201ctwo states for two peoples,\u201d meaning the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but the Palestinians and others are skeptical about the Israelis\u2019 motives.\u201cIsrael is doing everything possible to sabotage every effort to achieve a just and lasting peace,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement after the Israeli government approved the settlement financing. \u201cIt is time for the international community to assume its responsibilities towards this extremist government that openly supports apartheid and stands against the two-state solution.\u201dWhile strengthening the settlements, Israel has continued to demolish unlicensed Palestinian homes and livestock pens in the part of the West Bank known as Area C, the more than 60 percent of the territory where Israel exercises full security and civil control.The financing measure was approved after months of deadly Palestinian attacks in and around the settlements, as well as in Jerusalem and in cities around Israel.But Amir Peretz, an Israeli legislator from the center-left Zionist Union and a former defense minister, said of the financing measure, \u201cThey are using the name of security baselessly, because the defense establishment will not abandon the settlers even without getting the millions it is getting today.\u201dMr. Peretz added that the allocation was \u201crubbing the salt in the wounds of those who need every shekel.\u201d He pointed to a cross-country protest march led by mayors of towns far from the center of Israel as they campaign for a fairer distribution of government funds for education and welfare.Ehud Barak, another former military chief and defense minister, who, as the leader of the center-left Labor Party, served a short and largely unsuccessful term as prime minister, said at the conference that \u201ca fanatic seed of extreme ideology has taken over the Likud.\u201dHe added that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s priority was not security but \u201ca slow and cunning advancement of the one-state solution agenda.\u201d Mr. Barak said that would lead to either an apartheid state or a binational state \u201cin which the Jews will become a minority within a couple of generations.\u201dLikud dismissed Mr. Barak, who also gave a lengthy television interview on Friday night, as a failed politician who was seeking attention. Mr. Netanyahu rejected Mr. Yaalon\u2019s criticism as politically motivated, saying in a statement, \u201cYou cannot express full confidence in the leadership when you are on the inside and say the absolute opposite when you are on the outside.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Security Council Condemns Nuclear Test by North Korea", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea for its nuclear test on Wednesday, but there was no evidence yet that the North\u2019s most powerful backer, China, was willing to stiffen sanctions in a way that could push the unpredictable country to the point of collapse or slow its nuclear progress.A two-hour closed session of the Security Council on Wednesday afternoon ended with a pledge to \u201cbegin to work immediately\u201d on a resolution containing additional measures to rein in Pyongyang. It did not specify what those measures could be, and in the past, China and Russia have usually objected to steps that could threaten the North\u2019s survival. The most obvious would be a prohibition on loading or unloading North Korean ships around the world, or on financial transactions with the nation.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, did not indicate the basis for the administration\u2019s skepticism of Pyongyang\u2019s claim. But more than a month ago, when Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s young leader, boasted that he possessed the technology for a hydrogen bomb, American officials said they had a variety of evidence \u2014 some technical, some from human sources \u2014 to call that claim into question.A hydrogen bomb would be far more powerful, and more fearsome, than the type of nuclear weapon the North has tested three times since 2006, when it conducted its first test during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.A South Korean Defense Ministry official, who requested anonymity to speak about a national security matter, said Thursday that the ministry believed that even if the device was a boosted fission bomb, the test was probably a failure. The explosive yield was even smaller than that from the North\u2019s last and third nuclear test, in early 2013, he said. \u201cEven a boosted fission bomb produces a yield bigger than this, so we don\u2019t think this is a successful test of a boosted fission bomb either,\u201d he added. But the true nature of the test may not be revealed until results are back from atmospheric testing, usually conducted by Air Force planes that run along the North Korean coast \u201csniffing\u201d for byproducts of an explosion. Yet after the test in 2013, such inquiries were inconclusive. \u201cWe may never know,\u201d said one intelligence official involved in the testing. \u201cThe technology is pretty hit-and-miss.\u201dGary Samore, Mr. Obama\u2019s top nuclear adviser in the president\u2019s first term, said Wednesday that the timing of the test was strange, with North and South Korea discussing restoring some economic ties and the North trying to reach out to the Chinese. North Korea claimed on Wednesday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, the most powerful kind of nuclear weapon.President Obama said nothing in public about the test, in contrast to Mr. Bush, who responded to the first North Korean test in 2006 by declaring that the North would be held responsible if its bomb technology were found anywhere else in the world. Advisers said Mr. Obama was calculating that Mr. Kim was looking to get a rise out of him. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to give him the satisfaction,\u201d one aide said.On Wednesday evening, the White House said that Mr. Obama had spoken by telephone with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, reassuring both of America\u2019s support. \u201cI know this sounds like a crazy reason to set off a nuclear test,\u201d one American intelligence official said. \u201cBut stranger things have provoked North Korean action.\u201dBut it is far from clear that all the major players with a stake in what the North does are willing to take the kind of risks, and impose the kind of sanctions, that might prompt Pyongyang to back down or, alternatively, to lash out.Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, argued that stiffening existing sanctions, while sending a political message, would be insufficient. \u201cRatcheting up sanctions pressure demonstrates that there is a cost to violating Security Council resolutions,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cHowever, sanctions alone are not going to change Pyongyang\u2019s behavior. North Korea has complex illicit trafficking networks for evading sanctions, and not all countries in the region are adequately enforcing existing measures.\u201d The one time the United States did clearly get the North\u2019s attention was when it cut off bank accounts in Macau that Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, used to finance the lifestyle of the North Korean elite. But eventually, the Bush administration had to lift that sanction, partly under pressure from allies. On Wednesday, American allies engaged in a now-familiar set of rituals. Ms. Park convened an urgent meeting of her top national security aides in Seoul. Japan\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, told reporters after the Security Council meeting that his government expected the Council to adopt a robust resolution to check North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions. The American ambassador, Samantha Power, called for a \u201ctough, comprehensive and credible package of new sanctions.\u201d But the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, would say only that a \u201cproportionate response\u201d was necessary. For Mr. Kim, there was some domestic politics in all this. His Workers\u2019 Party is scheduled to hold its first full-fledged congress since 1980 this May. With no big improvements in the lives of his people, he needs something else to show for his four-year rule.\u201cThe biggest achievement Kim Jong-un can offer ahead of the party congress is his nuclear program,\u201d said Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt also means that things don\u2019t look good in the economic sector.\u201dSomini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, David E.

{"Headline": "Guaranteed Income for All? Switzerland\u2019s Voters Say No Thanks", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 Swiss voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to guarantee an income to Switzerland\u2019s residents, whether or not they are employed, an idea that has also been raised in other countries amid an intensifying debate over wealth disparities and dwindling employment opportunities.About 77 percent of voters rejected a plan to give a basic monthly income of 2,500 Swiss francs, or about $2,560, to each adult, and 625 francs for each child under 18, regardless of employment status, to fight poverty and social inequality and guarantee a \u201cdignified\u201d life to everyone.Switzerland was the first country to vote on such a universal basic income plan, but other countries and cities either have been considering the idea or have started trial programs.Finland is set to introduce a pilot program for a random sample of about 10,000 adults who will each receive a monthly handout of 550 euros, about $625. The intent is to turn the two-year trial into a national plan if it proves successful.In the Netherlands, Utrecht is leading a group of municipalities that are experimenting with similar pilot projects.In Switzerland, opponents warned that the proposal would derail an economic model that, far from showing signs of near-collapse, has allowed the country to remain among those with the highest living standards in the world, even with a growing and aging population. Switzerland has an unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent, less than half the average in the European Union.The backers of the plan did not detail how it would be financed. But the Swiss government and almost all the main political parties had urged voters to turn down the guaranteed income plan, warning that it would require raising an additional 25 billion Swiss francs a year through deep spending cuts or tax increases.Some opponents of a Swiss guaranteed income also attacked it as a return to Marxist economics, even if the idea has far older roots, dating to the 16th-century writings of Thomas More and the 18th-century works of Thomas Paine.After World War II, the concept of a guaranteed income was promoted as a way of redistributing income by some free-market economists led by Milton Friedman, who in part argued that it would be more efficient than the bureaucracy of running dozens of separate programs to help the poor.Still, the current discussion, in Switzerland and elsewhere, has been not only about wealth redistribution but also about how modern societies can continue to create jobs while pushing technological advances such as factory robots and driverless trucks.Campaigners in favor of a guaranteed income used robots as street stunts to warn what the jobless society of the future would entail. Some people gave out 10-franc notes at the Zurich\u2019s main train station while supporters in Geneva set up, on a public esplanade, a giant banner that asked, \u201cWhat would you do if your income were taken care of?\u201d\u201cI understand that a new generation is worried about how and where young people will next find work, but this proposal was pure nonsense,\u201d said Curdin Pirovino, a Swiss industrial designer. \u201cYou cannot give a society the idea that money is available for doing nothing.\u201dBut at a Sunday market in Geneva, several people defended the proposal in the context of returning to a more equitable society.Some also presented their vote as another challenge to industrialization, similar to their motivation for buying organic food from the stalls of local farmers rather than cheaper supermarkets. A third of voters in Geneva backed the idea of a guaranteed income.\u201cWe\u2019re losing all our values, creating countries that no longer need workers but still need consumers, but how can we expect people to buy anything if they can\u2019t earn a salary tomorrow?\u201d asked Olivier Duchene, a musician and street entertainer.Despite the clear defeat, campaigners said the vote was a first step toward a fairer economic model.\u201cOne out of five people voted for the unconditional basic income, so that is a success in itself,\u201d Sergio Rossi, an economics professor who backed the initiative, told STA, the Swiss news agency.Switzerland\u2019s model of direct democracy, in which citizens can collect signatures to force a national referendum on a proposal, has helped turn the country into a laboratory for pioneering social and economic changes.Referendums are gaining ground in other European countries that normally rely on a system of parliamentary democracy.But in Switzerland, the proliferation of such votes has provoked a debate over the ease with which complicated or radical issues can be brought to a referendum. Low voter turnout has also become an issue. About 46 percent of eligible Swiss voters went to the polls on Sunday, when four other national issues and several regional issues were voted on.Philippe Leuba, a regional politician, said on Swiss national radio on Sunday that it was positive that voters had followed the advice of their federal government. But he still deplored the fact that the proposal for guaranteed income had gotten so far, calling it a \u201chyper-populist and demagogic\u201d plan to give away money for nothing.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the subject of the Swiss referendum on Sunday. The vote was on a guaranteed income, not a minimum wage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mystic, the Monk and the Play Brought to You by Powerball", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byIt sounds like the setup for some kind of droll joke: A lottery winner and a rhinoceros arrive at the birthday party for a dead mystic. Art, and a blowout brawl, ensues.The back story of \u201cThe Glory of the World,\u201d in some ways, includes Mr. Mee\u2019s childhood, in a Catholic home where the living room shelves were lined with dozens of books by Merton. It also involves Mr. Cockrum\u2019s time as a monk, when, while living under a vow of poverty, he decided that if he were ever to have money, he would use it to fund theater.But, most of all, it starts with a walk.Mr. Waters set about reading, or trying to read, 10 of the roughly 70 books Merton wrote, and in 2014, he called Mr. Mee, a New York-based playwright and author who had often worked at the Actors Theater. The next year, 2015, would be the centennial of Merton\u2019s birth; would Mr. Mee be interested in a commission to write about the mystic for the theater\u2019s 39th Humana Festival of New American Plays?Mr. Mee was enthusiastic. He had been raised in a family with several priests and nuns and a fondness for Merton\u2019s work. \u201cI think I know Merton pretty well,\u201d he said. But he also issued a warning, telling Mr. Waters, \u201cI\u2019d love to do that, except, you know I\u2019m an ex-Catholic, so whatever I do might get you thrown out of Louisville.\u201dMr. Waters was unfazed, and the work began.The writer and director have been collaborating for years, most notably on \u201cBig Love,\u201d which also started in Louisville and moved to BAM, and they quickly agreed on a few basic elements for \u201cThe Glory of the World.\u201dThe play would be set at a 100th birthday party for Merton, at which the celebrants would quarrel over how to describe a multifaceted man who was a Trappist monk, a prolific writer, a champion of nonviolence and a friend to Eastern religions before dying at 53 of an accidental electrocution in Thailand.All of the actors would be men, reflecting the community in which Merton lived. And the play would begin, and end, in silence.\u201cThe Glory of the World,\u201d which requires an unusually large cast of 17, is neither a biography of nor a tribute to Merton but rather an exploration of how to think about a complicated historical figure, and, in the process, how to think about ourselves. Over the course of the play, the characters offer different takes, often in the form of toasts to Merton \u2014 celebrating him as a pacifist, a Communist, a meditator, a bohemian and so on.\u201cPeople who want Merton to be like a box full of kittens may not find this to their liking,\u201d said Mr. Waters, who described the production as \u201ca party.\u201d Mr. Mee said the play \u201ctakes Merton as one of the fantastic examples of how really rich a human being can be\u201d and the production is \u201cthis fantastic physical spectacle.\u201dThe rhinoceros appears because Merton once wrote an essay called \u201cRain and the Rhinoceros.\u201d The brawl is unusually long (14 minutes) and vivid. And the silence can be, intentionally, unsettling; at the start of the play, an actor (often Mr. Waters) walks onstage and sits, with his back to the audience. The length of the silence is \u201ceither interminable, or shockingly short,\u201d Mr. Waters said, depending on your tolerance.\u201cIt makes some people in an audience uncomfortable, because it denies something that you think is going to happen in a theater piece \u2014 something is being withdrawn, and it throws you off balance,\u201d he added. \u201cSometimes the tension is very palpable. There was one night in Louisville when I heard very distinctly a woman\u2019s voice, \u2018Is this all it\u2019s going to be?\u2019\u201dAmong the enthusiasts was Mr. Cockrum, who has been traveling the country visiting regional theaters as he looks for projects to support. The play was the seventh production he saw in three days at the Humana Festival.\u201cI was just smitten,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell in love. It drew me in. I leaned to the person next to me, as the house lights came up, and said, \u2018If ever I\u2019m going to be a commercial producer, this is going to be it.\u2019\u201dHe was particularly struck by the audience response.\u201cThere was this buzz \u2014 people were talking about the play,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were really engaged with each other about what the play had done for them, or to them, or with them.\u201dMr. Cockrum said Merton had been \u201cvery influential in my own spiritual journey\u201d and that \u201cI didn\u2019t read all 70 of his books, I don\u2019t think, but I might have, or pieces of all of them.\u201d When Mr. Cockrum was a monk, living at the Society of Saint John the Evangelist\u2019s monastery in Cambridge, Mass., he kept a prayer by Merton framed on a dresser in his cell.\u201cI promised myself then that if ever I had a pile of dough for some reason, that\u2019s what I would try to make happen,\u201d he said.As for the play\u2019s future, he said, \u201cI\u2019m focused strictly on this production \u2014 I want to make this the best it can be.\u201dFor Mr. Cockrum, the play was an obvious choice.\u201cIt has a monastic resonance for me that I recognized \u2014 the conversations that these men had between each other onstage were not unlike the conversations that happen in a cloistered environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of examination, that kind of deep, philosophical, what is sacred, what isn\u2019t sacred, goes on all the time in religious communities.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this because it\u2019s religious; I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s a great play that spoke to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Morgan Stanley Deal Makers Reunite on Exchange Merger", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The main investment bankers involved in the merger between Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange worked at one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest companies, Morgan Stanley, the last time the two exchanges flirted with the idea of getting married.Today, the bankers are no longer at Morgan Stanley. Rather, in a sign of the fast-changing landscape on Wall Street, they compete with their old company, operating out of boutique investment banks that did not even exist in late 2004, when the two exchanges last tangoed.Perella Weinberg Partners, one of whose founders is Joseph R. Perella, a former head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley, is leading a clutch of banks representing the Deutsche B\u00f6rse.The main banker for the London Stock Exchange is Simon Robey, who was co-chairman of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley and today runs his own firm, Robey Warshaw.A onetime rival for the London Stock Exchange \u2014 Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE \u2014 was helped by Caroline Silver, the former head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s European financial institutions group. Ms. Silver, who is now at Moelis & Company, was working with her former employer to upend the talks between the Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange. ICE said recently that it would not make an offer for the London exchange.This decade-old diaspora from Morgan Stanley clustered around one deal underscores the changing market for merger advice. Increasingly, boutique and independent investment banks have prospered as companies turn to them instead of the big global banks.Without even counting the potential fees on the London Stock Exchange deal, boutique and independent companies represented 30.5 percent of the $5.35 billion in completed merger fees in the first quarter of this year, according to Thomson Reuters, which tracks corporate finance activity.Last year, of the $26.1 billion in fees that were paid to Wall Street for merger deals, 31.3 percent went to boutique and independent investment banks, compared with 23.8 percent in 2005, when the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse last flirted with merging.The shift is remarkable particularly for a company like Morgan Stanley, which for much of its history prided itself on taking a firm public and then catering to all its banking needs, like raising debt or providing additional equity financing and advising on mergers and takeovers.Decades ago, when young bankers joined Morgan Stanley, executives would trot out one of the company\u2019s oldest clients, the telecommunications giant AT&T, as an illustration of the kind of company Morgan Stanley served.\u201cWe did almost everything for them,\u201d recalled Scott Moeller, who was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley from the early \u201880s to 1996 and is now director of the M.&A. Research Center at the City University London\u2019s Cass Business School.The more specialized advisory banks may be gaining, but Morgan Stanley is still a powerhouse, showing the durability of the global giants. Last year, the investment bank ranked No. 2 in worldwide mergers and acquisitions, with a market share of 29 percent in announced deals, behind Goldman Sachs with 34 percent of the market, according to Thomson Reuters.Morgan Stanley did not advise either the London Stock Exchange or Deutsche B\u00f6rse when they tried to merge in 2004. But after the French-born Xavier Rolet, a former Lehman Brothers executive, was appointed chief executive of the London exchange in 2009, he met with Mr. Robey, who also headed Morgan Stanley\u2019s British operations.Over the next few years, Mr. Robey helped Mr. Rolet frame his vision for the London Stock Exchange. In 2011, he assisted Mr. Rolet in orchestrating the London exchange\u2019s acquisition of the 50 percent stake in FTSE International that it did not already own. That same year, he also advised on the failed merger attempt by the London Stock Exchange and the TMX Group, the parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange.Their relationship deepened after Mr. Robey, 55, left Morgan Stanley in January 2013. He later teamed up with Simon Warshaw, former co-head of investment banking at UBS, to start a new firm.Robey Warshaw has only 14 employees. It takes up four floors of a stately Georgian townhouse on St. James Place in London; one of its neighbors is the British banker Jacob Rothschild. But last year, Robey Warshaw was ranked No. 16 in announced global mergers and acquisitions with a 4.5 percent market share.Mr. Robey and Mr. Rolet forged a friendship.In the summer of 2014, Mr. Rolet invited Mr. Robey to visit him at his vineyard in Provence, France. During the trip, Mr. Robey joined other guests of Mr. Rolet\u2019s at a performance of \u201cNabucco,\u201d an opera by Verdi that was part of a summer opera festival held in an ancient Roman theater north of Avignon.As a young man, Mr. Robey nearly pursued a career as a professional singer. He attended Oxford University on a choral scholarship. Today, he indulges his passion for music by overseeing the board of trustees at the Royal Opera House in London\u2019s Covent Garden.In November 2014, when Mr. Robey remarried, Mr. Rolet and his wife, Nicole, attended his wedding.In the case of Perella Weinberg, it was actually a Goldman Sachs alumnus that cemented ties with Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s new chief executive, Carsten Kengeter.When Peter A. Weinberg was chief executive of Goldman Sachs International in London more than a decade ago, he got to know Mr. Kengeter, a fast-rising fixed-income executive in Goldman\u2019s Frankfurt offices.The two kept up with each other when Mr. Weinberg left Goldman to start a merger advisory boutique with Mr. Perella.As it happens, Mr. Weinberg was also at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s. But he did not overlap with Mr. Perella, who joined the bank in 1993. The two men knew each other because Mr. Perella had gone to Harvard Business School on a scholarship established by Mr. Weinberg\u2019s grandfather, Sidney J. Weinberg.In the early days of Perella Weinberg, when some Wall Street rivals sniffed at the new banking upstart, Mr. Kengeter was welcoming. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Kengeter and his boss, Oswald Gr\u00fcbel, the chief executive of UBS at the time, invited Mr. Perella and Mr. Weinberg to an investment banker\u2019s dream: a dinner with some of UBS\u2019s biggest clients.Andrew Bednar, a merger banker for Perella Weinberg in New York, had also developed a relationship with some of the executives at Deutsche B\u00f6rse.Several years ago, a former Goldman partner, Duncan L. Niederauer, who at the time was chief executive of NYSE Euronext, hired Perella Weinberg to work on a plan to create the world\u2019s biggest exchange by marrying the New York exchange with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Even though European Union regulators vetoed the deal in February 2012, Mr. Bednar became better acquainted with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse team during the friendly merger talks.In late 2012, when ICE announced that it would acquire the New York Stock Exchange, leaving Perella Weinberg without a client in the exchange arena, Mr. Bednar began courting Deutsche B\u00f6rse.In June 2015, soon after Mr. Kengeter took over as chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Mr. Weinberg sat down with him. Like any new chief executive, Mr. Kengeter charged his team with thinking about the exchange\u2019s future and areas of exploration. Later that summer, Mr. Bednar also met with Mr. Kengeter on a trip to Frankfurt.The meetings were a prelude to a get-together between Mr. Kengeter and Mr. Rolet, who knew each other, having both worked in Europe for Goldman Sachs.Left out, now that ICE has decided against making a counterbid, is Ms. Silver, who was behind some of the biggest mergers between exchanges, including advising the New York Stock Exchange Euronext on its acquisition by ICE several years ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping Jobs for India Follow, Modi Clears Investors\u2019 Path", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byWhile the economy is still hampered by the country\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies and sprawling bureaucracy, the changes represent a greater shift away from the socialist and protectionist policies of India\u2019s modern post-independence history. The new rules will allow foreign investors to establish 100 percent ownership in companies involved in defense, civil aviation and food products, although with government approval.India\u2019s latest reports on job creation may have tipped the scales in favor of further economic liberalization, some experts said. Domestic data showed weak employment numbers in the last quarter of 2015 in jewelry, automobiles and information technology, compared with a year earlier.India began life as an independent country in 1947 with a heavily controlled, protectionist economy. It changed course in 1991 when a balance-of-payments crisis forced the government to loosen its controls on industry and reduce barriers to imports, among other things.Those changes are credited with spurring India\u2019s transformation into the fastest-growing large economy in the world. But its growth rate of 7.6 percent is too slow to provide jobs for the one million people entering the work force each month. The previous government, and Mr. Modi\u2019s, had promised further liberalization.Mr. Modi has struggled to enact the major changes he promised, such as making it easier for companies to acquire land, because his party does not control the upper house of Parliament. Monday\u2019s policy shifts required only the approval of his top administration.Still, Mr. Modi is expected to win passage in July of a new law to allow the imposition of a uniform goods and services tax on the country, in place of the state-by-state taxation, making it easier for businesses to operate nationally. The tax change, together with new rules on foreign investment, could have as significant an impact on India\u2019s economy as the 1991 reforms.Particularly significant on Monday was the change allowing 100 percent foreign investment in defense companies in India, Mr. Bhalla and others said.\u201cWith this liberalization, we would expect again some manufacturing activity in defense products to come in,\u201d Shaktikanta Das, secretary of economic affairs at the Ministry of Finance, told reporters in New Delhi. \u201cThe driving force behind the whole thing is that all these investments should facilitate creation of jobs.\u201dPrevious rules, which all but required a local majority stake, had scared off foreign weapons makers who feared losing control of valuable technology, said Ben Moores, a defense analyst at IHS Jane\u2019s, a global intelligence firm.Mr. Moores said the change would expose the big Indian defense companies, like Tata Advanced Systems and Hindustan Aeronautics, to competitive pressures for the first time.The Indian government plans to award more than 800 defense contracts worth $76.5 billion over the next 10 years, he said, on combat aircraft, tanks, anti-submarine equipment and more.There are benefits for smaller Indian companies as well, Mr. Moores said. Not only will their larger rivals potentially face direct, heavyweight competition from abroad, smaller companies will have opportunities to partner with outside defense contractors to gain expertise and domestic market share.India also relaxed its requirements that single-brand retail outlets purchase 30 percent of their supplies locally.This requirement has posed an obstacle to foreign investors who have been unable to find local sources. Apple, eager to expand its retail operations in India, had sought an exemption from this local sourcing requirement earlier this year but the Indian government appeared reluctant to comply.Under the new rules, foreign retail outlets will be given a three-year reprieve on the local sourcing requirement that could be extended to an additional five years, if the products being sold are \u201cstate of the art\u201d and \u201ccutting edge\u201d technology, the government said in its announcement.An Apple spokeswoman said the company was evaluating the new rules and had no immediate comment. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, visited India this year and met with Mr. Modi to discuss retail and manufacturing in the country, the Indian government said.Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a technology consulting firm in New Delhi, said the new rules removed a large hurdle to foreign single-brand retailers like Apple that wanted to open stores in India.\u201cThis will permit Apple to open its own stores and control the complete experience of the brand and the product,\u201d Mr. Singhal said.The new pharmaceutical rules, allowing foreign firms to purchase portions of Indian drug companies, were also seen as a positive development.But some consumer advocates worried that easier foreign investment could also undermine India\u2019s role as the supplier of inexpensive generic drugs to poor countries throughout the world.\u201cThis is perhaps going to make it even easier for the bigger pharmaceutical companies to control India as a competitor in the global marketplace,\u201d said Tahir Amin, co-founder of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, a New York-based nonprofit organization that works on access to medicines by challenging certain patents on drugs. \u201cMy prediction is the Indian generic marketplace is going to look very different in five years.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on June 21 about the Indian government\u2019s announcement of new rules to ease foreign investment referred incorrectly to a development involving Raghuram G. Rajan, governor of India\u2019s central bank, that took place two days previously and affected the timing of the announcement. Mr. Rajan said he would not continue for a second term as governor; he did not resign.Reporting was contributed by Gerry Doyle and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong, Vindu Goel from San Francisco, and Andrew Pollack from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

He called it \u201cthe final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land.\u201d\u201cI honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy,\u201d Mr. Modi added.Indian leaders have long been skeptical of American military power and have often been deeply critical of the Vietnam War and other military interventions by the United States. Celebrating American war dead, though, was a telling signal of what both sides say is a very different relationship between the two countries.Mr. Modi has encouraged a continued American military presence in Afghanistan because he is worried that Pakistan will have unchallenged influence there once the Americans leave.\u201cYour contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated,\u201d Mr. Modi said, adding: \u201cA commitment to rebuild a peaceful and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective.\u201dThe different references to Afghanistan are a measure of just how much relations between the world\u2019s largest democracies have changed in three decades.In another sign of a break with the past, Mr. Modi gave a strong endorsement for global institutions, most of them created with American leadership.\u201cGrowing uncertainties and political complexities \u2014 our engagement can make a difference by promoting cooperation, not dominance,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cConnectivity, not isolation. Inclusive, not exclusive mechanism. Respect for global commons and, above all, for international rules and norms.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s decision to accelerate already-warming ties with the United States has been greeted in Washington with excitement and surprise.On Tuesday, he held meetings at the White House with President Obama, where the two leaders formalized a wide range of agreements covering climate change, renewable energy, security and economic issues. Before Congress, Mr. Modi also repeated that India was open for business.Mr. Modi is eager for greater foreign investment, and although he has failed to deliver many fundamental reforms that would make business easier to conduct there, the smaller steps he has taken and his obvious enthusiasm have persuaded some major investors to give India a try.In his speech, Mr. Modi gave a nod to his difficulties in passing much of his economic reform agenda. Although Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority in the Lok Sabha, India\u2019s lower house of Parliament, it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.\u201cMr. Speaker, I\u2019m informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is harmonious,\u201d Mr. Modi said to laughter. \u201cI\u2019m also told that you\u2019re well known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.\u201d\u201cThe protection of the environment and caring of the planet is central to our vision of a just world,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cfor us in India to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient beliefs.\u201dBut, he said, \u201cOur partnership aims to balance responsibility and capacity and focuses on new ways to increase availability of renewable energy.\u201dMr. Modi has vowed to sharply increase the growth of solar power in India, but Indian diplomats have also pushed for commitments from the United States to make new solar power technologies available as cheaply as possible, either by waiving intellectual property fees or by providing favorable financing.\u201cThis has been the goal of our efforts in G20 and climate change summits,\u201d Mr. Modi said, to a mixed ovation \u2014 lawmakers on the Democratic side of the aisle stood and clapped, while those on the Republican side mostly stayed seated.Mr. Modi was forceful in his condemnation of global terrorism, a subject he dwelt on at length. \u201cNot just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,\u201d he said, adding in a clear reference to Pakistan: \u201cAlthough its shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India\u2019s neighborhood.\u201dIndia\u2019s long rivalry with Pakistan has meant that India has been a target of terror attacks funded and encouraged by Pakistan, most famously in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008.Some members of Congress have criticized Mr. Modi\u2019s human rights record, but the politics of a visit by an Indian leader have also changed. Before Mr. Modi spoke, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced more than a dozen members of Congress who were said to be escorting Mr. Modi into the chamber.There are 3.5 million Indian-Americans, and they are a highly successful immigrant group with both wealth and deep community connections, making them sought after by politicians. In just one example, some 40 percent of hotel rooms in the United States are owned or managed by Indian-Americans, according to Arun K. Singh, India\u2019s ambassador to the United States.An article on Thursday about an address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to a joint meeting of the United States Congress misstated the year of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

And some of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi, including BlackRock and Tiger Global. (Some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.)The question between now and the probable initial public offering in a few years is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.Shares in Credit Suisse have sunk by more than 50 percent since Mr. Thiam took over last summer. Last week, its stock touched a new low of 11.8 Swiss francs, or about $12.25, but recovered a little and closed at 12.83 Swiss francs on Monday. Mr. Thiam has been blunt about how the bank needed to shift from its model of riskier, capital-intensive trading and banking business toward providing financial services to wealthy clients in fast-growing emerging markets. But his brusque manner and the perception that he is not making the same sacrifices that he asks of the bankers have created tension. Mr. Herro also said that he saw no need for Credit Suisse to raise new funds.Stan Miranda, the chief executive at Partners Capital in London, said his fund had put on smaller trades and  expected sterling to fall as much as 15 percent on an exit vote. Banks have also scaled back risk limits, partly because of postcrisis regulations, and market makers have been scarred by the sharp moves that came after the Swiss National Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to ditch its currency cap in 2015.

In the case of General Electric, the magic number looks to be about $50 billion.The American industrial conglomerate, led by Jeffrey R.

The market capitalization benefits of reduced financial significance have been accruing for some time.The council, America\u2019s top financial watchdog, made the designation three years ago, and the company decided to break the shackles in April last year. In what will go down as a swift exercise in dismantling a lending business, G.E. has jettisoned $200 billion of assets. It seems to have achieved the fire-sale pace while avoiding singeing shareholders with low prices.Since G.E. announced its plans to offload almost all of GE Capital\u2019s assets \u2013 it is keeping a few operations involved in financing big-ticket items like energy turbines \u2013 the company\u2019s stock has added about $5.25 a share, or roughly $50 billion in overall market capitalization.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Last Chance", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico is also a humanitarian crisis. The Senate now has an opportunity \u2014 and the obligation \u2014 to address both. It is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on a bill already approved by the House that would restructure the island\u2019s debts and could create the conditions for recovery.If the bill loses, Puerto Rico will default on Friday on a $2 billion debt payment, creditors will keep suing for full repayment and essential services on the island, including health, sanitation, education, electricity, public transportation and public safety, will continue to decline.Even so, the bill\u2019s passage is in doubt. Senators in both parties have objected to the yes-or-no nature of the vote, saying they want to amend the bill. But amendments would likely kill the bill, in part because it passed the House only after negotiations and compromise among both parties and the White House. Even if the House were inclined to pass an amended bill, it could not do so before the July 1 default date because it is not in session.The bill is bitter medicine. In exchange for letting Puerto Rico restructure its debt in a federal process similar to bankruptcy, it requires the island\u2019s government to submit to the decisions and oversight of a financial control board that would manage the restructuring. The bill also exempts Puerto Rico from having to obey labor law on overtime pay and grants the island\u2019s governor the power to authorize sub-minimum wages for workers younger than 25.Those drawbacks, however, do not outweigh the benefits. The bill would fight poverty by adequately financing public pensions. It would also impose a stay, or pause, in litigation by hedge funds and other creditors, a move to ensure that scarce public money is not diverted to creditors while the restructuring is underway.The alternative is chaotic default and escalating human misery. Without a restructuring process that puts all claims on the table, creditors \u2014 who were or should have been aware of the risks in lending money to Puerto Rico \u2014 will never have an incentive to accept less than full repayment. The entire burden of the debt would fall on Puerto Ricans.There is no better solution at hand than the bill now before the Senate. A \u201cno\u201d vote would be a vote for Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors and against its people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Credit Suisse Tries to Overhaul Its Image, but Problems Remain", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneWall Street\u2019s efforts to overhaul its culture since the 2008 financial crisis that nearly bankrupted the world\u2019s economy have not been a resounding success, despite calls by prominent regulators to stop rewarding bad behavior.William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and one of Wall Street\u2019s most important overseers, has twice held closed-door sessions at the bank, located in downtown Manhattan, to urge top banking executives to overhaul the behavior inside their companies. His goal has been to get bankers to think about what they should do instead of what they can do and get away with.Some banks just don\u2019t get the message. Take Credit Suisse, the large Swiss bank that over the years has swallowed up two of Wall Street\u2019s premiere investment banks, First Boston and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, to form the core of its investment-banking practice. It has been a rough 2016 for the bank and its new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, who is facing a revolt from some of his employees after he suggested that Credit Suisse would start de-emphasizing investment banking after an unexpected $1 billion or so of trading losses in the last two quarters.In March, in an effort to right the ship on the credit side of the investment bank, Credit Suisse named Brian Chin, the chief of structured finance, and David Miller, the chief of credit products, to be co-chiefs of Credit Suisse\u2019s global markets credit division. This is yet another big job for Mr. Miller, with lots of responsibility and high pay, but his appointment sends exactly the wrong message about the values and behavior that a Wall Street bank should be rewarding.Mr. Miller, you may recall, was the bank\u2019s architect, starting in 2004, of a new syndicated loan product \u2013 called a dividend recapitalization loan \u2013 that allowed big-time real estate developers in the Western half of the United States to borrow based on the inflated valuation of their projects, pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of dividends and lay the risk at the doorstep of new investors whom Mr. Miller and his team had lined up.From 2004 to 2006, Mr. Miller and Credit Suisse arranged for $5 billion of these kinds of loans, which were then sold to investors. The deals produced hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the bank, a high percentage of which, of course, went into the pockets of Mr. Miller and his team. From 2004 to 2008, Mr. Miller received compensation of $23.1 million, including $7.2 million in 2006.In the end, all of the loans blew up, and investors lost billions. Soured deals include $375 million in loans to the Yellowstone Club, an hour outside of Bozeman, Mont.; $250 million to the Tamarack Resort in Idaho; $540 million to Lake Las Vegas, a 3,592-acre golf community in Nevada; $275 million to Promontory, a 10-square-mile second-home resort outside Park City, Utah; $400 million to the Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii; and $675 million to the Ginn resorts in Port St. Lucie, Fla.; Naples, Fla.; Boone, N.C.; and the Bahamas.After each of the developments ended up in Bankruptcy Court, a federal bankruptcy judge admonished the Credit Suisse bankers by calling the loans \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d from the outset.An affiliate of Highland Capital Management, a hedge fund based in Dallas, argued in a lawsuit that \u201cCredit Suisse was motivated by naked greed in perpetrating its fraudulent scheme.\u201d (In September, Highland Capital won a $287.5 million judgment against Credit Suisse related to losses stemming from its participation in a refinancing of Lake Las Vegas before it went into bankruptcy; Credit Suisse is appealing the ruling, and the judgment has not yet been paid pending the appeal. Highland Capital affiliates are also suing Credit Suisse in New York State over additional losses related to other deals.)Emails released as part of the litigation give a glimpse of the type of culture that Mr. Miller fostered in his group and its seeming lack of accountability.In a Sept. 22, 2004, in an internal email to other Credit Suisse executives, Mr. Miller promoted the soon-to-close Lake Las Vegas deal \u2014 the bank\u2019s first \u201cdividend recapitalization loan.\u201d He bragged about how the development\u2019s half-owners, the wealthy Bass brothers of Texas, were going to get what turned out to be a $469 million dividend.Fellow Credit Suisse bankers marveled at the deal\u2019s ingenuity for creating new business seemingly out of nowhere. \u201cYou must have the biggest and deepest dredge known to mankind,\u201d Grant Pothast, then head of the bank\u2019s distressed loan group, wrote to Mr. Miller. Responded Mr. Miller, \u201cI go wherever I can find a fee,\u201d while noting that the bank would be making $9 million on the deal.

It was done in a much more futuristic way, but the elements are still there,\u201d says Callum.A lightweight chassis complemented the engine and allowed for maximum weight-to-power ratio.\u201cAerodynamically the bodywork of the car was extremely sophisticated and ahead of its time,\u201d says Preston Lerner, Journalist and Ford GT Historian. \u201cThat enabled the car to achieve speeds that had never been seen before at Le Mans.\u201dThe Ford GT40 adopted new design and engineering principles such as the mid-mounted engine, a modified version of those that came in production cars like the Ford Galaxy.Mulsanne StraightThree miles of pure straightaway where Ford GT40s reached speeds over 200 mph.Beginning in fall 2013, Ford workers began to notice some colleagues coming and going from an inconspicuous door in the basement of Ford\u2019s product development center. For more than a year, the door remained locked for everyone except a handful of Ford employees who were made privy to what lay behind: the converted storage space where Ford\u2019s brightest minds would create the new Ford GT.\u201cThere were probably only 20, 25 people in Ford who knew about the project,\u201d says Callum. \u201cPeople knew something was going on behind these doors, but no one knew what.\u201dThe secrecy would allow the company to develop the Ford GT in record time, not only to premiere the basis of a production model by January 2015 at the Detroit Auto Show, but also to prepare for a 2016 return to Le Mans.\u201cWe wanted to truly surprise the industry with this product,\u201d says Dave Pericak, global director of Ford Performance.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to bring the auto show back to what it should have always been, which was surprise and a bit of a delight that this is not only a concept car, this is real.

One of the speediest straightaways in racing history includes two chicanes and a slight right turn known as the Mulsanne Kink, followed by a more-than-90-\u00addegree corner. Moments later the track hurls two equally challenging tests, corners known as Indianapolis and Arnage. The factors combined have spelled disaster for racers of the 1960s, as well as today.The same holds true today. It\u2019s one of the reasons the new Ford GT\u2019s active aerodynamics channel airflow.

This results in less aero drag and improved performance.The overall teardrop shape is key to efficiency.In developing the Ford GT for Le Mans, Ford embarked on a mission to build the production and race vehicles concurrently.

For me and others of my generation, this vote was about more than Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It signaled the definitive end of the era of transnational optimism in which I came of age: the \u201990s. Back then, we believed that interconnectedness was a strength. People wanted to study human rights law. Nationalism was out of fashion \u2014 at least in Western Europe \u2014 and weaponized Twitter didn\u2019t yet exist to galvanize political change. (Or rather, to take down institutions, not build them.)Regular people didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and neither did many European leaders, cocooned in their provincialisms. Sometimes there was chatter that no, Greece wouldn\u2019t get kicked out of the euro, but that maybe one day Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, would leave. Never mind how Germany had grown rich because its banks had lent Southern Europe money to buy German goods, a fact that didn\u2019t fit into the \u201clazy Greeks\u201d narrative of the German tabloid news media.The European Union hasn\u2019t done a good job of explaining its purpose \u2014 it\u2019s too opaque, too bureaucratic, too confusing \u2014 and its slow handling of the debt crisis, especially in Greece, where it acted fast so French and German banks could cut their losses, but left Greece asphyxiated, had devastating consequences for all. Decisions made for short-term financial stability have led to long-term political instability.Still, the right appeals to nationalism and the left does not. The right sells a nostalgic version of national identity that resonates viscerally but doesn\u2019t reflect reality, especially not for young people born into a Europe of Erasmus scholarships that let them study across borders, and EasyJet, which lets them travel around on the cheap.These critiques of Europe from the left and right aren\u2019t really ideological in the way that the 20th-century battles between communists and fascists were. Instead, voters have the sense that abstract economic forces are determining their fates, that their countries have given up part of their economic sovereignty to Europe \u2014 but that Europe, a vague construct, has not assumed that power and can\u2019t act on it. Europe hovers in a kind of purgatory of semisovereignty. In this confusion, nationalists thrive.\u201cSince 1989 there has been a return of memory and with it, and benefiting from it, a revival of the national units that framed and shaped that memory and gave meaning to the collective past,\u201d he wrote.Who inherits England?

{"Headline": "Getting a Reverse Mortgage, but Not From a Celebrity", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byYour MoneySound sketchy? The loans, which allow people age 62 and older to pull some of the money from their home equity without having to make any monthly payments on the debt, have a pockmarked history. Financial con artists have persuaded borrowers to put the proceeds in inappropriate investments, and some spouses who weren\u2019t on the mortgage have lost their homes.So it may surprise you to learn that some community bankers are quietly offering the loans, too, bringing a kind of Main Street respectability to a product that has long lacked it.Many of those people do manage to buy a home, however, and they may have paid off much of their mortgage by the time they retire. So yes, our retirement savings vehicles ought to be better. Until they are, however, home equity may end up being the biggest asset that many people have to draw on in retirement.That is where reverse mortgages come in for people who use their homes as a primary residence. If you are 62 or older, you can apply to extract some of that equity in a variety of ways, including through a lump sum or a line of credit. Your age, prevailing interest rates and the amount of equity in your home will help lenders determine what you can borrow. The main feature \u2014 which gives the product its name \u2014 is that instead of you paying the bank as you would with a traditional \u201cforward\u201d mortgage, the bank pays you.You are still responsible for the money, though (and have to keep up with home maintenance, taxes and insurance). The lender keeps a running tab of the interest and (often expensive) fees, and once you die or move to a nursing home or sell the property, the bank takes back its money (or your heirs write a check to settle the debt and keep the home). Borrowers never have to pay additional money, even if the interest has ultimately added up to more than the home is worth at that point.Fred Schindler, 72, had done his own homework by talking to a friend in the Pittsburgh area who had used a Philadelphia lender for a reverse mortgage. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to do big business through the mail or email,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Randy was local.\u201dRandy is Randy Davis, the sole reverse mortgage loan officer in the Pittsburgh area for Dollar Bank, which opened for business in 1855. Like all local and regional banks, it hopes to have lifelong relationships with customers, including while they are retired. So it now originates about 100 reverse mortgages a year in and around Pittsburgh and Cleveland.Mr. Schindler used his reverse mortgage to pay off the last bit of his original mortgage on his condo and to open a line of credit. By tapping it, he built a sizable enough down payment to get a better interest rate on a car loan. The reverse mortgage also gives him some breathing room because he did not want to tap retirement money from an annuity that will be worth more if he waits longer to use it.One hundred loans a year is not many for a bank with several dozen branches, and the caution appears to be purposeful. Dollar pays Mr. Davis a salary, not a commission. \u201cYou don\u2019t have an environment where people have to get that loan closed or they won\u2019t be able to pay their own mortgage next month,\u201d said Mike Henry, senior vice president for residential lending.The bank talks people out of using reverse mortgages, too. Mr. Davis described an older woman he had met who was living with her adult son. \u201cWhat\u2019s his intention when she is no longer alive?\u201d Mr. Davis asked her. The son wanted to stay in the house, but if his mother ran up a big reverse mortgage bill, he would have to pay the balance once she died in order to stay, or figure out how to borrow enough on his own to eliminate the debt. So, no reverse mortgage.As at Dollar, Fulton customers sign up for about 100 reverse mortgages a year, and it, too, has its sales agents on salaries. The two have one other thing in common: Both try to get borrowers to come in with family members or some trusted adviser who can help ask questions and make sure that the borrower understands everything.This makes sense for all sorts of reasons. Many reverse mortgage borrowers are in their 70s or 80s, and some of them may be in the beginning stages of cognitive decline. If I were a banker, I would want adult children in the room so they knew that their parent had willingly signed up \u2014 and so those same children wouldn\u2019t be blindsided by the debt later and accuse the bank of wrongdoing.Ms. Carson mentioned another reason: Some adult children try to get to the cash right after their aging parents take out a reverse mortgage. They may have even put their parents up to borrowing in the first place. Can her bankers smell ill intentions? \u201cI think you can,\u201d she said, noting that all customer-facing employees undergo training in recognizing elder abuse.One question that comes up often with reverse mortgage deliberations (or ought to at least) is this: If you are so hard up for money, shouldn\u2019t you just sell and downsize? To Ms. Carson, who will retire in a few weeks herself, and whose elderly father lived with her for 20 years, the answer isn\u2019t always so clear. Is there a serious illness? Longtime neighbors who can look in on you? Is family nearby who can help you stay at home a bit longer? Or people who could help you pack up and move? And what if there are no family or friends close to the most appropriate place to downsize?These questions don\u2019t lend themselves to hard and fast rules, and neither do reverse mortgages. \u201cThey are the right product for the right customer for the right reason,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if any of those things aren\u2019t right, then you\u2019re better off not taking the product.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In some cases, the vigilante groups have taken to patrolling borders, streets and other public places to defend against what they portray as a menacing incursion of asylum seekers, many of them Muslims from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other poor, war-torn nations.\u201cThe original cultures of Europe are threatened by some idiots from the desert,\u201d said Marian Magat, the leader of Vzdor Kysuce, another far-right group in Slovakia, which has actually seen few migrants pass through its borders and fewer seek to settle.In Hungary, which saw nearly 400,000 asylum seekers pass through its borders last year en route to Germany and other more welcoming destinations, Istvan Matyas Vass, a retired artist and former parliamentarian has, since July, led a group called the Hunyadi Border-Guard Unit.The group was named for John Hunyadi, a Hungarian military figure who won a decisive battle in Belgrade against the Ottomans in the 15th century. Mr. Vass and his more than 300 colleagues keep up a steady presence on social media, agitating about what they see as the threat from migration.In Bulgaria, Petar Nizamov said he was proud of creating an informal group called Civil Squads for the Protection of Women and Faith, which a few months ago began hunting for migrants along the country\u2019s borders, pushing them back into neighboring Turkey.Right-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.\u201cThose who come to Europe now are not refugees,\u201d Mr. Nizamov said, dressed in a long-sleeve T-shirt with the image of King Simeon the Great, who ruled Bulgaria during the late ninth and early 10th centuries. Their goal, he said, is \u201cto spread Islam\u201d across Europe.The groups remain relatively small, as focused on stirring up political support and media attention as on confronting migrants, and not all of them are actively patrolling. In Hungary, Mr. Vass posted a call last year to the Hunyadi Border-Guard Unit \u201cto be prepared to step up for your own defense.\u201d But the authorities later dropped an investigation after it became clear that the group had done nothing but prepare to take action.Not only are there few migrants coming through Slovakia at the moment, but the government, like those of most countries in the region, is strongly resisting pressure from Western Europe to accept asylum seekers for resettlement.Despite the small number of active participants, the emergence of the groups has the authorities in some countries worried. \u201cWhenever someone\u2019s trying to replace the state\u2019s function in some way, it creates a dangerous precedent,\u201d says Tomas Nociar, an expert on extremism from Comenius University in Bratislava.And the citizens groups have been more active in Bulgaria, whose border with Turkey has been an alternate route into Europe for migrants from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria unable or unwilling to make the voyage by sea to Greece.Mr. Nizamov has been under house arrest since mid-April and an investigation of his activities is underway. He was detained shortly after posting a video on social media showing the apprehension of three Afghan migrants, their hands tied behind their backs. The migrants told the police that the vigilantes, carrying knives and a gun, urged them to go back to Turkey.While Mr. Nizamov is the only one who has been detained by the Bulgarian authorities for a citizens arrest of migrants, his group is not alone in patrolling the Turkish border.In April, a group of volunteers known as the Organization for the Protection of Bulgarian Citizens caught 23 Afghans and handed them over to the police. The group, which organizes charity and sports events, began its patrols last year.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to help the state, as they don\u2019t have enough people to properly guard the border,\u201d said Georgi Bratanov, 29, a bartender and regular participant in the patrols.In February, Dinko Valev, also 29, a spare parts trader, became a national celebrity after a television station broadcast a report calling him a \u201csuperhero\u201d for catching a group of Syrian refugees, including women and a child.At first, the Bulgarian authorities turned a blind eye to the vigilante patrols and even encouraged their activities. But later, after international outrage over Mr. Nizamov\u2019s activities, the government condemned the groups\u2019 actions.\u201cAny lawbreaking or inhumane treatment\u201d will be prosecuted, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said, adding that his government had taken all necessary steps to secure the country\u2019s border.Daniel Milo, the coordinator of counterextremism policies in the Slovakian Interior Ministry, said self-styled citizens patrols present risks to themselves and the public. \u201cIt can end up badly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are not ready, nor equipped, to deal with any problematic situations.\u201dWebsites and social media pages for Mr. Kotleba\u2019s party depict a Slovakia awash in danger from criminals and \u201cGypsy extremists,\u201d protected by patrols of tough-looking men in green shirts, decorated with the party\u2019s logo.Until these right-wing patrols do anything illegal, they cannot be banned, said Lubomir Abel, vice president of the Slovakian police force.\u201cPeople who used to fight us in the streets are now sitting in the Parliament, wearing white shirts,\u201d Mr. Abel said of People\u2019s Party-Our Slovakia, which won 14 of the 150 seats in Slovakian Parliament in March elections, propelled by supporters weary of the country\u2019s inefficiency and corruption scandals.Likewise, in Hungary, where few refugees have actually settled, the far right is waging a campaign built on ethnic, religious and racial enmity, including encouraging supporters to be vigilant against what they portray as threats to their safety and way of life \u2014 even though the flow of refugees through the country has all but stopped this year.\u201cEurope is Christian, they are Muslims,\u201d Mr. Vass said in a telephone interview, speaking of the asylum seekers who poured through the country last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a financed and organized wave by Zionist Jews to destroy Europe. The E.U. has a suicidal policy in accepting them.\u201dMiroslava Germanova reported from Bratislava; Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria; and Helene Bienvenu from Budapest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Old Albany Hustle", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialAfter a lackluster legislative season, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared on Sunday that he and state lawmakers had managed to finish \u201cprobably the most successful session in modern history.\u201d That is not only wrong, but ridiculous.Instead of seizing the moment to enact reforms, New York\u2019s politicians left intact one of the state\u2019s great campaign financing scams \u2014 the so-called L.L.C. loophole. Limited liability companies can allow donors, hidden behind several shell companies, to contribute almost unlimited amounts to campaigns. Mr. Cuomo gave lip service to eliminating this loophole, but little of his political muscle.Albany\u2019s lawmakers also failed to put limits on their outside income, one of the ways Mr. Silver, in particular, ran afoul of the law. They did not restrict \u201chousekeeping\u201d donations to political parties, and, once again, they passed up an opportunity to expand public financing of campaigns to help foster competition at the polls.One positive move \u2014 requiring future convicted lawmakers to forfeit their pensions \u2014 will need legislative approval again next year before it is presented to the public as a constitutional amendment. Another potentially useful measure would tighten guidelines on spending by supposedly independent political action committees.New York City also suffered on other issues, particularly affordable housing. Renewing the 421-a tax program, which helps underwrite development, got lost in the paper shuffle. Mr. Cuomo had budgeted $2 billion this year as part of what he called \u201cthe largest commitment to addressing homelessness in New York State history\u201d \u2014 a five-year, $20 billion effort to create 100,000 affordable units and thousands of supportive-housing and shelter beds. But city officials have said that this year\u2019s contribution is a measly $150 million in new state funding, which advocates for the homeless have dismissed as peanuts. Mr. Cuomo insists the amount is $570 million including other sources.Mr. Cuomo can rightly boast about an increase in the state minimum wage enacted earlier this year, as well as paid family leave. But this legislative session was notable mainly for its failure to grasp a historic moment to address corruption in a meaningful way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Nearly 75 Years, and Countless Knots, a Boy Scout Leader Is Retiring", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byNUTLEY, N.J. \u2014 His arthritic fingers brought the ends of the rope together, intertwining them slowly but with obvious familiarity.He narrated: Left strand over, right strand through, as he demonstrated in his home here. He wore his favorite T-shirt, the one with the green Troop 102 logo that a member designed.\u201cAnd that,\u201d the scoutmaster, Julio Balde, said, proudly holding up the two pieces he entwined, \u201cis how you tie a square knot.\u201dFor almost 75 years, Mr. Balde has taught survival skills and the importance of civic engagement to the Boy Scouts of Troop 102 of Newark.His daughter, Anita Balde, estimated that more than 1,000 boys have been part of the troop, which meets weekly at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in the Ironbound section of the city.On Friday, his 95th birthday, Mr. Balde said that the best thing about all those years was \u201cwhen these kids grow up and they still think of you as their second father.\u201dWhen Mr. Balde started in scouting, he had to learn how to tie nine knots; now, he requires his scouts to learn just four. In the 1960s, more than 100 boys belonged to the troop. Today, there are only six members, and four of them are graduating from high school this month.Though Mr. Balde\u2019s mind is sharp, he said that his physical health reflected his age and that his doctors had advised him to slow down.He still climbs the steep, curving stairs to his second-floor bedroom \u2014 only recently did he let his daughter have handrails added \u2014 and still drives to scout meetings every week.Mr. Balde joined scouting at 15, when pressured by his Portuguese-immigrant parents. His family had moved to the Ironbound, a Portuguese enclave, when he was 2.\u201cDad, I\u2019m 15, I don\u2019t want to wear those little knickers,\u201d Mr. Balde recalled saying in protest.But he quickly fell in love with scouting.So much so that when he proposed to his wife, Joan, he told her that scouting would always be a priority. Mr. Balde recalled Joan cooking spaghetti and meatball dinners on Sundays for his hungry scouts. She died 23 years ago, a few months shy of their 50th anniversary.For about 45 years, Mr. Balde worked for Artley Inc. in Newark, designing and building displays for trade shows until the company closed in 1996. For the next 10 years, he was a consultant. He stopped working at 85.The Boy Scouts could not say if Mr. Balde was its longest-serving scoutmaster, but in an email on Monday the group said he was \u201ccertainly one of our longest tenured scouting volunteers in our organization\u2019s history.\u201dEric Adams, the assistant scoutmaster for Troop 102 and assistant finance director for the City of Newark, praised what Mr. Balde had done for so many boys. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find someone who has trained more leaders,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cBut he would never take credit for it.\u201dMr. Balde said he helped 43 young men become Eagle Scouts, the highest rank a Boy Scout can achieve.\u201cI\u2019m proud of all my boys,\u201d he said, then listed some of their accomplishments. \u201cI\u2019ve had dentists, doctors, lawyers and an undertaker.\u201dAnd at least one convict, he added, but there are always a few bad apples.Lucille Krutsick, 80, a Newark resident, has been a troop volunteer for more than four decades and considers the Baldes family.\u201cAs much as I know in his heart he didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Ms. Krutsick said, it was time for Mr. Balde to step down because of his declining health as well as the waning interest in scouting.Her two sons became Eagle Scouts while in Troop 102.One of them, Michael Krutsick Jr., 56, remembered Mr. Balde allowing the boys to learn from their mistakes and also credited the scoutmaster with instilling in him a desire to give back.\u201cInstead of saying, \u2018We need this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Krutsick said, \u201che taught us to say, \u2018We need this and I am here to help.\u2019\u201dBryan Aguilar, 17, who joined Troop 102 seven years ago, said Mr. Balde taught him to respect others and helped him \u201cform the young man I am today.\u201d He graduated from East Side High School in Newark on Monday and will attend Ramapo College of New Jersey in the fall.\u201cBecause of his age and because he has lived through so much,\u201d Bryan said, \u201che teaches us life lessons that my parents couldn\u2019t teach me because they haven\u2019t lived that long yet.\u201dReclining in his armchair, black slippers snug on his feet, Mr. Balde mirrored a picture on the mantel: a younger scoutmaster with a glowing smile and thick glasses. Around his neck was a medallion for the silver beaver, the highest honor an adult volunteer in scouting can receive.Citing the Boy Scout motto, he said, \u201c\u2018Be prepared\u2019 means be prepared with a smile.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visium to Sell and Liquidate Funds After Insider Trading Charges", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byThe firm will sell one of its funds to the money management firm AllianceBernstein and return money from its remaining three funds to investors, many of which are state pension funds, according to a letter sent to investors on Friday.Two days earlier, federal authorities filed criminal and civil securities charges against three traders at the firm, including Sanjay Valvani, a top lieutenant to the founder. The charges included insider trading and mismarking securities.Citing the government investigation, negative publicity and requests from investors to redeem their money, Jacob Gottlieb, the firm\u2019s founder, told investors that \u201cit became clear that maintaining the status quo was increasingly untenable for the firm.\u201d\u201cI am obviously deeply saddened by these recent developments,\u201d Mr. Gottlieb wrote in a letter to investors reviewed by The New York Times.The announcement is a stunning and unexpected outcome from the investigation. It is rare for a hedge fund to shut down over a government investigation when the founder has not been accused of wrongdoing.In March, Mr. Gottlieb informed investors that Visium was under investigation by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, adding that the firm would \u201cwork through this matter.\u201dThe government\u2019s insider trading case centers on a former Food and Drug Administration official, Gordon Johnston, who is accused of providing inside information about a generic drug approval process to Mr. Valvani, a portfolio manager for Visium\u2019s Balanced fund. In all, Mr. Valvani is said to have made $32 million in illegal gains from tips Mr. Johnston provided.Mr. Valvani then passed on some of those tips to Christopher Plaford, a former colleague, who used this information and other insider tips to garner illegal gains, according to the government.Separately, Mr. Plaford and another Visium employee, Stefan Lumiere, who was formerly Mr. Gottlieb\u2019s brother-in-law, have been accused of conspiring to inflate the value of the securities they were managing to charge investors higher fees. The government alleges that in all, the inflated prices led to $5.9 million in performance fees.Both Mr. Johnston and Mr. Plaford have pleaded guilty.Barry H. Berke, a lawyer representing Mr. Valvani, said his client was innocent. A lawyer for Mr. Lumiere has previously declined to comment on the case.AllianceBernstein will acquire Visium\u2019s Global Fund and its investment team in the deal announced on Friday. The terms for the fund and its investors are expected to remain the same, Mr. Gottlieb said.The price of the deal was not disclosed. A spokesman for AllianceBernstein did not respond to requests for comment.Visium will liquidate its Balanced fund, as well as its Equity Alpha and Institutional Partners funds. All requests for redemptions will be delayed, and money will be returned starting July 1, Mr. Gottlieb said.Visium was founded in 2005 and has 170 employees based in New York, London and San Francisco. Mr. Gottlieb has a medical degree from New York University but turned to finance soon after graduating, starting as an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.Some of Visium\u2019s pension fund investors include the New Jersey State Investment Council, the School Employees Retirement System of Ohio and the Missouri State Employees\u2019 Retirement System.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gun Control Effort in Congress Isn\u2019t Dead, but Prospects Aren\u2019t Good", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, was crowing a bit on the chamber floor Thursday when he began reading a staff member\u2019s email about a planning and development meeting the previous night in the town of Sanford, Me.\u201cEvery single person I spoke with either wanted me to convey their thanks to Senator King for his stand on \u2018doing something on gun control\u2019 to asking me that he stand firm and do more. People who own guns (and said so) and those who don\u2019t. Every single person expressed dismay that Congress has not acted on this.\u201dWithin hours, however, the Senate had again voted not to act \u2014 effectively condemning to legislative purgatory a measure that Mr. King had praised as providing just the sort of common-sense legislation his constituents were demanding after mass shootings like the one this month in Orlando, Fla.The bipartisan proposal written by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was aimed at stopping terrorist suspects on the government\u2019s no-fly list from buying guns. It survived a motion to table that would have killed the measure outright, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance it. The vote was 52 to 46.In the end, Ms. Collins was able to persuade just seven of her fellow Republicans to join 45 Democrats and Mr. King, who caucuses with Democrats, in favor. Ms. Collins later expressed confidence that the two Democratic senators who were absent, Dianne Feinstein of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, also would have voted in favor, leaving her short six votes.Still, the path forward is murky at best.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep working on it, and it\u2019s really up to the leaders where we go from here,\u201d Ms. Collins said, adding, \u201cI never give up.\u201dIn the short term, there is almost no chance the measure will resurface. Even the underlying bill that it would be attached to as an amendment, the annual Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill, is about to be set aside so that the Senate can return to a more urgent fight over financing to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus.Republican senators who voted against the Collins proposal cited concern about due process, saying they objected to the government being able to block the sale of a weapon without first demonstrating probable cause to a judge that the person trying to buy the gun was a terrorist.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, put forward a proposal that would block a gun sale to a suspected terrorist for three days to give federal prosecutors time to make the case. Democrats have said that standard is so high that it is unworkable.In an interview, Ms. Collins noted that if federal prosecutors could demonstrate such probable cause, the prospective gun buyer should probably be under arrest.Mr. Cornyn\u2019s proposal, which also failed to advance, received 53 votes on Monday, but was supported by just two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. A similar but more broadly worded proposal by Mr. Cornyn received 55 votes in December, but at that point also had just the same two Democrats in favor.With the frustration over the failure to tighten the nation\u2019s gun control laws boiling over, House Democrats staged a sit-in for more than 25 hours to demand votes on two measures \u2014 both of which had failed in the Senate on Monday.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who seized command over the House, pushed through a bill and adjourned for the Fourth of July recess, derided the Democrats\u2019 effort as a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d that risked undermining the House as an institution.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who supported the Collins measure, said on Thursday that it might take another terrorist attack to jolt his Republican colleagues into action.And yet in a sign that Ms. Collins may yet have found a narrow path forward, Representative Carlos Curbelo, a freshman Republican from Miami, said Friday morning that he was introducing a companion version of the Collins measure in the House.\u201cI was very pleased when Congressman Curbelo called me yesterday and said there was considerable interest in our bipartisan bill,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cTo have a companion bill in the House is also a very good sign of progress and the fact that people are eager to come up with a bipartisan approach to a real problem that does not compromise Second Amendment rights. And I believe that is exactly what we have done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the House votes to impeach Mr. Koskinen, the Senate would not hold a trial and could not muster the necessary two-thirds vote to convict him if it did, Senate Republicans say.The genial septuagenarian has long enjoyed a sort of behind-the-scenes prominence, well known to Washington insiders and business leaders. He is also well known to fans of soccer and Duke University \u2014 his dual passions \u2014 and the soccer stadium there, Koskinen Stadium, is named after him. Mr. Koskinen won the prestigious Elliot L. Richardson Prize this year \u201cfor excellence and integrity in government service,\u201d timing that suggested the selection panel\u2019s indifference to the well-publicized complaints of congressional Republicans.\u201cPeople like that who are sort of turnaround specialists and willing to take on hard jobs, there aren\u2019t that many of them. And people know who they are,\u201d said Alice M. Rivlin, an economist who worked with Mr. Koskinen in the Clinton administration, then in overhauling the government of Washington, D.C., after Congress stripped city officials of their budget power after years of mismanagement.In Mr. Koskinen\u2019s telling, he does not get hired; he is \u201cdragooned\u201d \u2014 he used the word more than once during an interview in a spacious, if drab, office with few personal touches besides family photos and mementos from previous jobs.\u201cI never apply for jobs \u2014 I just keep getting them,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said. \u201cI say I\u2019m going to go into the witness protection program, and they\u2019ll never find me again.\u201dHe has a physics degree from Duke and a law degree from Yale, and held various government jobs from the mid-1960s to early 1970s: clerk to the chief judge of a federal appeals court; adviser to a national commission on urban riots; aide to Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, a Republican, and then to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut.Next came 21 years in the private sector at the Palmieri Company, where he ultimately became the chief executive and revamped failed entities. Among them were the Penn Central, a Teamsters union pension fund and Mutual Benefit, at the time the largest life insurance company to have failed.When the Y2K job ended without computer chaos, Ms. Rivlin recommended Mr. Koskinen to Washington\u2019s newly elected mayor, Anthony A. Williams. Mr. Koskinen became city administrator and deputy mayor, helping local officials reclaim powers that Congress had transferred to a board of outsiders headed by Ms. Rivlin.\u201cWho in their right mind would want to take on a job like that?\u201d asked Joel L. Fleishman, a longtime friend of Mr. Koskinen\u2019s and a law professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke. He put that question to Mr. Koskinen then, and again 13 years later when his friend told him about the I.R.S. job offer.\u201cJohn said, \u2018Well, somebody\u2019s got to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fleishman recalled.\u201cI don\u2019t know how they even got my cellphone number,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.For a time, he was also Freddie Mac\u2019s chief executive and chief financial officer. He spent three years rebuilding the entity until he reached 72, the mandatory retirement age.\u201cFreddie needed some stronger management, so we selected him, and he accepted the job,\u201d said James B.

{"Headline": "New York Legislative Session Opens in Albany With Eye on Ethics", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 The opening of New York State\u2019s 239th legislative session looked and sounded very much as it has in years gone by, what with its ceremonial prayers, promises of hard work and bipartisan cooperation, and all manner of handshakes, hugs and how-ya-beens.\u201cThe time is up,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat. \u201cBoth leaders have been taken out of here and are going to jail. We have to take action.\u201dThat sentiment has been echoed in recent days by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who promised as recently as Tuesday that his agenda for 2016 would include a \u201cvery aggressive ethics proposal,\u201d despite his previous assertions that little could be done legislatively to solve venal behavior by lawmakers determined to break the law.Of course, ethics laws have been passed before, including a series of modest changes made last year, but on Wednesday several good-government groups were expressing new hope \u2014 and employing new strategies \u2014 for the 2016 session.Their proposals include asking legislators to abide by what some of the groups called the Clear Conscience Pledge, a written commitment to increase transparency, limit outside income and close the L.L.C. loophole.If lawmakers were in need of a reminder of the need for reform, it came in Manhattan on Wednesday, as Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court, who presided in Mr. Silver\u2019s case, set a sentencing date of April 13. Mr. Skelos and his son, Adam, are to be sentenced on March 3.In the Democratic-dominated Assembly, Speaker Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx devoted an early section of his opening remarks to possible anticorruption measures.\u201cThis Assembly is serious about ethics reform,\u201d Mr. Heastie said, adding, \u201cWe know that words are simply not enough.\u201dIn the Senate, John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads the majority in that chamber, saved his comments for the end of his speech, noting other \u201cpositive steps\u201d on ethics, and saying merely that the Republicans would engage in \u201cwhatever discussions are necessary.\u201dIndeed, the divided Legislature has proved to be a barrier to some action on ethics in the past. But the political power of ethics as an electoral issue will also be an undercurrent in 2016: The Republicans currently hold the slimmest of majorities in the 63-seat Senate, with 31 seats and the help of Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans.But on Wednesday, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, expressed confidence that the Republicans would hold their majority, and he unleashed a barrage of criticism of the governor\u2019s economic policies and oratorical habits.\u201cFidel Castro would be proud of his style, the way he\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Cox told a herd of reporters. \u201cWhen you stand up in front of an audience telling big lies in a loud, booming voice, where you repeat it over and over again, that is exactly what Fidel Castro did.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like everybody is talking about the minimum wage as if we\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minimum wage has gone up 75 percent since 2004.\u201dMr. Heastie said the Democratic majority in the Assembly would push for a higher minimum wage, more financing for education, and paid family leave.Mostly, such policy debates were being saved for later in this session, which runs to mid-June. But even invited speakers seemed aware of the shadow hanging over Albany, including Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, who opened the Senate session with a prayer noting that humans are \u201cweak and short-lived, lacking in comprehension and judgment,\u201d and its elected representatives seemingly desperately in need of a moral primer.\u201cWe need wisdom as we open this legislative session,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cWisdom to know right from wrong.\u201dBenjamin Weiser contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Laws passed in the last decade limited people or companies doing business with the city from contributing to official campaigns.\u201cOutside spending is not new to city elections,\u201d the report said, \u201cbut the scope was astonishing: $15.9 million spent over all; $6.2 million in City Council primaries alone.\u201dAmong them: Joseph Dussich, maker of the Mint-X anti-rat bag, guest of the mayor at City Hall and, after years of facing slammed doors, a suddenly successful vendor.Advertisement"}

Other existing investors, including Greycroft Partners, E-Ventures and Cross Culture Ventures, also took part.Thrive, founded three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs, is one of several start-ups built around a membership model. But customers pay $60 a year to be able to buy organic food at what the company says are lower prices than what traditional grocers like Whole Foods offer.The aim is to give more customers access to what the founders say is better food.\u201cWe\u2019re looking to make healthy living affordable and accessible to any American family,\u201d Nick Green, a Thrive Market co-founder, said in an interview.It was an idea that initially drew little enthusiasm, according to Mr. Green, with dozens of venture capital firms rejecting him and his co-founder Gunnar Lovelace for their seed round of funding. But the two found support from individual backers online, leading to subsequent rounds of financing that included the likes of Greycroft.Now, the company says that it has more than five million registered users and more than 300,000 paid members, and ships more than $200,00 worth of goods a day.The fund-raising announced on Monday is meant to help the company grow, including creating more of its own branded goods and paying for more media marketing.Thrive Market is also built around a philanthropic element: With every regular membership sold, Thrive Market also sponsors a membership for a low-income family. The impulse is rooted in part in Mr. Lovelace\u2019s childhood, part of which was spent growing up poor with his single mother.\u201cWe\u2019re really a stakeholder-aligned business,\u201d Mr. Lovelace said. \u201cWe want to be known for social advocacy.\u201dAlong with the fund-raising news, Thrive Market also plans to announce that it will petition the Agriculture Department to allow buyers to use food stamps online. Mr. Gunnar said that Thrive Market had been in talks with the department for over a year and a half on the issue, but had made no progress.\u201cThey jerked us around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re going to do this eventually, but we want to show the support there is for making this happen and happen quickly.\u201dAs part of the fund-raising round, two executives from Invus will join Thrive Market\u2019s board.\u201cAt Invus the best part of our job is to meet and partner with entrepreneurs who are passionate about their mission and are looking to transform their industries,\u201d Evren Bilimer, a managing director at the firm who will join the Thrive Market board, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we saw with Gunnar and Nick and the rest of the Thrive Market team.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the sales figures for the online grocer Thrive Market.

{"Headline": "After \u2018Brexit,\u2019 a Splitting Hangover for the City of London", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Luke Hickmore had an aperitif Thursday night, watched the early results on Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and went to bed. He didn\u2019t sleep long.Mr. Hickmore, 46, helps oversee $13.7 billion for Aberdeen Asset Management, a global investment firm. He switched on his TV at 3:30 a.m., and said he thought, \u201cHang on a sec, this doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to go the way the market priced in.\u201dThe financial district stretches from the stately offices of hedge funds in Mayfair to Canary Wharf, where glass-and-steel bank headquarters have replaced abandoned docks. But its heart, Britain\u2019s version of Wall Street, is known as the City of London or simply \u201cthe City,\u201d referring to roughly a square mile where you can find the old walls of Londinium, the city built by the Romans.Brexit is on everyone\u2019s mind, as bankers absorb a second Big Bang as profound as the one three decades ago \u2014 though one without a road map forward.After the tumult of Friday, bankers, traders and other finance types could be found at the Pavilion End, a City pub in the shadow of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. A group stood outside the pub, as is the custom in London when the weather allows. Some had their jackets off, white dress shirts and suit trousers with ties, and held pints of beer as they pondered where the City\u2019s jobs might move. Paris. Amsterdam. Frankfurt seemed the most likely. But few seemed excited about the prospect of living there.\u201cThere\u2019s no confidence; it\u2019s been shredded,\u201d said Andrew Towill, 28, one of four employees of a multinational real estate consultancy who were also standing outside the Pavilion End.Anna Benjamin, 50, said not much was different on Friday in their business \u201cbecause we\u2019re dealing with projects that are ongoing. But there is a definite feeling that once they start coming to an end, where is the next one coming from?\u201dJohn Lowes, 35, said there was a general \u201cfeeling of real concern.\u201d\u201cNow what happens? We just don\u2019t know,\u201d he added.The group worried about returning to the kind of conditions they faced during the financial crisis.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to that,\u201d Robert Harper, 37, said. \u201cThere were times when I had nothing to do.\u201dAs with every financial shock, there are winners and losers.Many of the less well-to-do will suffer. While older voters led the charge for Brexit, the value of their pensions took a hit along with the British stock market and economy.Executives described a tense night on trading floors. At Goldman Sachs, there was activity on the London floor throughout the night, with TVs blaring referendum returns. In a note to JPMorgan Chase employees, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the firm \u201cprocessed 1,000 trading tickets per second at one point,\u201d many times the typical trading volume. The chief executive at Citigroup in New York, Michael Corbat, personally walked the trading floor, a relatively rare move for a Wall Street chief these days.It will take days and months to sift through the ramifications for the markets and the City, as Britain negotiates its post-Brexit relationships and global financial firms figure out their next steps. The aftermath of a Leave vote was predictable in many ways, unforeseen in others.Earlier this week, at a conference, Andrew Jackson, chief investment officer at Cairn Capital, a London-based firm, was asked about the best way to prepare for a possible Brexit vote.Much further, it turned out. RBS fell 18 percent on Friday, Barclays 17.9 percent and Lloyds Banking Group 21 percent.Many hedge funds stayed on the sidelines heading into the referendum, looking to pounce in the aftermath.\u201cIt is early to tell, but there will be very few that have done exceedingly well or exceedingly badly,\u201d said Anthony Lawler, an executive at GAM, an investment management firm that oversees portfolios of hedge funds for institutional clients.Many investors, he said, preferred voting on probabilities, not binary yes-or-no outcomes. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a massive sudden move, that\u2019s very difficult to trade.\u201dMr. Hickmore said he had already reduced risk by moving away from bets that bond yields would go higher.\u201cYou can\u2019t hold that choice through a U.K. referendum vote like this, because the risk of you being wrong is so high,\u201d he said.Bets were being made, however. The pound rallied sharply Thursday as polls indicated a vote to remain in the European Union, only to collapse starting late Thursday night, well before the official results were announced.Mr. Odey, who declined to comment, has long supported a Brexit vote. After suffering losses in his portfolio earlier this year, his faith in Brexit paid off.\u201cI would rather we were out of Europe,\u201d Mr. Odey said in an interview in 2014, adding then that it was a \u201cprobably a protest vote.\u201dBack in the City, some less-celebrated finance types, cramped outside a dark pub called Ye Olde Watling, contemplated an uncertain future. One wondered aloud whether he could still build a career in London. With the prospect of Frankfurt in the air, another joked that he was giving German lessons now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Brussels, Art Museum Brings Hope to Muslim Neighborhood of Molenbeek", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosBut those plans were upended on March 22, when suicide bombers struck the Brussels airport and a subway station, killing 32 people and paralyzing a city already reeling from revelations that some of the deadliest terror attacks in Europe had been carried out by homegrown extremists, many from Molenbeek.They needn\u2019t have worried. When MIMA opened on April 15, the lines snaked along the waterfront, with 4,000 people visiting that weekend. And the attacks, the founders say, have only sharpened the museum\u2019s resolve to forge connections with young people in Molenbeek.\u201cWhen I bought this property eight years ago, people thought this project was mad because Molenbeek was a no-go zone,\u201d said Jean-Paul P\u00fctz, a developer who bought the building with the idea of re-establishing a brewery there. On opening day, he wept when he saw the lines, he said. \u201cWhat kind of impact can it have?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small piece, a very modest piece of hope.\u201dThe four-story brick museum, a former malt house for Belle-Vue Kriek beer built in 1916, anchors a gentrifying strip of artists\u2019 studios, youth hostels and cafes in an area once known as Little Manchester for its warehouses and factories. It is just a short walk from a parallel universe within Molenbeek of halal butcher shops, teahouses and Middle Eastern boutiques where voices rise from the noisy sidewalks in Arabic, French and Moroccan Darija, and many women are veiled in niqabs.The museum\u2019s facade is still laced with huge letters of white, yellow and blue graffiti. It will stay there, said Rapha\u00ebl Cruyt, the owner of a contemporary art gallery and a Molenbeek resident who is one of the museum\u2019s four co-founders, because \u201cwe won\u2019t erase what the street has left there with its own rules.\u201d\u201cIs it art?\u201d he said. \u201cI see it as more of an attitude.\u201dThe academy boasts that it has trained five national champions this year, but over the past five years it has also lost a handful of boxers to fighting in Syria for the Islamic State. A former member, Ahmad Dahmani, 26, was arrested in November in Turkey and imprisoned on suspicion of conducting reconnaissance for the Nov. 13 Paris attacks.Mr. Cruyt has visited the gym several times since MIMA opened. On a recent trip he spoke to the boxers, gathered near red punching bags, and invited them on a tour, describing how the museum was highlighting urban art that often reflects issues of personal rebellion and identity.Afterward, he said he had no idea how many of them would come to see the first exhibition, \u201cCity Lights,\u201d and its works by Brooklyn artists, including the duo Faile, whose spinning wood prayer wheel is carved with the words, \u201cart is a lie that tells truth,\u201d a sentiment attributed to Picasso.Mr. Cruyt and his wife, Alice van den Abeele, along with Michel de Launoit, an entrepreneur, and his wife, Florence, started developing the project in 2013. Some people warned the developers that the idea was unworkable because of its location.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit silly, but magnificent because you have to dare to come here,\u201d said Ann Gilles-Goris, a councilwoman in Molenbeek. \u201cThey believe in the place and they want to bring new life here.\u201dUnlike many private museums that are financed by a single powerful collector, MIMA, which cost 18 million euros to build (about $20 million), relies on a network of backers. Seven collectors contributed works and money to build a permanent collection, while others have made loans. Corporate partners furnished supplies and insurance for artworks and regional governments contributed seed money. An association of about 200 private sponsors augment revenue from ticket sales, a restaurant and space rentals. The museum\u2019s annual budget is about 600,000 euros.\u201cOur concept is the reverse from the usual private model,\u201d Mr. Cruyt said. \u201cWe are trying to create a structure for a museum from the bottom up.\u201dLast month a handful of boxers and trainers visited a cavernous room devoted to an installation by the Brooklyn artist Maya Hayuk. Long windows facing central Brussels were tinted rose and yellow, and the walls were covered with lush red and blue paint in geometric patterns.Mohammed Idrissi, a trainer, struck a \u201cRocky\u201d-like pose and punched the air as a friend took his photograph. Since the visit, he has started a project with the museum in which the boxers will create videos about their lives and Molenbeek.A fellow trainer, Tom Flachet, said the visit was the start of an effort \u201cto open the minds of boxers who have a lot of false ideas about museums and art in general.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat interests me is that you can bring people into another world and aid their personal development.\u201dOne problem, he said, is that many young men from Molenbeek do not feel accepted by broader Belgian society. But some social programs have made a difference. He said that a number of the boxers participated in a theater project sponsored by a nonprofit group; the program created a \u201crupture\u201d with their daily routines that prompted some to discover hidden talents.At the gym, before the training exercises began, Malik M\u2019bai, a 27-year-old boxer, said he believed that MIMA could help reshape Molenbeek\u2019s reputation. \u201cWith the negative image that Molenbeek has now, the museum demonstrates that people are doing good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only what we see on television. There is another side to Molenbeek.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Electric Wins O.K. to Shed \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byGeneral Electric\u2019s lending arm is no longer \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dThe conglomerate said on Wednesday that its GE Capital unit had shed a government designation for the country\u2019s biggest finance companies, one that imposes additional regulations and capital constraints.With the declaration that GE Capital was no longer a threat to the nation\u2019s financial stability \u2014 or, what regulators call a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d \u2014 G.E. has completed a roughly yearlong quest to sell nearly $200 billion of assets and shrink what had been the engine of its profit for decades.Beginning under General Electric\u2019s former chief executive John F. Welch Jr., GE Capital swelled into one of the country\u2019s biggest lenders, becoming as big a business as G.E.\u2019s traditional divisions such as jet engines and medical equipment.But the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the burdens of GE Capital, and by last year G.E. announced it would get out of most of its finance activities and refocus on industry, becoming one of dozens of companies that had concluded being smaller is better for shareholders.That meant shrinking its lending arm \u2014 and in the process slipping out from under a welter of regulations that required supervision by the Federal Reserve.Investors approved, sending G.E. shares up 2 percent on Wednesday, to $30.55.G.E.\u2019s new status signaled a success for the Obama administration as well. Ever since the so-called SIFI designation was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions have faced tougher regulations aimed at making sure they were less likely to collapse ruinously.In addition to the largest American banks, four nonbank financial institutions received the designation: GE Capital and the insurance giants American International Group, MetLife and Prudential Financial.G.E. instead worked to shrink enough so that the label no longer applied. It says it consulted closely with regulators during the planning and execution of its asset sales, and was told in March that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which controls the designation, would weigh removing that label.\u201cFor some time now, people have been arguing that there\u2019s no exit ramp,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a telephone interview. \u201cToday shows that\u2019s incorrect.\u201dIt was a noteworthy turnaround for G.E., whose lending business had long been one of its signature divisions. Mr. Welch viewed finance as a way to diversify the conglomerate and rapidly and powerfully increase the company\u2019s earnings.G.E.\u2019s current chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, initially backed the growth of GE Capital when he took over in 2001, increasing its business in commercial real estate loans and subprime lending.But the financial crisis ushered in market upheaval that hurt GE Capital\u2019s ability to borrow. By the time the too-big-to-fail label came into effect, owning a giant lending arm had become widely viewed as a liability.The objective of the sell-off of GE Capital assets, which began in spring 2015, was to reduce the financial division\u2019s size to much more manageable levels \u2014 and eliminate the heavy capital requirements and other regulations that the label imposed.\u201cThis decision is a result of the transformation of GE Capital into a smaller, safer financial services company that meaningfully contributes to the success of G.E.\u2019s industrial businesses,\u201d Keith S. Sherin, GE Capital\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Mr. Lew said that G.E.\u2019s shedding of the SIFI label was unique to the conglomerate.

{"Headline": "Williams Appeals Delaware Decision to End Pipeline Merger", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byShareholders of the Williams Companies voted on Monday to approve a merger with Energy Transfer Equity, the Dallas-based pipeline operator, paving the way for Williams to appeal a Delaware judge\u2019s decision last week that allows the deal to be terminated.\u201cWilliams does not believe E.T.E. has a right to terminate the merger agreement because E.T.E. has breached the merger agreement by failing to cooperate and use necessary efforts to satisfy the conditions to closing,\u201d Williams said in Monday\u2019s statement.It is the latest development in a merger dispute that has grown uglier by the month.In its appeal, Williams will try to prove that Energy Transfer did not engage in \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d to close the deal. Williams is expected to argue that once Energy Transfer found a tax-related issue that would prevent the deal from closing, it did not engage Williams appropriately to find a solution.A representative from Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Shares of both Energy Transfer and Williams were lower on Monday; Williams\u2019s share price sank more than 6 percent.The cash-and-stock transaction was valued around $33 billion when signed in September but has since slumped to about $22 billion, tracking the decline in Energy Transfer\u2019s stock price.The deal included an offer of $6 billion in cash, which became more of a concern to Energy Transfer over the last nine months with the worsening plight of the pipeline industry \u2014 which transports oil and natural gas.In March, Energy Transfer\u2019s head of tax realized a mistake in the complicated structure of the deal had been made and informed the company\u2019s outside tax counsel, Latham & Watkins.The law firm, too, conceded there was a mistake, in that the deal, which was supposed to be tax-free, might no longer be so. It found that the decline in Energy Transfer\u2019s stock price, in addition to the cash component of the transaction, created a mismatch during the transfer of Williams\u2019s assets, which could lead the Internal Revenue Service to bill the merged companies for an amount estimated at more than $1 billion.However, Sam Glasscock III, the vice chancellor of the Court of Chancery, ruled on Friday that Latham was acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d and would not have risked its reputation on behalf of its client.That decision paves the way for Energy Transfer to call off the deal, assuming Latham still cannot render its opinion. On its own, Williams estimates that it would be forgoing $4 billion to $10 billion compared with what its value would be if merged with Energy Transfer.Williams said it might seek damages as well.Advertisement"}

The gunman, Omar Mateen, who had been on a terror watch list until 2014, bought a SIG Sauer MCX rifle \u2014 a spinoff of the military-style AR-15 \u2014 as well as a 9-millimeter handgun at a Florida gun shop about a week before the attack. The original assault weapons ban passed by Congress in 1994 prohibited the sale of 19 kinds of semiautomatic weapons, including AR-15s, AK-47s and Uzis, as well as dozens of types of handguns, ammunition and other rifles that met certain \u201cmilitary-style\u201d conditions. It is unclear how many of these military-style features were on the AR-15-style rifle that Mr. Mateen used, so it may or may not have fallen under the ban.How did the 1994 assault weapons ban ever get through Congress?President Bill Clinton pushed the ban through as part of a far-reaching, $30 billion crime bill, making it a \u201cnonnegotiable\u201d element in the face of Republican resistance. Rising crime rates, gang violence and a number of attacks on police officers by criminals using assault rifles all helped get the ban through Congress. When he ran for re-election, Mr. Clinton released an ad saying, \u201cBill Clinton did something no president has ever been able to accomplish: He passed and signed a tough law to ban deadly assault weapons.\u201dWas the assault weapons ban effective?What happened to the 1994 assault weapons ban?In 2004, Congress allowed the 10-year ban to expire amid lobbying by the N.R.A. and gun-rights advocates in Congress. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president that year, accused President George W. Bush of failing to do enough to win passage of an extension.Have there been efforts to bring back the ban? Yes, the large majority of the most notorious recent mass shootings in the United States \u2014 including the attacks in San Bernardino; Newtown, Conn.; and Aurora, Colo. \u2014 have involved semiautomatic weapons. After almost every one, there has been an effort in Congress to bring back the ban. But all have failed in the face of Republican opposition. The N.R.A. and other gun-rights advocates argue that the weapons should not be called \u201cassault rifles\u201d at all, and that they are usually used for hunting, marksmanship or self-protection. Some Democrats believe the passage of the 1994 ban contributed to the Republican takeover of the House that year, and the memory of that political impact has been sobering for gun-control advocates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanders Fans, I Get Your Pain. But Let\u2019s Unite Against Trump.", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPutting aside these macro issues, I was also deeply depressed. Anyone who has ever lost a serious presidential campaign can tell you it is an excruciating experience. I know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014 I\u2019ve lost three, including one in 2008 that was, we thought, un-losable: Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama. I was her 31-year-old press secretary.Losing is crushing: If you\u2019re a staff member you\u2019re immediately unemployed. And whether staff member or die-hard supporter, you\u2019re disappointed and angry \u2014 really, really angry. You have come to believe (because you must in order to work 18 to 20 hours a day for very little pay) that your candidate is a hero who will save the world, and that your opponent is a horrible person who will ruin it.So once we lost the long primary fight, I wanted to shout my certainty that she was the right nominee and he was the wrong one to anyone who would listen. Night after night I sat down and wrote excoriating op-ed essays taking on Mr. Obama, the press and the party structure that helped elect him. I\u2019d wake up in the morning and realize that what I had written sounded shrill, sometimes crazy and way too upset, and I\u2019d tear it up and start over again.The general election showed me how wrong I was. To my surprise, Mr. Obama won handily, taking states that Democrats hadn\u2019t won in generations. And though I haven\u2019t agreed with everything he\u2019s done, he\u2019s had one of the most successful presidencies in a very long time.Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s role in this campaign has been valuable \u2014 he has introduced important issues and excited millions of new voters. Mr. Sanders has earned the right to compete in the remaining primary contests and stay in until the convention \u2014 as Mrs. Clinton did in 2008. But rules are rules, and the math is the math. Senator Sanders is not going to be the Democratic nominee. There\u2019s staying in a race to cross the finish line with your head held high, and then there\u2019s participating in or condoning language and actions that will damage the nominee and help Mr. Trump.So to all the Sanders staff members and supporters who are as hurt and dismayed as I was, who feel that their candidate is right and the opponent dead wrong, who want to keep fighting to the convention and beyond: I get it. I\u2019ve been there (with Howard Dean and Bill Bradley as well). But please learn what I have learned and don\u2019t let your anger get the best of you. The consequences of doing anything that will help Donald Trump win are catastrophic.I understand you may not love (or even like) Mrs. Clinton right now. Perhaps you can\u2019t imagine knocking on doors for her in the cold or donating your hard-earned money to finance her campaign. I\u2019m doing both of those things, but I realize that you may not want to. I felt the same way about Mr. Obama in 2008. In the end I didn\u2019t work hard to get him elected (I really regret that now, by the way), but neither did I do or say anything that would harm his chances. I came to accept that he was, in fact, my party\u2019s nominee and might be the eventual president.Recalling all those op-ed articles I discarded, I finally wrote one toned-down enough that I thought someone might publish it. I showed it to the one person whose blessing, if not praise, I needed: Hillary Clinton. Her response was clear and unequivocal. Do not send this to anyone. The race is over, she said. We fought our best fight, but we lost.I know how difficult those lessons about losing can be to impart \u2014 and even more so to accept. But it is of the utmost importance that we all look beyond this intraparty contest to the one coming in November. I understand the anger about losing, and I know you may not love her (or even like her) yet. But Hillary Clinton is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. She is the only thing standing between us and President Trump. That should be enough motivation for all of us to put our differences behind us and focus on helping her win.Jay Carson is a screenwriter, former deputy mayor of Los Angeles and consultant on urban issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sepp Blatter and Deputies Arranged Huge Payouts After Indictments, FIFA Says", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byDays after several of his colleagues were awakened in their hotel rooms by the police and arrested on corruption charges last year, Sepp Blatter, the longtime president of FIFA, made an important decision. He decided he deserved a raise.With soccer in crisis and an unprecedented scandal beginning to boil, Mr. Blatter \u2014 who had just won re-election to a record fifth four-year term \u2014 signed a new employment contract that increased his salary to $3 million a year and guaranteed him a $12 million bonus if he completed his mandate.That arrangement, completed just as FIFA was plunging into organizational chaos, was one of many instances in which three of FIFA\u2019s top officials arranged over five years to pay themselves more than $80 million, according to an internal investigation of world soccer\u2019s governing body by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel.It was the latest in a series of jaw-dropping accusations about a culture of corruption pervading FIFA. For years, top soccer officials have been accused of using bribes and payoffs to profit from their roles overseeing the billions of dollars FIFA and other governing bodies generate through tournaments like the World Cup. But in the past year, dozens of soccer officials \u2014 though not the three accused Friday \u2014 have been charged with fraud, racketeering and money laundering in a broad corruption investigation led by the United States Justice Department.The three were also accused of modifying the termination clauses in their employment contracts to ensure that they would receive multimillion-dollar payouts even if they were fired for cause.Scandal and accusations have dotted the FIFA reign of Sepp Blatter.\u201cThey had the authority they needed,\u201d Quinn Emanuel investigators wrote of Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, \u201cand they simply told payroll and HR, the department generally in charge for employment contracts at FIFA and which reported to Mr. Kattner, how much should be paid out and to whom.\u201dIn a statement responding to the accusations, Mr. Blatter\u2019s lawyer, Richard Cullen, said Friday, \u201cWe look forward to showing FIFA that Mr. Blatter\u2019s compensation payments were proper, fair and in line with the heads of major professional sports leagues around the world.\u201dMr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner did not immediately respond to FIFA\u2019s statement.The accusations by FIFA and its lawyers seemed intended to paint a picture of a leadership group operating outside FIFA financial controls:\u25a0 In 2010, Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were awarded $23 million in retroactive bonuses for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that FIFA said were not called for under their employment agreements.\u25a0 In 2011, with Mr. Blatter in a contested election for the FIFA presidency, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner were given eight-year contract extensions that included guarantees that they would receive full payment of their salaries if they lost their jobs, a likely outcome under a new president.\u25a0 That same year, Mr. Blatter received a bonus of 12 million Swiss francs (about $12 million) for overseeing the 2014 World Cup.\u25a0 In May 2015, only days after the arrests of several of their colleagues in Zurich, Mr. Blatter, who signed a contract in 2008 that paid him 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) a year, executed a new contract that increased his salary to about $3 million and included the prospect of another performance bonus of $12 million if he completed his term.A day after that, Mr. Kattner\u2019s contract was extended four years \u2014 through December 2023 \u2014 and modified to include a clause that he be paid in full even if he was fired. In its statement, FIFA dryly labeled the timing of that contract extension \u201cnoteworthy.\u201dThat situation came to light when the auditor, Domenico Scala, abruptly resigned at FIFA\u2019s recent Congress in Mexico, saying that Mr. Infantino and others had orchestrated a change in FIFA\u2019s bylaws that shifted the power to hire and fire the independent ethics officials with FIFA\u2019s new governing council \u2014 a body led by Mr. Infantino.FIFA has defended Mr. Infantino by saying the shift was done to protect the organization against the possibility it might be unable to separate itself from individuals who come under investigation, but the assertion seemed to run counter to Mr. Infantino\u2019s professed support for reform and his stated goal of greater separation of powers at FIFA.Then this week came the German report, which said that Mr. Infantino had instructed FIFA staff members to delete recordings of an executive session in which removing Mr. Scala had been discussed. Mr. Scala, as part of his role leading the audit and compliance committee, also was responsible for setting Mr. Infantino\u2019s salary \u2014 a process that reportedly had gone poorly, with Mr. Infantino describing Mr. Scala\u2019s initial proposal of a $2 million salary as \u201cinsulting.\u201dMany of those executives held top posts in the FIFA led by Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner, so it was not surprising that more detailed allegations against the three men might emerge. In its news release on Friday, FIFA and its lawyers accused Mr. Blatter, Mr. Valcke and Mr. Kattner of working together to bulk up their compensation in agreements as far back as 2007.The evidence, the lawyers said, revealed breaches of fiduciary duty and also raised questions about FIFA\u2019s internal financial controls, especially the role of its compensation subcommittee. It was unclear whether all the salary and bonuses were paid and if FIFA would seek to recover any of it.FIFA said that all of the contracts would face further investigation, and that it had shared its findings with the Swiss attorney general\u2019s office and would do the same with the Justice Department.Advertisement"}

Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued by a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Uber\u2019s valuation of $62.5 billion \u2014 making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world \u2014 would not change with this new investment.Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors \u2014 some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.An article on Wednesday about Uber\u2019s plans to raise as much as $2 billion through the use of leveraged securities described a leveraged loan incorrectly.

{"Headline": "What Dead Pigs Can\u2019t Teach Us About \u2018C.S.I.\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byForensic scientists have long used dead pigs and other animals as stand-ins for humans to better understand how the body decomposes after death.But recent work by a team of scientists at the University of Tennessee suggests that for anyone trying to draw conclusions about a person\u2019s time of death or the way that decomposition progresses, pigs may be a poor substitute for humans.\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that to estimate the time since death for human forensic cases, our results indicate that human subjects are best, because the pigs and the rabbits do not capture the variation we saw in the humans,\u201d said Dawnie Wolfe Steadman, director of the center, who led the research.She added that pigs or other mammals might be suitable for some types of forensic research, like determining the types of insects or scavengers in a particular region.For forensic scientists, estimating the time of death from human remains has always been a somewhat iffy business.In 1981, William M. Bass, a forensic anthropologist, founded the Body Farm, the first outdoor research facility of its kind in the nation, because some of his estimates had been off by decades or even longer.In one case, Dr. Bass was called to look at well-preserved remains that had been dug up during the renovation of a house in Nashville in 1976. He estimated that the man had been dead for a few months. But the remains turned out to be those of a Civil War colonel, killed in battle in 1864.\u201cThe assumption was that it can\u2019t be that different,\u201d Dr. Bartelink said, referring to the decomposition rate of pigs.The results \u201cconfirmed the claim that pig carcasses can substitute for human corpses in research and training programs,\u201d concluded the authors, led by an entomologist, Dr. Kenneth G. Schoenly, who is now at California State University, Stanislaus.But that study included only one human and two pigs \u2014 a very limited sample, as Dr. Schoenly and his colleagues noted.In contrast, Dr. Steadman\u2019s research tested decomposition in 15 pigs, 15 rabbits and 15 human bodies that had been donated to science that were divided into three trials of five subjects of each species left to decompose in spring, summer or winter.The remains were placed outdoors on the ground at least 10 feet apart at the research facility. The researchers monitored temperature and humidity, and cameras documented scavenging by raccoons or other animals. Insect activity and the degree of decomposition were recorded twice a day.But Dr. Steadman and her colleagues found that estimates based on a formula often used to calculate time since death correlated weakly with the actual time that the pigs, rabbits and humans in the study had spent decomposing, and that decomposition rates differed sharply among the species and from season to season.In spring and summer, the peak seasons for insects like blowflies that are attracted to carrion, the pigs decomposed more rapidly than the human subjects. But in winter, humans decomposed faster, largely as a result of scavengers like raccoons, which seemed to prefer the human remains.\u201cAll of the areas of interest for the pigs are in the trunk,\u201d Dr. Steadman said, \u201cwhere with humans it\u2019s all in the limbs, and that affects the scavenging.\u201dDr. Steadman said one of the most striking findings was how much the decomposition patterns of one human body differed from another. \u201cAll of us have various diets, our body composition varies widely, and it\u2019s not just weight,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals who have a lot of fat decompose faster than lean individuals.\u201dShe added that chemotherapy drugs and other medications could also affect how quickly a body decomposes.Dr. Bartelink said studies like Dr. Steadman\u2019s were \u201cextremely important\u201d and showed that \u201cwe need to be doing studies on humans, not animals.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange,\u201d Dr. Wescott said. \u201cThings have been decomposing since the beginning of time, and it\u2019s remarkable how little we know about how things decompose and why they decompose.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Zika virus is also sexually transmitted, and health experts say both mosquito control and contraception are needed for protection against infection.Scientists increasingly believe that the Zika virus may cause birth defects in infants. Here\u2019s why.Congressional Republicans have said the White House has had sufficient financing to begin addressing the problem using more than $500 million reallocated from anti-Ebola programs in April.\u201cWe all agree that the Zika virus is a real threat and needs to be addressed,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the majority leader from Kentucky, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday morning. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats worked together to pass a bill here in the Senate to provide funding and resources. The House passed its own version. We are now ready to go to conference and complete a final bill.\u201dShortly after his statement, however, Senate Democrats held a news conference urging Republicans to move faster and approve the full amount of money sought by the White House. \u201cThe mosquitoes are not waiting for Congress to act,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said there were five new Zika cases reported on Tuesday in his state. \u201cThis is an emergency,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.So far, the hundreds of Zika cases reported in the United States all appear to have been contracted in Central and South America and the Caribbean, where mosquitoes carrying the virus are now widespread.

Trump and Boris Johnson: Is this how the era ushered in by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher finally ends?It once looked as though the financial crisis of 2008 might even bring about the end of laissez-faire economics. \u201cThe idea of an all-powerful market which is always right is finished,\u201d declared Nicolas Sarkozy, then the president of France. And Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, Germany\u2019s finance minister at the time, predicted that \u201cthe U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system.\u201dBut I suspect few would have guessed that the economic order built on Reagan\u2019s and Thatcher\u2019s common faith in unfettered global markets (and largely accepted by their more liberal successors Bill Clinton and Tony Blair) would be brought down by right-wing populists riding the anger of a working class that has been cast aside in the globalized economy that the two leaders trumpeted 40 years ago.Britons\u2019 vote last week to exit the European Union was not simply about their idiosyncratic distaste for all things European \u2014 an aversion shared by Thatcher, who saw Brussels as the kind of meddlesome big government she loathed. Brussels was merely a stand-in for something deeper: the very globalization that Thatcher as Britain\u2019s prime minister so enthusiastically promoted.The so-called Brexit vote was driven by an inchoate sense among older white workers with modest education that they have been passed over, condemned by forces beyond their control to an uncertain job for little pay in a world where their livelihoods are challenged not just by cheap Asian workers halfway around the world, but closer to home by waves of immigrants of different faiths and skin tones.Their frustration is turning traditional ideological labels on their heads. Mr. Trump, a bombastic businessman who\u2019s never held office, and Mr. Johnson, the former journalist turned mayor of London, might not put it this way, since they continue to cling to a conservative mantle. But they are riding a revolt of the working class against a 40-year-long project of the political right and its corporate backers that has dominated policy making in the English-speaking world for a generation.So where does capitalism go now? What can replace a consensus built by a charismatic American president and a bull-in-a-china-shop British prime minister in favor of small governments and unrestrained markets around the world?The British political scientist Andrew Gamble at the University of Cambridge has argued that Western capitalism has experienced two transformational crises since the end of the 19th century. The first, brought about by the Depression of the 1930s, ended an era in which governments bowed to the gospel of the gold standard and were expected to butt out of the battles between labor and capital, letting markets function on their own, whatever the consequences.In his 2010 book, \u201cCapitalism 4.0,\u201d the London-based economic commentator Anatole Kaletsky refers to a document in the archive of the British Treasury that shows the reaction of the permanent secretary to a proposal by the great economist John Maynard Keynes to use government spending to spur Britain\u2019s economy. It has three words: \u201cExtravagance, Inflation, Bankruptcy.\u201dMr. Keynes\u2019s views ultimately prevailed, though, providing the basis for a new post-World War II orthodoxy favoring active government intervention in the economy and a robust welfare state. But that era ended when skyrocketing oil prices and economic mismanagement in the 1970s brought about a combination of inflation and unemployment that fatally undermined people\u2019s trust in the state.Even the former president of France Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u2014 a Socialist who nationalized the banking system, increased government employment and raised public-sector pay after being elected in 1981 \u2014 was forced into a U-turn. In 1983, he froze the budget and brought about \u201cla rigueur\u201d: the austerity.The Keynesian era ended when Thatcher and Reagan rode onto the scene with a version of capitalism based on tax cuts, privatization and deregulation that helped revive their engines of growth but led the workers of the world to the deeply frustrating, increasingly unequal economy of today.There are potentially constructive approaches to set the world economy on a more promising path. For starters, what about taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to tap the world\u2019s excess funds to build and repair a fraying public infrastructure? That would employ legions of blue-collar workers and help increase economic growth, which has been only inching ahead across much of the industrialized world.There is, however, little evidence that the world\u2019s leaders will go down that path. Despite the case for economic stimulus, austerity still rules across much of the West. In Europe, most governments have imposed stringent budget cuts \u2014 ensuring that all but the strongest economies would stall. In the United States, political polarization has brought fiscal policy \u2014 spending and taxes \u2014 to a standstill.The cost of inaction could be enormous. Mr. Johnson\u2019s campaign to reject British membership of the European Union is already producing political and economic shock waves around the world. Mr. Trump \u2014 whose solutions include punishing China with high tariffs and building a wall with Mexico \u2014 is trying to ride workers\u2019 angst into the most powerful job in the world.There are less catastrophic ways to put an end to an era.Advertisement"}

Those rallies have often garnered Mr. Trump national cable news coverage, the type of news media attention that fueled his primary campaign.But the result for now has been that Mr. Trump is campaigning in states where he has far less risk of being defeated by Mrs. Clinton than states that are likely to be competitive, like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, Rust Belt states with large numbers of the white working-class voters who have been most receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s message.\u201cA travel schedule driven by fund-raising needs that takes you away from battleground states is one that\u2019s full of missed opportunities,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former Mitt Romney adviser.With Mr. Trump in the South, Mrs. Clinton has been spending her week in Ohio and Virginia, two of the most crucial states for winning the presidency. She was also in Pennsylvania, another state where Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of populism could be effective, but where he has spent little time since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee.Mr. Madden noted that Mr. Trump was uniquely able to generate national television coverage and newspaper headlines wherever he happened to be. \u201cBut he needs to flip states like Colorado, Ohio, Virginia and Florida in order to win,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d rather be driving national coverage from those locales than not.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign is also beginning an advertising blitz in battleground states this week, on top of commercials that have already been run in those places by the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, Priorities USA.Mr. Trump remains confident that he can flout conventional campaign practice by relying on a small staff and heavy news coverage. But even so, and despite his reliance on assistance from the Republican National Committee, his campaign faces heavy potential costs for television advertising, polling and building operations in key states.Raising money to pay for those items through the campaign is difficult: Donors may give no more than $5,400 a person through the party convention in July. After that, they are limited to donating $2,700.At this point in the presidential cycle in 2012, Mr. Romney was raising more than $1 million a day for himself and the party. There is no indication that Mr. Trump is approaching that pace.Moreover, while Mr. Trump lent his campaign more than $43 million in the primaries, he has shown little inclination to self-finance his general election campaign in a large-scale way. Yet many Republican fund-raisers have openly questioned why they would donate to a candidate who has claimed a net worth of $10 billion.Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, called his fund-raising operation \u201ca tremendous success,\u201d adding that \u201cthe money is pouring in for the party.\u201d She declined to answer specific questions.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has carefully guarded information about his fund-raising: His aides telephoned attendees for the Boston event to call it off, rather than emailing them, the people involved said, and have closely held lists of coming fund-raising events; another candidate might distribute those dates widely to help build interest.Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who has been able to tap a long-established network of allies and donors, Mr. Trump is trying to build one from scratch and on the fly. But he has struggled to sign on some of his party\u2019s top donors. Local party figures in different cities have declined to add their names to his invitations, meaning many have been sent without lists of co-hosts, a standard practice, according to veteran fund-raisers in both parties.That has kept Mr. Trump in New York raising money, as he did last week, or heading to California for fund-raising events. While he has said he will put both states in play, neither has been in reach for a Republican presidential candidate in decades.\u201cI trust and support the opinion of Irving\u2019s Police Chief,\u201d she wrote on Tuesday. \u201cThat said, Trump is welcome to visit any time.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the city in Texas where Beth Van Duyne is the mayor. It is Irving, not Irvine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MoMA Apologizes for Dropping a Film Critical of North Korea", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byThe Museum of Modern Art has acknowledged it wrongly canceled the New York debut of \u201cUnder the Sun,\u201d a documentary about North Korea that has been criticized by that country and Russia.She followed up a few days later to tell the documentary\u2019s distributor that it would not be included in the festival. \u201cIt just simply came in too late to review all the possible ramifications of showing it here at MoMA,\u201d she wrote.The museum said on Friday that Ms. Berger was no longer working there. Margaret Doyle, a spokeswoman for the museum, declined to elaborate, and Ms. Berger, reached by telephone, said she would not comment.While there have been dozens of documentaries about North Korea, few have been produced with the permission of its government. Mr. Mansky negotiated with North Korea for two years before settling on a contract that allowed its government to provide the script and cast, assign minders to direct Mr. Mansky\u2019s crew, vet daily footage and approve the final version of the film.North Korea is listed in the film\u2019s opening titles as one of the five producers along with representatives from Russia, Latvia, Germany and Mr. Mansky\u2019s own production company, Vertov Films.The documentary\u2019s subversive quality lies in how Mr. Mansky chose to shoot it. With the scenes completely staged by the North Koreans, he simply let his cameras run all day, every day. Thereby he captured the staging, multiple takes and more general manipulation that constitutes the reality North Korea reveals to the outside world.Mr. Mansky argues that North Korea nullified their accord when it canceled his third and final trip to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, during which he planned to shoot the last part of the story. \u201cThey didn\u2019t allow us to finish filming as was spelled out in the contract,\u201d he said in a Skype interview from his home in Riga, Latvia.Mr. Mansky estimated that at the time that North Korea stopped cooperating, he had only 30 percent of the total footage he needed. He nonetheless managed to edit it into a 90-minute film.\u201cUnder the Sun\u201d has been criticized by North Korea and the Russian government. North Korea asked Russia to destroy the film and punish Mr. Mansky; Russia\u2019s Ministry of Culture, which helped finance the film, subsequently asked for its name to be removed from the credits. Mr. Mansky declined to make the changes. The ministry has not granted permission for the documentary to be screened in Russia.In the email exchange from late January about including it in the MoMA festival, Ms. Berger drew a comparison between \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d and \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a Sony Pictures comedy in which American television journalists plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\u201cWe need to look over this very carefully before making a final commitment to keeping the film in the program,\u201d Ms. Berger wrote before ultimately notifying the distributor that it would not be included.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China-Led Development Bank Starts With $509 Million in Loans for 4 Projects", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 A new Chinese-led international development bank announced its first four loans on Saturday, pledging to lend $509 million for projects to spread electric power in rural Bangladesh, upgrade living conditions in slums in Indonesia, and improve roads in Pakistan and Tajikistan.The projects of the 57-member bank, founded last year as an effort by China to both challenge lending institutions and cooperate with them, are relatively modest.The road in Tajikistan is just three miles long, but it will help clear traffic congestion on an important trading route near the capital, Dushanbe. A $100 million loan to Pakistan is for 40 miles of highway in Punjab Province that would complete the last section of a national artery, the M-4, the bank said.Three of the projects are being financed with other institutions \u2014 the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \u2014 an approach that allowed the new bank to begin the projects quickly. The bank\u2019s $165 million loan to expand electricity in rural areas of Bangladesh is its only stand-alone project.By financing projects with long-established institutions, the Beijing-based bank was able to move quickly because work on meeting environmental standards and procurement policies had been completed, staff members at the bank said.The bank \u201cwas born with the birthmark of China, but its upbringing is international,\u201d Mr. Jin said. Referring to the three other institutions that will finance the projects, he said, \u201cWe can work wonderfully together.\u201dThe new bank is being watched closely. The United States refused to join when it was offered membership in 2014, saying it was uncertain how the bank would measure up on matters of environmental protection, human rights and anticorruption measures long promoted by Western governments and institutions. Japan has also not sought membership in the bank.But President Obama\u2019s administration was mostly concerned that the bank would challenge the current development architecture, the Bretton Woods system established under the leadership of the United States after World War II.In the past year, Mr. Jin has worked to reassure Washington, largely by agreeing to choose projects that have already been approved by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European bank. He has also emphasized that the new bank will be more streamlined and strive to be \u201clean, green and clean.\u201dWashington has shown no signs of wanting to join the new bank, but senior Obama administration officials have praised the decision to work with the established institutions and their regimen of standards.Britain was the most eager of the Western democracies to join the bank, and it broke ranks with the United States and became a member in the fall of 2014. Other members of the European Union, including France and Germany, rushed in after Britain.Asked if he believed that Britain\u2019s decision showed that the old guard was crumbling quicker than he expected, Mr. Jin diplomatically replied that he had detected no such signs.One of five vice presidents of the bank, the British politician Danny Alexander, sat next to Mr. Jin at the news conference. Member countries eagerly sought to fill the positions of vice president, and Mr. Alexander\u2019s appointment was interpreted as a reward to Britain for its critical support of the bank in the face of American opposition.Two dozen countries have expressed interest in joining the bank, and they sent observers to the two-day meeting, Mr. Jin said. The new members would come from Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa, and could join as early as next year.So far, the bank has 39 permanent professional staff members and about 20 other people working on contracts, a relatively small pool of people for an international bank planning to supervise major contracts. The staff is expected to expand to about 100 by the end of the year, a bank official said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenneth Axelson, Who Troubleshot New York City\u2019s Fiscal Crisis, Dies at 93", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byKenneth S. Axelson, a J. C. Penney executive who was foisted on New York City Hall as a deputy mayor during the 1975 fiscal crisis to restore integrity to the city\u2019s extravagant budget, and who left after a year with his goal largely accomplished, died on May 23 in Rockport, Me. He was 93.The cause was chronic kidney failure, his son Stephen said this week.Mr. Axelson, at the time a senior vice president for finance and administration at the department-store chain, was enlisted by Mayor Abraham D. Beame at the urging of Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York and the bankers and other bondholders who had precipitated the crisis by refusing the city\u2019s routine request to borrow more money.As the first deputy mayor for finance, Mr. Axelson profoundly influenced the administration\u2019s grudging response to what Mayor Beame himself acknowledged were years of \u201cfiscal gymnastics\u201d that had burdened the city with a $3.3 billion cumulative deficit. The annual operating budget then was about $12 billion.When Mr. Axelson returned to the private sector in 1976, Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created to borrow on the city\u2019s behalf, said Mr. Axelson had \u201cprovided a level of integrity to the city\u2019s numbers, and a degree of trust, that was unparalleled.\u201dMr. Rohatyn was the public face of the administration\u2019s outside monitors, state appointees who had imposed a fiscal recovery plan and were charged with ensuring that the city did not deviate from it. In contrast, Mr. Axelson operated from within city government to verify that every budget submitted to the monitors adhered to predetermined spending levels.In an interview on Friday, Eugene Keilin, a former special assistant to Mr. Axelson and later a successor to Mr. Rohatyn at the assistance corporation, called Mr. Axelson an architect of the city\u2019s recovery. Mr. Axelson, he said, helped put the city on a trajectory toward eliminating its deficit, adopting a balanced budget in three years, and restoring self-government sooner than anticipated.\u201cWe had a dry run on the night and morning of Oct. 16 and 17, and that experience scared the devil out of all of us,\u201d Mr. Axelson told the City Club of New York in November 1975. \u201cIt suddenly comes cracking down how disastrous and how uncertain it all is.\u201dJ. C. Penney had lent him to the city as a deputy mayor making $1 a year, but he retained his $188,000 company salary, well over what the other three deputies were making combined.Mr. Axelson dealt mostly behind the scenes as a fiscal hard-liner. Sometimes he served as a foil for Mr. Beame, fending off politically potent supplicants and accusing semi-independent agencies of foot-dragging in imposing economies. He also warned New Yorkers that further retrenchment was necessary to obtain federal loan guarantees, darkly invoking the administration of President Gerald R. Ford, which had resisted aiding the city.The city, he predicted, \u201cwill develop an expertise in how to contract, which will be a new skill in New York.\u201dMr. Axelson negotiated with organized labor and with the fiscal monitors. He prodded the mayor to pare the municipal payroll, ratify contracts financed by productivity improvements, raise taxes and sacrifice sacred cows, including free tuition at the City University of New York and the 35-cent subway fare.Perhaps most enduringly, he instilled a degree of professional rigor and transparency in the city\u2019s accounting practices; today, strict accounting rules are in place to prevent such a crisis from recurring.Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp, said his fiscal-crisis epiphany occurred when he asked Mr. Cavanagh how many people the city employed. Mr. Cavanagh fished a slip of paper from his pocket, Mr. Wriston recalled, and said, \u201c397,402 \u2014 or something like that.\u201d But Jac Friedgut, a Citicorp economist who was present, noticed that the paper was blank.\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew we were in trouble,\u201d Mr. Wriston said.Kenneth Strong Axelson was born in Chicago on July 31, 1922, the son of Charles F. Axelson, an insurance agent, and the former Katherine Strong.Drafted into the Army during World War II, he was shifted out of his original unit and assigned to audit procurement contracts. He later learned that the outfit had almost been wiped out in Belgium.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from the University of Chicago, where he also received a master\u2019s degree. After studying to be a certified public accountant at DePaul University, he worked for the big accounting firms Arthur Andersen & Co. and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. before joining J.C. Penney in 1963.At Penney he was executive vice president, director of finance and public affairs, a board member and a member of the four-person office of the chairman. By the time he retired in 1981, he had helped the company expand to more than 2,000 stores.Mr. Axelson also served as chairman of the Fund for the City of New York.His wife, the former Roberta Bearhope, died in 2011. In addition to his son Stephen, he is survived by three other sons, Kenneth Jr., Jerrold and Chris; eight grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.He denied any wrongdoing and was cleared by federal investigators and by the company.In his stint at City Hall, Mr. Axelson experienced culture shock as a corporate accountant thrust into a world where budgets were at the mercy of electoral politics. Preconceptions vanished when he was confronted with the reality of running a government, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve found that a great change took place in New York City on Sept. 16, the day I became deputy mayor,\u201d Mr. Axelson said in the City Club speech. \u201cBefore that day, I had all the solutions to the city\u2019s problems. But in the two months since then, things have gotten much more complicated, because I find I don\u2019t have all the answers any more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Pushes Back Against U.S. Complaints of Industrial Overcapacity", "Date": "2016-06-06", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese finance minister jabbed back on Monday at complaints from his American counterpart that China\u2019s glut of factories making mountains of steel, aluminum and other products was overwhelming foreign markets and makers.\u201cAt that time, the whole world applauded and thanked China,\u201d Mr. Lou told a news briefing near the end of a day of annual meetings in Beijing between senior Chinese and American officials. \u201cNow they\u2019re saying that China has a production glut that is a drag upon the world. But what did they say at the time?\u201dMr. Lou was responding to questions about the Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who has complained that China\u2019s huge surpluses were being sold so cheaply on international markets that they were distorting the global economy.\u201cThe United States supports efforts to reduce excess capacity and leverage in the economy,\u201d Mr. Lew said at the opening session of the talks, called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, held this year on the grounds of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.\u201cExcess capacity has a distorting and damaging effect on global markets,\u201d he said. He added that defusing the problem was \u201ccritical to the function and stability of international markets.\u201dThe talks, set to end on Tuesday, also cover foreign policy and international security tensions, such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and China\u2019s territorial disputes with neighbors in the South China Sea. There was no sign of either side shifting its position in those disputes in the meeting\u2019s opening remarks by President Xi Jinping and Secretary of State John Kerry.But Mr. Kerry said the annual talks, which started in a smaller form a decade ago, remained \u201cone of the best opportunities that we have to discuss our differences and to seek creative ways to narrow them or to eliminate them altogether.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.China\u2019s exports of cut-price steel, aluminum and other products have become a contentious international issue, prompting anti-dumping tariffs and feeding into the American presidential race. Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders have both argued in their campaigns that blue-collar workers have lost jobs because of skewed trading rules.This year, the Department of Commerce began putting heavy tariffs on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost.Mr. Lou (pronounced \u201clow\u201d) said there was nothing wrong with Mr. Lew raising the excess capacity problem in the talks. But he suggested that Mr. Lew had his eyes on critics back in the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re under pressure domestically,\u201d he said.The Communist Party leadership fears that sweeping industrial closings could kindle widespread worker protests like those that erupted in several northeastern rust belt cities in 2002.Mr. Lou also told reporters that the Chinese government had no estimate of the numbers of workers who would have to be laid off from steel mills, mines and other industrial plants as part of that growth program. A labor official said this year that cutbacks in the steel and coal sectors alone could lead to layoffs of 1.8 million workers.Mr. Lou declined to offer his own figure, citing as one example the number of factories in private hands, which tend to have fewer workers than China\u2019s state-owned mills. The government cannot control the economy through central planning in the way it once did, Mr. Lou said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very hard to estimate how many people you reduce if you reduce steel production by 10,000 tons.\u201dBut Scott Kennedy, a researcher on Chinese economy policy, said at a presentation in Beijing that the hand of the state still meddled too much in deciding winners and losers in sectors ranging from new technologies to improving the environment.The result was \u201cinefficient growth,\u201d Mr. Kennedy, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in presenting a new report about China\u2019s latest five-year economic growth plan.\u201cThere is a lot of genuflecting to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you get to the reality the plan is far less ambitious.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bidding Wars in the Suburbs", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byBy 5 p.m., they had submitted an offer for the full asking price of $942,000. The sellers wanted to give it more time. After several days, the couple raised their offer to $999,000. The sellers wanted another week. \u201cWe asked them to give us a number they would take it off the market for,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said. \u201cThey said no.\u201dThe couple really wanted the house. They huddled with Mr. Scinta, who analyzed recent sales prices of similar properties to help them strike a balance between a strong offer and an overzealous offer, which, if it exceeded the bank\u2019s appraisal, could cause problems with financing.Finally, on a Monday morning, they submitted their highest offer: $1,087,000, a full 15 percent premium. Mr. Scinta heard back that afternoon.\u201cArthur called and told us there were nine other offers,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said. \u201cBut we got it \u2014 by three or four grand.\u201d And fortunately, the bank appraisal came in on the nose.The family moved in last December; a third child is expected to arrive in August. They are delighted with their new home. But as for the angst involved in buying it? \u201cIt was awful,\u201d Ms. Krivickova said.\u201cThe city is this pot of water that\u2019s spilling over on the sides, and that excess demand is going to the suburbs,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a New York appraisal and research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all being driven by the lack of affordability.\u201dAcross Westchester, northern New Jersey, parts of Long Island and lower Fairfield County, Conn., the competition is fiercest for move-in-ready homes toward the lower end of the price scale \u2014 under $1 million in some markets, under $2 million in others \u2014 in places within a 40-minute rail commute to the city. Walking distance to a lively downtown, a train station or both heightens the appeal.Well-priced homes in good condition in these markets often draw multiple offers within days of coming on the market. An analysis of first-quarter sales this year conducted by Miller Samuel showed the highest percentages of Westchester properties (23 percent to 44 percent) selling at or above asking price \u2014 signs of likely bidding wars \u2014 in places like Larchmont, Irvington, Bronxville, White Plains and Pelham. The average premium ranged from 1.7 percent to 4 percent, actually lower than a year ago at the same time, when buyers were paying more like 5 percent or 6 percent over the asking price.Fairfield County and Long Island could not claim the same intensity in sales activity in the first quarter, Mr. Miller said. In Fairfield County, Stamford, Norwalk, Greenwich, Fairfield, Westport and Darien, 2 percent to 13 percent of properties sold at or over the asking price. On Long Island, Garden City, Huntington, Levittown, Port Washington, Franklin Square and Manhasset showed signs of bidding wars on 1 percent to 3 percent of transactions.Mr. Miller said he suspects bidding wars may have been more prevalent in those towns a couple of years ago, while now, \u201cWestchester is center stage.\u201dMr. Miller\u2019s firm does not cover New Jersey. But there, \u201cthe housing market is looking better than it has in a very long time,\u201d said Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Valuation Group in East Brunswick, N.J. Among the briskest markets are Hoboken, Glen Ridge, Maplewood, Montclair and South Orange, judging by their very low levels of inventory, he added.Generally speaking, buyers are not lining up for luxury properties. High-end homes \u2014 upward of $2 million or $3 million, depending on the location \u2014 are still going begging across the metropolitan area, agents said. Demand for these homes is weakest in affluent suburbs without a train station. \u201cThe reason is clear: The high-paying jobs in the region are now disproportionately located in Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Otteau said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s where you\u2019re going, there\u2019s just not enough hours in the day to involve a car in that commute.\u201dAt the same time, the luxury market in rail-centric towns is also slow, as they vie for fewer Wall Street bonus dollars and compete with a growing preference for urban living. Said Mr. Otteau, \u201cBecause of the dramatic improvement in urban life in the last 20 years, it\u2019s no longer a given that when you\u2019re ready to raise a family, you need to go out and buy a house in the suburbs.\u201dBut many buyers who would prefer to stay in New York City simply can\u2019t afford to. In Pelham, \u201calmost all of our buyers are coming from the city, increasingly from Brooklyn,\u201d Mr. Scinta said. \u201cThey are being priced out in terms of the additional space they need. They\u2019ve outgrown their apartments and can\u2019t afford to move up to the next-size apartment.\u201dIn their search for a home, Anil and Smita Abraham, who are moving from the Washington, D.C., area for Mr. Abraham\u2019s financial services job in New York, have hit many of the market hot spots, like Greenwich, Conn., and numerous places in lower Westchester. But on a Sunday in mid-May, the Abrahams and their two children, ages 6 and 4, were concentrating on open houses in Pelham. \u201cPelham is our top choice, I would say,\u201d Ms. Abraham said. \u201cWe really loved Greenwich, but it\u2019s too far to commute.\u201dThey were among a dozen or so buyers checking out a six-bedroom Georgian colonial that had been listed for $1.465 million the previous Thursday. The couple were smitten with the updated house, particularly because of its ample bedroom space \u2014 room for visiting grandparents \u2014 and large basement playroom. Although the open house wasn\u2019t busy, the listing agent, Caroline Baccellieri, an associate broker with McClellan Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, already had two offers in hand before it began. By that night, she had two more \u2014 including one from the Abrahams.But the sellers took one of the earlier offers. \u201cIt came in at over asking the day the house went on the market,\u201d Ms. Baccellieri said. \u201cWe felt like they were going to see it through and there weren\u2019t going to be any problems.\u201dEarlier this month, the Abrahams were in negotiations for another house in Pelham, but weren\u2019t certain they would reach a deal. With the spring season slowing and fewer properties coming on the market now, Mr. Abraham said they would buy elsewhere in lower Westchester if need be.Mike and Wendy Buzzeo of Jersey City were outbid three times as they searched recently for a home in Montclair, Maplewood and South Orange, N.J. During a crowded open house at a five-bedroom Queen Anne Victorian in Montclair last month, the Buzzeos, who have two sons, ages 1 and 3, said, based on their previous experiences, they suspected the list price of $539,000 was set deliberately low to spark a bidding war.\u201cWe figure you have to add at least $100,000 to the list price to get an idea of what the house is really going for, and usually it\u2019s more than $100,000,\u201d said Mr. Buzzeo, the head of international marketing for FXCM, an online brokerage firm.Betsy Ceccio of Keller Williams in Montclair, who had the listing along with her business partner, Joyce Slous, disputed the notion that homes were being underpriced to spark a frenzy. But she acknowledged that many homes were selling above their list prices, especially in the $500,000 to $900,000 range. Even with older bathrooms in need of updating, the Victorian, which is within walking distance of downtown and a train station, wound up netting 13 offers, all over asking, and several a full 20 percent higher, well beyond what the sellers expected, Ms. Ceccio said.\u201cBuyers were waiting and waiting for inventory to open up, and they\u2019re looking at the school calendar and thinking they need to get settled before the school year starts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe clock is ticking.\u201dThe Buzzeos were not among the bidders on that house, but Ms. Buzzeo, the director of digital marketing for MetLife, later said that they had made an offer that had been accepted on a house in Maplewood.The dearth of lower-priced inventory relative to demand is sometimes sparking bidding wars in towns where they are usually few and far between. In Weston, Conn., for example, which has no train station or downtown, and where sales have been sluggish this year, JoAnn and Doug Cohen found themselves in an unexpected bidding war earlier this spring for a three-bedroom split-level listed for $635,000. Having sold a large house in Westport two years ago, the Cohens, who have an 11-year-old daughter, had been renting in Weston while they looked for a modestly sized house priced under $850,000.\u201cI didn\u2019t want another large house,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, who works for an accounting services firm. (Her husband is a talent scout for a recruiting firm.) \u201cWe\u2019re on a seven-year-plan \u2014 we\u2019re going to move to a different area when our daughter graduates from high school.\u201dThe split-level was the nicest house they had seen; others in their price range had tended to need a lot of work. (The median sales price in Weston from February through May averaged around $780,000.) This one had an open floor plan with lots of natural light, a newer kitchen and a flat two-acre yard on a cul-de-sac.\u201cThere just aren\u2019t a whole lot of these out there,\u201d said Gabrielle DiBianco, the agent with the Higgins Group who represented the Cohens.Still, the Cohens were surprised when they made an offer under the asking price and were told they were competing with two others. They raised their bid enough to secure the house, and closed earlier this month.At the same time, in some of the rail towns on Long Island, houses sell so quickly that some agents aren\u2019t even bothering with open houses, said Maggie Keats, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Manhasset and Port Washington.\u201cThey have sufficient traffic by appointment,\u201d she said.Calling Manhasset and Port Washington \u201cthe \u2018it\u2019 markets\u201d for buyers moving from the city, Ms. Keats said the towns were benefiting from highly rated school districts, a quick commute to Penn Station, \u201ctrue\u201d downtowns and waterfront access.\u201cIn both of these communities, some of the movement you see is people within the community, whether up or down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a huge amount of turnover, and we do not get a great amount of inventory. So when something new comes on, there\u2019s high demand.\u201dIn Garden City, properties in good condition for under $1 million routinely draw multiple bids, as buyers are waiting in the wings, according to Stephanie Cullum, an associate broker and manager at Coach Realtors. In 23 years of selling real estate, Ms. Cullum said, she had never seen first-time buyers as determined to get a home as they were at the beginning of the spring market.\u201cA lot of them have bid on something and lost it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get out to see homes right when they come on.\u201dIn her opinion, not only the high prices in the city are driving demand; rising rents on Long Island are as well. \u201cTwo-bedrooms are asking $2,900 to $4,500 a month,\u201d she said, referring to Garden City. \u201cYou could get a nice mortgage for that.\u201dNot all buyers are motivated solely by budget considerations, of course. George and Brooke Antonopoulos have spent most of this year looking for a home in Darien, Conn. They\u2019ve lived in Manhattan for 10 years, but as they consider having a family, they are looking for more square footage for their money, along with the lifestyle they grew up with: \u201cyards and barbecues,\u201d said Ms. Antonopoulos, who works in accounting.They have made offers on two houses so far; neither worked out \u201cfor various reasons,\u201d said Mr. Antonopoulos, who works for a hedge fund. But they\u2019re not frazzled. They don\u2019t have to stand in line for a good property under $1.5 million, like so many other would-be Darien buyers. Given their budget of up to $4 million, the Antonopouloses say, the market, in their case, is tilting in their favor.Tammy La Gorce contributed reporting from Montclair, N.J.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legislature Reaches Deal to Extend Mayoral Control of New York\u2019s Schools for a Year", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 State lawmakers on Friday reached a long-awaited deal to conclude the 2016 legislative session that included a modest ethics package, state funding for supportive housing for the homeless, and a one-year extension \u2014 with major caveats \u2014 of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s control of New York City schools.Consensus on the ethics reform seemed to come quickly on Friday, the day after the last official day of the legislative session. The deal would, among other things, strip state pensions from public officials convicted of corruption and strengthen prohibitions on political campaigns\u2019 ability to coordinate with independent expenditure committees.But a similar consensus kept lurching out of reach on the issue that mattered most to Mr. de Blasio: mayoral control. In the end, he ceded significant concessions to his Albany antagonists in exchange for an extension of a single year, down from the three years he had hoped for.Bowing to demands from the State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican who is not disposed to be helpful to a mayor who has openly worked to flip control of the chamber to the Democrats, the mayor and his allies in the Democrat-dominated Assembly agreed to disclose more information about city school districts\u2019 spending and to accept a change to the oversight structure for more than half the city\u2019s charter schools.A one-year extension, with few or no caveats, had seemed all but cemented when lawmakers went to bed on Thursday evening. But the morning found Mr. Flanagan pushing for the funding transparency requirement, followed by the charter-school provision in the afternoon. It would effectively create a parallel system of charter schools within the city, allowing \u201chigh-performing charter schools in good standing\u201d to switch to join the State University of New York umbrella or the Board of Regents of the State Education Department.City Hall gritted its teeth.\u201cThis extension is a recognition of the unprecedented progress and achievements mayoral control has delivered for our school system,\u201d Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor\u2019s office, said in a statement.For people outside city education circles, however, there was plenty of meat in the agreement that Mr. Flanagan; Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat; and the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat, announced on Friday evening.Lawmakers also agreed to require school districts to test for lead in drinking water, with the state paying for some of the testing costs. The adoption of the lead testing bill was a victory for Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat, who heads the Education Committee and who had been criticized for blocking a previous bill that she considered too broad.Under the new bill, schools would be required to periodically test for lead \u2014 though some already do \u2014 and notify parents in the event the dangerous element is discovered.The state will also provide an additional $50 million in capital funding for SUNY and the City University of New York.But the governor\u2019s announcement that the state would release $570 million in state resources to build and operate 1,200 units of supportive housing for the homeless was immediately dissected and dismissed by advocates for the program, who said it fell far short of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s initial commitment to pay for 20,000 units.\u201cTonight\u2019s plan would appear to be a betrayal of the most vulnerable New Yorkers and the latest broken promise from a governor who makes sweeping announcements that lead to paltry results,\u201d the Campaign 4 NY/NY Housing, a supportive housing group, said in a statement.Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders had already agreed to funding for 6,000 units over five years as part of the state budget passed in March, but another deal was required to release the first infusion of money for spending. The $570 million figure included only $150 million of new state funding, said Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, the chairman of the Assembly\u2019s Social Services Committee, with the rest coming from existing capital funds and tax credits.\u201cIn January, it was 20,000 units,\u201d he said. \u201cIn April, it was 6,000 units. Now it\u2019s 1,200 units and it\u2019s only $150 million in new money. All the rest is smoke and mirrors.\u201dOther high-profile bills won both houses\u2019 backing on Friday.The Legislature passed a bill that aims to ensure equal access to legal representation for the poor by reimbursing counties for indigent legal services, drawing praise from the New York Civil Liberties Union.The hotel industry in New York City cheered the passage of legislation that would keep people from advertising stays shorter than 30 days in unoccupied homes, a measure that the bill\u2019s supporters said would restrict commercial operators of illegal hotels, but that Airbnb \u2014 the company that prompted the bill \u2014 said would affect regular city residents. It is already illegal in New York to rent out an empty apartment for less than 30 days at a time.The Legislature also passed bills that would increase penalties for using software known as ticket bots to scoop up large numbers of tickets to concerts, games or other events, a practice that the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, highlighted in a recent report. Doing so is already illegal, but the bill would make it a misdemeanor.The agreement on Friday, which came after a flurry of deals at the March budget deadline, including an increase in the minimum wage and the establishment of a paid family leave program, did not please corporate leaders like Heather Briccetti, the president of the Business Council of New York State, who called it devoid of any \u201cmajor pro-growth or cost reduction measures.\u201dNor did it mollify government watchdogs and other advocates of ethics reforms who had high hopes that the convictions last year of Sheldon Silver, the former Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, the former Senate majority leader, would finally shame the Legislature into acting to prevent corruption.But of all the measures on ethics that lawmakers did discuss this session, pension forfeiture, a straightforward and broadly popular measure, was the only prominent one to survive. Mr. Cuomo had proposed but failed to win support for more ambitious proposals that included eight different bills for closing a campaign-finance loophole that allows limited liability companies to donate to political candidates up to the limit for individual contributors, rather than for businesses.In order for pension forfeiture to become a constitutional amendment, two consecutively elected legislatures must approve it before voters consider the measure on the ballot.The announcement about the ethics agreement highlighted what were called strong protections against the independent expenditure committees empowered by the Citizens United ruling, the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 campaign finance decision. The governor had made a push to tighten restrictions on such committees over the past few weeks.The ethics package will also require political consultants who simultaneously advise elected officials or candidates and work with companies that have business before the state to register with the state and disclose their clients. It strengthens disclosure requirements for lobbyists and for tax-exempt nonprofits that lobby the state to disclose financial support from other nonprofits that are not supposed to engage in political activity.Blair Horner, the executive director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the deal was a \u201csmorgasbord of elections, ethics and lobbying reforms\u201d that nonetheless was \u201cnot focused at the heart of what\u2019s wrong with Albany,\u201d including the nearly unchecked flow of money through multiple limited liability companies. That said, Mr. Horner said the move to define coordination between independent expenditure committees and candidates was an improvement. \u201cNo one has defined what that means,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this does.\u201dThe greatest source of friction on Friday appeared to be the mayoral control issue.There was concern within City Hall that the charter school provision would significantly change how such schools in the city run.Charter schools can be authorized by three agencies \u2014 the State Education Department, the city\u2019s Education Department and SUNY \u2014 but all operate according to the same state law. Although the announcement of the agreement did not offer details, the Senate\u2019s proposal would exempt SUNY schools from the usual state standards and free to set their own rules, two officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations said.There are 111 charters authorized by SUNY in the city. Another 55 are authorized by the city\u2019s Education Department, and 39 by the state department.J. David Goodman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert H.B. Baldwin, Transformer of Morgan Stanley, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRobert H. B. Baldwin, a Wall Street maverick who presided over the transformation of Morgan Stanley from a prestigious but staid old investment bank into a modern, competitive financial services corporation in the 1970s and early \u201980s, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Skillman, N.J., near Princeton. He was 95.His son Robert Jr. confirmed the death on Wednesday.At the start of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s tenure, Morgan Stanley\u2019s partners and clients wore old-school neckties, lunched at the same clubs and relied on sure things: underwriting bonds, genteel integrity, assured profits. But as Morgan Stanley\u2019s gentlemanly mystique gave way to new regulations and cutthroat competition, Mr. Baldwin liked to remind them that he had worked his way through Princeton, and that his grandfather had been a railway conductor.In short, that he was not really one of them.A tough, brusque, often polarizing leader who struck colleagues as being out of place at Morgan Stanley, he was widely credited with pulling the firm out of its white-shoe rut into an era of enormous growth and painful change, less focused on exclusive services for blue-chip clients and more on the rough-and-tumble of securities trading, mergers and acquisitions and money management.As president from 1973 to 1982 and chairman until he retired at the end of 1983, Mr. Baldwin expanded Morgan Stanley into a full-service financial brokerage and changed a culture that had been entrenched for decades, with executive success often assured by family, social and educational connections.Morgan Stanley\u2019s tweedy underwriters dealt almost exclusively with the chief executives of corporate America \u2014 American Telephone, General Electric, Exxon, DuPont and other giants \u2014 playing golf, taking leisurely lunches, giving advice and managing the sales of bond and stock issues without dickering over commissions or competing in open markets. Those relationships were not abandoned under Mr. Baldwin.But after the Securities and Exchange Commission abolished fixed commissions on stock trades in 1975, changes were inevitable. For Morgan Stanley, which sold blocks of stock for institutions at set fees, the new rule meant a huge loss of easy revenue and a need to compete for commissions. It could no longer monitor markets from a distance, but had to get down on trading floors and skirmish for bids and prices.Mr. Baldwin created a trading operation from scratch, and hired a big staff for it. The firm had long looked down on the trading-floor crowd as coarse. Now it needed traders capable of split-second, high-pressure decisions, people with quick wits, stamina and guts. Other firms were raided for talent. Incentive pay sharpened performances. Collegiality faded, competition raced ahead.Other traditions also fell. To get closer to clients, Morgan Stanley gave up its hallowed headquarters on Wall Street and moved to Midtown Manhattan. It established new offices in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Instead of taking country club memberships, it rented Madison Square Garden sky boxes to entertain clients at Knicks and Rangers games.To compete for lucrative mergers and acquisitions, long shunned by Morgan Stanley\u2019s etiquette, Mr. Baldwin named dozens of new executives whose expertise was in equities and hostile takeovers, not social relationships. The firm also began taking start-ups as clients, handled initial public offerings of stock and moved into wealth management for private clients.By the time Mr. Baldwin stepped down, Morgan Stanley had become a full-service financial hub. Its staff had grown tenfold to 2,600 and its capital to more than $300 million from $7.5 million in 1970. It was still one of the most prestigious names on Wall Street. But historians said the cost had been great.Robert Hayes Burns Baldwin was born on July 9, 1920, in East Orange, N.J., to John Frank and Anna Burns Baldwin. His grandfather really was a Pennsylvania Railroad conductor. Robert graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1938. At Princeton, he ran a laundry to pay his way. He studied economics, played football, basketball and baseball, and graduated in 1942 with high honors. In World War II, he was a naval officer on two aircraft carriers.In 1949, he married Geraldine Gay Williams. They divorced. In 1981, Mr. Baldwin married Dorothy Tobin Ayres.Besides his son Robert, his survivors include another son, Whitney; three daughters, Janet K. Baldwin, Deborah Baldwin Fall and Elizabeth Baldwin Maushardt; two stepchildren, Mary Ayres Hack and W. Dillaway Ayres Jr.; and 13 grandchildren.Mr. Baldwin joined Morgan Stanley in 1946. He became a general partner in 1958 and a limited partner in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, he took a leave to be President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s under secretary of the Navy.As president and chairman of Morgan Stanley for a decade, he was an influential voice on Wall Street, quoted by the press when interest rates changed, inflation worsened or government agencies imposed new regulations affecting the industry.His 1975 prediction that hundreds of brokerage firms would go out of business as a result of the new S.E.C. rule eliminating fixed commissions was quoted often as its accuracy became apparent over the next few years. In 1978, he signaled Wall Street\u2019s cautious approval of a national market system linking the major securities exchanges electronically. And he spoke for many colleagues when he criticized President Jimmy Carter\u2019s tax reforms and enthusiastically endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980.When he stepped down as chairman at the end of 1983, he joined a board that informally advised Morgan Stanley on policy matters and business ventures. From 1989 to 1992, he was chairman of the Lodestar Group, a New York merchant bank.In later years, as Morgan Stanley became a global financial operation with 1,300 offices and 60,000 employees in 42 countries, Mr. Baldwin was remembered by old colleagues as a man of rough edges and driven energy, awkwardly misplaced among the Ivy Leaguers but the savior of a proud institution.\u201cTo the last, Baldwin remained hypercompetitive and bent on having his way,\u201d Mr. Chernow wrote in his history of the House of Morgan. \u201cYet for all his flaws, the tough, tactless Baldwin had emerged as the most important person in modern Morgan Stanley history, giving the firm the market skills to compete in a world no longer based on old-school ties.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s marriage to Dorothy Tobin Ayres. It was 1981, not 1961.Sam Roberts contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justices\u2019 Orders Underscore Ruling Against Abortion Limits", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand appeals court decisions that had blocked abortion restrictions in Mississippi and Wisconsin.Officials in Mississippi said women could obtain abortions in neighboring states. But Judge E. Grady Jolly, writing for the majority, said, \u201cMississippi may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state.\u201dThe case centers on a Texas law that has resulted in half its clinics closing.The court\u2019s orders in the abortion and union cases were just a few words long and gave no reasons.The court also did not explain why it had turned down appeals in cases on pharmacists who objected to dispensing some kinds of birth control and on compelled disclosures in connection with elections. But those orders drew dissent from conservative justices who said the court had erred in refusing to hear the appeals.The owners of Ralph\u2019s Thriftway, a grocery store and pharmacy in Olympia, Wash., and two pharmacists challenged the regulations, saying they objected to dispensing emergency contraceptives like Plan B because they believed them to be \u201ctantamount to abortion.\u201d The regulations, the plaintiffs said, violated the First Amendment\u2019s protection of religious liberty.Dissenting from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to deny review, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that there was \u201ca strong case\u201d that the regulations had been \u201cimproperly designed to stamp out religious objectors.\u201dJustice Alito added that the regulations \u201care likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications.\u201dDecisions in the 2015-16 term were deeply affected by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the refusal of Senate Republicans to approve President Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the empty seat.\u201cThe bottom line is clear: Washington would rather have no pharmacy than one that doesn\u2019t toe the line on abortifacient emergency contraceptives,\u201d Justice Alito wrote.Louise Melling, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Supreme Court had been right to turn down the appeal. \u201cWhen a woman walks into a pharmacy, she should not fear being turned away because of the religious beliefs of the owner or the person behind the counter,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOpen for business means open for all.\u201dOnly Justice Clarence Thomas had dissented from that part of the Citizens United decision, and he dissented again in the Delaware case. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote, \u201cit is time for the court to reconsider whether a state\u2019s interest in an informed electorate can ever justify the disclosure of otherwise anonymous donor rolls.\u201dJustice Alito said that he would have agreed to hear the case, but he did not join Justice Thomas\u2019s dissent.The court also agreed to hear eight new cases during its next term, which starts in October.

{"Headline": "\u2018Hustle\u2019 Mortgage Fraud Case Falls Into Crevice of the Law", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchProving fraud usually starts with finding a lie made to mislead someone into pursuing a transaction or spending money when they would not have done so if they knew the truth.When the story of the lack of prosecutions from the financial crisis is finally written, the most important issue will be how difficult it turned out to be to prove fraud. The courts have held the government to a high standard, refusing to uphold cases in which the conduct came close to the line but never quite crossed over into a violation.This was the only case to go to trial under the statute, setting what seemed to be a benchmark for proving fraud in connection with questionable mortgage practices. The government introduced evidence that a Countrywide program called the High-Speed Swim Lane, or \u201chustle,\u201d resulted in providing mortgages that did not meet the requirements set forth in contracts permitting them to be sold to Fannie and Freddie. Ms. Mairone oversaw the program that the government claimed caused more than $1 billion in losses to the two housing finance companies.According to the appeals court, the key question is whether \u201cwillful but silent noncompliance\u201d constituted \u201ca fraud \u2014 a knowingly false statement, made with intent to defraud \u2014 or is it simply an intentional breach of contract?\u201d There was no evidence that Countrywide made a false statement when it signed the contracts with Fannie and Freddie, only that it later decided to breach the agreement by selling bad mortgages without alerting the companies to that fact. Therefore, the Justice Department failed to \u201cprove fraudulent intent at the time of contract execution; evidence of a subsequent, willful breach cannot sustain the claim.\u201dIn the criminal law, which this case involved even though it was brought as a civil Firrea lawsuit, there must be what is known as a \u201cconcurrence of the elements.\u201d For fraud, the misstatement and the intent to defraud must be present at the same time, so that a subsequent decision to intentionally violate an agreement by supplying a shoddy product does not establish that a misstatement took place with the requisite intent at the time the contract was signed.Is this just a legal technicality that allows Bank of America to avoid liability? The answer is \u201cyes and no\u201d \u2014 what else do you expect from an academic?It is a technicality because the bank knew its mortgages did not meet the terms of the contracts but never alerted Fannie and Freddie that it was selling them bad loans that would cause significant losses. A buyer expects the seller to adhere to the terms of the contract, or to try to withdraw from it otherwise, so normally one can assume that silence on Countrywide\u2019s part meant it was meeting its legal obligations for the loans it sold.Bank of America avoided the penalty because it found a loophole that meant it did not lie when it sold the bad mortgages, only that it breached the agreement in a way that fell short of being a fraud.But the answer is also \u201cno\u201d because a basic requirement for proving fraud is that the government show there was an affirmative misstatement, or that the party that remained silent had a duty to speak. A contractual relationship does not impose such a duty unless it is an explicit term of the agreement.Fannie and Freddie could have easily avoided the problem by including a requirement that the seller of mortgage loans certify that they were in compliance with the contract. That simple step that would have alerted the companies to problems in what Countrywide was selling \u2014 or been the basis for a fraud claim if the company said nothing about meeting the mortgage standards.So the hustle case falls into a crevice in the law. Fraud requires a deception, and that those accused of a violation knew that their statement or silence was in fact misleading. Just breaching a contract, standing alone, will not be enough to prove fraud.The appeals court\u2019s decision fits a pattern in recent appellate cases in which misleading statements were found not to rise to the level of fraud, or at least raised a sufficient question about a violation that a conviction had to be overturned.\u201cTo state the obvious, they will often try to mislead the other party about the prices and terms they are willing to accept. Such deceptions are not criminal,\u201d the appeals court stated.In finding that the evidence should have been admitted, the appeals court said that \u201ca jury could reasonably have found that misrepresentations by a dealer as to the price paid for certain R.M.B.S. would be immaterial to a counterparty that relies not on a \u2018market\u2019 price or the price at which prior trades took place, but instead on its own sophisticated valuation methods and computer model.\u201dThere is an intuitive sense that deception resulting in losses must be fraudulent. But the appeals courts have taken a stricter view, making it more difficult to prove fraud in cases involving ordinary business transactions, even in some instances when it can be shown a statement was false.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberia, Desperate to Educate, Turns to Charter Schools", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byFixesOne reason many students stay home is that teachers do, too. George Werner, who has been education minister for a year, has begun a ghost-busting project \u2014 firing teachers who either don\u2019t teach or don\u2019t exist. In three counties so far, Liberia has removed 2,500 ghost teachers from the payroll.President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has another 18 months in office. Education reform is a long-term project. But she and Werner are doing one thing in a hurry: When the school year starts in September, private operators \u2014 for-profit companies and charitable organizations \u2014 will take charge of 120 government primary schools, 3 percent of the total. It\u2019s a one-year pilot project that, if it works, could lead to a nationwide charter school system.Everything that involves for-profit schooling is controversial. In Africa as in the United States, private schools attract wealthier families \u2014 pulling advantaged students and their influential parents out of the public system. To a lesser extent, the same is true with charter schools: They often strip out families who place great importance on their children\u2019s education. Resources sometimes follow.Low-cost private schools are everywhere in Africa. But most are very similar to government schools. They usually consist of a single teacher in her house, with no access to training or materials, using the same rote-learning system ubiquitous in developing countries: She writes something on the blackboard, students repeat it in unison.Bridge is different. Teachers are closely monitored, supervised and coached. They get scripted lessons on tablets, which tell them what to say and do every minute. Bridge has master teachers who create lessons; the classroom teacher\u2019s job is to deliver them. This allows Bridge to hire high school graduates at low salaries. They get a three-week course in teaching methods and managing a classroom.Bridge also has a very long school day, eight and a half hours, with optional Saturdays. Bridge now has over 460 nursery and primary schools in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and India, and has been opening a new school every 2.5 days on average.Bridge charges $6 a month in tuition \u2014 well out of range for a slum dweller living on a dollar a day. But supposedly free public schools also charge, in the forms of fees and bribes, leaving the poorest at the same disadvantage.You\u2019d expect Bridge\u2019s students to do better academically than public school students, and they do. But how much is attributable to family background, and how much to Bridge\u2019s teaching?A formal evaluation is just beginning. For now, we have Bridge\u2019s studies. The company recently commissioned a study in Kenya comparing its schools with a control group and controlling for family factors. The results were so-so in math: Bridge students got the equivalent of 13 percent more instruction each year. They were excellent in English, the equivalent of 32 percent more schooling.Liberia\u2019s partnership project grew from a series of conversations that began last September between Werner and Shannon May, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Bridge. Werner then visited Bridge schools in Kenya and Uganda, talking to parents and teachers. \u201cI was awed by what I saw: the ability of children to read and write, the commitment of teachers, the measurement and evaluation mechanisms, the organization,\u201d he said in an interview last week. When Sirleaf was in Kenya on a state visit, she too visited a Bridge school.They decided to do a one-year pilot program with Bridge, and if the pilot was successful, to turn more of Liberia\u2019s primary schools over to Bridge \u2014 perhaps eventually all.May jumped at the opportunity. \u201cThey are paying $78 per kid per year,\u201d she said. \u201cI said we could do it for $75, and you would get everything you see in Bridge schools now if we could do it at scale. I want to show that the Liberian government can afford a great school.\u201dLiberia\u2019s public school teachers threatened to strike. As for private schools, there are some good ones in Liberia. They all said, \u201cWhat about us?\u201dBut it\u2019s still hugely controversial. Let\u2019s try to sort this out.First, a number of accusations are nonsense. For example:As it does for all schools, the government will provide schools in the pilot with teachers, administrative staff and school buildings, all paid for from the education budget. Outside donors \u2014 not yet publicly identified \u2014 will be supplying another $50 to $60 per student. \u201cWe operators are asked, as far as possible, to live within that amount,\u201d said Paul Skidmore, the founder and chief executive of Rising Academies.That will be impossible, as there are large upfront costs that operators will have to pay themselves. All will certainly lose money on the pilot.If the pilot is successful and the program expands, the government will pay operators the same amount per pupil as it spends on regular schools.At the same time, the project raises serious concerns:The other charter operators haven\u2019t even been chosen. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unfair, but there is nothing you can do,\u201d said Alain Guy Tanefo, chief executive of Omega. \u201cIt\u2019s still good to be a part of. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to prove there are other models.\u201dBridge\u2019s other advantage is financial. Its investors include Bill Gates (personally), Khosla Ventures, the Omidyar Network, the Zuckerberg Education Venture and Learn Capital, which counts Pearson as a limited partner. Bridge could sink unlimited money into its 50 schools, even at a level that would be unsustainable if scaled up.Small pilot, small problem. But if the Partnership schools scale up, it could be a big problem.That doesn\u2019t have to happen. The public school system might benefit, by adapting relevant practices from the charters. \u201cIt could be a way to bring new people, talent and innovation to the public sector, and strengthen it,\u201d said Hares.But Liberian schools are a disaster precisely because the government has been unable to do that. And if it could, then why bring in private school operators? Why not use those skills to create a decent public system?A personal note: In the American context, I oppose public financing or encouragement of private and charter schools. I\u2019ve sent my children to New York City public elementary and middle schools that are not academically selective. Our elementary school has been active in the anti-charter movement.Liberia is different. The project should have been envisioned sooner, and the process should have been fairer. But if experimentation is justified anywhere, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s hard to look at Liberia\u2019s educational system and say: Do nothing new.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Expiration Date on China\u2019s Promises Stokes Unease in Hong Kong Housing", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported bySinosphere\u201cThe current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the lifestyle,\u201d the Joint Declaration said.Hong Kong\u2019s housing prices are as vertiginous as its towers, and many people struggle just to afford a mortgage \u2014 even the 30-year ones that banks increasingly offered as property prices rocketed over the past decade, said Lee Wing-tat, a former legislator and the chairman of Land Watch, a land and housing think tank.\u201cNow, if you do a 30-year mortgage arrangement, it\u2019s from 2016 to 2046 \u2014 that\u2019s still O.K.,\u201d Mr. Lee said in an interview. But that could change, he said, predicting, \u201cThey will not lend out the money for a mortgage up to 2048.\u201dAdam Harper, a spokesman for HSBC, which was founded in Hong Kong in 1865 and prints most of the money in the territory, said the bank \u201cmonitors market and economic conditions carefully.\u201dJust as in the 1980s, when the capitalist city looked nervously ahead to Communist rule, there is, once again, a focus on land and finance.\u201cThe banking sector and the financial sector need clear certainties to invest in the Hong Kong market, in long-term infrastructure development and housing,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cUnless in the coming five years Beijing has a clear policy for Hong Kong after 2047, if they can\u2019t present a clear message, a safe message, there will be a negative effect on confidence.\u201dThis time, though, land leases are a lesser cause for concern, he said. All land in Hong Kong is leased by the government to a buyer, a colonial government practice retained by the post-handover government.As these leases expire, the government is already renewing beyond 2047, Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf you renew a lease today, they will extend to 2066.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the usual practice,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent guaranteed.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de facto central bank, wrote in an email that the Hong Kong government \u201chas already indicated that it has constitutional rights to grant land lease with tenure beyond 2047.\u201dWith regard to long-term mortgages, wrote the spokeswoman, who commented on condition of anonymity in keeping with the agency\u2019s custom when stating official policy, \u201cBanks should take into account the land tenure and other relevant factors.\u201d She added, \u201cBanks have not reflected any issues relating to land tenure to the H.K.M.A. so far.\u2019\u2019\u201cHistory repeats itself,\u201d said Johannes Chan, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cIn the 1980s, the banks were a prime driver for a solution.\u201dThat demand for financial certainty led to the Joint Declaration and the legal framework, known as the Basic Law, that Britain and China agreed to for post-handover Hong Kong, which described the city\u2019s rights for 50 years after 1997.The Joint Declaration was the basis for the recovery of China\u2019s sovereignty, and \u201cit clearly stated that the Chinese policy was to let things go on for 50 years,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cThere is no promise for beyond 50 years. Thereafter it will relapse, because sovereignty has already been resumed.\u201dThe decision is entirely up to China, he said. \u201cAt the moment I think it is fair to say that no one in the world knows what will happen in 2047,\u201d Mr. Chan said.And, without clarity, banks will quietly begin shrinking the time frame for mortgages, he predicted, \u201cuntil the interest rates get too high with 15-year mortgages\u201d and the risk of borrower default \u201cis too great.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of America to Pay $415 Million to Settle S.E.C. Inquiry", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe Securities and Exchange Commission will examine the brokerage industry for potential violations in the way companies handle customer cash after the regulator reached a $415 million settlement with Bank of America. The S.E.C. found the bank\u2019s Merrill Lynch to have misused billions of dollars of client money to finance its own trades.The S.E.C. said Merrill Lynch misused as much as $5 billion in customer cash weekly from 2009 to 2012, making complex options trades that generated $50 million in profits for the company over that period. In the process, the bank failed to safeguard customer assets that could have been jeopardized in the event the company failed.That is not a minor concern. The activity in question, which began before Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch in January 2009, coincides with the height of the financial crisis. Merrill Lynch\u2019s merger with Bank of America came as the bank faced steep losses; Bank of America would eventually receive $45 billion in government bailout money.The settlement is the largest against a company over the customer protection rule.The S.E.C. also said on Thursday that Merrill Lynch improperly put as much as $58 billion of customer cash daily into accounts that were subject to liens from clearing banks. That money was also at risk had Merrill Lynch failed. The activity ran from 2009 until last year, when the S.E.C. said it notified the bank of the issue.\u201cThe rules concerning the safety of customer cash and securities are fundamental protections for investors and impose lines that simply can never be crossed,\u201d said Andrew J. Ceresney, the S.E.C.\u2019s director of enforcement.Though customers did not lose money, the enormous exposure to risk brought on such steep penalties, Mr. Ceresney said.\u201cMerrill Lynch violated these rules, including during the heart of the financial crisis, and the significant relief imposed today reflects the severity of its failures,\u201d he said.Under the customer protection rule, brokerage firms are supposed to hold customer cash in a reserve account, separate from other firm assets. This is an expensive rule for banks because they cannot use that idle money for other activities, but it is in place to protect customer assets and make them accessible to customers in a crisis. Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse in 2008 left brokerage customers unable to recover billions of dollars of assets for months if not years.\u201cWhile no customers were harmed and no losses were incurred, our responsibility is to protect customer assets and we have dedicated significant resources to reviewing and enhancing our processes,\u201d Merrill Lynch said in a statement. \u201cThe issues related to our procedures and controls have been corrected. We have cooperated fully with the S.E.C. staff throughout this investigation.\u201dThe S.E.C. says Merrill Lynch created complex options trades that lacked economic substance but had the effect of reducing the amount of money it needed to set aside in the customer reserve account. That freed money for the bank in what amounted to interest-free loans from customer funds.A newly hired executive raised questions about the trades in April 2012, and Merrill Lynch discontinued them after a review, Mr. Ceresney said in a call with reporters on Thursday. But Merrill Lynch did not tell regulators about its decision to stop the trades, a failure of transparency that made its penalties in the case more severe, he said.The agency will begin a review of other brokerage firms to unearth potential misuses of customer funds, though the S.E.C. says it is encouraging firms to come forward with information by offering leniency.Merrill Lynch is paying $50 million in disgorgement of the profits from the trades, another $7 million in interest and a $358 million penalty.The S.E.C. also announced a case against William Tirrell, who was Merrill Lynch\u2019s chief of regulatory reporting when the violations occurred. He faces an administrative hearing over accusations that he failed to adequately monitor the trades and provide information about them to regulators.His lawyer, Steven M. Witzel of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, said in an emailed statement: \u201cWhile we are disappointed that the S.E.C. filed this action, Mr. Tirrell looks forward to the opportunity to vindicate himself at trial.\u201dSeparately, Merrill Lynch will pay $10 million to settle S.E.C. claims that it sold complex securities to 4,000 investors in 2010 and 2011 with inadequate disclosures. The bank sold $150 million of the securities, called structured notes. It did not admit to wrongdoing in this case. It paid $5 million to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which helped investigate the case.In October, the S.E.C. announced its first structured note settlement with UBS, which agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle charges that it made false or misleading statements and omissions in its sale of the products to investors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "And if Elected: What President Trump Could or Couldn\u2019t Do", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorUnder the principle of separation of powers, the president shares power with Congress and the judiciary. The party system, the press and American political traditions may constrain him as well. But what would this mean in practice if Mr. Trump wins?It depends on what Mr. Trump wants to do. His signature issues are immigration and trade. He could not build the Mexican wall without congressional support. But he could order immigration authorities to deport unauthorized immigrants.And he could bar Muslims from entering the country under existing law, which authorizes him to bar classes of aliens whose entry he determines \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be the first time: President Ronald Reagan cited this law, as well as his inherent constitutional powers, to block a flood of Haitian migrants from pouring into United States territory in 1981.Can he slap tariffs on China, as he has threatened? Yes, he can. Congress has delegated to the president the power to retaliate against foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices like dumping, leaving it to the president and trade officials to determine what that means. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs on China and other countries for what many observers considered political reasons.The World Trade Organization ruled the steel tariffs illegal in that case. But Mr. Trump could simply ignore its judgment, and indeed withdraw the United States from the W.T.O., just as President Bush withdrew the United States from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002. While he\u2019s at it, Mr. Trump could tear up the North Atlantic Treaty, which created NATO, an organization that he has called \u201cobsolete.\u201dIn wielding executive power in these ways, Mr. Trump would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Bush cited his commander in chief powers in order to justify interrogation, surveillance and detention polices in the wake of Sept. 11. While Mr. Obama has shied away from Mr. Bush\u2019s constitutional arguments, he has interpreted statutes aggressively, while also relying on constitutional authorities, to justify the military intervention in Libya in 2011 and his nonenforcement of immigration laws.He could direct the Department of Justice to investigate his critics by prioritizing categories of crimes they may have committed. Political opponents could be accused of campaign finance law violations. Former government officials, like Hillary Clinton, could be accused of violating secrecy laws. Even if the charges come to nothing, the legal fees for defendants will be hefty.Mr. Trump could also crack down on journalists who report on national security issues by enforcing federal secrecy laws more aggressively than previous presidents. President Obama received a lot of criticism for prosecuting government employees who leaked secrets, but the Justice Department did not bring charges against the journalists who published the leaked information.What couldn\u2019t Mr. Trump do? He couldn\u2019t lower (or raise) taxes on his own. He\u2019s supposed to spend funds that Congress appropriates and for the things that Congress appropriates them for \u2014 that\u2019s what stands in the way of the wall (unless he persuades Mexico to pay for it and construct it on the other side of the border).What, then, stands between us and a nearly unbounded Mr. Trump, aside from the next election? Senators McCain and McConnell say Congress, but only a veto-proof majority in both houses, passing new laws, could stop Mr. Trump from exercising the legal authority that Congress has already given the president. Congress can threaten to withhold funds, but the president\u2019s powers to veto legislation and appoint government officers give him a large bargaining chip. Removal of a president by impeachment is extremely difficult; it has never happened.The courts are another barrier, but they would need to reverse their longstanding practice of deferring to the president in matters of foreign affairs and domestic regulation. The Supreme Court could, for example, declare an entry bar on Muslims unconstitutional. But it\u2019s hard to predict how Mr. Trump would respond. After a federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, ruled against him on a motion in the long-running Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump called him a \u201chater\u201d and a \u201cMexican\u201d (Judge Curiel is an American).To make things happen, Mr. Trump will need to get loyalists into leadership positions of the agencies, but to do so, he will need the cooperation of the Senate (or he will need to aggressively exploit his recess appointment powers). Moreover, the small number of politically appointed leaders enjoy only limited control of the mass of civil servants. These employees can drag their feet, leak to the press, threaten to resign and employ other tactics to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives if they object to them. They\u2019re also hard to fire, thanks to Civil Service protections.But Mr. Trump can fight back. He can appoint loyalists not only to political positions in the executive branch, but to the courts, and he may be able to attract them to the ranks of the Civil Service. And while executive branch officials who disregard the law might be prosecuted by the Justice Department, President Trump would have one more trick up his sleeve. Like President George H.W. Bush, who rescued Iran-contra defendants from punishment in 1992, he could hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards in the form of the pardon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When You Dial 911 and Wall Street Answers", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Bottom Line Nation | Part 1Since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms have increasingly taken over public services like emergency care and firefighting, often with dire effects.Supported byA Tennessee woman slipped into a coma and died after an ambulance company took so long to assemble a crew that one worker had time for a cigarette break.Paramedics in New York had to covertly swipe medical supplies from a hospital to restock their depleted ambulances after emergency runs.A man in the suburban South watched a chimney fire burn his house to the ground as he waited for the fire department, which billed him anyway and then sued him for $15,000 when he did not pay.In each of these cases, someone dialed 911 and Wall Street answered.The business of driving ambulances and operating fire brigades represents just one facet of a profound shift on Wall Street and Main Street alike, a New York Times investigation has found. Since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms, the \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d of an earlier era, have increasingly taken over a wide array of civic and financial services that are central to American life.Today, people interact with private equity when they dial 911, pay their mortgage, play a round of golf or turn on the kitchen tap for a glass of water.In emergency care and firefighting, this approach creates a fundamental tension: the push to turn a profit while caring for people in their most vulnerable moments.For governments and their citizens, the effects have often been dire. Under private equity ownership, some ambulance response times worsened, heart monitors failed and companies slid into bankruptcy, according to a Times examination of thousands of pages of internal documents and government records, as well as interviews with dozens of former employees. In at least two cases, lawsuits contend, poor service led to patient deaths.Private equity gained new power and responsibility as a direct result of the 2008 crisis. As cities and towns nationwide struggled to pay for basics like public infrastructure and ambulance services, private equity stepped in. At the same time, as banks scaled back their mortgage operations after the crisis, private equity firms \u2014 which face lighter regulation than banks, and none of their rainy-day capital requirements \u2014 moved in there as well.The power shift has happened with relatively little scrutiny, even as federal authorities have tightened rules for banks. Unlike banks, which take deposits and borrow from the government, private equity firms invest money from wealthy individuals and pension funds desperate for returns at a time of historically low interest rates.\u201cThere is private equity \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 and it\u2019s happening everywhere,\u201d said Vikram Pandit, a former Citigroup chief executive who is now head of the Orogen Group, which invests in financial businesses. Across the financial landscape, he said, \u201cNew champions will emerge.\u201dWarburg Pincus, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, and other major private equity firms have invested in emergency services, a business that routinely holds the lives of customers in its hands. While this represents one small corner of private equity, which traditionally used debt to seize underperforming companies, it captures the industry\u2019s newfound pervasiveness.K.K.R. \u2014 a firm memorialized in \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d a book that chronicled a defining 1980s Wall Street deal \u2014 also invested in public water services. Blackstone is now America\u2019s largest landlord of rental houses. And in the mortgage industry, until recently the province of banks, the Fortress Investment Group controls a huge bill collector.In many of the fields where private equity now operates, it has not necessarily performed better or worse than the banks and governments it replaced. In some cases it financed projects that others wouldn\u2019t fund and provided crucial public services, including emergency care. And because these firms do not rely on the government for loans, and are much smaller than Wall Street banks, they pose far less risk to the broader economy.\u201cOver 11 million Americans work for private-equity-backed businesses, and millions more rely on private equity performance for their retirement security,\u201d said James Maloney, a spokesman for the American Investment Council, the industry\u2019s leading lobbying group. Private equity, Mr. Maloney said, helps \u201cadvance both our economic and societal well-being.\u201dBut the Times investigation of emergency services shows that hasn\u2019t always been the case.Of the 12 ambulance companies recently owned by private equity, three filed for bankruptcy in the last three years, according to public filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence, a research service that tracks over 1,100 major ambulance companies in the United States. Those three companies had problems that predated private equity. But no other ambulance company tracked by the research firm filed for bankruptcy during that period.The latest blowup came in February, when TransCare EMS, controlled by the firm Patriarch Partners, filed for bankruptcy, closing its doors forever. One day, cities and towns up and down the East Coast had TransCare services; the next, they didn\u2019t.\u201cPrivate equity has, in this case, threatened public safety,\u201d said Richard Thomas, the mayor of Mount Vernon, N.Y, which relied on TransCare. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way to treat the public.\u201dPatriarch\u2019s owner and founder, Lynn Tilton, said in a statement that she was \u201cdeeply saddened by the unfortunate circumstances that triggered the abrupt end to TransCare\u2019s operations and the heartache it has caused for many of its devoted employees.\u201d She noted that TransCare, like other ambulance companies, \u201cfaced the obstacles inherent to its business model.\u201dRural/Metro, long one of the nation\u2019s largest ambulance companies and one of the few operators of private fire departments, did a tour through bankruptcy, although it reorganized and stayed in business. One private equity investor took Rural/Metro into bankruptcy, and another helped get it out.During that period, Rural/Metro\u2019s response times slowed in certain towns and it instituted more aggressive billing practices across the board, records show. While under the control of Warburg, Rural/Metro once sent a $761 collections notice to an infant girl born in an ambulance.\u201cThe matter may be reported to a national credit reporting agency,\u201d the notice read, effectively threatening a baby with a bad credit report.\u201cObviously there were problems with Rural/Metro,\u201d said Ron Cunningham, a spokesman for Rural/Metro\u2019s new parent company, Envision Healthcare, which is not a private equity firm. \u201cWe are continuing to hire paramedics and E.M.T.s and what you are seeing is that the response times are improving.\u201dIn a statement, Warburg said it \u201cinvested in Rural/Metro with the objective of growing and strengthening the company\u2019s business.\u201d\u201cDespite several initiatives undertaken by the company\u2019s board and management team,\u201d the statement said, the \u201cchallenges Rural/Metro faced were too difficult to overcome.\u201dWhile private equity firms have always invested in a diverse array of companies, including hospitals and nursing homes, their movement into emergency services raises broader questions about the administering of public services. Cities and towns are required to offer citizens a free education, and they generally provide a police force, but almost everything else is fair game for privatization.\u201cWe\u2019re reaching new lows in the public safety services we will help provide, especially in very poor cities,\u201d said Michelle Wilde Anderson, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in state and local government. Private equity firms, she said, \u201care not philanthropists.\u201dA TransCare ambulance pulled into a hospital parking lot in Westchester County. Employees in windbreakers, \u201cEMS\u201d emblazoned on the backs, hopped out and headed for the emergency room door.They were there not to bring in a patient or sign paperwork, but to go \u201cE.R. shopping\u201d: swiping supplies to replenish critical items TransCare could not afford to replace in its ambulances.After an ambulance finishes a run, hospital staff members often restock medications as a courtesy. But TransCare emergency workers described pressure from supervisors to go further and raid supply carts, sometimes without the hospital\u2019s blessing. On occasion, one TransCare worker would act as lookout while \u201cthe other one would just be grabbing stuff,\u201d said Emanuel Almodovar, a former employee.Chez Valenta, an 11-year veteran of TransCare, said employees often had no choice. Medications in the ambulances were expired and supplies were depleted.\u201cThere\u2019s only a couple of things that terrify paramedics,\u201d Ms. Valenta said. \u201cBeing without your critical medications is one of them. I make no apologies.\u201dThe supply shortage \u2014 and the extreme measures taken to address it \u2014 was just one warning sign of TransCare\u2019s demise. In February, it became official: Employees received an email from a supervisor declaring, \u201cWe are being told to cease operations immediately.\u201dTransCare\u2019s unraveling, told through internal documents and interviews with former employees, provides a case study in private equity\u2019s ambulance experiment. The company\u2019s implosion followed the bankruptcies of two other ambulance companies owned by private equity, Rural/Metro and First Med.TransCare, an ambulance company owned by a private equity firm, recently went out of business. We obtained internal emails and minutes of executive meetings that lay bare the company\u2019s final year and its ultimate demise.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Private equity investors swept into the ambulance business with high hopes.\u201cTremendous growth potential,\u201d Warburg Pincus said in a statement in 2011 when it bought Rural/Metro with plans to acquire rival ambulance services and improve bill collection.\u201cIt didn\u2019t quite play out like they had hoped,\u201d said Mike Ward, executive director of the National EMS Management Association.So some private equity firms fell back on a time-tested moneymaking strategy: slashing costs. The case of TransCare shows the perils of that approach.In 2003, Patriarch helped rescue TransCare, which had previously been owned by other private equity investors, from another bankruptcy. For years the company, which once had 2,000 employees, showed signs of improvement, with ample resources and high morale.Patriarch\u2019s owner, Ms. Tilton, liked to put a friendly face on private equity, shunning the stereotype of Wall Street raiders out to strip companies of valuable assets or flip them for a quick profit. Ms. Tilton starred in a reality television show, \u201cDiva of Distressed,\u201d and has famously said, \u201cIt\u2019s only men I strip and flip.\u201dThe TransCare mess was a mere blip for Patriarch, which manages a sprawling portfolio of more than 70 companies, including the mapmaker Rand McNally.And Ms. Tilton, who said she \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to try to save the company, attributed TransCare\u2019s collapse to problems beyond Patriarch\u2019s control. The business requires costly investment in medical gear, she said. \u201cWith limited free cash flow, any disruptions in the business can cause unsustainable deterioration.\u201dYet Ms. Tilton was very much in charge of TransCare as it crumbled. She was the sole owner of the Patriarch Partners fund that had a controlling stake in TransCare. And although she never held an executive or management role, she was TransCare\u2019s sole board member \u2014 a situation almost unheard-of in corporate America. Only 3 percent of private companies have two or fewer board members, according to survey data from the National Association of Corporate Directors, which called a one-person board \u201clikely a recipe for governance failure.\u201dFormer TransCare employees described pressure to cut costs and increase billing as the company weakened in recent years. Patients were transported unnecessarily in ambulances, they said.And ambulances regularly broke down. On the day TransCare filed for bankruptcy, more than 30 percent of the company\u2019s vehicles were out of service, some for hundreds of days, according to internal documents.\u201cWe drove buses on the 911 unit where the brakes didn\u2019t work properly,\u201d said Rayshma Raghunath, a former TransCare employee, referring to her ambulance. She started feeling uneasy during the Ebola scare in 2014, when she said workers had trouble getting enough sanitary wipes to disinfect their ambulances.Caitlin Cannizzaro, another former employee, said that even starting the ambulances became tough. One morning, it took four hours to get some running, she said. \u201cYou really had to become a MacGyver in the field.\u201dBy early 2015, the company had racked up health department violations for failed ambulance inspections, internal documents show. Employees spotted bedbugs in the Brooklyn dispatch center. Suppliers refused to provide drugs or repair ambulances because of unpaid bills.\u201cWe were constantly having problems with the heart monitors,\u201d said Mr. Almodovar, the former emergency medical technician. \u201cIt started getting scary. The last thing we want is for a patient to die on us because the equipment is failing.\u201dBy February 2015, shortages became critical. According to meeting minutes reviewed by The Times, TransCare executives discussed how their New York locations would be \u201cunable to make it through the weekend with current medical supplies.\u201dSupervisors regularly paid for supplies out of their own pockets and hoped for reimbursement, emails show. Some workers said the ambulances carried expired medications. Others went \u201cE.R. shopping.\u201dIn March 2015, a new problem emerged: Some TransCare employees did not get paid on time. Then in July, it happened again.When it looked like payroll might be delayed another time, TransCare sent sample questions and answers to managers, \u201cto help you communicate\u201d with frustrated employees. It read in part:Q. When will we be paid?A. We do not know.In the first few days of 2016, the trouble accelerated. Eviction warnings had piled up. High levels of carbon monoxide in the Brooklyn office sent at least one employee to the hospital, according to medical records.The company lost a major customer, the city of New Rochelle, N.Y. Less than 48 hours later, employees learned the chief executive had stepped down \u2014 the third in four years to leave.\u201cRecent events have been a wake-up call,\u201d the chief operating officer wrote to the staff to announce the chief executive\u2019s departure. The note signed off, \u201cHere\u2019s to a great future together!\u201dA month later, the company filed for bankruptcy, leaving a mess for cities and employees alike. Workers rushed to the company\u2019s offices in Brooklyn to collect their final paychecks. Worried the checks might bounce, some piled into emergency vehicles and raced to a 24-hour check-cashing store.James Bradley, deputy commissioner of public safety in White Plains, blamed Patriarch for TransCare\u2019s woes. \u201cThat\u2019s where the problems lie,\u201d he said.The city of Mount Vernon, another former customer in New York, hired a new private company at a cost to taxpayers, and is developing its own ambulance operation within its fire department. In New York City, where TransCare had operated 27 ambulances, the fire department paid its own ambulance workers overtime to fill the void.\u201cI am highly upset with Patriarch. They lied to us,\u201d said Jay Robbins, a former director of operations at TransCare who was at ground zero after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\u201cI told my employees to come in and work, and now they won\u2019t be getting paid,\u201d he said soon after the bankruptcy, his voice shaking.The bankruptcy also disrupted litigation pending against the company, including a malpractice case that raises questions about TransCare\u2019s training procedures.During an Aerosmith concert at Madison Square Garden in 2012, Robert Albrecht, a 52-year-old businessman with a wife and three children, suddenly collapsed.TransCare arrived within minutes \u2014 it was stationed in the building. But a paramedic mistakenly inserted a breathing tube into Mr. Albrecht\u2019s esophagus, medical records and the lawsuit show, pumping air into his stomach instead of his lungs. He was pronounced dead minutes later.The case was scheduled for preliminary settlement talks, according to the family\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan C. Reiter, when TransCare went under. Today Mr. Albrecht\u2019s widow is a creditor in the bankruptcy, in line with medical suppliers and unpaid workers.In Loudon County, Tenn., another ambulance company was unnerving local officials.After 11 years of relying on Rural/Metro, the Tennessee county wanted to part ways in 2014. So it sent letters to the company outlining grievances: Rural/Metro employees slept through an emergency call. A Rural/Metro driver refused to transport a dead body because it would \u201cstink up\u201d his ambulance. Another Rural/Metro worker, who later said she offered to respond to an emergency even though she was off duty, had enough time to smoke a cigarette while the company scrambled to assemble a full crew. The patient later died.In the year since private equity had led the company into bankruptcy, Rural/Metro had endangered \u201cthe health and welfare\u201d of its citizens, Loudon County said in a letter to the company. It was, as the letter put it, \u201ca complete system failure.\u201dData on the quality of an ambulance company\u2019s performance is scarce at the national level and difficult to compare town-to-town or company-to-company. A basic metric \u2014 how often ambulances are late \u2014 is often defined differently, if it is measured at all.Still, data can show how one company changes over time, and a Times analysis of data obtained under freedom of information laws from five of Rural/Metro\u2019s major markets suggests that service in four areas suffered under private equity ownership. The Times examined where Rural/Metro operated exclusively, in or near cities.In one town, response times surged; in another, penalties skyrocketed. In a third, county officials time and again received a dreaded alert: no available ambulances.The first private equity investor to back Rural/Metro was Warburg Pincus. It was just one investment for a firm that manages roughly $40 billion.But the 2011 takeover was the sort of acquisition that tarred private equity firms in the public mind as corporate raiders out to make a fast dollar. Warburg financed its roughly $730 million purchase by adding more than $500 million in debt to Rural/Metro\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 a deep hole to climb out of.Initially, Warburg invested in the company and its ambulances. Rural/Metro acquired two ambulance companies, helping increase capital spending by 20 percent and payroll by 15 percent in 2012. But the deals added to overall debt, contributing to cutbacks that potentially affected patient care.Some ambulances weren\u2019t promptly restocked, employees said. In Arizona, the company\u2019s home state, it shelved a program that gave raises to senior staff. It also slashed pensions there.\u201cIt was a train wreck,\u201d said Aaron Chamney, a former Rural/Metro fire captain who said he was dismissed a month into Warburg\u2019s ownership after he was injured on the job.The financial results were also a mess. Rural/Metro, which operates ambulances in 20 states, told investors it would book higher revenue than it ultimately did, leading bondholders to sue Warburg for fraud, a case that continues. Warburg denies the accusations.As Warburg\u2019s investment spiraled toward bankruptcy, service suffered.In Arizona, just days before the August 2013 bankruptcy, the health department wrote to Rural/Metro demanding data on its 911 response times. Rural/Metro was failing to respond on time, state records show.Tacoma, Wash., waived almost all of Rural/Metro\u2019s fines for lateness in 2012 because the company was meeting overall standards. Then, however, performance collapsed. Rural/Metro paid fines for nine straight months. In the first half of 2013, average monthly penalties, both waived and not, nearly quintupled from the same period a year earlier.\u201cThroughout our ownership of Rural/Metro, Warburg Pincus always supported a high standard of customer care and the best possible results for all of the company\u2019s stakeholders,\u201d the firm said in a statement, citing \u201cincreased spending to improve operations and processes, increased capital investment and strategic acquisitions.\u201dBut as Warburg\u2019s investment was crumbling, something interesting happened: Other investors saw an opportunity and snapped up Rural/Metro\u2019s bonds. This is a classic strategy in which Wall Street firms hunt for investments (in this case, distressed debt), expecting them to bounce back.But Rural/Metro didn\u2019t recover. It filed for bankruptcy.Suddenly those bondholders had a choice: revive the company, or lose their money. The biggest bondholder was Oaktree Capital Management, an investment manager that specializes in distressed bonds and private equity deals. Oaktree invested $88 million in loans and stock, helping wipe out Warburg\u2019s stake in the company. By January 2014, Oaktree was the single largest shareholder in Rural/Metro.But Oaktree, which owned nearly 40 percent of Rural/Metro, did not halt the slide. In Rochester, monthly penalties averaged $58,950 in the first half of 2015, during Oaktree\u2019s tenure, more than double the average during the first half of 2013, when Warburg owned the company.In July 2014, the Mesa, Ariz., fire chief formally complained about Rural/Metro\u2019s \u201cunprecedented reduction of ambulances, which in turn delayed patient care.\u201d The fire chief of the Superstition Fire and Medical District, in Apache Junction, Ariz., accused Rural/Metro of appearing \u201cmore focused on cutting corners and canceling contracts than quality of care.\u201dIn Aurora, Colo., Rural/Metro awarded medals of valor to some employees for responding to the 2012 movie theater shooting. But the city issued increasing penalties to the company, on an average basis, for late responses and other problems after the bankruptcy. Last year, during Oaktree\u2019s tenure, Aurora chose to award its contract to a different ambulance company.In a statement, Oaktree said Rural/Metro\u2019s board was unaware of \u201cany contracts that the company lost due to deficient response times or supplies.\u201d\u201cThe board\u2019s foremost focus was patient safety,\u201d Oaktree said, adding that it \u201cnever contemplated any expense cuts that would have affected response time or patient care.\u201dNot everyone was displeased with Rural/Metro. In Wheat Ridge, Colo., the company has been considered compliant since 2011. When Rural/Metro suffered delays, \u201cThere were always reasonable explanations,\u201d said Daniel Brennan, chief of police.Similarly, San Diego considered Rural/Metro compliant under Warburg\u2019s and Oaktree\u2019s ownership. However, the city\u2019s records show that it excused several hundred late responses over the last five years for circumstances like bursts of emergency calls.Officials in Knox County, Tenn., said they started worrying in April 2015 when Rural/Metro alerted them twice that it had no ambulances available for emergencies, forcing them to rely on other providers. That is known as a \u201clevel zero,\u201d and it had happened only once before in recent years. In 2015, the county penalized Rural/Metro $110,000 for level-zeros.Rural/Metro also must tell the county if three or fewer ambulances are available. During the second half of 2015, it notified the county of such shortages an average of 106 times per month \u2014 quadruple the average of the same period in 2013.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been told is that their challenge is around staffing,\u201d said Dr. Martha Buchanan, director of the county\u2019s health department. She cited the bankruptcy and a new law requiring more worker certifications, making hiring tougher.Rural/Metro also reported increased lateness, defined as taking 10 minutes or longer to reach an emergency. In the second half of 2015, Rural/Metro was late, on average, about 9.4 percent of the time, up from 6.8 percent two years earlier. Though the company still met overall standards, the county said Rural/Metro \u201chad increased difficulty in doing so.\u201dSince Envision took over Rural/Metro in late 2015, replacing private equity, the company has shown signs of improvement, Knox County officials said. It has purchased new ambulances and raised salaries.In neighboring Loudon County, officials noticed response time problems after the bankruptcy, when Oaktree was the largest shareholder. The final straw came after an early-morning 911 call in August 2014. Donna Maher, 81, couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cThey\u2019re coming as quick as they can,\u201d the 911 operator promised.But Rural/Metro\u2019s ambulance had not yet left the station. Surveillance video showed an emergency worker standing beside her ambulance, smoking a cigarette.Ms. Maher eventually reached the hospital, but died 10 days later. Later that year, Loudon County negotiated an early exit from its Rural/Metro contract. And the ambulance worker, Cortney Bryson, was fired.Ms. Bryson sued Rural/Metro for wrongful termination, saying the company was \u201ccovering up improper scheduling, staffing and response criteria\u201d in a way that \u201ccould have been shown to be a direct factor in the death of a citizen.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Bryson said she had worked two 24-hour shifts back-to-back before the call about Ms. Maher came in. Ms. Bryson was technically off the clock, she said, but a replacement hadn\u2019t yet arrived.Ms. Bryson said that she offered to go with another colleague, but that they needed permission because the colleague lacked full credentials. While waiting, she smoked.Jennifer Estes, the 911 center director, says it is difficult to link a delayed ambulance to a death. But this case, she said, \u201cleaves some room for someone to wonder, \u2018Could the extra time have made a difference?\u2019\u201dAfter private equity took over Rural/Metro, new posters appeared on the walls of ambulance and fire stations, featuring a caricature of a uniformed employee delivering a mandate: Get a signature.In other words, get patients to sign documents that can be used to bill them.\u201cAlmost always, if the patient is alert, they will be able to sign,\u201d he says.And if the patient can\u2019t sign? Then go to a family member, or a nurse. \u201cThey\u2019ll sign \u2014 because I don\u2019t give up.\u201dThe posters \u2014 just one element of Rural/Metro\u2019s aggressive billing practices while owned by private equity \u2014 promoted \u201cDo the Write Thing,\u201d a policy instructing employees to document every detail of a patient\u2019s treatment. It paired with another initiative, the \u201cCare to Cash\u201d checklist, also instituted during Warburg\u2019s tenure.Warburg Pincus said it was not aware of those specific initiatives.The policies, Rural/Metro said, would help patients by ensuring that bills were accurate. But employees complained that the process distracted them from caregiving and put them in the awkward position of seeking signatures from ill or medicated patients.Do the Write Thing \u201cdidn\u2019t sit well with the firefighters,\u201d said Nico Latini, who has worked at Rural/Metro for a decade. \u201cWe operate under a high level of integrity and we do the right thing every day \u2014 with an R, not a W.\u201dIn the four years that private equity led Rural/Metro, the company was fighting for financial survival. It raised its prices, but patients couldn\u2019t afford those bigger bills.Against that backdrop, the company intensified its collection efforts. And when people didn\u2019t pay, Rural/Metro took them to court.After Warburg left the company, Rural/Metro eliminated Care to Cash and Do the Write Thing. But even under its new non-private equity owner, it still sues to collect some unpaid bills from fire and ambulance customers. Rural/Metro\u2019s new owner said it \u201cwill continue to utilize the legal system to pursue payment when appropriate,\u201d but added that it first asks \u201ccustomers who need assistance to work with us to develop a payment plan that meets their needs.\u201dRural/Metro\u2019s fire departments sell homeowners an annual subscription for fire protection, often ranging from $100 to $500, depending on the property. If a nonsubscriber suffers a fire, Rural/Metro will still answer the call, unlike some other private departments. But then it sends a bill well above the subscription price.Even before private equity took over, the company sued to collect fire bills. Under private equity, this practice flourished.The Times examined court filings in the areas where Rural/Metro operates fire departments and identified dozens of lawsuits filed since 2011, when private equity took over. In these lawsuits, which are unheard-of at tax-funded public fire departments, the company pursued unpaid bills ranging from a few hundred dollars to $59,000.In Knoxville, Tenn., Lester Day faced one of those lawsuits. When his chimney caught fire in March 2013, he dialed 911.When firefighters arrived almost an hour later, 911 records indicate, the house had been reduced to ashes. That didn\u2019t stop Rural/Metro from charging Mr. Day for their response and then placing a $15,000 lien on his home, which he had since rebuilt.\u201cNow I\u2019m having to sell everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Day said in an interview. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201dRural/Metro also filed hundreds of lawsuits against ambulance patients in the same time period, including claims against families of people who died.Public providers are generally less aggressive than private ones, and some opt not to sue at all. The New York Fire Department said it sends letters to ambulance patients but stops short of suing.And yet, patients may not always have the chance to ride in a government ambulance.

And the pound\u2019s fall is a good thing for exports, he said. \u201cI was very pleased with the result.\u201dNationwide, young voters provided much of the support for the Remain campaign, but that was not the case in Sunderland.John Todd, 18, an information technology apprentice, voted for the first time, and said he supported the U.K. Independence Party.\u201cWe\u2019re segregated from the south, and the north is a barren wasteland,\u201d he said, wearing a heavy black leather jacket with metal studs despite the summer heat. \u201cIt\u2019s us against them.\u201d\u201cThe E.U. is a mystery to us,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve never heard about it up here.\u201dThe outcome of the vote in the large section of industrial northeast England that includes Sunderland exposed deep regional divisions and a rift between classes \u2014 a working class that feels it has lost out from globalization, and a more mobile, educated class of people who have prospered from free trade and movement.In Sunderland, a city of 273,000 on the North Sea coast, there were few signs of \u201cbregret\u201d or \u201cregrexit\u201d \u2014 terms shared on social media to describe the pangs of remorse some felt as they watched billions of dollars get wiped off world markets.Pro-Leave voters said they had nothing to lose because they had little to gain from globalization in the first place.\u201cGive Brexit a chance,\u201d said Maria Taylor, 58, a florist on a street where rows of brick houses, a legacy of the Industrial Revolution, shove against one another. \u201cIt can\u2019t get worse than what\u2019s been going on already,\u201d she added.In Washington, a run-down neighborhood close to the Nissan plant, shops on Co-operative Street appeared as if out of a time warp: a hairdresser with bonnet hair dryers, a candy shop where a single ceiling bulb illuminates rows of dusty containers filled with stuck-together sweets.To people like Mr. Walker, the turmoil in the financial markets was a distant rumble, a problem for the rich \u201cdown south\u201d in London and for those with enough resources to take a bet on the vast flows of speculative money that shift around the globe.As deindustrialization and other factors have hollowed what was once a manufacturing stronghold, the region has struggled to catch up with its wealthier southern neighbors despite efforts by recent governments to bridge the divide.\u201cAll the industries, everything, has gone,\u201d said Michael Wake, 55, forklift operator, gesturing toward Roker Beach, once black from the soot of the shipyards. \u201cWe were powerful, strong. But Brussels and the government, they\u2019ve taken it all away.\u201dThe referendum, Mr. Wake said, was an opportunity to \u201cpoke the eye\u201d of Mr. Cameron and the London establishment.Fears over job security from an influx of cheap European laborers was another motivation. Heather Govan, 28, a decorator, said cheap labor helped big businesses by keeping costs down, but not self-employed people like her.Some residents, however, said they had benefited from European Union membership.\u201cI\u2019m shocked \u2014 it\u2019s bad for the industry,\u201d said John Thompson, 53, who has worked for more than 30 years in a components factory. \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty now, and people who were going to invest here are going to think twice.\u201dMany engineers in the shipbuilding industry took jobs at Nissan. They became part of an upwardly mobile class able to afford houses along the now soot-free beach.To them and their families, the European Union is appealing. They can swim at the Sunderland Aquatic Center, a \u00a320 million project with an Olympic-size pool that the European Union helped finance. They can send their children to the sleek, modern Sunderland University campus, which also received union financing.However splashy these projects may be, they remain largely inaccessible to Sunderland\u2019s working class. Many cannot afford the \u00a330 monthly fees at the Aquatic Center, and people in the nearby Washington neighborhood said they had never set foot inside.As for Sunderland University, the tuition, which the government recently raised, is too much for many young people.\u201cAll the money is going back to the rich,\u201d said Ms. Taylor, the florist. \u201cThe working class is completely hammered. They\u2019ve sold us down the river.\u201dJohn Hall, 54, a neighbor, looked determined. \u201cAll the people here are looking out for their grandchildren,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIn 20 years\u2019 time, it would be a better place for them.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re big, we\u2019re strong enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be hard, but we\u2019ll still eat.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driven by Campaign Populism, Democrats Unite on Expanding Social Security", "Date": "2016-06-18", "News": "Supported byThe calculations that drove those efforts have not changed. In their last report, in July 2015, the trustees of Social Security, including four administration officials, said the program\u2019s old-age and disability insurance trust funds could be depleted in 2034, and could then pay just 79 percent of promised benefits unless Congress took action.But the politics have shifted. Mr. Obama summarized the new Democratic consensus in a speech in Elkhart, Ind., on June 1.\u201cIt\u2019s time we finally made Social Security more generous, and increased its benefits so that today\u2019s retirees and future generations get the dignified retirement that they\u2019ve earned,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd we could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.\u201dMr. Sanders has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security and made that a major theme of his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The party\u2019s new consensus gave Mr. Sanders reason to crow.\u201cA few years ago we were told that the debate on Social Security was not whether we were going to cut it, but by how much,\u201d said Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the Sanders campaign. \u201cMany of us stood up and fought back.\u201dNow, he said, after Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks this month in Indiana, \u201cwe are all unified as Democrats, and the issue is not whether we\u2019re going to expand Social Security, but how much we\u2019re going to expand it.\u201dSixty million people receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. So even small changes can have big implications.At one point, just before the New Hampshire primary in February, Mr. Sanders challenged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record on Social Security and suggested that she might support increasing the age at which people become eligible for full retirement benefits. (That age, originally set at 65, increases gradually and is already scheduled to reach 67 for people born after 1959.)Responding immediately on Twitter, Mrs. Clinton denounced the comments as \u201cfalse innuendos\u201d and promised: \u201cI won\u2019t cut Social Security. As always, I\u2019ll defend it, & I\u2019ll expand it.\u201dSpecifically, Mrs. Clinton says, she would increase benefits for widows and those who take time out of the paid work force to care for a child or a sick family member. She would require the wealthiest Americans to \u201ccontribute more\u201d through higher taxes. And she says she would fight efforts to privatize Social Security, reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments or increase the age for collecting full retirement benefits.Mr. Obama highlighted other reasons for the Democrats\u2019 renewed focus on Social Security. \u201cA lot of Americans don\u2019t have retirement savings,\u201d he said, and \u201cfewer people have pensions they can really count on.\u201dMore than 110 House Democrats \u2014 out of 188 total \u2014 have endorsed a resolution supporting policies to \u201cprotect and expand Social Security.\u201dDemocrats have offered a number of proposals to alter the formula for calculating Social Security benefits or financing the program, but have not endorsed a specific legislative package. One proposal would increase benefits for everyone, with extra help for those considered most vulnerable. Another would increase the cost-of-living adjustment to reflect the fact that older Americans tend to use more health care services. Another proposal would impose payroll taxes on workers\u2019 earnings above $250,000 a year.In the Senate, Democrats are digging in against a Republican nominated by Mr. Obama to serve a second term as a public trustee of Social Security, a watchdog over the finances of the program. Democrats say the nominee, Charles P. Blahous III, who served as a trustee from 2010 to 2015, has undermined public confidence in the program by exaggerating its financial problems. He was an architect of President George W. Bush\u2019s failed plan to let people put some of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, described Mr. Blahous as \u201can anti-government zealot.\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, \u201cMr. Blahous has shown over the course of his academic career that he is personally ideologically opposed to the fundamental promise of Social Security.\u201d\u201cThis firestorm is about politics, pure and simple,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.By a vote of 14 to 12 on June 8, the Finance Committee recommended the confirmation of Mr. Blahous, over the objections of all Democrats on the panel.Mr. Trump may have opened a fissure in his party, just as Democrats unite. He assured Iowa voters in December that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to cut your Social Security,\u201d and at a Republican debate in March, he said, \u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Democrats\u2019 Gun-Control Sit-In Turns Into Chaotic Showdown With Republicans", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Democratic protest demanding votes on gun-control legislation led to pandemonium in the House chamber that did not end until early Thursday, when Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his fellow Republicans reclaimed control long enough to force through a major spending bill. They then abruptly adjourned and left the Capitol.Furious Democrats remained on the House floor, where they huddled around their leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who praised their stand as a \u201cdiscussion heard around the world.\u201dMs. Pelosi expressed bewilderment at the Republican position. \u201cWhat could they be thinking?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhatever it is, they don\u2019t want to tell anybody about it. That\u2019s why they left in the dead of night.\u201dThe standoff, which began with a Democratic sit-in on the House floor just before noon on Wednesday, did not end until about 3 a.m. Thursday when Mr. Ryan \u2014 barreling over Democrats\u2019 objections \u2014 took the rare and provocative step of calling a vote on a major appropriations bill in the wee hours and without any debate. He then adjourned the House, with no legislative votes scheduled until July 5.The House approved the bill, which includes $1.1 billion in emergency financing to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus \u2014 and more than $80 billion in other government spending \u2014 by a vote of 239 to 171 shortly after 3 a.m.Republicans dashed from the chamber into the sticky heat gripping Washington and were met by protesters who jeered, with some shouting, \u201cDo your job!\u201dEarlier, as Democrats fought for control of the floor, they pressed against the speaker\u2019s dais, waving signs with the names of gun victims and chanting \u201cNo bill! No break!\u201d as Mr. Ryan repeatedly banged his gavel in an attempt to restore order.When Mr. Ryan left the speaker\u2019s chair, Democrats shouted: \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201dThere were scenes of chaos across the floor as Republicans tried to resume regular business. At one point, Democrats began singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d \u2014 altering the lyrics to say \u201cWe shall pass a bill some day\u201d \u2014 as Republicans shouted in outrage.And when Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, tried to confront the chanting Democrats, he was restrained by aides and colleagues.The unusual events were set off with the sit-in before noon when Democrats insisted on taking votes on gun measures before Congress began its weeklong recess for the Fourth of July.\u201cWe will not leave the floor of this House until this Congress takes action!\u201d Representative Kathy D. Castor, Democrat of Florida, declared.Democrats \u2014 who do not have enough strength in either the House or Senate to pass legislation on their own \u2014 have resorted to spectacle to highlight their anger over Congress not taking action to tighten the nation\u2019s gun-control laws.The House Democrats\u2019 anger, and their willingness to disrupt the proceedings, seemed to take some Republicans by surprise as they stood on the sidelines.Ms. Pelosi arrived on the floor with an air of calm, surveying her rank and file\u2019s protest as it gathered steam. Mr. Ryan, in an interview on CNN, dismissed the sit-in as a publicity stunt.They have repeatedly accused Republicans of siding with the National Rifle Association rather than with the victims of gun violence.The turmoil on Wednesday and Thursday in the House illustrated the differences in partisan relations in the House and Senate.Typical of the more restrained and decorous Senate, Mr. Murphy\u2019s speeches last week were derided by Republicans as a pointless \u201ctalkathon,\u201d but there were no confrontations and no shouting. Under Senate rules, any one senator who is recognized to speak can hold the floor until relinquishing it.The House gives the minority no such rights, and the Democrats resorted to an insurrection. Shortly after the sit-in began on Wednesday, Republicans quickly declared a recess, cutting off regular business \u2014 as well as the live television feed of floor proceedings, which operates only when the House is in session.The Democrats were left in control of the chamber, where they gave a series of impassioned speeches and skirted the television blackout by using Twitter\u2019s live-feed Periscope service to broadcast their efforts. That was a violation of House rules, which bans cameras or other electronic devices on the floor.Even by the hyperpartisan standards of modern Washington, it was a brazen disruption that underscored the outrage many lawmakers have expressed about the failure of Congress to act on gun legislation in the aftermath of numerous mass shootings.On Wednesday, Democrats short-circuited an active legislative session, for which Republicans had scheduled votes on a number of measures, including amendments to the annual financial services and general government appropriations bill. By late afternoon, Republicans said they still intended to conduct business, but the Democrats showed no sign of relenting.Representative Maxine Waters of California seemed to sum up their collective resolve when she said, \u201cI\u2019m prepared to stand here until hell freezes over.\u201dMs. Pelosi said her caucus was seeking votes on measures similar to two Democratic proposals that failed to advance in the Senate. One of those sought to ban gun sales to people on the government\u2019s terrorism watch list, while the second would expand and toughen background checks for gun buyers.Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a hero to many Democrats because of his role in the civil rights movement, initiated the protest on Wednesday.\u201cWe have to occupy the floor of the House until there\u2019s action,\u201d he said.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has drafted a narrower compromise measure. But despite some bipartisan backing, that proposal also seems in danger of failing for lack of sufficient Republican support.Even if all Senate Democrats and the independents who caucus with them voted in favor, which is hardly assured, at least 14 Republicans would need to agree to reach the 60-vote threshold for advancing the measure. Ms. Collins still seemed far short of that number on Wednesday.Democrats also pushed the gun issue at a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee, putting forward an amendment to the annual Homeland Security spending bill that would bar individuals suspected of terrorist activities from purchasing firearms, similar to a Democratic measure that failed in the Senate on Monday.\u201cI just want to make it very clear that I\u2019d rather my child be inconvenienced than dead,\u201d said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.The amendment failed, with every Republican and two Democrats voting against it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bypassing Private Equity to Get a Slice of the Big Deal", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byFor decades, the buyers in some of the largest deals had come in three forms: private equity firms, corporations and public market investors.But over the last few years, a new group of buyers has sprung up: sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and even private families have flexed their deal-making muscles. As interest rates hover near zero (and in many parts of the world, below zero), these investors, with trillions of dollars in their war chests, have taken it on themselves to buy pieces of companies, or in some cases, the whole thing.Over the last year and a half, these so-called emerging buyers bought about 17 percent of the assets sold by private equity firms, up from 2 percent in 2007, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs. They were even more active as buyers than private equity firms themselves.By taking a direct stake in companies, these buyers are looking for investment gains without paying management fees to private equity firms, which they would have to pay if they invested in a traditional fund. The risks are higher, however, especially because some of the newcomers do not have the same internal people who find deals and vet them that a private equity firm or a bank would have.Some banks are stepping in to fill that void. Last month, Goldman Sachs announced plans to expand its financial sponsors group, which works with private equity firms, to focus more on these emerging buyers. The group, run by a Goldman partner, Alison J. Mass, plans to spend the next several months identifying these buyers and how best to cover them, she said. It was recently renamed the Financial and Strategic Investors Group.\u201cIt was a wake-up call for us that we have to be forward-thinking and innovative,\u201d Ms. Mass said in an interview from the company\u2019s offices in New York. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit and look in the rearview mirror and just cover private equity firms anymore.\u201dMs. Mass\u2019s career has tracked the transformation of private equity. She started on Wall Street 35 years ago, as private equity was becoming a modern industry. She worked at the now-defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert under Leon Black, who went on to start one of the largest private equity firms, Apollo Global Management. When Drexel went into bankruptcy in 1990, Ms. Mass left for Merrill Lynch. She joined Goldman Sachs in 2001.Her group at Goldman Sachs includes a number of prominent women, a scarcity in the worlds of both investment banking and private equity. As of this month, three female partners, including Ms. Mass, will be working with financial sponsor clients at Goldman Sachs \u2013 out of 13 total in investment banking. Stephanie Cohen, who is the global head of financial sponsor mergers and acquisitions, and Sarah-Marie Martin, who is joining from Credit Suisse, are the other two.By expanding her group, Ms. Mass may be helping some of her longtime clients as well. John Connaughton, a co-managing partner of Bain Capital, a client of Goldman Sachs\u2019s financial sponsors group, said, \u201cWe find ourselves more and more partnering with these institutions. The more they\u2019re advised, the more they\u2019re rational and the more they understand how deals get done.\u201dSome of the emerging buyers are taking steps to make their internal deal-making abilities more professional. Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign fund created its own group three years ago to focus on direct investments, and it now has 15 people.Many of the emerging buyers\u2019 deals are made in conjunction with private equity firms, in a practice known as co-investing. The private equity firms offer some investors \u2014 whom they call limited partners \u2014 the chance to buy stakes in deals directly alongside them. Co-investing gives private equity firms access to a larger pool of capital to make bigger acquisitions, while it allows investors to pay few or no fees. Of 140 limited partners surveyed last year by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 73 percent said they had co-invested in at least one deal.Private equity firms have come under fire for the way they choose clients to invest alongside them, tending to give more opportunities to their larger investors, critics say. And co-investors often reap the gains in these deals, while other investors in the private equity fund bear the expense of due diligence and legal fees if a deal breaks.Not all sovereign wealth funds and other emerging buyers will be successful. Many are not equipped to execute deals and help turn around struggling businesses. \u201cYou have to be careful that you don\u2019t lower your standards,\u201d said Steve Feilmeier, the chief financial officer at Koch. \u201cFor the right opportunities, alternative buyers are going to really do their due diligence to make sure they\u2019re buying a security they\u2019re comfortable with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Asked about the Nepali site, an Indian archaeologist sniffed. \u201cThe question doesn\u2019t arise,\u201d he said.Buddhist history is an ever-more-serious business. China and India, two giants maneuvering for control in South Asia, have identified Buddhism as an instrument of soft power. In an area where, for centuries, Buddhism all but disappeared, a range of global stakeholders are investing in infrastructure to accommodate throngs of future pilgrims. India\u2019s prize attraction is Bodh Gaya, the site where, it is believed, the Buddha attained enlightenment.Nepal, increasingly aligned with Beijing, jealously guards its claim to the Buddha\u2019s birth and early life.\u201cIt is a matter of surprise that even today, in this 21st century, 2,500 years later than the time of Buddha\u2019s birth, that it\u2019s still a little bit confused,\u201d said the Nepali prime minister, K. P. Sharma Oli, at a government-sponsored Buddhist conference in Kathmandu last month.Of the conference\u2019s 385 delegates, more than 300 were Chinese; India\u2019s delegation numbered nine. When Mr. Oli complained about outsiders trying to encroach on Nepal\u2019s status as the Buddha\u2019s home, it was quite clear whom he meant.\u201cThere are people, a few people, perhaps, who are deliberately trying to create a situation of confusion,\u201d he said.Buddhist lore has it that Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, grew up within the luxurious setting of his father\u2019s palace in the city of Kapilavastu, carefully guarded from any exposure to human suffering. When, at 29, Siddhartha stepped outside, he was confronted with the sight of the aged, the diseased and the dead, an experience that shook him so powerfully that he left his father\u2019s home the following day, embracing life as an ascetic.Until the time of the British Raj, there was little serious effort to determine where these events occurred. A powerful Hindu revival had rolled over the plains, extinguishing virtually all trace of the religion that had begun there. Then came the European Indologists, armed with the only shreds of evidence available: the accounts of Chinese monks who traveled the Buddha\u2019s path in the fifth and seventh centuries A.D.By the time the British withdrew, digs at two different locations had both declared victory. The modern border between Nepal and India had also come into existence, and the two claims, supported by fragmentary evidence and fired by nationalism, hardened into a cranky rivalry.His discoveries, he wrote, a bit huffily, so infuriated a \u201cparticular set of scholars\u201d that they \u201cderived pleasure in indulging in the most unparliamentary language\u201d questioning the identity of Kapilavastu.The leader of that Indian expedition, Debala Mitra, uncovered traces of a sprawling brick city, but she said it could not have been Kapilavastu because it had been built hundreds of years after the Buddha\u2019s life. Last year, the Unesco-backed team cut down through the brick structures Ms. Mitra had found and discovered a second fortification whose ramparts were made of clay.Then they dug even farther, slowing their work to a crawl. They were watching for cylindrical depressions in the earth: evidence that under the clay fort had once stood timber fence posts, perhaps for so long that the wood had decayed, leaving a shell of earth behind.Six feet below the earth\u2019s surface, they found them. The traces of hardened earth inside those holes, when analyzed in a laboratory, dated from the sixth century B.C., meaning they would have stood during the Buddha\u2019s lifetime.In late April, a scorching heat settled on the plains, and workmen used wheelbarrows to refill trenches, shutting down the expedition for the hot season. Placards were erected, announcing that \u201cit would have been on this roadway that Siddhartha traveled on toward the Eastern Gate before renouncing his princely life.\u201d A wooden walkway was also built so that pilgrims who prostrated themselves would not become covered in mud.It was a bit hard to imagine a crowd there; the forest was empty except for a young boy, who was amusing himself by throwing stones. But Ram Bahadur Kunwar, from the Nepalese Department of Archaeology, paced the site of a central walled complex and spoke of great hopes.\u201cIt is still a mystery, because we have not opened it up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we do, I think that this structure will tell the history of Kapilavastu.\u201dOthers share his excitement. The Asian Development Bank is helping to finance a $54 million upgrade of the international airport close to the Nepalese town of Lumbini, the Buddha\u2019s birthplace. The upgraded airport, when it is completed in 2030, will accommodate 760,000 passengers a year. Lumbini is about 16 miles from Tilaurakot.It seems that many of those visitors are expected to come from China, which is experiencing a Buddhist revival: Tour guides are picking up Mandarin, new hotels are hiring Chinese chefs, and the local authorities are planning to erect a statue of the ninth-century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim whose travel journal established Nepal as the Buddha\u2019s birthplace. On a recent afternoon, a gaggle of women from Chengdu were clambering back onto a plane after meditating for five minutes under the branches of a tree near the Buddha\u2019s birthplace.Sunanda Sakyaputra, a Buddhist monk who had traveled to Tilaurakot to meditate, said the site of the ruined palace, a place where the Buddha \u201cwas not happy,\u201d gave him a profound sense of the futility of human suffering. Asked about the town on the Indian side, he snorted.\u201cThat is wrong, very wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cAll things. India thinks all things are hers. Why?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of passengers that the airport near Lumbini, Nepal, will be able to accommodate, after upgrades, in 2030. It is 760,000 passengers a year, not six million.Kai Schultz contributed reporting from Kathmandu, Nepal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "RJR Nabisco Ruling Bolsters Justice Dept.\u2019s Pursuit of FIFA", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchFor the Justice Department, the ruling means that its pursuit of corruption inside FIFA, the organization that oversees international soccer, can move forward without any concern that the charges might not be a permissible use of federal law.RICO is a powerful weapon for bringing together in a single prosecution disparate acts that play out over an extended period. It allows prosecutors to largely avoid issues related to the statute of limitations, and it permits charging a number of defendants who may have only tenuous connections to one another but are part of a larger scheme.The vehicle for bringing together these disparate strands of corruption is the first count in the indictment that charges the defendants with a single conspiracy to violate RICO. To prove its case, prosecutors must show that the agreement was to commit crimes that were part of a broader \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d involving a long list of federal crimes rather than just separate acts committed by different defendants.One potential challenge to the charges was whether RICO could be applied to conduct largely occurring outside the United States involving an organization in another country. The \u201cracketeering enterprise\u201d identified in the indictment is FIFA, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, and the local confederations that for the most part have no presence in this country.The Supreme Court took up the issue of whether RICO applies to extraterritorial violations in RJR Nabisco v. European Community, which involved a claim that the company illegally invested income derived from organized crime groups operating in Europe. The company argued that under the decision in the Morrison case, RICO reached only enterprises that operated in the United States, a position that would have crippled the broad FIFA corruption prosecution if the court had adopted it.The justices did not go that far in analyzing the scope of RICO. Instead, they found in a decision last week that RICO could be applied to conduct outside the United States as long as the particular crimes constituting the \u201cracketeering activity\u201d involved foreign conduct that could be charged on its own.The statute includes a number of crimes that apply extraterritorially, including money laundering. In addition, the wire fraud statute applies to foreign transmissions as long as there is an effect on commerce in the United States, another way that conduct taking place largely outside the United States can be included in a RICO prosecution.That does not mean private lawsuits involving foreign conduct necessarily survive, however. The Supreme Court went on to find that the presumption against extraterritorial application of a law \u201crequires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.\u201d Thus, a foreign plaintiff who does not have any operations in the United States could not take advantage of the law.It is uncommon for the Supreme Court to divide a statute, finding that one part can be applied to foreign conduct while another part cannot. But civil claims under RICO have the additional requirement of proving harm to \u201cbusiness or property\u201d from the pattern of racketeering activity, so it is this element that requires showing a domestic impact from the foreign violations.In other words, the FIFA case and other prosecutions involving terrorist financing might have been at risk if the court took a restrictive view of RICO\u2019s application to foreign conduct.In the FIFA indictment, which was returned shortly before the government submitted its brief in the RJR case, the Justice Department was careful to charge money laundering conspiracies that fit within the extraterritorial reach of that statute so that there was a clear basis for the RICO conspiracy charge. And the wire fraud conspiracies all involve communications into the United States, allowing for a broad description of foreign activity that includes the requisite domestic impact.The RICO count ties everything together so that defendants accused of receiving corrupt payments involving different soccer tournaments can be brought together. That charge should easily meet the test the Supreme Court adopted for a foreign enterprise like FIFA to be the basis for prosecuting individuals for engaging in racketeering activities through its offices.Prosecutors have little interest in civil RICO actions, so they were willing to throw that aspect of the law under the bus to preserve the ability to bring criminal cases in which the enterprise is largely \u2013 if not completely \u2013 conducted overseas. As long as the violations have an impact in the United States, then RICO remains a powerful tool for the Justice Department to pursue cases like that involving the bribery carried out through FIFA and its regional confederations.The green light is on for federal prosecutors to continue to pursue global corruption through RICO, serving as the world\u2019s policeman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen : Apr\u00e8s le Brexit, le printemps des peuples est in\u00e9vitable !", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 S\u2019il est bien une chose qui chatouille l\u2019orgueil d\u2019un Fran\u00e7ais, c\u2019est qu\u2019un Anglais vienne lui voler la vedette. Mais devant la valeur du courage, m\u00eame le Fran\u00e7ais le plus fier ne peut que s\u2019incliner : il ne lui reste qu\u2019\u00e0 tirer son chapeau. Et c\u2019est bel et bien un acte de courage que la d\u00e9cision que vient de prendre le peuple britannique, le courage de ceux qui assument leur libert\u00e9.Le Brexit l\u2019a emport\u00e9, d\u00e9jouant tous les pronostics. Le Royaume-Uni a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de larguer les amarres de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne et de reprendre son ind\u00e9pendance parmi les nations du monde. On disait que l\u2019\u00e9lection se jouerait sur le seul terrain \u00e9conomique, et pourtant les Britanniques ont compris le v\u00e9ritable enjeu du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum avec plus de perspicacit\u00e9 qu\u2019on veut bien l\u2019admettre.Ils ont compris que derri\u00e8re le cours de la livre sterling et derri\u00e8re les d\u00e9bats d\u2019experts financiers, une seule vraie question \u00e9tait pos\u00e9e, \u00e0 la fois simple et fondamentale : voulons-nous laisser un pouvoir non d\u00e9mocratique r\u00e9genter nos vies ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons-nous reprendre notre destin en main ? Le Brexit est avant tout une question politique. C\u2019est le choix libre d\u2019un peuple d\u00e9cidant de se gouverner par lui-m\u00eame. M\u00eame mise en valeur par toute la propagande du monde, une cage n\u2019en reste pas moins une cage, et elle est insupportable \u00e0 l\u2019homme \u00e9pris de libert\u00e9.L\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne est devenue la prison des peuples. Chacune des 28 nations qui la composent s\u2019est vue progressivement priv\u00e9e de ses pr\u00e9rogatives d\u00e9mocratiques par des commissions et des conseils sans aucune repr\u00e9sentation populaire. Chaque pays doit appliquer des lois qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas voulues ; il ne d\u00e9cide plus de son propre budget ; il est somm\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir ses fronti\u00e8res contre sa volont\u00e9. La situation des pays de la zone euro est encore moins enviable. Par id\u00e9ologie, on force des \u00e9conomies diff\u00e9rentes \u00e0 adopter une m\u00eame monnaie, quitte \u00e0 les saigner \u00e0 blanc : version revisit\u00e9e du lit de Procuste. Les peuples n\u2019ont plus voix au chapitre.Et le Parlement europ\u00e9en, me dira-t-on ? Il n\u2019est d\u00e9mocratique qu\u2019en apparence, car il est fond\u00e9 sur un mensonge : faire croire qu\u2019il existe un peuple europ\u00e9en homog\u00e8ne, et qu\u2019un d\u00e9put\u00e9 polonais aurait la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de voter une loi pour le peuple espagnol. On a voulu nier l\u2019existence des nations. Il est naturel qu\u2019elles ne veuillent pas se laisser faire.Le Brexit ne fut pas le premier cri de r\u00e9volte des peuples europ\u00e9ens. En 2005, la France et les Pays-Bas ont organis\u00e9 un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur le projet de Constitution europ\u00e9enne : l\u2019opposition fut massive dans les deux cas, et les autres gouvernements d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de cesser net l\u2019exp\u00e9rience pour \u00e9viter la contagion. Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, la constitution europ\u00e9enne \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e aux peuples sous le nom de trait\u00e9 de Lisbonne. En 2008, l\u2019Irlande refusait elle aussi par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d\u2019appliquer ce trait\u00e9. On balaya une nouvelle fois d\u2019un revers de main cette d\u00e9cision populaire.Quand la Gr\u00e8ce d\u00e9cida par r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum en 2015 de refuser le plan d\u2019aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 de Bruxelles, la r\u00e9action antid\u00e9mocratique de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne n\u2019\u00e9tonna plus personne : nier la volont\u00e9 des peuples \u00e9tait devenu pour elle une habitude. Le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission europ\u00e9enne, Monsieur Jean-Claude Juncker, eut \u00e0 cette occasion un \u00e9clair de franchise lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9clara sans honte : \u201cIl ne peut y avoir de choix d\u00e9mocratique contre les trait\u00e9s europ\u00e9ens\u201d.Si le Brexit ne fut pas le premier cri d\u2019espoir, il se pourrait n\u00e9anmoins qu\u2019il soit la premi\u00e8re vraie victoire des peuples. Les Britanniques ont mis l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne devant un dilemme dont elle va avoir du mal \u00e0 sortir. Soit elle d\u00e9cide de laisser tranquillement le Royaume-Uni prendre le large, et alors elle court le risque de cr\u00e9er un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent : la r\u00e9ussite politique et \u00e9conomique d\u2019un pays sorti de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne serait une preuve manifeste de son caract\u00e8re n\u00e9faste. Soit, mauvaise perdante, elle d\u00e9cide de faire payer le peuple britannique par tous les moyens, et alors elle montre au grand jour la nature tyrannique de son pouvoir. Le bon sens incline \u00e0 choisir la premi\u00e8re option. Je pressens que l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne choisira la seconde.Une chose est certaine : le d\u00e9part de la Grande Bretagne ne rendra pas l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne plus d\u00e9mocratique. La structure hi\u00e9rarchique des institutions supranationales va souhaiter se renforcer car comme toutes les id\u00e9ologies mourantes, l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne ne conna\u00eet que la fuite en avant. Les r\u00f4les sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 connus : c\u2019est l\u2019Allemagne qui m\u00e8nera la danse, et la France sera bonne suivante.Signe des temps qui courent : Messieurs Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi et Mariano Rajoy vont aujourd\u2019hui directement prendre leurs ordres chez Madame Angela Merkel, sans passer par la case Bruxelles. La remarque de Henry Kissinger, \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d a maintenant une r\u00e9ponse claire : il faut appeler Berlin. Il ne reste alors plus qu\u2019une alternative aux peuples europ\u00e9ens : rester pieds et poings li\u00e9s dans une union qui trahit les int\u00e9r\u00eats nationaux et la souverainet\u00e9 populaire, ouvre grand nos pays \u00e0 l\u2019immigration massive et \u00e0 la finance arrogante, ou d\u00e9cider de retrouver leur libert\u00e9 par le vote.Des appels au r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum r\u00e9sonnent aux quatre coins du continent. J\u2019ai moi-m\u00eame propos\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident Hollande d\u2019organiser une telle consultation populaire en France, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas manqu\u00e9 de refuser. Le destin de l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne ressemble de plus en plus \u00e0 celui de l\u2019Union sovi\u00e9tique, qui est morte de ses propres contradictions.Le printemps des peuples est maintenant in\u00e9vitable ! La seule question qui reste \u00e0 poser est celle de savoir si l\u2019Europe est pr\u00eate \u00e0 se d\u00e9faire d\u2019elle-m\u00eame de ses illusions ou si le retour \u00e0 la raison se fera dans la douleur. Pour ma part, le choix est fait depuis longtemps : j\u2019ai choisi la France, j\u2019ai choisi les nations souveraines, j\u2019ai choisi la libert\u00e9.Marine Le Pen est pr\u00e9sidente du Front National.Advertisement"}

For a month and a half, three world premieres are mounted, each with 10 performances and, at most, a running time of 90 minutes. For new-play aficionados, Summerworks is a must-see stop, especially since tickets are a budget-friendly $18.For Ms. Striar, it\u2019s a juggling act.That makes for an especially busy summer for Clubbed Thumb, now 20 years old. But despite the frenzy, Ms. Striar, 47, is calm and upbeat; she likes the adrenaline. \u201cYou can\u2019t be super-duper contemplative,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou have to be in a very heightened state of responsiveness.\u201dClubbed Thumb holds a special significance for Mr. Lipton, since it produced his New York debut, \u201c100 Aspects of the Moon,\u201d in 2005. He has since won an Obie and has a new work scheduled to have its premiere at Joe\u2019s Pub in February, but he considers Clubbed Thumb, which commissioned \u201cTumacho,\u201d an artistic home.Six Tony nominees, including the director Leigh Silverman and the Tony-winning set designer David Zinn, have followed along, choosing to work in a tiny black box.\u201cMy sensibility is very particular and what\u2019s so great about Clubbed Thumb is you have this very specific curatorial vision,\u201d Mr. Lipton said during a \u201cTumacho\u201d rehearsal break. \u201cThey do things that are going to be weird and have a sense of humor.\u201dClubbed Thumb was founded by Ms. Striar and three friends: Meg MacCary, Arne Jokela and Jay Worthington. (Mr. Jokela is still on the board.) The name came from a random page in a Victorian book of palmistry. \u201cThere was a picture of a clubbed thumb in it, it looked like a toe, and that was funny to us,\u201d recalled Ms. Striar, curled up at the Wild Project\u2019s rooftop garden. \u201cWe honestly didn\u2019t bother to read what it meant.\u201dThe evocative phrase stuck, along with a mission statement to develop and produce \u201cfunny, strange and provocative new plays by living American writers.\u201dThe first Summerworks included creations by Wallace Shawn, Charles Mee and Carson Kreitzer. Now the festival is one part of a larger endeavor; there are also writers\u2019 groups, an early director\u2019s fellowship, lab and workshop presentations, and a playwright residency. (Many of those groups meet in Ms. Striar\u2019s East Village apartment.)While the company\u2019s financial situation is modest, this is a good year: Clubbed Thumb has a budget of $717,000 and three full-time staff members; 74 percent of the budget comes from grants and donations, and 70 percent goes toward productions and artistic programs. While Ms. Striar ruefully acknowledges that the artist pay is low \u2014 Summerworks participants, both cast and crew members, get $1,500 apiece \u2014 she\u2019s aiming to do better. \u201cWe raise our budget and pay every year,\u201d she said.What a Clubbed Thumb production lacks in budget, it often makes up for in ambition. \u201cTumacho\u201d has a cast of nine and a live musician. \u201cMen on Boats,\u201d about the 1869 Powell Expedition down the Colorado River into the Grand Canyon, has a cast of 10 \u2014 all women playing male historical figures.When it comes to selecting plays for Summerworks, it\u2019s variety that catches Ms. Striar\u2019s eye. \u201cI generally like plays that I\u2019m compelled by, and I don\u2019t know if they work,\u201d she said. \u201cOften I don\u2019t even get big chunks of the play. I like surprise, I like mystery, I like challenge, I like to be kept on my toes. To me, a fun time in the theater is one where I\u2019m leaning forward, trying to figure things out.\u201dConsidering Clubbed Thumb\u2019s track record, that strategy has been successful. Ms. Striar\u2019s next goal is to start producing more outside of Summerworks. And to continue supporting artists, both new and \u2014 like Mr. Lipton \u2014 returning.\u201cIt\u2019s a place that we can grow with,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s really exciting.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Off Off Broadway theater company Clubbed Thumb referred incorrectly to one of its founders, Arne Jokela. He is still on its board of directors; he has not \u201cleft the organization.\u201d The article also erroneously included a playwright among those who got their first professional or New York production courtesy of the company. Samuel D. Hunter was not one of them; Page 73 Productions first presented Mr. Hunter\u2019s work. And the article referred incorrectly to casting for the remounted production of Jaclyn Backhaus\u2019s play \u201cMen on Boats.\u201d While transgender performers were in the original production, they are not part of the new cast.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Gets to Be Angry?", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byI AM an opinionated woman so I am often accused of being angry. This accusation is made because a woman, a black woman who is angry, is making trouble. She is daring to be dissatisfied with the status quo. She is daring to be heard.When women are angry, we are wanting too much or complaining or wasting time or focusing on the wrong things or we are petty or shrill or strident or unbalanced or crazy or overly emotional. Race complicates anger. Black women are often characterized as angry simply for existing, as if anger is woven into our breath and our skin.Black men, like black women, are judged harshly for their anger. The angry black man is seen as a danger, a threat, uncontrollable.Feminists are regularly characterized as angry. At many events where I am speaking about feminism, young women ask how they can comport themselves so they aren\u2019t perceived as angry while they practice their feminism. They ask this question as if anger is an unreasonable emotion when considering the inequalities, challenges, violence and oppression women the world over face. I want to tell these young women to embrace their anger, sharpen themselves against it.If you really want to see my anger, you would have to join me in my car, when I am driving. I am afflicted by road rage. I have deeply held opinions on the driving habits of others. When I am alone in my car, and sometimes when I have passengers, I yell at other drivers. I gesticulate wildly. I mutter terrible things about the mothers of these others. I am not proud of this but it is cathartic to release my anger. There is no fallout beyond a rise in my blood pressure.And still, it\u2019s scary to recognize how much anger I have roiling beneath the surface of my skin and how few outlets I have for that anger, how I don\u2019t feel entitled to that anger. I keep most of my anger to myself, swallowing it as deep as I can, understanding that someday, I won\u2019t be able to swallow it anymore. I will erupt and then there will be fallout.Anger is a significant part of our cultural conversation. Sometimes, I see people log on to Twitter and ask, \u201cWhat are we outraged about today?\u201d In this, there is dismissiveness suggesting that the asker is bored with the injustices, small and great, that inspire anger within us.In these circumstances, anger becomes an emotion that needs to be controlled, an inconvenience and an irritant. It gets confused for rage, which also has its uses.There are consequences for both expressing and suppressing anger. In northeastern Brazil, women refer to suppressing their anger as \u201cswallowing frogs,\u201d which contributes to \u201cemotion-based ailments,\u201d according to L. A. Rebhun, an anthropologist who studied the connection between anger and illness in the region. The physical manifestations of anger, Professor Rebhun writes, \u201cmay also be seen as symptoms of the pain of bridging gaps between cultural expectation and personal experience in emotion, a process neither easy nor simple.\u201dBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s latest album chronicles heartbreak, betrayal and the anger that rises from those experiences. In the video for the song \u201cHold Up,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 strolls down a city street, a placid smile on her face, as she carries a baseball bat. And then, without warning, she slams that bat against car windows, a fire hydrant, a surveillance camera. With each blow, her face falls into a mask of concentrated rage and then she\u2019s on to the next target, with ever more bounce in her step.In her keynote speech to the National Women\u2019s Studies Association in 1981, Audre Lorde said, \u201cEvery woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions, personal and institutional, which brought that anger into being.\u201dIn the Democratic primary this year, people flocked to Bernie Sanders because they were angry about campaign finance and excessive debt and too few opportunities to flourish. The candidate reveled in his anger, often wagging his finger and raising his voice. Together he and his supporters were angry. Their anger was celebrated, framed as passion and engagement.Conversely, Hillary Clinton is not allowed to be angry though certainly some of her supporters are. Mrs. Clinton, once again, has shown how the rules are different for women. She cannot raise her voice without reprisal. When she appears as anything but demure, when she is passionate and sharp, she is attacked not for her ideas, but for her demeanor.Amid all this anger, history is being made. She is the first woman who will serve as a major party\u2019s nominee for the American presidency.The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, is the angriest from a large field of angry contenders.Many of his supporters seem angry about so many things \u2014 a black president, their lot in life, not getting their piece of the American dream or having to share that American dream with people of color, women, gay, lesbian and transgender people. This anger is discussed with no small amount of compassion or curiosity. It is allowed to flourish. At many of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies, this anger spills into violence.But anger is not an inherently bad thing. Most of the time, it is a normal and even healthy human emotion. Anger allows us to express dissatisfaction. It allows us to say something is wrong. The challenge is knowing the difference between useful anger, the kind that can stir revolutions, and the useless kind that can tear us down.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind the Cruel Attack on Turkey", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe world is once again stunned and grieving over a brutal terrorist attack. This time it was in Turkey, where three suicide bombers killed at least 41 people and wounded more than 200 others at the international airport in Istanbul. The timing on Tuesday was especially cruel for a Muslim majority country, coming during the 10 holiest days of the holy month of Ramadan.The assault, for which Turkish authorities blamed the Islamic State, is the latest evidence of how the chaos in the Middle East, in particular the Syrian war, has metastasized, spilling over borders and rattling countries that are crucial to regional stability. Few are more important than Turkey, a NATO ally and a strategic link with the West. The sharing of intelligence between Turkey and the West, already close, will need to be made even closer.That Turkey has become a target is not a surprise. For too long, the government in Ankara underestimated the ISIS threat, even as it focused on other groups in Syria trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.Turkish officials allowed great quantities of arms and thousands of extremist foreign fighters to pass through its border into Syria. Some of those fighters have found a home in Turkey and are likely to be a threat for some time to come. Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has allowed a more radical strain of Islam to flourish in Turkey.It wasn\u2019t until last year, under American pressure, that Turkey began carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State targets and allowing American aircraft targeting the terrorist group to fly sorties out of Turkey. Turkey also has been more rigorous in shutting down the Syrian border.This has clearly angered the Islamic State and made Turkey a more likely target. Further, American officials say that recent gains by the coalition fighting the Islamic State has inspired the terrorist group to move against soft targets like shopping areas and the airport.Over the last 18 months, the Islamic State has lost nearly half the territory it once controlled in Iraq and 20 percent of the territory it held in Syria, the officials say, while the group\u2019s access to financing and the number of foreign fighters entering Syria have been reduced. A major effort now underway to retake the town of Manbij in Syria could further restrict the Islamic State\u2019s access to the Syrian-Turkish border.The Islamic State, of course, is not solely Mr. Erdogan\u2019s problem. The growing threat to Turkey is only the latest reason for the United States and its partners to work more urgently to defeat the group in Iraq and Syria, while seeking to end the civil war in Syria, which has not only brought devastation to hundreds of thousands of civilians, but provided fertile ground for extremism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 N.Y.P.D. Commanders Are Arrested in Vast Corruption Case", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byThree New York Police Department commanders were arrested on Monday, along with a Brooklyn businessman, on federal corruption charges linked to one of several continuing investigations into Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising.The arrests were one of the most significant roundups of police supervisors in the recent history of the department \u2014 a deputy chief and a deputy inspector accused of accepting expensive gifts from two politically connected businessmen who prosecutors say were seeking illicit favors from the police.In court papers unsealed on Monday, federal agents describe how the two men, who are at the center of one of the City Hall fund-raising inquiries, showered gifts on senior police officials: jewelry for the police inspector\u2019s wife; a video game system for the chief\u2019s children; tickets to Brooklyn Nets games; hotel rooms in Rome and Chicago; even a private-jet flight to Las Vegas, with a prostitute on board.The police officers arrested on Monday were Deputy Chief Michael J. Harrington, 50; Deputy Inspector James M. Grant, 43; and Sgt. David Villanueva, 42, who was charged in a separate but related scheme involving gun licenses. The businessman arrested was Jeremiah Reichberg, 42, of Borough Park, Brooklyn.The other businessman, Jona S. Rechnitz, 33, has pleaded guilty and has provided information in the police case and in at least one of the fund-raising investigations focused on Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and his inner circle, according to several people familiar with the case.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said little about the connection between the various inquiries, beyond noting that \u201cthere is no allegation that has anything to do with the mayor anywhere\u201d in those court documents.Mr. Reichberg and Mr. Rechnitz do not appear to have had any official affiliation to the Police Department, although Mr. Reichberg, a member of the large Orthodox Jewish community in Borough Park, would often describe himself as a \u201ccommunity liaison\u201d to the department. He even had business cards identifying him as such, prosecutors said.But what the men lacked in official status, they made up for with regular gifts and frequent social calls that afforded them a remarkable level of influence inside the department, prosecutors said.At their urging, a top chief appointed Inspector Grant to command the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a plum assignment, according to the complaint.But they were motivated, prosecutors said, by more than the thrill of meddling in police politics. Rather, they wanted the department to serve as \u201ca private police force for themselves and their friends,\u201d Mr. Bharara said at a news conference. \u201cEffectively they got cops on call.\u201dIn recent years, the senior police officials were quick to play the roles of chauffeur, bodyguard and concierge to the two businessmen, according to a criminal complaint sworn out by Blaire Toleman, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a public corruption squad.On some occasions, the police officials drove the businessmen around town and to the airport, with lights flashing and sirens blaring. Other times, the police sent underlings to help one of the businessmen, who was involved in the diamond trade, against a business rival or to retrieve gemstones that were the subject of disputes over payment, according to the criminal complaint.Sergeant Villanueva was charged in a separate but related scheme that involved aiding applicants for firearms licenses, the court papers said. In that scheme, bribes \u2014 as much as $18,000 per gun license \u2014 factored into 100 to 150 gun licenses in recent years, according to the papers.Both Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg, the businessman arrested on Monday, have been generous supporters of the mayor.Since the scandal has reached the Police Department, nearly a dozen mostly senior officials have been disciplined and several have put in to retire.Indeed, the arrest of two senior police officials on bribery charges in a single case is a rarity, despite the long docket of colorful police scandals over the years.Informed by a century of scandals related to graft, the department\u2019s official policy is that officers are not to accept any gratuity, not even a cup of coffee. The only exception is that officers are allowed to accept pen and pencil sets, plaques or other common tokens of appreciation.\u201cThe case shows whether you\u2019re a cop or a chief, if you break the law you will be handled the same way,\u201d William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, said at the news conference, speaking after Mr. Bharara.At a brief arraignment on Monday, neither Chief Harrington nor Inspector Grant spoke in court.After the hearing, a lawyer for Inspector Grant, John C. Meringolo, called his client \u201can exceptional police officer for his entire career.\u201dSome of the conduct detailed in the court papers veers toward the bizarre. It describes the two businessmen\u2019s visit to Inspector Grant\u2019s Staten Island home on Christmas Day in 2013, wearing elf hats to deliver a video game system for his children and a piece of jewelry for his wife valued at $1,000. On the same day, the two men visited the deputy chief\u2019s home and delivered a video game system for his children.Far from being an unwelcome intrusion, it was the start of what Inspector Grant apparently hoped would blossom into a Christmas tradition. When the holiday came and went the next year without any gifts, Inspector Grant expressed his disappointment to Mr. Reichberg during a phone conversation in January 2015, captured on a wiretap.\u201cFirst of all, the two elves didn\u2019t come\u201d for Christmas, he said using an expletive for emphasis, according to the papers. During the same conversation, Inspector Grant complained that Mr. Reichberg had not invited him on a Super Bowl trip, choosing instead to extend the invitation to another police official.\u201cSee, you don\u2019t love me anymore, bro,\u201d Inspector Grant complained, according to the complaint.It might have seemed a bit ungrateful, given that Inspector Grant may have owed the men his promotion to lead the 19th Precinct, the criminal complaint suggests.The two businessmen, in fact, dined with Chief Banks once or twice a week, always picking up the bill, according to the complaint. And when Chief Banks ultimately appointed Inspector Grant to be commander of the 19th Precinct, in mid-2014, he put the two businessmen on the phone so they could share the news with the inspector \u201cthat he was being promoted,\u201d according to the complaint.A lawyer for Mr. Banks, Benjamin Brafman, said, \u201cWe have always maintained that former Chief Banks did not knowingly violate the law, and nothing in today\u2019s arrest of other members of the department changes that position.\u201dThe accusations made against Deputy Chief Michael J. Harrington, Deputy Inspector James M. Grant and Jeremiah Reichberg, who has described himself as a community liaison to the New York Police Department, included bribery, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy.With Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s cooperation and Mr. Reichberg\u2019s arrest, the friendship between the two men clearly seemed to have ended.Mr. Reichberg\u2019s lawyer, Susan R. Necheles, issued a statement in which she said her client had not committed a crime and was \u201ca good man\u201d who \u201chas helped many people.\u201d She added, \u201cHis only mistake was his friendship with Jona Rechnitz, a criminal who has admitted bribing a union official and who is desperately trying to get others in trouble in order to curry favor with prosecutors and save his own skin.\u201dMr. Rechnitz\u2019s lawyer, Alan Levine, responded with a statement of his own. \u201cJeremy Reichberg is responsible for his own conduct, just as Jona Rechnitz was for his,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now apparent that Jeremy Reichberg\u2019s problems are the product of his own actions and his own words from a court ordered wiretap on his phone.\u201dAl Baker, J. David Goodman and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Operative Tied to Cuomo Is Accused of Bribing Judge to Get Favorable Rulings", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byA political operative with ties to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is expected to be charged on Thursday in connection with a bribery scheme that involved a State Supreme Court justice in Buffalo, who has already pleaded guilty in the case.The operative, G. Steven Pigeon, is accused in a criminal complaint of bribing the justice, John A. Michalek, with help for a promotion; favors for two close relatives; Buffalo Sabres hockey tickets; and a seat at one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s fund-raisers. In return, the complaint says, Mr. Pigeon received favorable treatment in court cases in which he and his acquaintances had an interest.Mr. Michalek, who had served as a justice since 1995, pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court on Wednesday to a felony count of receiving a bribe. He also admitted to filing a public document with false information, also a felony.The case stemmed from a joint state and federal investigation led by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, into Mr. Pigeon\u2019s fund-raising activities.As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Michalek, who resigned from the bench, has agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Pigeon is expected to appear in court on Thursday on unspecified charges, according to Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman.According to the complaint, Mr. Michalek repeatedly asked for Mr. Pigeon\u2019s assistance in moving up to the Appellate Division of the court, where there was a vacancy for an associate judgeship.\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t mention it to you,\u201d the justice wrote in an email to Mr. Pigeon in December 2012, beginning what the complaint said was a quest for the appointment that lasted two and a half years. \u201cWonder if you could help.\u201dMr. Pigeon apparently went straight to the top.\u201cUnc Steve... How\u2019d you do with the Gov????\u201d Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon on Jan. 8, 2013.\u201cBunch happening... In Albany now... Gov went well... Talked u up,\u201d Mr. Pigeon replied. \u201cLet\u2019s have coffee soon.\u201dIf the meeting did occur, nothing seemed to come of it. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard a peep about the Appp Div,\u201d Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon the next month.John Kelly, a spokesman for the governor, said: \u201cAppointees for any state appellate court must first be reviewed and approved by the judicial screening committee. Mr. Michalek\u2019s name was never advanced by the committee to the governor for consideration for any appointment.\u201dMr. Pigeon\u2019s lawyer, Paul Cambria, declined to comment on Wednesday.If Mr. Michalek never managed to rise to the Appellate Division, his relatives prospered under Mr. Pigeon\u2019s guidance, according to the complaint. Mr. Pigeon found a contact to help one of those relatives get a job on a political campaign. Mr. Michalek and Mr. Pigeon also repeatedly discussed different options for a second relative, including appointments to a government task force or an education committee.Through Mr. Pigeon, the relative also got a $1,000 seat at a fund-raiser in November 2013 for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign.\u201cWe will continue to root out public corruption wherever we find it,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.The arrangement had benefits for Mr. Pigeon, too. The emails about job prospects were often interspersed with discussions about several lawsuits that companies he was consulting for had pending before the justice, who was handling commercial civil cases in Erie County Supreme Court.Mr. Pigeon was receiving money from a party to one of the lawsuits, while his colleagues or acquaintances had a financial stake in others.Mr. Michalek often emailed updates on the lawsuits to Mr. Pigeon, who replied with his own input; gave Mr. Pigeon advice about the direction of the cases; and handed down rulings that benefited Mr. Pigeon, his clients and his business associates, according to the complaint. In one instance, Mr. Pigeon argued that the justice should deny a motion for a protective order against a subpoena. He complied.In May 2012, when Mr. Michalek was looking for a lawyer to handle a receivership, he took Mr. Pigeon\u2019s recommendation of a local lawyer whom Mr. Pigeon referred to as \u201cmy guy.\u201dThe lawyer did not appear on the court\u2019s list of qualified receivers, but Mr. Michalek cleared that hurdle by signing a special form that said he had \u201crequired the expertise\u201d of Mr. Pigeon\u2019s pick.\u201cHave to give them a spec reason etc,\u201d Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon. \u201cWill figure it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementJune 28, 2016Phillip LongmanAvik RoySo why does Sanders oppose giving veterans those options?The common sense response of most Americans \u2014 and most veterans \u2014 was simple: Give veterans who can\u2019t get convenient care from the V.A. the option of obtaining that care from private doctors, hospitals and insurers.There are plenty of veterans who are happy with V.A. health care. And those who have been lucky enough to stay off the V.A.\u2019s waiting lists often do well. But why on earth would we deny other veterans the ability to seek care from qualified private providers, when those on Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare can? Even the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s own employees enjoy a vast array of private health care and coverage options that are denied to the veterans they ostensibly serve.We hear a plethora of excuses from opponents of reform. Antagonists say that veterans can only receive good care in a closed system, in which veterans are forbidden to seek care from other sources. The naysayers shriek about \u201cprivatization,\u201d as if health care delivered by private physicians is something to be feared. And they claim that if some veterans seek care from private sources, those that prefer the traditional V.A. will receive inferior care.Those who are ideologically committed to believing that government services are always better than private services may be unwilling to consider evidence to the contrary. And leaders of public-sector unions oppose allowing veterans to seek care from private hospitals instead of public ones, because they\u2019d receive less income from workers\u2019 dues. But for everyone else, the right answer is obvious.\nMost Americans these days have never served in the military. Fewer still have received care in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or even known someone who has. This gap between military and civilian life creates an opening for a powerful array of interests intent on eroding public support for our veterans health care system. Giving veterans access to America\u2019s world-class hospitals \u2014 nonprofit institutions like Massachusetts General Hospital and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \u2014 is not a corporate conspiracy. Nor is it a conspiracy to give veterans the option of choosing alternative health plans, like those offered by nonprofit Blue Cross entities. We thoroughly reviewed the historical and scientific evidence regarding V.A. health outcomes. So did the independent assessment of V.A performance requested by Congress in 2014. Our conclusions and theirs were the same: that many veterans receive quality care from the V.A., but that many do not \u2014 especially those who are forced to languish for months on V.A. waitlists. Reforming the V.A. in these ways affirms plain common sense. It\u2019s supported by the best research on health reform. Most important, it upholds a fundamental American principle: that those who\u2019ve sacrificed to preserve our freedoms should themselves have the freedom to choose how and where they get their health care.\nBy 2034, the cost of V.A. health care under this scenario could be as high as $450 billion, compared to a baseline of less than $100 billion. Most of this exploding cost would come from veterans currently covered by private health care plans who would quickly switch to the much more attractive, taxpayer-financed package available from the V.A. How would Congress pay for this exploding cost? Mainline veterans service organizations like the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans have enough experience in Washington to know that all the new spending would crowd out funding for V.A.\u2019s core mission, which is to serve veterans who have service-related disabilities or who are indigent. Veterans hospitals and clinics would have to close to cover the cost of providing a very generous health care plan to vets who don\u2019t currently use the V.A. and who in most instances don\u2019t need or want the specialized model of care it offers. Most veterans advocates, including myself, strongly support the V.A.\u2019s making greater use of high-performing health care networks of private providers in areas where the V.A. needs to improve capacity and access. But these networks need to be tightly integrated and coordinated into the V.A.\u2019s existing model of care, both to control cost and, even more important, deliver the quality of care veterans deserve. \nWould privatization of V.A. health care improve the system or undermine it?\n"}

She also warned the gathering that if Republicans compromised on their principles to win an important election, they would be entering fraught territory.\u201cWhat happens next time?\u201d she asked, implying that it could lead to more compromises and more candidates like Mr. Trump.Ms. Whitman, who ran for governor of California in 2010 and was a finance co-chairwoman for Mr. Romney in 2012, was part of a group of major donors who tried to stop Mr. Trump during the primaries through paid advertising. She has been explicit about her disdain for him.\u201cLook at the comments he\u2019s made about women, about Muslims, about reporters,\u201d she told CNBC in March. \u201cIt\u2019s just repugnant.\u201dThe group at the retreat represented a mix of the Republican Party, divided between those who have said they cannot support Mr. Trump, like Mr. Romney, and those who have tepidly endorsed him, like Mr. Ryan, who was Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012.In an emailed statement, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Whitman\u2019s comments. \u201cI never met Meg Whitman, but the job she is doing at Hewlett Packard is not a very good one,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBased on the disastrous campaign she ran in California, and the tens of millions of dollars she wasted, I have learned a lot from her. I do not want her support.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about its social media director\u2019s gibe at Mr. Ryan, which at a minimum showed a lack of message discipline inside the campaign. Whether it would endanger Mr. Ryan\u2019s support of Mr. Trump was not clear; the speaker\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment Saturday.He was forced to respond Friday when pressed by Ms. Brown, who now runs an education website and is married to Dan Senor, who was an adviser to Mr. Ryan and to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s primary race rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Turning to Mr. Ryan during a panel discussion, Ms. Brown told him that one morning, one of her sons, expressing disappointment, had asked why he endorsed Mr. Trump.What, she asked Mr. Ryan, was she supposed to tell her child?The attendee present for the exchange said Mr. Ryan appeared slightly uncomfortable but handled the question well. He said Mr. Ryan had explained that while he understood the disagreement among Republicans, he believed that his decision to support Mr. Trump would be better for the Republican Party in the long term.Mr. Trump, he said, had won with large margins in some of his House members\u2019 districts, and many voters liked and supported the candidate.Indeed, Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination with the same flamethrowing approach he is using today.\u201cIt\u2019s like what they said about his temper,\u201d said Brett Mohnkern, 29, of Oil City, Pa., who went to Mr. Trump\u2019s rally on Saturday in Pittsburgh. \u201cTone down for what?\u201dStill, the attendee who saw the exchange with Mr. Ryan on Friday said the party\u2019s debate over whether to support Mr. Trump was like a family\u2019s struggle with a divorce.Mr. Ryan, in one of his appearances at the retreat, tried to infuse what little humor he could into the situation. He joked that he had recently told David Copperfield that he wished the magician could make Mr. Ryan disappear from 2016.Nicholas Confessore and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The justices issued a brief order Tuesday saying that the Legislature \u201chas currently satisfied\u201d the court\u2019s orders on education funding by approving the measure last week. The decision ends a threat that public schools would be shut down after Thursday. Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, signed the school finance measure into law on Monday.

The justices ruled last month that the funding system remained unfair to poor school districts. (AP)Lawyers for an Air Force officer charged with rape, adultery and other crimes are making the novel argument that the military ban on extramarital sex discriminates against heterosexuals because it does not specifically include same-sex couples. Lawyers for Col. Eugene Caughey of the Air Force challenged the adultery provision Monday in a military court at Peterson Air Force Base. They argued that the half-dozen adultery charges against Colonel Caughey should be thrown out because they violate his constitutional rights. Military prosecutors argued the adultery ban does apply to same-sex couples. The judge has not ruled on the argument. Colonel Caughey is charged with raping a woman at Schriever Air Force Base, also in Colorado, in late 2014 or early 2015. He is also accused of committing adultery several times, photographing his exposed genitals while in uniform and groping women. His court-martial is scheduled in August. He is a 24-year Air Force veteran and was formerly second in charge of the 50th Space Wing at Schriever. (AP)Voters will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana in California. Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Tuesday that proponents of the initiative had turned in more than the 366,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballot. The measure asks voters to approve allowing people 21 and older to buy an ounce of marijuana and marijuana-infused products at licensed retail outlets and grow up to six marijuana plants for personal recreational use.

{"Headline": "Boeing Offers Details on Iran Deal, Saying All Was Done Legally", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byThe Boeing Company on Thursday offered new details on its proposed passenger aircraft deal with Iran and rejected suggestions that it had not done sufficient homework in identifying end users of the planes.In a letter to congressional critics of the politically delicate deal, Boeing said Iran Air, the national airline, intended to buy 80 passenger planes in a variety of models worth $17.6 billion and lease 29 of the company\u2019s 737s, with deliveries projected to begin as early as next year.The letter, by Tim Keating, vice president of government operations, also said \u201cwe have a vigorous compliance mechanism at Boeing with regard to the screening of all parties with which we do business.\u201dMr. Keating wrote that Boeing had strictly adhered to dealings with Iranian entities approved by United States sanctions monitors.\u201cWe could not, as a corporation, be reasonably expected to have better intelligence resources than that of the U.S. government,\u201d Mr. Keating wrote. \u201cTherefore, we do rely upon the U.S. government to provide the information needed for us to remain compliant.\u201dAmong the eased sanctions was a relaxed prohibition on Iran\u2019s ability to acquire aircraft for the national airline\u2019s aging commercial fleet.Iran also has negotiated an agreement with Airbus, Boeing\u2019s major competitor, to acquire more than 100 aircraft.The sale and lease of Boeing jetliners, if completed, would constitute the biggest American business transaction with Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.Other nonnuclear sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran remain. They include a prohibition on the use of the dollar by Iran and its exclusion from the American banking system, complicating how Boeing would get paid. Boeing\u2019s products also cannot be used by sanctioned entities in Iran, notably the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.The congressmen, citing the United States\u2019 designation of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, and what they described as Iran\u2019s systematic use of its commercial aircraft to aid \u201chostile actors around the world,\u201d requested that Boeing explain how the company would prevent Iranian use of Boeing planes for such purposes.Mr. Keating said in the response that Boeing had negotiated legally with Iran under the conditions allowed by the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.He also wrote that Boeing had reached no decisions yet on how to handle the Iranian financing for the aircraft, and reiterated the company\u2019s previous pledges to follow the United States government\u2019s determinations of what is allowed.Advertisement"}

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201dWhich brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away.Jonathan A. Knee is professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School and a senior adviser at Evercore Partners.

{"Headline": "New York Above 800 Feet", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "By Jake SilversteinPerhaps much of this history has been driven by crude competition \u2014 the fierce battle between the Chrysler Building and the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building (40 Wall Street), for instance, to be the World\u2019s Tallest Building, a fight the Chrysler won by a stunning coup de gr\u00e2ce: the last-minute addition of its secretly constructed spire, which nudged New York\u2019s altitude record up to 1,046 feet for 11 precious months until the Empire State Building topped out. But the city\u2019s architectural history cannot be reduced to gamesmanship. Something else is going on. Manhattan builds up because it cannot build out and because it cannot sit still. Those of its inhabitants who can afford to do so will seek to climb to higher ground.We are currently in the midst of another clambering epoch. The city has 21 buildings with roof heights above 800 feet; seven of them have been completed in the past 15 years (and three of those the past 36 months). In this special New York Issue, we explore the high-altitude archipelago that spreads among the top floors of these 21 giants. It totals about 34 million square feet in all, encompassing lavish living spaces, vertiginous work environments (during construction and after), elite gathering places. Visually, the experience of this new altitude feels different in kind from its predecessors, the peak uplifts of previous booms that topped out at 400, 500 or 600 feet. At 800 and above, you feel something unusual in a city defined by the smelly bustle of its sidewalks and the jammed waiting and inching and zooming of its avenues \u2014 a kind of Alpine loneliness. Every New Yorker knows the pleasant private solitude that can be found at street level, among anonymous crowds. This is something different: an austere sense of apartness inspired by achieving a perspective seemingly not meant for human eyes.Jake Silverstein is editor in chief of the magazine.By Michael Kimmelman\u201cWould you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?\u201d Harry Lime asked on the Ferris wheel in \u201cThe Third Man.\u201dJimmy Park, whose office is also on the 85th floor and who is a mountain climber in his spare time, put it another way: \u201cYou\u2019re looking down on something you\u2019re not in, and you feel you\u2019re a long way from where you need to be if you need to be safe. At the same time, there\u2019s something therapeutic about seeing great distances. It happens on planes, on mountains, on beaches. I\u2019ll have a meeting with a new client, and we\u2019ll gaze out the window and have this comfortable silence.\u201cIt\u2019s analogous,\u201d he went on, \u201cto the \u2018overview effect\u2019 that astronauts feel, which created the whole environmental movement. You realize how small you are and how big the world is.\u201dThe Old Testament declared every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low, in keeping with classical beliefs about proportion and balance. By the 18th century, awe, terror and exultation, previously reserved for God, passed over to geological phenomena like mountains and experiences like conquering peaks. Kant called it \u201cthe terrifying sublime.\u201d In the 19th, with new technology and the growth of cities, nature was rivaled by the man-made. The sublime became reachable by climbing to the top of a tall building.In this spirit, Richard Morris Hunt designed New York\u2019s Tribune Building, built in 1875, with its clock tower at 260 feet, competing with the spire of Trinity Church to be the tallest structure in the city. A quarter-century later, Daniel Burnham\u2019s Flatiron Building, at 285 feet, established a new ideal of tall and skinny, soon dwarfed by the 700-foot-tall Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower, just across Madison Square Park, which was itself outdone, in 1913, by Cass Gilbert\u2019s Woolworth Building, at 792 feet.The New York skyline found its Platonic ideal less than two decades later with the Chrysler and Empire State buildings. The Empire State\u2019s 204-foot mooring mast for passenger dirigibles, which never actually docked there, represented the mercantile equivalent of Trinity\u2019s steeple. As E.B. White wrote, the city skyline was \u201cto the nation what the white church spire is to the village \u2014 the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying that the way is up.\u201dIt was exclusivity of neighborhood, more than sheer height, that connoted status in Manhattan half a century ago: a 20th-floor penthouse on Park Avenue still signified the pinnacle of the social pyramid. Back then, real nosebleed altitudes, like 800 feet, belonged primarily to commercial, not residential, buildings. Skyscrapers advertised companies. Apartments alone couldn\u2019t cover the extraordinary cost of construction at such heights.That changed only during the last decade or so, once apartments in luxury buildings like 15 Central Park West fetched $3,000 a square foot and more. Suddenly, a very tall, very slender project on 57th Street, with a floor plate just big enough for one apartment, or maybe two, and needing far fewer space-hogging elevators than a commercial tower, seemed profitable to aggressive developers. Big-name architects were enlisted. As Carol Willis, the founding director of the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan, likes to put it, form follows finance.Height suddenly substituted for neighborhood as a signifier of status, partly because zoning regulations steered sky-high construction toward less restricted, mixed-use parts of the city, like 57th Street, which also offered money shots of Central Park, and partly because a target clientele of South Asian copper-mining industrialists and Russian oligarchs had little intention of living in their apartments. In any case, they didn\u2019t actually want neighbors. They wanted views. Developers promoted these buildings as de facto country estates, where the chances of encountering someone who isn\u2019t a paid employee of the building are vanishingly slim, and in-house restaurants serve only tenants, so that even eating out won\u2019t require actually going out.Many New Yorkers, infuriated by tax breaks given to these skyscraping potentates, picture themselves toiling in the long, skinny shadows the new towers will cast. But shadows aside, that\u2019s not entirely fair to the supertalls. Some people may not like their scale, but a handful of apartments in mostly nonresidential blocks of Midtown or near Wall Street are hardly the cause of gentrification and displacement. And there may be just a little xenophobia in the anti-supertall phenomenon. It\u2019s a good bet that more than a few wealthy Chinese, Indians and Arabs, like Jews before them, facing an impossible vetting process from co-op boards on the Upper East Side, elected instead to look down on them.In any case, 57th Street is now dubbed Billionaire\u2019s Row, and wealth has reached new altitudes. Advances in skyscraper technology have much to do with this. William F. Baker, who helped engineer the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 2,717 feet the world\u2019s tallest tower, recently explained the engineering behind life above 800 feet. Engineers, he said, who long ago figured out how to make sure skyscrapers won\u2019t topple over, are focused more and more these days on the trickier problem of making people inside feel secure. It\u2019s a challenge because very tall, very slim buildings are designed, like airplane wings, to bend not break. An average person starts worrying about movement in a high-rise long before there\u2019s anything approaching a threat to safety. Mild jostling that you take for granted in a car or train can provoke panic at 100 stories, even if you\u2019re still safer in the building than in the car.Incredible efforts now go into mitigating those effects. Today\u2019s superslender towers are outfitted with sophisticated counterweights, or dampers, and other movement-tempering devices, as they are also outfitted with elevators that speed tenants to their aeries but not so swiftly that you will perceive any troubling G-forces. Something around 30 feet per second seems to be an ideal velocity, suggesting there may be an ultimate height for luxury towers \u2014 not because we can\u2019t engineer a mile-high building but because rich tenants won\u2019t abide elevators that take several minutes to reach apartments for which they paid the annual expenditures of the Republic of Palau.Exceptional engineering requirements are said to account for a hefty portion of the cost of apartments in the supertalls, like 432 Park Avenue, presently the tallest apartment tower in Midtown Manhattan, and one of the costliest. Its exterior is a grid of concrete and glass, like an extruded Sol LeWitt, or a distended Josef Hoffmann vase (or a middle finger stuck up at the city, depending on your perspective). Giant twin dampers near the roof, the size of locomotive engines \u2014 with their own spectacular double-height views over the city \u2014 act like shock absorbers, providing ballast and discouraging chandeliers from tinkling and Champagne glasses from toppling over.But taste is tricky to legislate. Critics greeted the Chrysler Building with horror when it was finished, then held it up as a model of what skyscrapers should look like when a modern generation of glass and steel towers reshaped the postwar skyline and provoked fresh outrage. Looking back, we can see that 1950s landmarks like Lever House, by SOM\u2019s Gordon Bunshaft, and the Seagram Building, by Mies van der Rohe, are as beautiful and refined as any architecture in America, although in the following decades they spawned a million mediocre imitations, cluttering Manhattan and obscuring the originals\u2019 genius. This was the era of white flight and suburban sprawl, when Roland Barthes described New York as a vertical metropolis \u201cfrom which man is absent by his accumulation,\u201d and America\u2019s so-called towers in the park \u2014 those often unjustly maligned housing projects of clustered high-rises in poor neighborhoods, many on the margins of the city \u2014 were left to ruin. The ugliest skyscraper in town, long known as the Verizon Building, at 375 Pearl Street, a seemingly windowless behemoth, still looms over the Brooklyn Bridge. It went up in 1976, just after the twin towers, by Minoru Yamasaki, which New Yorkers loved to hate \u2014 until many came to regard them differently, and not just because of what happened on Sept. 11. At dawn and dusk, the sculpted corners of the towers captured sunlight, making orange and silver ribbons float in the ether. Now, 1 World Trade has risen from their ashes. The classic modernist skyscraper is fashionable again. Taste, like the New York skyline, remains an endless work in progress.Of the new buildings, I like 432, designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, and the studied jumble of 56 Leonard, downtown (Herzog & de Meuron are the architects). They\u2019re designed with finesse, punctuating the skyline. Other buildings going up, like Jean Nouvel\u2019s 53 West 53rd, beside the Museum of Modern Art, and 111 57th Street, by SHoP Architects, promise to help tip the scales back toward an older ideal of the sophisticated, attenuated tower, crowded out by those decades of plug-and-play boxes.And corporate chieftains are no longer clamoring for glitzy new company towers. They\u2019re more in tune with millennials, who prefer repurposed buildings, street life and live-work neighborhoods. The architect Bjarke Ingels has recently envisioned a couple of New York towers that feature enormous, sky-high terraces, to bring something of the pleasures of being on the street into the ether.\u201cThe tendency has been to create a hermetic experience, with floor-to-ceiling windows, so you\u2019re incarcerated in a box,\u201d Ingels said. \u201cOutdoor space used to be considered a nuisance, which didn\u2019t contribute to the building\u2019s value, but I believe that\u2019s changing. I am starting to hear leasing people say they want outdoor space. That\u2019s true in residential as well as commercial properties. I think the future at 800 feet is more likely to be engaged with the outside and less an escape from it.\u201dMaybe. In New York, it can get pretty windy and cold up there. For ages, my aunt has rented a studio apartment, a bit lower down, on the 16th floor of a building in Greenwich Village, with a terrace looking toward Washington Square Park and Lower Manhattan, although mostly the view consists of a jumble of low-rise buildings, black-tar rooftops and fire escapes. The terrace has a sun-bleached, green-and-white canvas awning that can be rolled out for shade. Voices and car horns waft up from the street. Rain splatters on the terra-cotta floor. Spring blows in on breezes from the river. I feel like the luckiest man in New York when I\u2019m there, above the city and in the middle of it.Everyone\u2019s sweet spot is different. I stood with Jimmy Park at his window in 1 World Trade, 1,000 feet up. He was extolling the view of Brooklyn and Queens. The roof of 7 World Trade, a neighboring 743-foot glass office tower, cleverly conceived by David Childs, was several hundred feet directly below us. We could just make out the mechanicals. Someone standing up there would have been one of Harry Lime\u2019s dots.I asked Park how tall he thought it was. He scrunched his forehead. He hadn\u2019t really thought about it, he said. \u2666Matthew Pillsbury is a photographer.

Then he led me south, through a lavish open-plan living room, where his partner, Tatyana Enkin, was preparing tea. The two are collectors of glass art, and the living room was dense with it: crystal swans and obelisks and lilac-and-purple baubles of various abstract shapes. LED strip lighting in the ceiling made the room glow blue, then red. \u201cLook at the World Trade Center,\u201d Estis said, pointing downtown. Finally, he led me west.But as he looked out the window his eyes flickered, a little irritated, at two new supertall condo buildings that tower above his, slightly blighting his west-facing view. To the right in the middle distance was One57, a blandly luxurious gray-blue monolith that rises to 1,004 feet and casts a significant shadow over the south side of Central Park; just to the right of that stood the even loftier 432 Park Avenue, pencil-thin and still unfinished. The design of 432 Park is more attractive than One57\u2019s \u2014 it resembles a neat stack of pale Rubik\u2019s Cubes \u2014 and its rapid rise has made it perhaps Manhattan\u2019s most noticeable skyscraper. When Estis moved into Trump World Tower in 2002, his year-old home was the world\u2019s tallest residential building. Now 432 Park dwarfs it.\u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to an art gallery,\u201d Enkin said. \u201cThe painting has to be on eye level.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of being above it all?\u201d Estis said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on the beauty of the city and the various structures. Here you have the flavor.\u201dEstis is, much like the man who built Trump World Tower, thickset, restless, plain speaking and motivated by a desire to win. He grew up in Little Neck, Queens, his mother a legal secretary and his father a lawyer for the Veteran\u2019s Administration. At school, they asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. \u201cRich,\u201d Estis replied. He was 6. While in college, he rented an ice-cream truck and drove it around on an aggressive schedule \u2014 eight months out of the year. Soon after he graduated from law school he had enough money saved to buy his first piece of property: a two-family home in Bay Terrace, Queens. Now 57, he owns approximately 65 apartments and houses throughout Manhattan and Queens, and heads a 79-lawyer law firm.Enkin, like Trump\u2019s first and third wives, is an ex-model who grew up in the Eastern bloc. She was raised in Soviet Ukraine and worked as a hydrologist in the Siberian gulags before moving to the United States to become a model for the Elite agency and Marc Jacobs. Now 40, she works as an artist\u2019s agent.By living above 800 feet, Estis and Enkin are two members of an unexpectedly exclusive group in Manhattan. In my estimation, no more than 40 people currently live above that line, scattered among just three buildings (Trump World Tower, One57 and 8 Spruce Street, a Frank Gehry building downtown). But they\u2019re just the vanguard. The city is in the midst of another building boom, one unlike any that has come before. In the past, Manhattan\u2019s tallest buildings were filled with corporate offices; now, the most imposing skyscrapers are built as homes for some of the wealthiest people on the planet. By 2020 there are expected to be at least 14 residential skyscrapers in New York City. Many of them will block out the light for a great expanse of Central Park. A small city is being built in the sky \u2014 but for whom? I was curious to learn about them, so I set out to meet as many as I could.Estis and Enkin were the first I got in touch with, and the most hospitable. I lingered around their apartment for hours, until the sun was setting over the Hudson. The spires of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building suddenly illuminated, bathing the apartment in their light.\u201cWhen you\u2019re up there,\u201d Estis said, meaning the 432 Park penthouse, \u201cyou\u2019re missing this. You\u2019ll see lights. But not at this level. You never want to be level with, or looking down on, rooftops. There\u2019s no advantage.\u201d\u201cApparently that penthouse sold for $95 million,\u201d I said. The buyer has been reported to be the Saudi Arabian retail and real estate giant Fawaz Alhokair (432 Park\u2019s representatives declined to comment). He made his $1.37 billion fortune by bringing outlets of Western retail chains \u2014 Topshop, Banana Republic, Zara and Gap \u2014 to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus.Estis shrugged, unimpressed. \u201cThey get bragging rights,\u201d he said. Then he affected the smug tone of a 432 Park penthouse purchaser and added: \u201cI paid more money than anyone else in the building. But I may not have the best view.\u201dThe view may not matter in the end. According to Forbes, Alhokair lives primarily in Riyadh, so presumably 432 Park\u2019s penthouse will become just a pied-\u00e0-terre for him \u2014 or perhaps simply an investment property, destined to remain pristinely and forever empty.Tracking down the owners was a drawn-out process. I would make a trip to the New York City Registry to fetch the names and addresses of the limited-liability companies that made the purchases and try to contact them that way. For example, the top two floors of One57 make up a single duplex, Apartment 90, which sold for $100.5 million to an L.L.C. named, unhelpfully, P89-90 LLC. (It remains Manhattan\u2019s most expensive single residence.) The lawyer representing the L.L.C., Andrea Riina, emailed me, \u201cYour request was forwarded to the client and declined.\u201dI had slightly better luck with Apartment 90\u2019s downstairs neighbor, the owner of Apartment 88. In April 2015, it was sold for $47.3 million to Pac Wholly Own L.L.C., which is associated with a Chinese airline, Pacific American. The airline is owned by the HNA Group, which is in turn owned by the billionaire Chen brothers, Feng and Guoqing. After correctly predicting in the early 1990s that Hainan, a balmy island south of Beijing, would become a kind of Chinese Riviera, they started an airline to take passengers there. Soon, they amassed a fortune. According to a 2014 Bloomberg profile, Chen Feng is a \u201crigorously private\u201d man; apparently his brother is, too. I emailed Guoqing Chen\u2019s assistant several times before she finally responded: \u201cOne57 is a company investment program, and Mr. Chen doesn\u2019t live in One57 right now. So, I am afraid Mr. Chen can\u2019t take the interview. Thank you so much for your consideration.\u201d The rebuff knocked out Apartment 86 too. The L.L.C. that purchased it, One57 86 L.L.C., is registered to the same small downtown Manhattan office suite that houses Pacific American airlines.Apartment 83 is unsold, and the owners of Apartments 85 and 82 \u2014 the billionaire retailers and business partners Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, respectively \u2014 \u201cprefer not to be included in the article,\u201d their assistant wrote. Stroll, who made his money by investing early in Tommy Hilfiger, is Canadian but a resident of Geneva, according to Forbes. Chou \u2014 an early investor in Michael Kors \u2014 lives in Hong Kong.I had a good feeling about Apartment 81 (which lies slightly below 800 feet, but I felt I\u2019d earned it). For a start, there was a chance its owner actually lived there. The apartment cost $55.5 million and \u2014 according to The Times\u2019s real estate pages from the week of the sale \u2014 boasts a \u201cgalvanizing 75-foot-long entrance gallery,\u201d a \u201cgrand salon,\u201d four bedrooms, a \u201cone-ton bathtub carved from a single marble slab,\u201d \u201chead-on views of the park to the north\u201d and a concierge who can organize everything from \u201chelicopter service to the Hamptons\u201d to use of a quartz stone bed at a spa on a lower floor that has, apparently, certain healing properties. These apartments are marketed in grandiose ways. As Michael Graves, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman, told The Times in November 2015, \u201cLiving on a full floor at One57 is probably the closest thing to being a king in the 21st century.\u201d (To be pedantic, the world\u2019s 15 actual kings are closer to being kings than the residents of One57 are, though there might conceivably be some overlap.)The purchaser of Apartment 81 turned out to be a Texan named Becky Moores. Unlike her neighbors, she didn\u2019t conceal her identity. She bought it in her own name \u2014 well, in the name of the Rebecca Ann Moores Family Trust. She married her childhood sweetheart, John, in 1963. Forty-five years later she filed for divorce, hinting at infidelity. The divorce was messy and public and the payout vast enough to afford her not only Apartment 81 but a $34.3 million apartment on One57\u2019s 54th floor too. The settlement proved less fortuitous for fans of the San Diego Padres. John Moores was the team\u2019s owner, and to pay the settlement he had to sell his majority share. In the process, the payroll plummeted, and the star players Jake Peavy and Adrian Gonzalez were traded off to save money. \u201cUltimately, the team collapsed,\u201d says Tom Krasovic, a sports reporter at The San Diego Union-Tribune who covered the Padres for years. He seemed confident that Becky Moores would grant me an interview. \u201cI always found her to be a very nice lady,\u201d he told me over the telephone. \u201cShe\u2019s very well liked and very approachable with a lot of the media.\u201d\u201cBad news,\u201d emailed my contact for Moores. \u201cRebecca Moores isn\u2019t interested in participating in your story.\u201dSorting out who lives above 800 feet in Trump World Tower is slightly easier, thanks both to the tabloids and to the fact that it was built before this vogue for secrecy really took hold. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z used to live up there. They rented an apartment a few floors above Estis and Enkin for a year, paying a reported $65,000 per month. The former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter lived there, too. He sold his 5,500-square-foot apartment on the 89th floor, identical in shape and size to Estis and Enkin\u2019s, for $15.5 million in 2012. Nowadays, their neighbors include the widow of a Delta Air Lines pilot who made a fortune in the stock market, a human rights advocate from South Africa who specializes in health care projects for the developing world, the chairman of Assist America (a global medical-emergency service) and a mysterious Asian businessman who purchased the three remaining apartments all at once, paying in cash, according to Enkin. \u201cHe\u2019s Japanese,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know exactly what he does.\u201d (According to a resident and city records, his name is Chinh Chu. Chu works in finance and he is, in fact, from Vietnam. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)8 Spruce Street stands out among these new buildings because it\u2019s rental-only \u2014 none of the units are for sale. Only the top three floors sit above the 800-foot line. The resident of Penthouse South, on the very top floor, agreed to meet me.Penthouse South is tiny \u2014 so tiny it looks as if there has been some mistake. Its 453 square feet are inclusive of literally everything. It\u2019s so incongruous amid the huge penthouses it abuts that it feels almost magical, like the secret railway platform from which the wizards take the train to Hogwarts. It was designed to be a guest or nanny\u2019s room for one of the other penthouses, but building management rented it instead to Stellan Parr \u2014 33, tattooed, soft-spoken and studying to be a physician assistant. He pays rent \u201cin the low thousands.\u201d He is a unique man: perhaps the only person of (somewhat) modest means who lives at such heights in New York. We sat at his kitchen/living room/bedroom table and admired his view, which takes in the Statue of Liberty, the curve of the East River, 1 World Trade Center and the 9/11 Memorial pools. He opened his window a fraction, and we both suddenly experienced debilitating vertigo. He closed it, and the feeling immediately dissipated.As my elevator descended and my ears popped, it occurred to me that I would almost certainly never take in such a view again. And in fact, maybe nobody will, if these apartments wind up becoming empty investments.A few weeks later, via email, I received an enormous surprise. For the first time ever, a purchaser of an apartment above 800 feet in one of the mysterious new supertall condo buildings had agreed to speak with a journalist about his purchase. I was to meet him in his Fifth Avenue office on Thursday at 4 p.m.Howard Lorber is a 67-year-old New Yorker, balding, gregarious, instantly likable. He stood at his 52nd-floor office window, which looks out over \u2014 or, I suppose, under \u2014 his future home. His apartment will be on the 67th floor, he told me, 850 feet above the ground.\u201cI point it out to everyone who comes in here,\u201d he said.I mentioned my calculation that only a few dozen people currently live above 800 feet in the city. Lorber, who works in real estate, did his own calculation and said, \u201cOnce 432 Park is filled, there\u2019ll be 40 more.\u201dOn his mantelpiece were photographs of him with Donald, Ivanka and Melania Trump. \u201cI think Donald is fantastic, and he\u2019s going to beat Hillary and be the next president,\u201d he said. There was also a photograph of him with Mitt Romney. \u201cI should take that one down,\u201d he said.Lorber grew up in the Bronx. His father was an electrical engineer, and Lorber entered the work force by the time he was 13, \u201cflipping pizzas, pumping gas.\u201d He went to college but hated it, so he became a sociology major because someone told him it was the easiest way to graduate. Out in the world, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the sort of work he could find with a sociology degree, so he went back to college and learned accounting. He became a stockbroker, then moved into insurance. Eventually, he made enough money to buy Nathan\u2019s Famous, the hot-dog company. He\u2019s currently chairman of the real estate firm Douglas Elliman, the very same firm that is now selling the condos at 432 Park \u2014 hence, perhaps, his willingness to be interviewed. From time to time during our conversation, he lapsed into a kind of marketing autopilot: \u201c432 Park is an unbelievably striking building, it\u2019s like a masterpiece, it has to be the most talked-about and revered building in New York City. ... \u201d But I didn\u2019t mind the spiel because \u2014 given his expertise \u2014 he provided insightful answers to my lingering questions about the supertall boom.\u201cHow come Trump World Tower is so much less expensive than 432 Park?\u201d I asked.\u201cBy New York standards it\u2019s already an older building,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst Avenue in the 40s doesn\u2019t command the same price as Park Avenue in the 50s. It just doesn\u2019t. Everyone wants to live in the middle, as opposed to the ends. I guess Central Park is the equivalent of living on the water in the Hamptons. Then there are the ceiling heights, the amenities. ... \u201d (432 Park will have a restaurant, a fitness center and several floors of studios that the owners of the larger apartments can purchase as offices or for staff accommodation. When I walked into Lorber\u2019s office, he was complaining to one of his associates about the price of these studios. \u201cSeven hundred feet for $3 million, to house your staff?\u201d he was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d Still, he has reserved one for himself.)I recounted to him my lack of success at One57, how I was impeded in part by the impenetrable L.L.C. names. \u201cPeople do it for privacy,\u201d he said.\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit worked.\u201dI asked him about all the emptiness up there. Will those apartments purchased as investments by foreign billionaires really remain forever vacant?\u201cIt depends on the people,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome foreigners just want to get their money out of the countries they\u2019re in. They may or may not rent them, but it\u2019s not about making money. It\u2019s more a matter of wanting stability, to be in a safe haven, which they believe New York City is. Look around the world. Look at all the turmoil. Argentina\u2019s bankrupt, Brazil\u2019s in trouble. In China the prices probably went down 20 to 30 percent last year.\u201d But this, he added, was more an issue for One57 than for 432 Park. \u201cOne57 is geared more to foreigners; 432 Park is mostly domestic.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d I asked.\u201cIt ended up that way,\u201d he said. \u201cOne57 has a hotel in it. 432 Park doesn\u2019t. I think the foreigners like the idea of having a hotel. The locals like the privacy and the security of not having a hotel. And also, in fairness, One57 was on the market first. So they had the first shot at those people.\u201dThis last statement made me realize just how tiny a group this is \u2014 these foreign billionaires happy to spend tens of millions on New York City apartments they may never visit. It\u2019s a very small community, the superrich. In fact, when Lorber asked me who else I had interviewed for the story, and I mentioned Warren Estis, he broke into a huge smile and said: \u201cI know Warren very well! He\u2019s a client of the company! He\u2019s a fun guy!\u201dWhen I was at Estis and Enkin\u2019s apartment we got to talking about Trump and the hostility that follows him around. Trump World Tower was itself constructed amid much acrimony and division \u2014 a chaotic and upsetting experience for some neighbors and a bonanza for others. Taking advantage of the city\u2019s idiosyncratic \u201cair rights\u201d process, Trump quietly bought rights from the owners of several low-rise neighboring buildings \u2014 a church and a Japanese cultural center among them \u2014 until he had enough to build one gigantic tower. He undertook his maneuver with such stealth that none of the other neighbors, not even Walter Cronkite, knew what was unfolding in their backyards. When Trump\u2019s plans were finally revealed, Cronkite made an emotional petition to the city appeals board, calling the design \u201cdemeaning\u201d to the United Nations. \u201cHow can we allow an institution as important to the world and New York as the U.N. to be forever dwarfed by this outsize and illegal tower?\u201dA Trump executive, Abraham Wallach, responded by reminding the media that Cronkite himself lived in a 50-story high-rise at U.N. Plaza. \u201cPeople who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d he said.Before setting off for Trump World Tower, I emailed the Rev. Robert J. Robbins, formerly of the Church of the Holy Family, to ask what the church did with its unexpected $10 million air-rights windfall from Trump. He declined my interview request, citing \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s present high profile\u201d as the reason. One of Estis and Enkin\u2019s neighbors refused to let The Times photograph their apartment because they didn\u2019t want their name associated with Trump\u2019s in the current climate. For that reason, I felt concerned about mentioning his name to Estis and Enkin. But I needn\u2019t have worried. They are huge fans of his and intend to vote for him.\u201cHe\u2019s truly impressive,\u201d said Estis. \u201cHe gives off an aura of presence and he usually has very positive things to say to the individual he\u2019s talking to. He makes you feel good about yourself. He\u2019ll praise you.\u201d\u201cHow has he praised you?\u201d I asked.\u201cOne time I ran into him at the U.S. Open, and he was with a well-known name in New York real estate,\u201d Estis said. \u201cWe shake hands, and he turns to the builder-developer and says, \u2018Warren\u2019s probably one of the best lawyers in New York City.\u2019\u2009\u201d Estis beamed. \u201cAs I said, it makes you feel good.\u201dTrump does like to say things that make people feel good, though the question of their veracity is often tricky. Trump World Tower\u2019s public-relations agency repeatedly assured The Times that Estis\u2019s apartment lay 810 feet above the ground. But then I called Marshall Gerometta, an expert in skyscraper heights at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\u201cOnly the top residential unit is above 800 feet,\u201d he said. That\u2019s the 90th-floor penthouse, four floors above Estis and Enkin. His figure, he told me, came from a 3-D image of the building on Google Earth. When I raised doubts about his methods, he said that he had \u201cchecked dozens of buildings this way against the actual blueprints, and it\u2019s usually within a couple of feet of accuracy. I\u2019m kind of the go-to guy on this.\u201d (This is true: The Council on Tall Buildings is a respected source.)\u201cIs Trump known for exaggerating his buildings\u2019 heights?\u201d I asked.Gerometta replied that he didn\u2019t know about that, but he did know this: Trump was probably one of the first builders to skip floor numbers in order to inflate the total count. \u201cWhat he markets as the 90th floor is often actually the 72nd floor, just to make it sound more impressive.\u201d\u201cThe Donald,\u201d Gerometta said, laughing, \u201clikes to exaggerate.\u201d (Trump World Tower continues to dispute Gerometta\u2019s figures but has not produced blueprints or other evidence to the contrary.)For Estis and Enkin, the precise altitude of their apartment is ultimately immaterial. At sunset we sat at a west-facing window. The evening light filled the room, and Enkin had opened a bottle of Champagne. I suddenly remembered recent demonstrations at various Trump-owned skyscrapers across New York City.\u201cWas there an anti-Trump protest outside this building a couple of weeks ago?\u201d I asked them.Enkin smiled. Then she shrugged and said, \u201cYou only see the top of their heads.\u201d \u2666Christopher Anderson is a Magnum photographer and a recipient of a Robert Capa Gold Medal Award. By Helen MacdonaldBehind the tourists pressed against the perimeter fence, there\u2019s a man leaning back against the wall. Above him the stars and stripes flap languidly in the night air. I can\u2019t see his face in the gloom, but I know this is the man I\u2019ve come to meet because he\u2019s holding a pair of binoculars that look far better than mine, and his face is upturned to sky. There\u2019s an urgency to the way he stands that reminds me of people I\u2019ve seen at skeet shoots waiting for the trap to fire the next target. He\u2019s tense with anticipation.This is Andrew Farnsworth, a soft-spoken 43-year-old researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and I\u2019m joining him here in hope of seeing a wildlife phenomenon that twice a year sweeps almost unseen above the city: the seasonal night flights of migrating birds. I can\u2019t help thinking this is an absurdly incongruous place for a nature-viewing expedition. Apart from the familiar exceptions \u2014 pigeons, rats, mice, sparrows \u2014 we tend to think of wild creatures as living far from the city\u2019s margins, and nature as the city\u2019s polar opposite. It\u2019s easy to see why. The only natural things visible from this height are a faint scatter of stars above and the livid bruise of the Hudson running through the clutter of lights below. Everything else is us: the flash of aircraft, the tilt of bright smartphones, the illuminated grids of windows and streets.Skyscrapers are at their most perfect at night, full-fledged dreams of modernity that erase nature and replace it with a new landscape wrought of artifice, a cartography of steel and glass and light. But people live in them for the same reason that they travel to wild places: to escape the city. The highest buildings raise you above the mess and chaos of life at street level; they also raise you into something else. The sky may seem like an empty place, just as we once thought the deep ocean to be a lifeless void. But like the ocean, this is a vast habitat full of life \u2014 bats and birds, flying insects, spiders, windblown seeds, microbes, drifting spores. The more I stare at the city across miles of dusty, uplit air, the more I begin to think of these supertall buildings as machines that work like deep-sea submersibles, transporting us to inaccessible realms we cannot otherwise explore. Inside them, the air is calm and clean and temperate. Outside is a tumultuous world teeming with unexpected biological abundance, and we are standing in its midst.Wind-borne migration is an arthropod specialty, allowing creatures like aphids, wasps, lacewings, beetles, moths and tiny spiders hoisted on strands of electrostatically charged silk to travel distances ranging from tens to hundreds of miles. These drifting creatures are colonizers, pioneers looking for new places to live, and they\u2019ll make a home wherever they find one. Place a rose bush out on the arid environment of a top-floor balcony and soon wind-borne sap-sucking aphids will cluster on its stems, followed by the tiny wasps that parasitize them.Insects travel above us in extraordinary numbers. In Britain, the research scientist Jason Chapman uses radar systems aimed into the atmosphere to study their high-altitude movements. Over seven and a half billion can pass over a square mile of English farmland in a single month \u2014 about 5,500 pounds of biomass. Chapman thinks the number passing over New York City may be even higher, because this is a gateway to a continent, not a small island surrounded by cold seas, and summers here are generally hotter. Once you get above 650 feet, he says, you\u2019re lofted into a realm where the distinction between city and countryside has little or no meaning at all.During the day, chimney swifts feast on these vast drifts of life; during the night, so do the city\u2019s resident and migrating bats, and nighthawks with white-flagged wings. On days with northwest winds in late summer and early fall, birds, bats and migrant dragonflies all feed on rich concentrations of insects caused by powerful downdrafts and eddies around the city\u2019s high-rise buildings, just as fish swarm to feed where currents congregate plankton in the ocean.It\u2019s not just insects up there. The tallest buildings, like the Empire State, 1 World Trade Center and other new supertowers, project into airspace that birds have used for millenniums. The city lies on the Atlantic flyway, the route used by hundreds of millions of birds to fly north every spring to their breeding grounds and back again in the fall. Most small songbirds tend to travel between 3,000 and 4,000 feet from the ground, but they vary their altitude depending on the weather. Larger birds fly higher, and some, like shorebirds, may well pass over the city at 10,000 to 12,000 feet. Up here we\u2019ll be able to see only a fraction of what is moving past us: Even the tallest buildings dip into only the shallows of the sky.Though you can see migrating raptors soaring at altitudes well over 800 feet over the city during the day, most species of diurnal birds migrate after nightfall. It\u2019s safer. Temperatures are cooler, and there are fewer predators around. Fewer, not none. Just before I arrived, Farnsworth saw a peregrine falcon drifting ominously around the building. Peregrines frequently hunt at night here. From high-rise lookout perches, they launch flights out into the darkness to grab birds and bats. In more natural habitats, falcons cache the bodies of birds they\u2019ve killed among crevices in cliffs. The ones here tuck their kills into ledges on high-rises, including the Empire State. For a falcon, a skyscraper is simply a cliff: It brings the same prospects, the same high winds, the same opportunities to stash a takeout meal.I feel less like a naturalist and more like an amateur astronomer waiting for a meteor shower, squinting expectantly into the darkness. I try a new tactic: focusing my binoculars on infinity and pointing them straight up. Through the lenses, birds invisible to the naked eye swim into view, and there are birds above them, and birds higher still. It strikes me that we are seeing a lot of birds. An awful lot of birds.For every larger bird I see, 30 or more songbirds pass over. They are very small. Watching their passage is almost too moving to bear. They resemble stars, embers, slow tracer fire. Even through binoculars those at higher altitudes are tiny, ghostly points of light. I know that they have loose-clenched toes tucked to their chests, bright eyes, thin bones and a will to fly north that pulls them onward night after night. Most of them spent yesterday in central or southern New Jersey before ascending into darkness. Larger birds keep flying until dawn. The warblers tend to come earlier to earth, dropping like stones into patches of habitat farther north to rest and feed over the following day. Some, like yellow-rumped warblers, began their long journeys in the southeastern states. Others, like rose-breasted grosbeaks, have made their way up from Central America.Something tugs at my heart. I\u2019ll never see any of these birds again. If I weren\u2019t this high, and the birds weren\u2019t briefly illuminated by this column of light cast by a building thrown up through the Depression years to celebrate earthly power and capital confidence, I\u2019d never have seen them at all.Farnsworth pulls out a smartphone. Unlike everyone else holding screens up here, he\u2019s looking at radar images from Fort Dix, in New Jersey, part of a National Weather Service radar network that provides near-continuous coverage of airspace over the continental U.S.A. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a heavy migration night tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you see those kinds of patterns on radar, in particular, those greens,\u201d he explains, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about 1,000 to 2,000 birds per cubic mile potentially, which is almost as dense as it gets. So it\u2019s a big night.\u201d After days of bad weather for birds wanting to fly north, with low cloud and winds in the wrong direction, a bottleneck of migrants built up, and now the sky is full of them. I watch the pixellation blossom on the animated radar map, a blue-and-green dendritic flower billowing out over the whole East Coast. \u201cThis is biological stuff that\u2019s up in the atmosphere,\u201d Farnsworth says, pointing one finger to the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s all biology.\u201dMeteorologists have long known that you can detect animal life by radar. Just after World War II, British radar scientists and Royal Air Force technicians puzzled over mysterious plots and patterns that appeared on their screens. They knew they weren\u2019t aircraft and christened them \u201cangels\u201d before finally concluding that they were flocks of moving birds. \u201cThat was their contamination, right?\u201d Farnsworth says of radar meteorologists. \u201cThey wanted to filter all that stuff out. Now the biologists want to do the reverse.\u201d Farnsworth is one pioneer of a new multidisciplinary science, fit for an era in which weather radar has become so sensitive it can detect a single bumblebee over 30 miles away. It\u2019s called aeroecology, and it uses sophisticated remote-sensing technologies like radar, acoustics and tracking devices to study ecological patterns and relationships in the skies. \u201cThe whole notion of the aerosphere and airspace as habitat is not something that has come into the collective psyche until recently,\u201d Farnsworth says. And this new science is helping us understand how climate change, skyscrapers, wind turbines, light pollution and aviation affect the creatures that live and move above us.New York is among the brightest cities in the world after Las Vegas, only one node in a flood of artificial illumination that runs from Boston down to Washington. We cherish our cities for their appearance at night, but it takes a terrible toll on migrating songbirds: You can find them dead or exhausted at the foot of high-rise buildings all over America. Disoriented by light and reflections on glass, they crash into obstacles, fly into windows, spiral down to the ground. More than 100,000 die each year in New York City alone. Thomas King, of the New York pest-control company M&M Environmental, has had calls from residents of high-rise buildings asking him to deal with the birds colliding with their windows during migration season. He tells them that there\u2019s no solution, but they can talk to their building manager about turning the lights off. It helps. Programs like the New York City Audubon\u2019s Lights Out New York have encouraged many high-rise owners to do the same, saving both energy and avian lives.Every year the \u201cTribute in Light\u201d shines twin blue beams into the Manhattan night as a memorial to the lives lost on Sept. 11. They rise four miles into the air and are visible 60 miles from the city. On peak migration nights songbirds spiral down toward them, calling, pulled from the sky, so many circling in the light they look like glittering, whirling specks of paper caught in the wind. On one night last year, so many were caught in the beams that the few pixels representing the \u201cTribute\u201d site glowed superbright on the radar maps. Farnsworth was there with the Audubon team that got the lights shut off intermittently to prevent casualties. They switched off the \u201cTribute\u201d eight times that night for about 20 minutes at a time, releasing the trapped birds to return to their journey. Each time the lights went back on, a new sweep of birds was drawn in \u2014 the twin towers made ghosts of light visited over and over by winged travelers intermittently freed into darkness before a crowd rushed in to take their place. Farnsworth is a lead scientist in BirdCast, a project that combines a variety of methods \u2014 weather data, flight calls, radar, observers on the ground \u2014 to predict the movements of migrating birds throughout the continental United States and forecast big nights like this that might require emergency lights-out action.The flow of birds over the observation deck continues, but it\u2019s getting late. I make my farewell, take the elevator back down the building and wander uphill to my apartment. Though it\u2019s long past midnight, I\u2019m wide-awake. Part of what high-rise buildings are designed to do is change the way we see. To bring us different views of the world, views intimately linked with prospect and power \u2014 to make the invisible visible. The birds I saw were mostly unidentifiable streaks of light, like thin retinal scratches or splashes of luminous paint on a dark ground. As I look up from street level, the blank sky above seems a very different place, deep and coursing with life.Living in a high-rise building bars you from certain ways of interacting with the natural world. You can\u2019t put out feeders to watch robins and chickadees in your garden. But you are set in another part of their habitual world, a nocturne of ice crystals and cloud and wind and darkness. High-rise buildings, symbols of mastery over nature, can work as bridges toward a more complete understanding of the natural world \u2014 stitching the sky to the ground, nature to the city.For days afterward, my dreams are full of songbirds, the familiar ones from woods and back lots, but also points of moving light, little astronauts, travelers using the stars to navigate, having fallen to earth for a little while before picking themselves up and moving on. \u2666Brian Rea is an illustrator and artist based in Los Angeles.Photographs by Jack DavisonCamille Sweeney is a journalist and a co-author of \u201cThe Art of Doing.\u201dBy Gareth CookAt last, the wind happens upon one of the supertall towers south of the park and reveals a far more wicked talent. It strikes the building\u2019s face and rushes for the edges, whipping off the corners and spiraling tightly, creating a columnar vortex that sucks at the tower\u2019s side and goes careering downwind. If air is moving quickly, these vortices form to a beat, pulling first one way, then the other. The gale is coming out of the north, but this force acts on the perpendicular, along the east-west axis, rocking the structure. Specialists call this the crosswind effect, and in certain circumstances, the rocking hits a building\u2019s \u201cnatural frequency.\u201d Imagine, says Derek Kelly, an engineer, that the hand of God were to reach down and gently pluck one of the skyline\u2019s spires: The skyscraper would vibrate back and forth, like a guitar string. That is a building\u2019s natural frequency. If it matches the crosswind tugs, the two are in resonance; the oscillations grow, like a child kicking on a swing. East then west, east then west. When a gale rolls in, a supertall will lean back, but it\u2019s nothing compared with the potential power of the crosswind effect.Today\u2019s engineers have conquered gravity: With enough structural steel and high-performance concrete, a tower will soar. The more dogged foe is wind. While gravity pulls down, wind can come from any compass point. It can apply pressure or suction, or alternate between the two. The wind, unlike gravity, changes from city to city, from season to season. Most harrowing of all is the wind\u2019s dynamism. It is changed by everything it touches, and the wind even shapes itself, with every current pulling on all its neighbors. Gravity is plodding and obvious, but give wind a chance, and it will gather itself together and riot.In the world of tall buildings, a novel kind of specialist has come to prominence: the wind engineer. As towers grow taller, they climb into more powerful winds, and lighter construction techniques can leave them more vulnerable. Developers have begun putting up very slender skyscrapers, like 432 Park Avenue in New York, and these are particularly sensitive to the aerial environment. When a wind engineer like Kelly looks at such a building, he understands that it is airborne, with one end pinned to underlying bedrock, the rest riding the winds of Manhattan.Kelly is a principal at RWDI, one of North America\u2019s top wind consultants. The company\u2019s client list includes 432 Park Avenue and 111 West 57th Street, a 1,428-foot skyscraper set to be among the slimmest in the world. (Imagine a one-foot ruler, stood on end and stretched to roughly twice its height.) When testing shows too much sway in an initial design, a near certainty with slender supertalls, RWDI offers a \u201cshaping workshop.\u201d The architect, developer and engineer make the trek from their home metropolis to the company\u2019s headquarters in Guelph, Ontario, with dibs for the day on a wind-test tunnel and a cadre of model makers so that ideas can be tried in the tunnel and improved upon. The goal is to find ways that the building might, as these specialists say, \u201cconfuse the wind.\u201d Designers of airplane wings want a smooth rush of air, to generate lift; designers of buildings want to divide the wind and leave it in disarray.Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, at 2,717 feet the planet\u2019s tallest man-made structure, is asymmetrical, winding down from the top in a series of steps, like an expanding spiral staircase. The crosswind effect depends on a building\u2019s width, and so at each level on the Burj, the wind beats at a different frequency: confused and frustrated, like a toddler kicking wildly on a swing that won\u2019t get going. Another favorite weapon of wind confusion, seen on many skyscrapers, is cut corners, which disrupt suction forces along the side. Pinnacles and antennas are subjected to the kind of scrutiny given America\u2019s Cup yachts. In the case of 432 Park Avenue, the design team used five gap layers, each two floors in height, where the facade opens to allow air to pass through, sapping vortices. These horizontal bands give the tower a visual rhythm, but they are there because of the wind. In the natural world, wind sculpts sand dunes and cuts the snow, carving rings where it has whipped around a tree. It leaves its marks on buildings too.If shaping and structural tweaks reach their limit, engineers can reduce motion further by installing \u201ctuned mass dampers\u201d near the apex. One version consists of an enormous mass on a suspension system with pistons that resist the mass\u2019s movement. The damper acts as a pendulum, but set just off the building\u2019s natural frequency, meaning that whenever the tower lurches, the mass drags, out of sync, steadying it. The 1,667-foot Taipei 101 is damped with a 728-ton ball that does double duty as a tourist attraction. From the observation deck, the ball appears to swing in heavy winds, though actually the tourists are also in motion.Hidden at 432 Park Avenue, some 1,300 tons of combined mass stroke away on two dampers. The building\u2019s engineer, Silvian Marcus, the U.S.A. director of building structures at WSP/Parsons Brinckerhoff, visited one of the top floors with a group and asked if anyone felt anything. No, they said. He rested a laser pointer on the floor, aimed it up and stood back. The dot wandered as the tower flexed. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s unbelievable; we feel nothing,\u2019\u2009\u201d Marcus told me. With high-end damping, most people will not sense motion in normal weather. For supertall residential skyscrapers, tuned mass dampers are the rare luxury amenities that go unseen.Very tall buildings are a recent invention, and the public has not yet developed an intuitive sense for them. \u201cWe still have this innate understanding that a building we enter will remain stationary,\u201d says Melissa Burton, the global head of civil structures for BMT Fluid Mechanics. \u201cIt scares us when it moves.\u201d You can choose to make a home in the clouds, comfortably isolated from the elements, but you can never escape the wind. The walls, and everything they contain, will always be in motion. Most of the time, this will fall beneath your notice. Yet someday a storm will come, the wind will riot and you will feel its touch. \u2666Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.Photographs by Matthew PillsburyPhotographs by Thomas StruthThomas Struth is a photographer based in Germany who often examines the relationships between people and their modern environments. His photographs have been shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Museo del Prado in Madrid and others.By Taffy Brodesser-AknerJimmy Chin wasn\u2019t all that concerned with safety, to be honest; he was more concerned about the unknowns of rigging the first shots. He wanted to convey the \u201cairiness\u201d of being up that high; he wanted to convey the awe he knew that he would feel \u2014 the awe that motivates everything he does, whether photographing free climbers in Yosemite for National Geographic or dangling from unclimbed sandstone towers in Chad. He was mostly thinking that shooting straight down the spire \u201cmight not give you a sense of the actual spire,\u201d and how can you show how big the world is from up there with just one shot? He wanted the camera to swing out a little, and he was thinking of the best ways to do that. He settled on a long monopod, a six-foot pole, and that\u2019s about all he could think about. He had returned from China a few days before, coming home jet-lagged from another big shoot. The safety issue felt like a nonissue to him. This guy was part of the first ascent of the sharkfin at Meru, in the Himalayas. He skied from the summit of Everest. He\u2019d never climbed a skyscraper, but 1,776 feet in the air is nothing for him; 1,776 is usually what he calls a good start. And anyway, he had his very own safety liaison.All the time Walsh was lecturing, and during the entire six hours they were up there together, Chin was thinking what a good teacher Walsh must have been, back in Walsh\u2019s previous life, at that Philadelphia public school. But the school district was a mess, Walsh says, and when he was laid off four years ago, he didn\u2019t look very hard for another teaching job. A relative told him about FallProof, a company that teaches fall prevention, to head off lawsuits (and falls).Chin couldn\u2019t help noticing how patient Walsh was, how they seemed to speak the same language despite having such extraordinarily different backgrounds. For a minute, Chin could imagine Walsh doing both things, the climbing and the teaching. You know that old physics theory about a multiverse? In which there are infinite numbers of concurrent universes for every moment of the past and present and future? In the multiverse, there stands Jamison Walsh, patiently teaching the special-needs population of the city, and there is Chin skiing down Everest right this minute, every minute, thinking that that is probably the craziest thing he will ever do.This wasn\u2019t Walsh\u2019s first time up the spire; it wasn\u2019t even his second. The other times, he was on the clock for safety checks and needed to just get the job done \u2014 making sure the ladders and all the fall protection were in \u201ctiptop shape\u201d for the people who would be climbing later to service the weather barometers and the beacon for airspace, and eventually the array of antennas for local television that will be installed this summer, antennas similar to the ones that used to be on the World Trade Center. But this time, up there for hours with the sole purpose of letting the time pass, letting the light change and the clouds move for Chin\u2019s camera, he was able to really contemplate it, you know?They grew chatty over the hours. Walsh asked Chin about Everest, the only mountain he\u2019d heard of that Chin had climbed and photographed. Walsh told Chin about the rooftop he\u2019d recently been on in York, Penn., how he could see the mountains around him. They talked about the view from nearly 1,776 feet. They high-fived about what giants they were. Walsh tried to FaceTime with his poor wife, who gets nervous about what he does, who sighs with relief every time he walks through the door at the end of the day. \u201cWe\u2019re up here!\u201d he said into the camera. Chin will tell you that Walsh seemed a little giddy up there. The excitement took Walsh by surprise. \u201cIt was undescribable,\u201d Walsh said. Yes, being a safety liaison is mostly just a regular job, but sometimes regular jobs can burst your heart.There they hung, harnessed King Kongs, dangling off the building. As late afternoon descended and Chin\u2019s shutter clicked, Walsh watched the city, trying to wrap his head around the beauty of it. \u201cIt\u2019s simply whatever God produced,\u201d he said, trying to convey what it was like. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d He looked over at the Statue of Liberty, which was ant-size, and he looked over at Jersey City, for God produced Jersey City as well, and he watched the sunset. He thought about Sept. 11 up there. How could you not? At the base of the spire, construction workers had graffitied memoria for those they lost in the attack into the steel. Far down below were the footprints of the old towers and the reflecting pools, and people surrounding them at all hours, paying respects, wondering how we\u2019ve moved on so quickly that right next door there\u2019s a new tower now, taller even. If you were to believe in a multiverse, you could imagine that somewhere in a parallel universe, the people in the twin towers are still there doing their jobs as on any given day, scurrying through the halls with their papers and their tasks, at their terminals. But if you believe in a multiverse, you could also imagine that day when the people descended suddenly and unwillingly, how they jumped and fell \u2014 that day is happening on a loop forever, too. One World Trade Center rose up in spite of all that happened, and in our audacity or our hubris, we\u2019re going higher. As Walsh says, business is good.You couldn\u2019t even see them from the ground that spring day, Walsh and Chin. The sky darkened, and the city lit up, and Walsh looked up past Chin, past the crow\u2019s nest, and saw that there was not much left to go before the climb was complete. Eventually they came down off the spire, and they both signed the base. That night, Chin went to get a cheeseburger, something he can never do in the Himalayas. And that night, Walsh took the train back to Pennsylvania, and he walked through the door of his home once again, and his wife sighed relief and asked him about his day. \u2666By Sam AndersonWe want to see.What do we want to see?A large part of what we want to see, it turns out, is ourselves seeing.The photographer Brian Finke captured people capturing people \u2014 themselves and others \u2014 on top of New York\u2019s highest public observation decks: the Empire State Building, Top of the Rock and One World Observatory. Together, these skyscrapers attract around 10 million tourists a year. They are spikes of capitalist triumph: symbols of wealth, strength, power, transcendence.But humans are sensitive creatures. Even though these platforms are not, in the grand scheme of things, all that high \u2014 850 feet, 1,250 feet \u2014 the air is measurably thinner up there. Our lungs have to work a tiny bit harder to smuggle oxygen into our bloodstreams. We know, viscerally, that we\u2019re unlikely to survive a fall from such an inhuman height. It is both terrifying and giddy. We feel we are standing, temporarily, in a band of the sky; we are only visitors in this elevated realm, and won\u2019t stay long. Still, we reach up higher. We hold our cameras out at arm\u2019s length, or even beyond arm\u2019s length with selfie sticks, straining for every last inch of perspective, so that in the resulting photo, right there in the foreground of the panoramic expanse (the park, the river, the rival skyscrapers, the harbor), is the familiar spectacle of us: our Hawaiian shirts, our sunglasses, our babies packed snugly into their elephant-print slings, our tender, terrestrial faces. \u2666Design: Gail Bichler, Matt Willey.

{"Headline": "The Muslim Silence on Gay Rights", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAn Afghan-American Muslim walks into a gay club in Florida on Latin night during Pride Month. In my dreams, that is the beginning of another great story of remix, tolerance and coexistence that is possible only in America. In reality, it\u2019s the start of a nightmare massacre fueled by hatred and perpetrated by a man from a group already scarred by a generation of suspicion and surveillance.Whether Omar Mateen was a militant fighter financed by the Islamic State, a self-radicalized extremist or a lone wolf psychopath with a gun license, the distinction for committing the worst mass shooting in our history now belongs to an American Muslim.After the attacks in Orlando early Sunday morning, many of my American Muslim friends began posting messages on Facebook about how frustrating it felt to go from the affirming images of the late Muhammad Ali to news of yet another terrorist attack. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent us,\u201d many wrote. \u201cHe can\u2019t call himself a Muslim.\u201d For many American Muslims, this kind of immediate condemnation and social media activism has become the first step in our symbiotic relationship with the news cycle. As the history of fellow minorities has taught us, retaliatory violence, exclusion and even internment are always possible in the American family and it\u2019s best to try to get ahead of the curve.But in this moment of hashtag solidarity, I hope we can also have some tough conversations about our limits. Accompanying those posts, I saw many gestures of solidarity and sympathy for the L.G.B.T. community. But behind those posts is a history of silence on gay rights.For eight years, I was an editor and producer for NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201d It seemed as if each week featured an example of \u201cMuslim\u201d violence and with it an opportunity to bring more nuanced perspectives and context to the discussion. Through highlighting the voices of Muslim reformists and liberals, I felt optimistic about a generation that could bridge our widening divisions. But in my personal life, I was struggling in isolation with how to reconcile my own faith with my sexuality.We must stand up against the anti-Muslim responses that come so easily in this current political climate. But for Muslims, this is also a moment to reflect more deeply on how we feel about living in a country where gay rights are central, where marriage equality is real and coexistence is the only way forward.As I look at his narcissistic selfies and brooding poses on the cable news loop, I don\u2019t know if Omar Mateen was mentally ill or just emotionally unhinged. I don\u2019t know if it was the sight of two gay men kissing that infuriated him to the point of massacre. What I do know is that there will be more dark days to come if we don\u2019t build the psychological, political and spiritual space within our communities to embrace the remixes that are possible only in this country.Bilal Qureshi is a former editor and producer for NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Panama Papers Show How Rich United States Clients Hid Millions Abroad", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byOver the years, William R. Ponsoldt had earned tens of millions of dollars building a string of successful companies. He had renovated apartment buildings in the New York City area. Bred Arabian horses. Run a yacht club in the Bahamas, a rock quarry in Michigan, an auto-parts company in Canada, even a multibillion-dollar hedge fund.\u201cHe is the manager of one of the richest hedge funds in the world,\u201d a lawyer at Mossack Fonseca wrote when the firm was introduced to Mr. Ponsoldt in 2004. \u201cPrimary objective is to maintain the utmost confidentiality and ideally to open bank accounts without disclosing his name as a private person.\u201dIn summary, the firm explained: \u201cHe needs asset protection schemes, which we are trying to sell him.\u201dThus began a relationship that would last at least through 2015 as Mossack Fonseca managed eight shell companies and a foundation on the family\u2019s behalf, moving at least $134 million through seven banks in six countries \u2014 little of which could be traced directly to Mr. Ponsoldt or his children.How the Panama-based law firm set up offshore corporations, foundations and bank accounts for wealthy clients.In recent weeks, the papers\u2019 revelations about Mossack Fonseca\u2019s international clientele have shaken the financial world. The Times\u2019s examination of the files found that Mossack Fonseca also had at least 2,400 United States-based clients over the past decade, and set up at least 2,800 companies on their behalf in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the Seychelles and other jurisdictions that specialize in helping hide wealth.Many of these transactions were legal; there are legitimate reasons to create offshore accounts, particularly when setting up a business overseas or buying real estate in a foreign country.But the documents \u2014 confidential emails, copies of passports, ledgers of bank transactions and even the various code names used to refer to clients \u2014 show that the firm did much more than simply create offshore shell companies and accounts. For many of its American clients, Mossack Fonseca offered a how-to guide of sorts on skirting or evading United States tax and financial disclosure laws.These included locating an individual from a \u201ctax-convenient\u201d jurisdiction to be the straw man owner of an offshore account, concealing the true American owner, or encouraging one client it knew was a United States resident to use his foreign passports to open accounts offshore, again to avoid scrutiny from regulators, the documents show.If the compliance department at one foreign bank contacted by Mossack Fonseca on behalf of its clients started to ask too many questions about who owned the account, the firm simply turned to other, less inquisitive banks.And even though the law firm said publicly that it would not work with clients convicted of crimes or whose financial activities raised \u201cred flags,\u201d several individuals in the United States with criminal records were able to turn to Mossack Fonseca to open new companies offshore, the documents show.Experts in federal tax law, money laundering and offshore accounts \u2014 asked by The Times to examine certain documents or at least to identify legal issues raised by the money management techniques that Mossack Fonseca advocated \u2014 said the law firm at times had come up with creative, but apparently legal, strategies to save clients money. A common tactic: selling real estate as a shift of corporate assets, instead of as a piece of property subject to transfer taxes.While the experts were reluctant to declare that the law firm or its clients had broken any laws given that no charges have been filed, they said they were surprised at how explicitly Mossack Fonseca had offered advice that appeared carefully crafted to help its clients evade United States tax laws.But presented with summaries of several cases by The Times, Mossack Fonseca did not try to explain its actions. It simply said that its standards had improved in recent years, as rules internationally had tightened.But the services offered by Mossack Fonseca, with 500 employees in more than 30 offices worldwide, were in high demand by the rich and famous in the United States.A spokesman for Mr. Weill said the accounts were used for legitimate purposes, and \u201cappropriate disclosures were filed.\u201d Mr. Akridge and Mr. Soriano did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The family of William R. Ponsoldt of Florida was one of Mossack Fonseca's most important clients in the United States. Here is a look at the firm's work, and the legal issues raised. Family members declined repeated requests for comment.For its best customers, like the Ponsoldts, who declined repeated requests to discuss their work with Mossack Fonseca, the firm\u2019s ministrations went far beyond legal services and banking. It acted as a concierge for \u201call details regarding your properties and worldwide business affairs,\u201d for example, helping the family confidentially purchase (and dispose of) luxury condominiums at resort destinations and even arranging repairs for a car stored at a vacation home and hiring a contractor to fix broken poolside tiles, the documents show.\u201cYou deserve the best Mr. Ponsoldt, and we will try to help you the most we can,\u201d the firm explained in an email.The firm\u2019s American clients often expressed disbelief at how much they could lighten their tax burden by using the techniques advocated by Mossack Fonseca.\u201cAt hearing that he can make nearly $8 million per year just on tax savings,\u201d a client from Pennsylvania \u201cwas now wide awaken,\u201d a Mossack Fonseca staff member wrote. \u201cI could even detect sweats coming down from his forehead and his cheeks were beginning to blush with crimson excitement. Noticing his interest, I went in for the kill.\u201d\u201cHow does a US citizen legally get funds to Panama without the knowledge of the US government and how can those funds be profitably invested without the US government knowing about them?\u201dThe reply came from Rams\u00e9s Owens, then a partner who helped run the firm\u2019s trust division, offering clients \u201ceffective solutions to enhance your privacy, protect your wealth.\u201d Mr. Owens laid out a basic menu of services: a package deal setting up an offshore company in what he promised would be a relatively cheap and quick transaction.\u201cWe have right now a special offer by which we create a Private Foundation/company combination for a flat fee of US$4,500.00,\u201d Mr. Owens said. \u201cIt includes Charter Documents, Regulations, nominee officers and directors, bank account and management of funds, provision of authorized signatories, neutral phone and fax numbers and mail forwarding services for both the private foundation and its underlying company.\u201dWith this legal structure in place, Mr. Owens went on to explain, any money placed in these accounts would essentially go into a black hole.The benefits of such an arrangement were numerous, he added, detailing how the client could effectively evade United States tax laws while protecting himself \u2014 and the firm.\u201cAny decision you make, please be aware that you will have to sign a \u2018disclaimer\u2019 to us. We can only \u2018suggest,\u2019 but the final decision to take the money out of the country is fully yours, and under the professional opinion of someone in USA.\u201dThis was the sort of menu sold to the Ponsoldt family \u2014 in a very big way.William Ponsoldt, now 74, had come to Mossack Fonseca with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the firm\u2019s staff estimated in \u201cdue diligence\u201d memos that also laid out how he had become so wealthy.\u201cHe has started off in the 70ties purchasing run-down apartment buildings in New York, in order to refurbish and sell them off,\u201d noted one memo from 2007, shortly after the firm had started to handle the family\u2019s investment accounts. \u201cHaving done this for a while he spread out to various businesses and his CV is the typical profile of a serial entrepreneur.\u201d The memo went on to list nine businesses he had created, taken over or helped run, including Glas Aire Industries Group, an automotive parts supplier; Zeus Energy Resources, a Texas oil-drilling company; Regency Affiliates, which owned a Michigan rock mine; and Pegasus Ranch, one of the country\u2019s largest Arabian-horse-breeding operations.Few American clients, the records show, demanded and received as much attention as Mr. Ponsoldt and two of his children, Tracey and Christopher, each of whom was assigned a secret email account and a code name \u2014 \u201cfather,\u201d \u201cdaughter\u201d and \u201cson.\u201d Mossack Fonseca\u2019s \u201cV.I.P. service\u201d consisted of everything from securing lunch reservations at a popular French bistro in Panama City to pressing the government to make an exception and grant Mr. Ponsoldt and his wife Panamanian passports.Mossack Fonseca employees were named as the companies\u2019 officers, avoiding whenever possible any link to the Ponsoldt family. The firm even asked a Hong Kong branch of Barclays, the international bank, to override its rules for proof of the so-called beneficial owners of the accounts.The most important part of this elaborate structure was an entity called the Edenstone Foundation.In secret meetings documented in the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca named the Ponsoldt family as the beneficiary, through the foundation, of the money placed in bank accounts around the world.Among the early requests: confidentially transfer $800,000 from \u201cfather\u201d to \u201cson,\u201d meaning moving the money to yet another offshore account \u2014 called LBFH of Panama \u2014 which Mossack Fonseca had set up on Christopher Ponsoldt\u2019s behalf with bank accounts in Andorra and Panama.One motivation for Christopher Ponsoldt to stash money overseas in accounts not traceable to him: He owned a dirt racetrack in Florida, and he was concerned racers \u201cmay get hurt and might then try to sue him for damages,\u201d the law firm notes on his case file said.Mossack Fonseca agreed to \u201cprepare a service agreement\u201d between two of the legal entities it managed for the family, to make it look as if there were an actual expenditure of money for a business purpose.\u201cThis is one way in which people with a lot of money step away from being average,\u201d Mr. Blum said after reviewing the documents.Christopher Ponsoldt declined to comment. \u201cI am sorry, I can\u2019t help you,\u201d he said before hanging up.Tracey Ponsoldt Powers, William Ponsoldt\u2019s daughter, approached the firm in October 2008 with an urgent request for help in secretly moving some of her family\u2019s money to Panama and then into gold coins. She feared political developments at home.Mr. Owens suggested shifting the money into a \u201ccharity\u201d account, controlled by the firm on the family\u2019s behalf, in increments of less than $100,000, so it would not be detected.The subsequent series of complicated transfers \u2014 money from the account would eventually be used by Mossack Fonseca in 2013 at Ms. Powers\u2019s request to buy real estate \u2014 would be a challenge for American enforcement authorities, Mr. Blum said.\u201cSimply by constructing all this in such a complex way, they make it extremely hard for enforcement officials to ever have resources to reconstruct what taxes should have been paid,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this is all about is obscuring the trail.\u201dMs. Powers did not respond to a series of calls and emails, and then declined to answer questions when reached on a cellphone.\u201cI have no idea what you are talking about,\u201d she said before hanging up.Across the United States, Mossack Fonseca picked up clients who had similarly urgent and delicate demands.For more than 30 years as the founder of Boston Capital Ventures, Harald Joachim von der Goltz has built a reputation as a savvy investor in emerging companies.What few know, however, is that over roughly that same span of time and with the help of Mossack Fonseca, Mr. von der Goltz has also come to command a vast offshore empire: interconnected corporations, foundations and bank accounts with about $70 million in assets, according to internal emails.Harald Joachim von der Goltz has been been a longtime client of Mossack Fonseca. The following documents illustrate how Mossack Fonseca established accounts using Mr. von der Goltz's Guatemalan nationality and passport.A lawyer for Mr. von der Goltz said the beneficial owner of all of the trusts and accounts is Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s 100-year-old mother, who resides in Guatemala. One document also suggests that the tens of millions of dollars in the accounts originally came from businesses operated by Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s father.But numerous other documents prepared by Mossack Fonseca and signed by Mr. von der Goltz list him as the founder, manager and \u201cfirst beneficiary\u201d of the foundation that controls most of the family\u2019s wealth. Mr. von der Goltz also put assets from companies he helped operate into the accounts, documents show.Most important, Mossack Fonseca registered Mr. von der Goltz as a resident of Guatemala, which tax experts said could help him protect the family money from certain United States tax obligations.The firm recognized that claiming the Guatemala residency represented a risk, but considered it a risk worth taking, given Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s importance to the firm.\u201cMy suggestion: Leave everything as it is with von der Goltz, i.e. stay and live this potential risk, we might prefer to send money orders and cashier\u2019s checks, which have a slightly lower risk than bank transfers. It\u2019s all well done, customer understands well and accepts it as is,\u201d Mr. Owens wrote.\u201cI agree with your suggestion on my part,\u201d responded Ram\u00f3n Fonseca, one of the firm\u2019s founders.Money was frequently transferred from several of the offshore accounts to accounts in the United States to fund investments at Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s firm, the documents show. A foundation paid for his daughter\u2019s education, as well as his granddaughter\u2019s high school tuition.In a 2008 email, Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s Boston-based accountant asked executives at Mossack Fonseca to wire money from Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s mother, Erika.\u201cErika would like to make a gift to Tica of $100,000 for his birthday. She hadn\u2019t given him anything,\u201d the email said, providing an account for Mr. von der Goltz at Esp\u00edrito Santo Bank in Miami.\u201cOhh, yes, I know ERIKA wants it to be done quickly, we will proceed,\u201d Mr. Owens responded before confirming that the money should be moved as requested.Legal experts consulted by The Times said it was difficult to determine definitively if the arrangements related to Mr. von der Goltz violated United States laws. But they said such moves were commonly used by investors seeking to hide their assets and evade federal taxes.\u201cThere is reason to question if she was really directing that shift of money,\u201d Mr. Blum said, referring to Mr. von der Goltz\u2019s mother.In a statement, Mr. von der Goltz said the companies were established for legal purposes, and that both he and the companies were compliant with United States tax and reporting requirements.\u201cThere has never been any illegal activity associated with these companies,\u201d the statement said.Other case files examined by The Times show how Mossack Fonseca may have turned a blind eye in the vetting process while helping Kjell Gunnar Finstad, a Texas resident, set up an oil company offshore in 2013.Mossack Fonseca has long maintained that it will not work for individuals with criminal records or whose conduct raises \u201cred flags\u201d during its due-diligence process. But the firm somehow either missed or overlooked Mr. Finstad\u2019s past when it conducted a background search of potential directors for the new offshore oil company, OK Terra Energy, which was run out of Houston but registered in the British Virgin Islands.Three years earlier, Mr. Finstad, the company\u2019s controlling partner and lead investor, had been convicted in Norway for various breaches of securities and accounting laws involving a company called Norex Group. The case was major news in Norway.The records examined by The Times show that Mossack Fonseca collected a copy of Mr. Finstad\u2019s passport, and conducted a basic internet search and a cursory background check. But there is no mention of the fraud case, and no discussion of whether to proceed with setting up the new company, in light of Mr. Finstad\u2019s involvement.Reached at his office in Texas and asked about the Panama Papers, Mr. Finstad said only, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201dFor another client, Mossack Fonseca offered a special service for a premium price.Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca lawyer, again offered a solution.Mossack Fonseca would locate what he called a \u201cnatural person nominee\u201d in a \u201ctax-convenient\u201d jurisdiction to stand in for Ms. Olszewski as the owner of the account.\u201cThe Natural Person Trustee is a service which is very sensitive,\u201d Mr. Owens wrote. \u201cWe need to hire the Natural Person Nominee, pay him, make him sign lots of documents to cover us, make him sign resignations, make him get some proofs evidencing that he has the economic capacity to place such amount of moneys, letters of reference, proof of domicile, etc., etc.\u201d The process, he suggested, would cost her at least $17,500.Ms. Olszewski approved the maneuver \u2014 only to see the firm, at one point, accidentally disclose her name to the banks involved.\u201cRamses, Please call me ASAP!! This is important!!!!\u201d she wrote to Mr. Owens. \u201cHSBC said someone said marianna olszewski is the principal / beneficary! Who has done this!! I need you to call me immediately and tell them hsbc that was a mistake!!!!!!!!!! This is not good and I asked you NOT to do this! this is why we have this structure.\u201dMr. Owens sought to calm her down, saying that Mossack Fonseca could tell the bank that the natural person nominee actually controlled the account. \u201cThis can be solved,\u201d he wrote.Twelve days later, Mr. Owens sent HSBC a copy of a passport for a man named Edmund James Ward.The $1 million from Ms. Olszewski was then transferred to the new accounts, with an assurance that she need not worry.Marianna Olszewski wanted to shift $1 million from an account in Guernsey to a new overseas account. In these documents, the law firm Mossack Fonseca offers to find a \"natural person nominee\" in a \"tax-convenient\" jurisdiction to stand in as the owner of the account.Many of the client files \u2014 like those for Mr. Weill, the banker; Mr. Soriano, the ballplayer; and Mr. Akridge, the developer \u2014 contain little information on the purpose of the offshore accounts, or how they were used after they were set up, making it impossible, based on the records available, to assess whether they were used legitimately.But the experts who reviewed some of the documents related to the Ponsoldts, Mr. von der Goltz and Ms. Olszewski said that the firm itself seemed to realize it was taking risks.\u201cThey were not always sure themselves which side of the line they were on at any given moment,\u201d said Ross S. Delston, a former federal banking regulator who now specializes in combating money-laundering efforts. \u201cIt is apparent that members of the firm were aware they were treading very close to the line.\u201dIn 2013, Mossack Fonseca advised Ms. Olszewski to seek outside counsel and consider reporting herself to the I.R.S., warning of possible \u201csevere\u201d repercussions if she did not. The warning came in the wake of a Justice Department investigation of the role that certain Swiss banks had played in helping United States citizens evade federal taxes.Records show that Mossack Fonseca had been paid at least $102,000 over nine years to help Ms. Olszewski handle various transactions.Ms. Olszewski took the firm\u2019s advice, and belatedly disclosed her accounts to the I.R.S., the documents show. And by 2014, she asked Mossack Fonseca to shut down her accounts and offshore entities, which collectively held at least $1.7 million.\u201cI\u2019m in complete compliance with all my U.S. tax and reporting requirements,\u201d Ms. Olszewski said in an emailed statement when The Times asked about the accounts.Reached by telephone in late May, Mr. Owens, who is no longer with the law firm, said only, \u201cRegretfully, I cannot speak about individual clients or my time at Mossack Fonseca.\u201dMossack Fonseca sent a series of similar and increasingly dire warnings to the Ponsoldts in 2013 and 2014, telling them that they had to provide a Swiss bank with documentation that they had paid all required United States taxes \u2014 or face possible investigation.The records examined by The Times give no indication whether the Ponsoldts complied, and family members would not say when asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d Christopher Ponsoldt said in a second brief conversation before he again hung up.Mike McIntire contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Justices Decline to Hear Case Limiting Debt Collectors", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byThe Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a case that could undermine the ability of some lenders to charge high interest rates.The decision not to review a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit keeps intact a decision that directly affects only a narrow slice of the finance industry, namely debt collectors.But banking lawyers and lobbyists say the case, if applied more broadly, could wreak havoc on credit cards, student loans and other types of consumer lending.The case involves the National Bank Act that exempts national banks from various state laws limiting the interest rates lenders can charge. The federal law allows banks to follow the usury laws of whichever state they are in and then \u201cexport\u201d that rate to borrowers living in other states. Unsurprisingly, many banks have located their lending operations in states that permit lenders to charge the highest rates.In this case, the Second Circuit ruled in May 2015 that when the debt collector, Midland Funding, bought soured loans from Bank of America, it was not exempt from state interest rate caps, known as usury laws.Because Midland is not a bank, the company does not qualify for exemption from various state usury laws, the appeals court ruled.The borrower in the case, Saliha Madden, argued that Midland could not collect the 27 percent interest rate on her credit card because it exceeded the rate caps in her home state, New York.The ruling was a blow to the debt-buying industry, where companies like Midland buy up tens of millions of dollars of overdue debt from banks for pennies on the dollar. The debt buyers then seek to recover \u2014 often through aggressive legal maneuvers \u2014 a portion of the delinquent debt that the bank had essentially given up collecting on.At the same time, the ruling is a victory for consumers looking to fend off debt collectors in states with strict limits on interest rates, and it could embolden more challenges to the industry in other parts of the country.Some industry officials have warned that the appeals court ruling could upset the securitization market, where billions of dollars of credit cards and auto loan debt is originated by national banks but then sold to nonbanks. They ostensibly would have to honor each of the 50 state\u2019s usury laws.But lawyers who have studied the ruling say its reach is limited. It would probably not apply, for instance, to credit cards because even when this debt is bundled and sold to nonbank investors as part of securitizations, the bank still maintains a relationship with the borrower.Because of this continuing relationship, financial lawyers interpret the ruling to mean that the original interest rate that the bank charged on the credit card can still apply even after the debt is sold. In contrast, in the Madden case, the bank no longer has a relationship with the borrower after selling off the loan for collection.The ruling by the Second Circuit applies only to borrowers in the three states covered by that Appeals Court: New York, Connecticut and Vermont. But lawyers worry that consumers could mount similar challenges in other parts of the country.\u201cIt is not the end of the world,\u201d said David Luigs, co-head of the consumer finance practice at Debevoise & Plimpton. \u201cBut the principle that was applied suggests a big problem. If extended, it could massively impact the ability of banks to lend nationwide.\u201dOne industry that analysts say is particularly vulnerable to the ruling is online lending.Companies like LendingClub and Prosper broker loans through a bank and then promptly sell them to hedge funds, pensions and individuals. LendingClub, for example, issues its loans through WebBank, which is in Utah, a state with permissive interest rate laws.Analysts have warned that the Madden decision could force marketplace lenders to dial back the high-interest rates on certain loans that they had already sold to investors, creating a logistical headache and reputational issue.On Monday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said the Supreme Court decision not to review the case was \u201cgenerally credit negative for marketplace loans.\u201d The analysts noted that some \u201cmarket participants are already restricting their exposure to potentially usurious loans\u201d in New York, Connecticut and Vermont.In a statement, LendingClub said it was confident that \u201cfacts of the case do not directly apply to our business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Plan for the Financial World? Cross Your Fingers", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byAmong those who manage gobs of money, the possibility that Britain might actually disavow the European Union seemed until recently like a remote and even outlandish possibility.But about a week before voters go to the polls to determine their future, masters of finance are suddenly absorbing the prospect that Britain might really walk, unleashing anxiety and uncertainty throughout the global economy.Angst has seeped into the calculations. As investors digest the possibility that the largest marketplace on earth may be days away from a messy alteration, they have been yanking money out of riskier storehouses like stocks and putting it into safer instruments like bonds. The British pound and London stocks have been falling in frenzied trading.The conversation is now focused on managing the risks of Brexit. The trouble is that the worries are so diffuse and rife with unknowns that any attack plan amounts to an exercise in guesswork and hope. Executives, bankers and bureaucrats are grappling with something that could be minor or momentous and has never happened before.Maybe the Brexit \u2014 for British exit \u2014 would merely lop value from the pound before traders turned their attention to a more consequential plot twist elsewhere. Perhaps it would inspire separatist movements from Scotland to Spain, embolden anti-trade populists across the Continent and reinvigorate existential questions gnawing at the common euro currency. That could sow fear across world markets.A Brexit might spook investors into entrusting their money only to the safest repositories like American Treasuries. That could strengthen the American dollar and weaken American exports, while starving riskier emerging markets of investment.Whatever stories policy makers and businesspeople tell themselves, the only certainty is a surplus of uncertainty. Whatever provisional plans they sketch, they will find themselves mostly just wishing that nothing terrible happens.\u201cOn the financial markets, there is nothing they can do; it will just hit them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf my house is going to catch on fire, I can plan to have some water on hand, but there\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d\u201cThat kind of threw the cat among the pigeons and panicked everyone,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, a London company that manages foreign exchange for multinationals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pickup in client hedging.\u201dA company that, say, imports goods from China to sell in Britain fears that the pound is about to drop, making those Chinese goods more expensive. So it buys contracts that essentially lock in today\u2019s exchange rate for the future.According to Laurence Wormald, head of research at FIS, which provides technology and market intelligence to financial services companies, British stocks would most likely fall 15 percent after a Brexit, with the pound dropping by a similar proportion.If a Brexit vote hurts the British economy, the central bank might feel compelled to lower rates to motivate businesses and households to borrow and spend. But the bank might well do the opposite, raising rates to stop a currency slide.The most nettlesome variable may be trade. Britain sells nearly half its exports within the European Union. Multinational corporations have set up headquarters in Britain, using those bases to serve customers across the Continent.Those campaigning for a Brexit assure that a vote to leave would change nothing right away. Britain would remain a fully fledged member of Europe\u2019s marketplace for two years as it negotiated a new arrangement with the 27 remaining members of the union.Britain will hold a referendum on Thursday on whether to leave the European Union, a decision nicknamed \u201cBrexit.\u201dBut if Britain failed to secure a deal, commerce with Europe could be governed by the terms of the World Trade Organization, which gives member nations the authority to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports.The debate over the Brexit is full of references to sundry alternative models. Norway enjoys access to the European market although it remains outside the union. Switzerland has achieved similar status through a thicket of treaties. But in both cases, they must accept something supporters of Brexit want to eliminate \u2014 European rules that allow people to move liberally from country to country.Those urging a Brexit insist Britain can negotiate a tailor-made deal. Many economists describe that notion as somewhere between fanciful and delusional. Eager to discourage other members from considering an exit, Europe would seek to ensure that Britain paid a price.If Britain dumps Europe, \u201cthey are not going to say, \u2018Well, O.K., here\u2019s a good deal,\u2019\u201d said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London.Nowhere are preparations more intense than in finance. London has parlayed expertise in banking and inclusion in Europe to secure dominance over large areas of trading. As the referendum approaches, financiers are now consumed by a jigsaw puzzle of diabolical complexity: They are mapping out what assets they hold and where, seeking to anticipate what jurisdictions and rules might apply post-Brexit.\u201cInvestment banks and asset managers are pre-booking law firms, consulting firms and accounting firms for July,\u201d said William Wright, managing director of New Financial, a research institution in London. \u201cIf we do vote to leave on June 23, no one is going to have the faintest idea what impact it will have.\u201dIf the sun rises on June 24 with Britain on its way out, such a shift could happen sooner rather than later. At a time of crippling uncertainty, banks would feel a compulsion to at least eliminate variables by quickly announcing their plans, moving people within the European Union \u2014 to Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris.In the end, contingency plans may be devised more as salves for frayed nerves than bona fide operational blueprints. Britain may be on the verge of refashioning the world map. If that happens, the vote will set off proceedings so complex that the only guaranteed winners are the lawyers.All plans will be subject to change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Panel Recommends Censure of I.R.S. Commissioner", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A polarized House committee on Wednesday recommended that the House censure the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, John A. Koskinen, and seek to strip him of his office and his federal pension for \u201ca pattern of conduct\u201d that betrayed the trust of Congress and the public.Censure by the House would be the first step, supporters say, yet its impact will probably be limited to political symbolism. The Senate, also run by Republicans, is not expected to follow suit, or to support impeachment. It is unclear when the full House might act on the censure resolution, said aides to House Republican leaders, who are unenthusiastic about the effort against the commissioner.The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted 23 to 15 for his censure, with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed, after hours of exchanging condemnation and praise for Mr. Koskinen.The roots of the case against him go back to May 2013, when Republicans alleged that a politically motivated I.R.S. subjected Tea Party groups to unfair scrutiny as they sought tax-exempt status. Mr. Koskinen was hired in late 2013 to steady the agency and restore confidence, after the events in question. Republicans charge that he was complicit in the destruction of I.R.S. emails pertinent to the alleged targeting, and that he lied about the emails in testimony to Congress.Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the oversight committee, said that Mr. Koskinen delayed at least two months in telling Congress two years ago, in June 2014, that pertinent emails had been among those routinely destroyed at the I.R.S.\u2019s West Virginia office. \u201cAnd then he lied to us, under oath,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said, about what emails he would produce.Since then, Mr. Chaffetz said, \u201cMr. Koskinen has never made an attempt to clarify or amend any of his prior statements.\u201dWhile he said the commissioner should be impeached \u2014 next week the House Judiciary Committee will hold a second hearing on that \u2014 \u201ccensure is a helpful first step.\u201d\u201cWe owe it to the American people to ensure government officials are held accountable for misconduct,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said. \u201cWhen there is a duly issued subpoena, you have to comply with it. When you come to Congress, you must testify truthfully. If you find later that there has been a mistake in your testimony, you need to come and explain that and correct the record.\u201dThe Democratic minority put up a vigorous if doomed defense, led by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior party member on the committee. He called the case against the commissioner \u201cbogus\u201d and \u201ca travesty.\u201d\u201cJohn Koskinen is an honorable man,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cThis 76-year-old gentleman came out of retirement to take on the difficult and thankless job.\u201dMr. Cummings told Mr. Chaffetz: \u201cYour core accusation against the commissioner is that he was deceitful and that he misled the Congress, but you completely disregard the difference between a misstatement and a lie.\u201dMr. Cummings also quoted praise for Mr. Koskinen from Senator Orrin G.

The two bring experience in the media industry to the company: Mr. Rogers is the chairman of TiVo and the former head of NBC\u2019s cable division; Mr. Ratner is the vice chairman of Cablevision and the former chief of the Madison Square Garden Company.What drew both men to the eight-year-old WinView, they said in an interview, was the potential of the company to serve as a new platform for advertising tied to live sports, drawing on the sort of \u201csecond-screen\u201d phenomenon that is part of Twitter\u2019s appeal.The basic idea of WinView is relatively simple: Users challenge each other on various aspects of a live game using the company\u2019s smartphone app, ranging from a father taking on his daughter during a quarter of an N.F.L. game to a group of friends setting up a league tournament.It is a system that the two men said has already taken hold in Europe, where such synchronized competitions have overtaken daily fantasy sports in popularity.Underpinning the company are what Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ratner said were 26 key patents that cover running an online competition at the same time as a game.Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ratner were quick to dismiss any comparisons, noting that WinView for now was free to play and would \u2014 at least initially \u2014 draw its revenue from advertising. (They conceded that in Europe, WinView\u2019s counterpart operates largely as a pay-to-play system.)And they added that the various competitions that could run on WinView require far less of the sometimes arcane details and knowledge that populate daily fantasy sites.\u201cThis is free to play,\u201d Mr. Ratner said. \u201cThis is a far broader audience than a fantasy sports audience. This is for anyone who wants to play.\u201dAs part of the announcement, WinView said that it would officially open for business in the United States this fall, coinciding with the start of the professional football season.Both men said that they viewed the service as a way to tap into audiences that have grown to shun commercials \u2014 something that Mr. Rogers said he has long observed during his tenure at TiVo.\u201cAdvertisers are having a hard time reaching millennials,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cThis has created what we think is a huge advertising opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And so far on Friday, there have been some gut-wrenching moves in global markets.The British pound plunged to a level not seen in decades. The decline briefly meant that the British economy was smaller than France\u2019s, when measured in dollar terms.Italy\u2019s stock market was down more than 10 percent, and France\u2019s was off over 8 percent.The selling hit Japan, where stocks closed down nearly 8 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 459 points, or 2.55 percent, in late morning trading.Investors sought safety in government bonds. The yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond dropped into negative territory. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)The yield on the United States 10-year note also sank, to 1.53 percent, after overnight trading that was eight times its normal volume, according to FTN Financial.The question now is how much more conditions could change in the next days and weeks. At times like this, it makes sense to focus on areas where the global financial system seems most vulnerable.In Europe, that means searching the markets for indications that investors are starting to bet that the European Union will fracture further.Worrying? Sure.Still, it\u2019s important to remember that the European Central Bank has in the past acted boldly to head off adverse movements in bond markets. And on Friday, it said in a news release that it would \u201ccontinue to fulfill its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area.\u201dInvestors, policy makers and countries face a messy breakup with vast financial, economic and political implications.Europe\u2019s other weak point is its banking system. Much of the selling involved Britain\u2019s financial giants. Shares in Barclays, which has large trading operations, and which hoovered up much of Lehman Brothers after it crashed, had shed a fifth of its value on Friday. But Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, also plummeted \u2014 by 14 percent.At times like this, what really matters is whether banks can raise short-term money to finance their operations. The Bank of England said in a statement on Friday that it would make 250 billion pounds available to banks, and said it could provide \u201csubstantial liquidity in foreign currency.\u201dThe financial system overhauls introduced in the United States and Europe since the 2008 crisis, and the willingness to provide emergency support to the banks right now, will most likely stop the financial system from imploding.But a deeper test is whether the overhaul \u2014 which forced banks to have higher levels of capital and retain more liquid cash \u2014 has put the banks in a position in which they can continue lending to the real economy during this period of pervasive uncertainty. The Bank of England on Friday underscored that hope in its statement. \u201cThis substantial capital and huge liquidity gives banks the flexibility they need to continue to lend to U.K. businesses and households, even during challenging times,\u201d it said.One other thing to consider amid this selling and gloom: There is an optimistic scenario. Britain and Europe may work out a peaceful divorce, and Europe\u2019s policy makers may be able to stop the departure from deepening the Continent\u2019s economic problems. The economic pain in Britain may deter other countries from seeking to leave, or they may have votes and decide to stay.People who have bet on the world ending in recent years have lost a lot of money. But be very open to the notion that Brexit could be the event that finally makes them rich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Many Lives of a New York S.R.O.", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported by\u201cBefore, I had to get fully dressed just to use the bathroom on the floor,\u201d said Charlene Saliski, a 60-year-old former home health aide who has lived in the building for six years with her longhaired Chihuahua, Princess Sofia, and her tabby, Prince George. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the building, proud of where I live now.\u201dMs. Saliski found herself at the Capitol Hall after the death of her partner from lung cancer; the loss of his income meant she could no longer afford the $1,000 rent on her apartment in East New York, Brooklyn. Another Capitol Hall tenant, Eddie A. Ortiz, 49, a freelance hairdresser, has depression and supports himself with a city stipend for H.I.V.-positive individuals. He settled in a year and a half ago after periods of boarding with his mother, who has cancer, and at a Manhattan homeless shelter. He has outfitted his room with furniture discarded on sidewalks but with a few touches of the interior decorator he once was \u2014 a zebra rug and posters of Isadora Duncan and the Rat Pack.It may be a conceit, but I like to think of such tenants as refugees of a sort, finding havens from life\u2019s vagaries and mishaps. The hotel once housed literal refugees, including my family.I was 5 years old in 1950 when after a voyage on a Merchant Marine ship across the Atlantic, my parents, Marcus and Rachel Berger, survivors of the Holocaust whose Polish hometowns had been destroyed; my 3-year-old brother, Josh; and I moved into a single room in the Capitol Hall, subsidized by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.We lived there for several weeks, and my memories of that time are spare \u2014 a dark, dusty, oppressive room, walks along Broadway where we encountered other war refugees living in S.R.O. hotels, and a fistfight between my father and a man who came to kick us out of the hotel after the immigrant aid payments ended. But the Capitol Hall gave us a foothold in the country and introduced us to the cosmopolitan pleasures of the West Side, a neighborhood we were to live in for most of the next five years.The Capitol Hall has also given a foothold to Ms. Saliski and Mr. Ortiz as well as to thousands of migrants from the hinterlands. According to a history provided by organizers of the celebration held on May 24, it started life in 1913 as an apartment building with four apartments per floor. By the early 1940s the building\u2019s owners found it more profitable to cut up the apartments into narrow hotel rooms that would house the vigorous young workers flocking to New York for jobs in the wartime mobilization.In the 1950s, the Capitol Hall and scores of other hotels like the Marseilles and the Whitehall housed war refugees and, later, solitary elderly men and women, disabled people and mental patients released from state psychiatric hospitals. By the 1970s, during the city\u2019s economic downturn and near-bankruptcy, the term S.R.O. had acquired a sinister overtone, with many hotels filling up with drug dealers, prostitutes and released convicts who would frighten other tenants trying to scratch out a living and would disturb their neighbors with drunken brawls. One nearby hotel, the Endicott, was the site of several murders.By the 1980s, a wave of gentrification had spread across the brownstones and apartment houses, and hotels like the Endicott were converted to luxury co-ops. But some West 87th Street residents, among them Mig Boyle, a former tenant organizer, and her late husband, Robert Hoyt, the founder of the National Catholic Reporter newspaper, and Eric and Gillian Rosenfeld, wanted to preserve the diversity they had come to prize. They also realized that throwing the hotel\u2019s tenants out would increase the neighborhood\u2019s street homelessness.In the late 1970s, the West 87th Street 100 Block Association had arranged for social services to be provided in the hotel. They invited hotel tenants to take part in the block\u2019s annual pumpkin festival and help with spring plantings. \u201cWe got to know all the people in the hotel,\u201d Ms. Boyle said. \u201cWe totally lost the idea of us and them.\u201dWhen the landlord decided to convert the building, Ms. Boyle urged her neighbors: \u201cLet\u2019s buy it.\u201d\u201cMig comes up with these big plans and often they work out,\u201d said Mr. Rosenfeld, a lawyer, chuckling.Despite opposition from some block residents, they brought in Goddard Riverside, a neighborhood social services organization, which steered them to the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit that specialized in packaging financing for low-income housing. After a complicated struggle, financing was arranged through several government agencies and donations from foundations and private individuals. One donor was the socialite Brooke Astor, who toured the building and gave $100,000.In the three decades since, the building\u2019s upkeep and oversight have sometimes been challenging, mostly because money has been hard to come by. Ms. Saliski said that when she first moved in, the building seemed dilapidated in places. There were also complaints from neighbors of loud televisions and occasional thefts.The renovation, started in 2013, was complicated because Goddard Riverside wanted to displace no more than one-third of the tenants at a time and temporarily shelter them in other subsidized housing. Among the improvements made: A courtyard used for storing garbage was converted into a community room. Along with the physical renovation, social workers were added and weekly visits by nurse practitioners started. The renovation was paid for with a combination of city bond financing and low-income housing tax credits. Most tenants receive support from the federal Section 8 rent program; while rooms rent for $900, the tenants pay no more than one-third of their income.Projects like the Capitol Hall, said Mr. Russo, provided a model for other \u201cpermanent supported housing\u201d projects.\u201cRather than saying, \u2018Not in my backyard,\u2019 they said, \u2018Yes on my block!\u2019\u201d he said of the residents of West 87th Street.Advertisement"}

Dell had looked to sell the businesses in part to help raise cash to support its debt-heavy takeover of EMC Software, which faces a vote by EMC shareholders next month.Elliott has dabbled in private equity before, but in small ways. The hedge fund has offered to buy companies like Novell during activist campaigns, though largely as a tactic to try to prod those businesses into putting themselves up for sale.

{"Headline": "Smaller Chips May Depend on Vacuum Tube Technology", "Date": "2016-06-05", "News": "Supported byPASADENA, Calif. \u2014 The future of computing may be in its past.The silicon transistor, the tiny switch that is the building block of modern microelectronics, replaced the vacuum tube in many consumer products in the 1970s. Now as shrinking transistors to even more Lilliputian dimensions is becoming vastly more challenging, the vacuum tube may be on the verge of a comeback.In a darkened laboratory here, two stories beneath the California Institute of Technology campus, two students stare through the walls of a thick plastic vacuum chamber at what they hope will be the next small thing \u2014 a computer chip made from circuits like vacuum tubes whose dimensions are each roughly one-thousandth the size of a red blood cell.At stake is the future of what electronic engineers call scaling, the ability to continue to shrink the size of electronic circuits, which is becoming harder to do as they become as small as viruses.It has been more than half a century since the physicist Richard Feynman predicted the rise of microelectronics, noting \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of room at the bottom.\u201d He used the phrase in 1959 when he speculated about engineering with individual atoms. Several years later, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, wrote that the number of transistors that could be etched into silicon wafers would double at regular intervals for the foreseeable future.The last time researchers explored vacuum tubes was in the 1990s, when they were a promising option for building flat-panel displays. The technology failed to take off, however, because of cheaper and more efficient liquid crystal displays.\u201cThe vacuum tube comes back about every decade,\u201d Dr. Scherer said with a laugh.And for decades, that has been the story of vacuum tubes: There has always been a better option. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes because they were more compact, did not generate skin-burning heat and did not need a vacuum \u2014 the absence of atmosphere made it possible for electrons to jump between positively and negatively charged elements.The vacuum tubes the Caltech researchers are looking at are nothing like the bulky objects that hummed in the old family radio and even early computers. Both transistors and vacuum tubes \u2014 the British called the devices valves \u2014 control the flow of electricity, but they do so differently.The researchers have created a tiny tube formed from metal and capable of turning on and off the flow of electrons between four even smaller probes, which under an electron microscope appear like the tips of four ballpoint pens almost touching one another.The Achilles\u2019 heel of today\u2019s transistors is the smaller they get, the more they leak electrons. In modern computer chips, as much as half of the power consumed is lost to electrons leaking from transistors that are only dozens of atoms wide. Those electrons waste energy and generate heat.In contrast, Dr. Scherer\u2019s miniature vacuum tube switches perform a jujitsu move by using the same mechanism that causes leakage in transistors \u2014 known by physicists as quantum tunneling \u2014 to switch on and off the flow of electrons without leakage. As a result, he believes that modern vacuum tube circuits have the potential to use less power and work faster than today\u2019s transistor-based chips.\u201cEffects that are currently problems in scaling are precisely those that we would like to use for switching in these next-generation devices,\u201d Dr. Scherer said, noting that while there are efforts to redesign semiconductor-based transistors around the tunneling effect, his approach is significantly simpler.Vacuum tubes are one of a range of ideas that engineers are looking at as they work to create chips that can do more while using less power. Other promising approaches include exotic materials such as carbon nanotubes and even microscopic mechanical switches that can be opened and closed just like an electronic gate.The Caltech researchers returned to the idea of vacuum tubes several years ago after they had begun experimenting with the idea of making ultrasmall incandescent light bulbs no larger than a modern transistor that would be bright enough to be seen by the naked eye from across a room.The group previously worked in research areas like quantum dots, nanoscale structures now used in television displays to produce precise colors, and optoelectronics, a field that explores the use of lasers in electronic circuits. But they decided to look for new research areas that were less crowded with competitors.Today, semiconductor companies like Intel are making silicon chips with minimum dimensions between 10 and 20 nanometers. (A strand of DNA is roughly 2.5 nanometers in diameter.) Once the industry shrinks below 10 nanometers, Dr. Scherer expects that researchers will be surprised by the behavior of silicon at such atomic dimensions.For one thing, silicon emits light below 10 nanometers, he said. More significantly, it also becomes remarkably elastic as it becomes that small.\u201cIt\u2019s a different material, and it gives you this different behavior,\u201d he said. He sees the future in other materials and in old ideas that would be made new again.In contrast to silicon, a semiconductor, which can either conduct or insulate, depending on how it is chemically modified, Dr. Scherer\u2019s tubes can be made from a range of conducting metals, such as tungsten, molybdenum, gold and platinum. This will be an advantage because it will significantly simplify the tiny switches at the atomic scale.Dr. Scherer does not think the tiny tube will immediately replace the transistor, but the possibility of applications in space and aviation has caught the attention of Boeing, which is financing the research. Such specialty chips might be ready commercially before the end of the decade.\u201cTen years ago, silicon transistors could meet all of our demands,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next decade, that will no longer be true.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tighter Rules on Money Transfers Put Squeeze on Businesses", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byFor years, Fernando Lopez\u2019s storefront money-transfer business in Atlantic City was a place where local residents could wire money to family and friends abroad. But that business, Interamericana Express, which handled a lot of transmittals to Mexico, is dwindling as banks and regulators take a stricter view of cross-border money transfers.Mr. Lopez\u2019s business accounts have been closed several times in recent years by three different banks over money-laundering concerns despite his state license, hours of compliance training and binders full of rules and regulations. Since being dropped by the banks, he has operated his money-transfer business as an agent of MoneyGram International and Ria Money Transfer, depositing transfers in accounts at those companies. Banks will not take any of his money-transfer business directly.Frustrated, he is trying to convert his shop, which also offers notary and bill payment services, into a by-the-pound parcel shipping center. The banks don\u2019t see a small business with a money-transfer operation \u201cin a good way,\u201d Mr. Lopez said.\u201cWe comply with all the regulations. We have to follow the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want to deal with us.\u201dBanks are refusing to do business with money transmitters, closing or freezing their accounts over concerns about money laundering and extra regulatory scrutiny.The affected businesses include mom-and-pop convenience stores such as Mr. Lopez\u2019s, potentially limiting options for the millions of people living in the United States who want to send money home or forcing them to send cash, which is risky. Over one-quarter of American households rely on nonbank financial institutions, including money transmitters, for everyday banking needs, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\u201cLarge banks are just walking away from the business completely,\u201d said Peter Ohser, an executive vice president of MoneyGram International in Dallas, one of the two biggest transmitters next to Western Union.AmeriMex Communications, a Roswell, Ga., company that sells cellphone minutes to people in the United States to give to family or friends in Mexico, has started to work with some convenience store owners on a prepay basis because many are also money-transfer agents and their bank accounts have been frozen, according to Don Aldridge, the chief executive of AmeriMex.Convenience stores that handle remittances need an account to deposit the cash. Because it is nearly impossible for banks to know the identity of the final customer in a money transfer, remittance companies and their agents are being categorized as a high risk for money laundering and denied banking services. \u201cWe are part of the collateral damage,\u201d Mr. Aldridge said.He added he had considered buying three convenience stores in the Atlanta area and getting a money-transferring license, but he was told by his bank \u2014 First Citizens Bank in Raleigh, N.C. \u2014 that it would no longer be able to work with him if the stores were transferring money abroad.A spokeswoman for First Citizens Bank, Barbara Thompson, said that she was not aware of Mr. Aldridge\u2019s experience and that the bank did provide services to money-transfer companies that were registered with state and federal authorities.Wells Fargo is one bank that still offers services to money-transfer companies and their agents who send money from the United States to Mexico. But the bank provides such services only to companies or agents with which it has a relationship, and it puts them through tougher checks than it does with other customers, a bank spokesman said.A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment. JPMorgan and Citigroup did not respond to questions about their policy toward money-transfer companies and agents.Regulators are aware of the problems that money transmitters are facing; they say the situation is part of a wider trend of banks closing potentially risky accounts because of the costs of monitoring and compliance.\u201cAmong other factors, accounts may be dropped for very legitimate reasons, including suspicions of illicit activity or account holders not having the appropriate controls in place,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. \u201cThe fact that, over the same time period, the overall level of U.S.-to-Mexico remittances appears to be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants \u2014 which would not be a bad thing.\u201d\u201cWhat you don\u2019t see behind the scenes is that prices are going up,\u201d said Mr. Ohser of MoneyGram. A lack of banks willing to provide account services to any business that is transferring money to Mexico is causing friction and leading to increased costs, Mr. Ohser said.Regulators say they are growing concerned that people will resort to sending cash across the border, which is harder to track and riskier. \u201cMoney transmitters going out of business could lead remittance senders to use informal methods that are less detectable,\u201d according to a Government Accountability Office report published in January this year.Armored cars and courier services taking currency across the border have drawn the attention of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, which last year began investigating an increase in suspicious dollar currency shipments. FinCen investigators, along with Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have since tightened monitoring of border cash transit.The Treasury Department is working closely with Mexican authorities to address the difficulties that money-service businesses on both sides of the border are facing, Mr. Glaser said. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for us that remittance channels remain open.\u201dVarious international organizations are also working on efforts to help the money-transfer industry get access to banks. The Financial Stability Board in Switzerland has been coordinating those efforts, since noting that the trend of banks withdrawing services to other banks \u2014 known as correspondent banking \u2014 \u201chas the potential to rise to a systemic issue.\u201dOpinions are not changing quickly enough for people like Mr. Lopez, however. He worries his accounts at Ria and MoneyGram could be closed, too. \u201cThat would be devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason I\u2019m trying to expand my shipping business.

Elections for the next legislative session will be held in September, and the arrest comes about a month before the start of nominations.Mr. Leung, 60, said in a post on Facebook that commission officials came to his home about 6:30 a.m. on Thursday. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear in district court on Friday for a procedural hearing.Regarding the money, Mr. Leung said by telephone on Thursday afternoon, \u201cI gave to the party, to a publishing house, I can\u2019t recollect the memory, but I need to talk to a lawyer and defend myself now.\u201d He said he could not discuss the matter further because he had not yet talked to his lawyer.He pointed out that the charges came just ahead of nominations for election to the Legislative Council. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a smear, you know,\u201d he said.\u201cI said before, if the government wants to press charges to anyone, they are capable,\u201d he added.In an earlier post on Facebook, he wrote, \u201cHe who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick.\u201dMr. Simon, in an email, said, \u201cLegislator Leung is a uniquely positive presence in Hong Kong, and so as I have no idea what this is all about, it\u2019s best, for this rare occasion, I keep my usually wide-open mouth closed.\u201d He added that he had not been contacted by the anticorruption council.Legislative rules require lawmakers to declare donations within two weeks, and Mr. Leung has previously been cleared of wrongdoing in relation to other payments that were not immediately reported.According to a statement he made to a commission of lawmakers investigating the earlier donations, Mr. Leung admitted to receiving about $64,000 from Mr. Lai in 2013 on behalf of the League of Social Democrats, a party with which he is affiliated.Mr. Leung contended that he had received the cash from Mr. Lai on behalf of the party, not in his capacity as a lawmaker. Last December, the committee sided with Mr. Leung in saying that he had not violated the legislature\u2019s rules.Mr. Leung has declared receiving donations totaling about $115,000 in the current legislative session, which began in 2012, according to the legislature\u2019s records.Other lawmakers have declared the receipt of donations from Mr. Lai since at least 2007, according to the legislature\u2019s records.Charlotte Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angelo Mozilo Will Not Face U.S. Charges for Mortgage Fraud", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byThe Justice Department\u2019s pursuit of Angelo R. Mozilo, one of Wall Street\u2019s most recognizable names tied to the subprime mortgage crisis, is ending with a whimper.After dropping a criminal investigation of Mr. Mozilo earlier, federal prosecutors recently decided against filing a civil fraud case against him, his lawyer, David Siegel, confirmed on Friday.Prosecutors in Los Angeles, in coordination with those at the Justice Department in Washington, spent more than two years reviewing the merits of pursuing a civil fraud case against Mr. Mozilo, a co-founder of Countrywide Financial, which was one of the largest originators of subprime mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis.Mr. Mozilo, 77, and several other former Countrywide executives received letters in the last few weeks from federal prosecutors notifying them that the prosecutors had officially ended an investigation into the sale of billions of dollars of mortgages to home buyers with questionable credit histories, Mr. Siegel said. He added his client was \u201cpleased to see the investigation concluded.\u201dThe decision by federal prosecutors to not proceed with a civil fraud case under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act is not too surprising, given the length of the review process.The possibility of the Justice Department filing a so-called Firrea lawsuit against Mr. Mozilo came to light when Bank of America reached a $16.65 billion settlement of its own Firrea case in August 2014. The inquiry by the Justice Department of Mr. Mozilo was seen by some legal critics as a way for prosecutors to address complaints that little had been done to hold individuals accountable for the financial crisis.Bank of America acquired Countrywide and assumed its liabilities in 2008, as the financial crisis erupted.Over the last few years, federal prosecutors used the threat of a Firrea civil fraud lawsuit to extract tens of billions of dollars in settlements from other big banks. The law proved to a be a useful tool for prosecutors because of its 10-year statute of limitations for bringing a case \u2014 much longer than the standard three- or five-year statute of limitations for most civil fraud lawsuits.In the past, the Justice Department had used the potential of filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Mr. Mozilo as the basis for denying Freedom of Information Act requests seeking details about the decision by Los Angeles prosecutors to drop their criminal investigation into Countrywide and Mr. Mozilo.Presumably, it will now be possible for those who want to learn more about the aborted criminal investigation to seek information from the government.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Starts Summer Push With Crippling Money Deficit", "Date": "2016-06-20", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump enters the general election campaign laboring under the worst financial and organizational disadvantage of any major party nominee in recent history, placing both his candidacy and his party in political peril.Mr. Trump began June with just $1.3 million in cash on hand, a figure more typical for a campaign for the House of Representatives than the White House. He trailed Hillary Clinton, who raised more than $28 million in May, by more than $41 million, according to reports filed late Monday night with the Federal Election Commission.The Trump campaign has not aired a television advertisement since he effectively secured the nomination in May and has not booked any advertising for the summer or fall. Mrs. Clinton and her allies spent nearly $26 million on advertising in June alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, pummeling Mr. Trump over his temperament, his statements and his mocking of a disabled reporter. The only sustained reply, aside from Mr. Trump\u2019s gibes at rallies and on Twitter, has come from a pair of groups that spent less than $2 million combined.Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising for May reflects his lag in assembling the core of a national finance team. In the same month that he clinched the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump raised just $3.1 million and was forced to lend himself $2 million to meet costs. Some invitations to Trump fund-raising events have featured the same short list of national Republican finance volunteers regardless of what city the event is held in, suggesting Mr. Trump has had some trouble lining up local co-hosts.A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an inquiry about the campaign\u2019s spending plans. During an interview on Monday on CNN, Mr. Lewandowski defended the candidate\u2019s bare-bones approach.\u201cWe are leaner, meaner, more efficient, more effective. Get bigger crowds. Get better coverage,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cIf this was the business world, people would be commending Mr. Trump for the way he\u2019s run this campaign.\u201dBut the shortfall is leaving Mr. Trump extraordinarily dependent on the Republican National Committee, which has seen record fund-raising this campaign cycle and, long before Mr. Trump even declared his upstart candidacy, had begun investing heavily in a long-range plan to bolster the party\u2019s technical and organizational capacity.In a first for a major party nominee, Mr. Trump has suggested he will leave the crucial task of field organizing in swing states to the Republican National Committee, which typically relies on the party\u2019s nominee to help fund, direct and staff national Republican political efforts. His decision threatens to leave the party with significant shortfalls of money and manpower: On Monday, the party reported raising $13 million during May, about a third of the money it raised in May 2012, when Mitt Romney led the ticket.\u201cIt\u2019s like a waterfall,\u201d said Brian O. Walsh, a Republican campaign strategist. \u201cThere are things that have to happen, and someone has to pay for them.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s cash crunch marks a stark reversal from the 2012 presidential campaign, which seemed to inaugurate a new era of virtually unlimited money in American politics, buoyed by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision two years earlier. By the same point that year, President Obama and Mr. Romney were raising tens of millions of dollars per month with their parties. And while Mr. Romney faced a larger deficit overall against Mr. Obama in June 2012, he was raising far more money than Mr. Trump is now, with big donors flocking to his cause.\u201cThe campaign has got to be the entity that\u2019s out there driving the fund-raising car,\u201d said Austin Barbour, a lobbyist who served as national finance co-chairman of the Romney campaign. \u201cAnd it better be a big old Cadillac.\u201dMr. Trump has defied conventional wisdom before, clinching the Republican nomination with a small organization and modest outlays on television. And Republican officials believe they are well prepared to compensate for Mr. Trump\u2019s late start. The Republican National Committee has more than 500 field staff members on the ground in swing states, far more than in 2012, and a robust digital and data operation.Allies of Mr. Trump say they believe the tide is already turning. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will appear at a high-dollar fund-raiser in New York City hosted by some of the most prominent names on Wall Street.Fund-raisers for Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said they were now hoping to raise up to $500 million in joint efforts with the Republican National Committee, or an average of $100 million a month from June through October. He is now reliably raising between $5 million and $7 million in each city where he raises money, those donors said.A joint fund-raising effort with Mr. Trump and 11 state Republican parties yielded the Republican National Committee $3 million in just five days at the end of May. Some of the largest checks came from a handful of wealthy Trump supporters who are not party mainstays, suggesting Mr. Trump could tap new sources of campaign money.But Mr. Romney was also backed by expansive network of deep-pocketed \u201csuper PACs\u201d and other outside groups that collectively spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to elect him. This year, the Democrats are leading in outside money. Priorities USA Action, a group focused on advertising in support of Mrs. Clinton, announced on Monday that it had raised $12 million in May and had $52 million on hand \u2014 a huge reserve.The outside spending effort to help Mr. Trump, by contrast, has been chaotic and underfunded, hampered by a profusion of competing groups, one of which has spent only $1 million so far on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.The most prominent group, Great America, is advised by Ed Rollins, who managed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 campaign, and other more seasoned Republican operatives. But it, too, has had difficulty persuading big donors: On Monday, it reported raising just $1.4 million during the month of May.Fund-raising efforts for Mr. Trump have been hampered by the candidate\u2019s own erratic public comments. He has repeatedly said he will pay for his own campaign even as his volunteers fan out around the country to solicit six-figure checks, confusing allies and potential donors alike.\u201cTwo days ago, he said, \u2018I may fund it myself,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rollins said. \u201cDonors are all being cautious about what\u2019s going to happen here.\u201dAgustin Armendariz and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

This plan may well join the long list of reform promises Mr. Cuomo has made, largely without effect, since he took office in 2011.But there is, of course, an ethical elephant-in-the-room. It doesn\u2019t take a cynic to notice that the governor has long failed to deliver on a full slate of ethics reforms. There are spending loopholes to close and outside incomes to limit and corrupt pols\u2019 pensions to seize.

Citizens United is not nearly as big a problem in New York State as Mr. Cuomo says it is, because state campaign finance laws are so loose, the opportunities for lavish spending so broad.

{"Headline": "Ruling on Dell Buyout May Not Be the Precedent That Some Fear", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorFor a $24.9 billion deal, it is a piddling sum: an extra $24.7 million plus about $12 million in interest.Much of the criticism has centered on the fact that the Delaware judge \u2014 in deciding that the fair value of Dell shares was $17.62 a share, far above the $13.65 paid by the buyout consortium led by the company\u2019s founder, Michael S. Dell \u2014 found that there was no significant fault with the conduct of the company\u2019s directors and that no other bidder had emerged for Dell shares.So should we be worried that this decision will change buyouts?The answer is probably no, because of the deeply weird nature of appraisal and this case.First, let\u2019s keep in mind how small the outcome of this case was. Some 20 Dell shareholders are entitled to an additional $37 million.The ruling came in an appraisal rights proceeding. In such a proceeding, shareholders of a company are allowed to go to court and argue that they were not paid fair value for their shares in the acquisition. The different amount is based on the court\u2019s determination of whether the acquisition price was the fair value of the shares.Under the arcane laws of appraisal, only Dell\u2019s shareholders who voted against this acquisition and properly exercised appraisal rights will get the extra amount. (Some shareholders\u2019 cases, including T. Rowe Price, which would have received over $200 million, were thrown out on procedural grounds.)The purpose of appraisal rights is not to say what the company\u2019s market price should have been. Appraisal is about giving shareholders a remedy if they think the negotiated deal price is just not good enough.Appraisal is thus about finding a judicially determined \u201cfair value\u201d \u2014 the standard the court determines whether to award more money to a dissenting shareholder. The terms \u201cmarket price\u201d and \u201cfair value\u201d can have different meanings, and fair value is not necessarily the price paid in the market.This difference is at the heart of the dispute over this decision and highlights the battle going on over appraisal rights themselves. Courts are struggling to figure out what \u201cfair value\u201d is in light of the emergence of hedge funds specializing in exercising appraisal rights.Historically, appraisal proceedings were reduced to a corporate finance exercise as each party hired an expert to value the company using discounted cash flow and other methodologies.What is a judge, who is not an expert in valuations, to do?Frustration in recent years over this battle of the experts has led Delaware courts to change how they calculate appraisal prices.Instead of simply having to puzzle through conflicting expert opinions, judges have in recent cases looked to the merger price to determine if the price was fair. So long as the price paid was negotiated through an arm\u2019s-length process, the court deemed this to be fair value. The underlying assumption of course was that the fairly bargained market price was fair value.To be fair, however, the Dell board did later bend over backward to try to get things right.Vice Chancellor Laster also asserted that because the pricing was based on a leveraged buyout model, it was not a market price. That model is one where the buyer\u2019s price is based on what it thinks its returns will be and is used by private equity firms. In this situation, a private equity firm would pay only what would produce a targeted rate of return.This is not quite so neat in the real world, but the use of a leveraged buyout model to price this transaction led the judge to determine that the market price was not a reliable one, because it showed merely the price the private equity firm could pay, not one that was \u201cfair value.\u201d In contrast, Vice Chancellor Laster argued that a strategic acquirer, a competitor of Dell, for example, would pay what the company was worth, closer to fair value.Because the buyout price was not a good one to determine fair value, the judge instead conducted an old-style appraisal proceeding where he used a discounted cash flow analysis to compute \u201cfair value\u201d using the expert opinions. Discounted cash flow analysis is a financial technique that values the future revenue streams of the company to determine an investment\u2019s potential. This type of analysis involves numerous estimates including what the company will earn in the future.A different result was thus inevitable, and that is how the court got to $17.65 a share.The decision highlights the problems with appraisal generally. Judges are being forced to apply a law and to value companies based on a notion of fair value that is uncertain at best.As a result, the Dell case is unlikely to be a game changer. The market price is likely to continue to be the price used because it is so difficult to compute \u201cfair value\u201d otherwise.The opinion may affect management buyouts, but that may not be such a bad thing \u2014 forcing would-be managers to work hard to justify buying their own companies would be better for shareholders. In any case, management buyouts are rare these days; only two were proposed in 2015, according to Factset MergerMetrics.Yet there will be probably no impact outside management buyouts. Indeed, if the amount at stake in the Dell case had been more significant, I would hazard a guess that the judge just might have hesitated.In the end, I agree in large part with the critics of the Delaware ruling. They just assume that the opinion will become the norm. I don\u2019t think so for the reasons above.But let\u2019s keep one goal in mind about this decision and its ruling. If appraisal isn\u2019t there to serve as a check on management \u2014 or to be something more than the acquisition price \u2014 what is it good for? Not much.An article on the DealBook page on Wednesday about a Delaware judge\u2019s ruling that the 2013 buyout of Dell shortchanged shareholders misstated part of the name of the opinion arm of Bloomberg News, one of whose contributors, Matt Levine, commented on the ruling. It is Bloomberg View, not Bloomberg Views.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An N.Y.U. Study Gone Wrong, and a Top Researcher Dismissed", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byNew York University\u2019s medical school has quietly shut down eight studies at its prominent psychiatric research center and parted ways with a top researcher after discovering a series of violations in a study of an experimental, mind-altering drug.A subsequent federal investigation found lax oversight of study participants, most of whom had serious mental issues. The Food and Drug Administration investigators also found that records had been falsified and researchers had failed to keep accurate case histories.In one of the shuttered studies, people with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress caused by childhood abuse took a relatively untested drug intended to mimic the effects of marijuana, to see if it relieved symptoms.\u201cI think their intent was good, and they were considerate to me,\u201d said one of those subjects, Diane Ruffcorn, 40, of Seattle, who said she was sexually abused as a child. \u201cBut what concerned me, I was given this drug, and all these tests, and then it was goodbye, I was on my own. There was no follow-up.\u201dAt least one trial of marijuana, and one using ecstasy, are in the works for traumatized veterans, and some psychiatrists and many patients see this work as having enormous promise to reshape and improve treatment for trauma. But obtaining approval to use the drugs in experiments is still politically sensitive. Doctors who have done studies with these drugs say that their uncertain effects on traumatic memory make close supervision during treatment essential.The New York Times pieced together details of the research and the investigation through documents, letters and emails, as well as interviews with a participant and several researchers familiar with the project.The violations \u201cjeopardize subject safety and welfare, and raise concerns about the validity and integrity of the data collected at your site,\u201d the F.D.A. said in a letter, obtained by The Times, to Dr. Alexander Neumeister, the studies\u2019 lead investigator.Dr. Charles Marmar, the chairman of the psychiatry department at N.Y.U., said that people working with Dr. Neumeister had reported concerns about the lab\u2019s compliance with research standards. Once some of those issues were confirmed, Dr. Marmar said, the university placed Dr. Neumeister on leave, \u201cand suspended all activity, suspended access to all accounts. I took control of those studies.\u201d Dr. Neumeister later submitted his resignation.Georges Lederman, a lawyer for Dr. Neumeister, said there may have been protocol violations, \u201cbut N.Y.U. has taken the position that those violations were more egregious than we believe they actually were.\u201d The issues could have been easily remedied, he said, and noted that they did not cause the sponsor of the research, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, to shut it down.Both the university and Mr. Lederman said there was no evidence that any study participant had been harmed.Pfizer said that N.Y.U. was responsible for conducting the trial, and that the company had previously tested the same drug, known as an F.A.A.H. inhibitor, for osteoarthritic pain, without significant side effects. \u201cThe safety profile we observed does not preclude future development of our compound,\u201d a Pfizer spokesman said by email.The research team decided to use a drug intended to produce some of marijuana\u2019s effects, made by Pfizer, which financed the trial. Some participants took the drug over a seven-day period; others took a placebo pill. The N.Y.U. team performed scans on each person to see whether brain activation patterns correlated with symptom relief.The study called for recruiting 50 people with a PTSD diagnosis, according to study documents. Only 14 enrolled at the N.Y.U. site, according to federal documents, and many had participated in previous studies by Dr. Neumeister. One had completed a study of another drug 16 days earlier, when the protocol called for a 30-day window, according to the F.D.A.The federal inspection, from July 16 to Aug. 5 last year, found that the research team had failed to assess at least three subjects 24 hours after they had taken the experimental drug, contrary to study protocol, according to the F.D.A. letter. In several instances, the agency found, Dr. Neumeister had falsified documents by signing a fellow investigator\u2019s name on reports. \u201cHowever, in fact, you or another study employee actually conducted these study procedures,\u201d not the colleague, the F.D.A. concluded.\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI had flashbacks, returning nightmares, every symptom coming on full force, not to mention the withdrawal. After going off and back on four or five times, I told them, \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s when she was flown to New York to enter the trial.Ms. Ruffcorn said she had several odd symptoms after the trial, including a hyper, wired sensation that occurred without the usual memories of abuse. For months, she tried to find out whether those reactions were tied to the experimental drug, but because the study was shut down and the data belonged to Pfizer, the N.Y.U. doctors could not tell her whether she\u2019d taken the drug or a placebo.Earlier this month, after much persistence, she found out that she\u2019d taken the placebo. \u201cIt was a big relief,\u201d she said.Dr. Neumeister and N.Y.U. continue to disagree over the seriousness of the research violations, both sides said. But the university has tossed out all of the data as unreliable, and tracked down the study participants to check on their health, Dr. Marmar said.\u201cI honestly believed I had the best qualified and among the most ethical researchers on the faculty\u201d running these studies, Dr. Marmar said.Advertisement"}

Sam Brownback enacted the largest tax cuts in the state\u2019s history in 2012 and 2013, a $1.1 billion upper-bracket boon for which he promised rich economic returns. But the governor and the Republican Legislature were soon shortchanging the state\u2019s public school budgets in compensation.Per-pupil state aid has declined from $4,400 to $3,800 during the Brownback years. That has forced reductions in staffing, classes and school days in the more poorly financed districts. It has also fueled the current crisis in which the public school system faces a shutdown on July 1, imposed by the State Supreme Court, unless the state government restores some of the equity it sacrificed in pursuing the trickle-down myth.Instead of abiding by the court\u2019s mandate, Mr. Brownback and the lawmakers insisted they know better than the courts on how to fund the schools, making sure not to harm the budgets of richer districts. During an earlier round of the court fight last year, Mr. Brownback and his allies enacted a retaliatory measure that threatens to strip the court system of its funding. This was a despicable low, particularly for conservative politicians promoting themselves as strict constitutionalists. Now they\u2019re denouncing \u201cactivist\u201d judges and working to replace the justices.Fortunately for Kansas, the court held fast, ruling last Friday that the latest attempt to fix the problem \u2014 a change in funding formulas to a block grant system \u2014 would create \u201cintolerable, and simply unfair, wealth-based disparities among the districts.\u201d At issue are the disparities in funding suffered by the poorest districts, four of which sued in 2010 and won their case. More money is needed from the state, perhaps $40 million to keep the schools open in the short run, according to some estimates. The larger question, which the court promises to answer at a later date, is whether the state has provided for enough total revenue to sustain a fairly funded public system.Some Republicans already are threatening to continue their defiance of the court, accusing the judges of \u201cholding children hostage.\u201d The governor accused the court of \u201cpolitical brinksmanship.\u201d But after growing protest over continuing cuts last year, he made sure there were no new ones this year.The court remains focused on the July 1 deadline, noting that \u201cpolitical necessities\u201d were not relevant to its work and neither is the success or failure of the Republicans\u2019 gamble on trickle-down policies. \u201cSimply put,\u201d the court ruled, \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s unconstitutional enactment is void; it has not performed its duty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The girls were thrown from the car and died. Neither was wearing a seatbelt. Mr. Halsell, who lives in Huntsville, was released from jail after posting $150,000 bail. The girls\u2019 father, Pernell James, 37, was treated at a hospital. (AP)Gov. Sam Brownback said Tuesday that he would call the Legislature into special session to tackle education funding and respond to a state Supreme Court order declaring that public schools might not be able to open after June. Mr. Brownback, a Republican, did not set a date for the Republican-dominated Legislature to reconvene to beat a June 30 deadline set by the court for lawmakers to fix school finances. The court last month rejected some changes in school finance laws that lawmakers had made to comply with an earlier order from the justices to improve funding for poor schools. Public schools are out for the summer, but they provide services year-round to special education students and serve meals to poor children. (AP)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Institute Offered Get-Rich Schemes With Plagiarized Lessons", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Trump also lent his name, and his credibility, to a seminar business he did not own, which was branded the Trump Institute. Its operators rented out hotel ballrooms across the country and invited people to pay up to $2,000 to come hear Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cwealth-creating secrets and strategies.\u201dAnd its customers had ample reason to ask whether they, too, had been deceived.Reality fell far short. In fact, the institute was run by a couple who had run afoul of regulators in dozens of states and had been dogged by accusations of deceptive business practices and fraud for decades. Similar complaints soon emerged about the Trump Institute.Yet there was an even more fundamental deceit to the business, unreported until now: Extensive portions of the materials that students received after paying their seminar fees, supposedly containing Mr. Trump\u2019s special wisdom, had been plagiarized from an obscure real estate manual published a decade earlier.Together, the exaggerated claims about his own role, the checkered pasts of the people with whom he went into business and the theft of intellectual property at the venture\u2019s heart all illustrate the fiction underpinning so many of Mr. Trump\u2019s licensing businesses: Putting his name on products and services \u2014 and collecting fees \u2014 was often where his actual involvement began and ended.\u201cThat Trump Institute, what criminals they are,\u201d said Carol Minto of West Haven, Conn., a retired court reporter who attended one seminar in 2009 and agreed to spend $1,997.94 to attend another before having second thoughts. She wound up requiring the help of two states\u2019 attorneys general in getting a refund. \u201cThey wanted to steal my money,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump\u2019s infomercial performance suggested he was closely overseeing the Trump Institute. \u201cPeople are loving it,\u201d he said in the program, titled \u201cThe Donald Trump Way to Wealth\u201d and staged like a talk show in front of a wildly enthusiastic audience. \u201cPeople are really doing well with it, and they\u2019re loving it.\u201d His name, picture and aphorisms like \u201cI am the American Dream, supersized version\u201d were all over the course materials.Yet while he owned 93 percent of Trump University, the Trump Institute was owned and operated by Irene and Mike Milin, a couple who had been marketing get-rich-quick courses since the 1980s.A Trump executive, Michael Sexton, told The Sacramento Bee in 2006 that there was a simple reason for going into business with the Milins: Their company was \u201cthe best in the business.\u201dYet the Milins\u2019 reputation was actually pockmarked with lawsuits and regulatory actions \u2014 a dismal track record that Mr. Trump and his aides could have unearthed with a modicum of due diligence.The Milins were known for running full-page ads that screamed \u201cFREE MONEY!\u201d and offered tutorials on how to obtain government grants and loans. They were also notorious for being frequent targets of state regulators.In 1993, the Texas attorney general accused their company, then called Information Seminars International, of taking customers\u2019 money and running. People who bought a $499 \u201cMilin Method\u201d package were promised financing to resell real estate purchased at government auctions, officials said, but when customers sought to follow up with the company, the Milins had vanished.In 2001, operating as National Grants Conference, the Milins settled with Florida authorities after being accused of violating the state\u2019s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. And in 2006, the Vermont attorney general sued the Milins for consumer fraud, ultimately fining them $65,000 and allowing customers to seek more than $325,000 in refunds.The regulatory woes continued after the Milins rebranded their seminar business with the name of the country\u2019s best-known real estate developer: In 2007, 33 state attorneys general signed a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the Milins of deceptive trade practices. A year later, their company sought bankruptcy protection, owing $2.1 million to creditors. The venture continued for a few years.Alan Garten, Mr. Trump\u2019s in-house counsel, said that executives were unaware of the Milins\u2019 history when their business relationship began but that he could not recall when they became aware of the couple\u2019s run-ins with regulators.Operating as the Trump Institute, the Milins pursued familiar tactics \u2014 and attracted familiar complaints, eventually earning an F from the Better Business Bureau.Seminar attendees who later sought assistance from supposed experts over a Trump Institute toll-free phone line complained of being told to ignore what they had been taught in the seminars because it was outdated or useless advice. \u201cThe \u2018advisers\u2019 refused to listen to us when we referred to the methods taught in the seminars,\u201d Fred and Zofia Besel, a retired couple from New York, wrote in 2009, seeking a refund in a letter that wound up with the Florida attorney general\u2019s office.Unbeknownst to customers at the time, though, even the printed materials handed out to seminar attendees were based on a lie. The Trump Institute copyrighted its publication, each page emblazoned with \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Road Map to Success,\u201d and it distributed the materials to those who attended the seminars.Yet much of the handbook\u2019s contents were lifted without attribution from an obscure how-to guide published by Success magazine in 1995 called \u201cReal Estate Mastery System.\u201dAt least 20 pages of the Trump Institute book were copied entirely or in large part from \u201cReal Estate Mastery System.\u201d Even some of its hypothetical scenarios \u2014 \u201cSeller A is asking $80,000 for a single-family residence\u201d \u2014 were repeated verbatim.Asked about the plagiarism, which was discovered by the Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d American Bridge, the editor of the Trump Institute publication, Susan G. Parker, denied responsibility and suggested that a lawyer for the Milins, who provided her with background material for the book, might have been to blame.The lawyer, Peter Hoppenfeld, who no longer represents the Milins, said Ms. Parker was most likely at fault but acknowledged forwarding her information from the Milins\u2019 office. Reached at her home in Boca Raton, Fla., Irene Milin told a reporter, \u201cI\u2019m very busy,\u201d and hung up. She did not answer subsequent calls or respond to a voice mail message.Mr. Garten said Mr. Trump was \u201cobviously\u201d not aware of the plagiarism. But even while playing down Mr. Trump\u2019s link to the Trump Institute, calling it a \u201cshort-term licensing deal,\u201d Mr. Garten expressed pride in the venture. \u201cI stand by the curriculum that was taught at both Trump University and Trump Institute,\u201d he said.Ms. Parker, a lawyer and legal writer in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said that far from being handpicked by Mr. Trump, she had been hired to write the book after responding to a Craigslist ad. She said she never spoke to Mr. Trump, let alone received guidance from him on what to write. She said she drew on her own knowledge of real estate and a speed-reading of Mr. Trump\u2019s books.Ms. Parker said she did venture to one of the Trump Institute seminars \u2014 and was appalled: The speakers came off like used-car salesmen, she said, and their advice was nothing but banalities. \u201cIt was like I was in sleaze America,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all smoke and mirrors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He would stay in a rental apartment in Manhattan and wear a GPS monitoring device. And one more thing: Mr. Zarrab would pay for 24-hour guards to ensure that he did not flee and to escort him to and from the courthouse.The request, which a judge is expected to take up on Thursday, is not as unusual as it may seem. The rich are different from everyone else, even those accused of crimes. But a handful of extremely wealthy defendants, particularly those from overseas, are testing courts by proposing to live in self-financed gilded cages while they await their fate.Prosecutors vigorously objected to Mr. Zarrab\u2019s being allowed to face trial under such conditions, telling a federal judge in Manhattan that the proposed plan would allow a rich defendant to build \u201ca personal jail for himself\u201d in a Manhattan apartment, \u201cstaffed by a firm on his payroll.\u201d\u201cZarrab\u2019s proposed bail conditions,\u201d the government said, \u201care an attempt to use his tremendous wealth to obscure the flight risk through a facade of security that is beyond the reach of all but a small subset of fabulously wealthy defendants.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has sharply disputed the government\u2019s position, saying that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Zarrab was arriving in Miami to visit Disney World with his wife and 5-year-old daughter, is devoted to his family and charitable causes and is not a threat to flee.Whether Mr. Zarrab succeeds remains to be seen, but other defendants have already been granted release on such terms.\u201cIt just reinforces for me the point that our entire system of pretrial detention is predominantly based on wealth,\u201d said Inimai M. Chettiar, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who runs an initiative to end mass incarceration.Joshua Norkin, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of New York, said the elaborate bail package that was being proposed for Mr. Zarrab and that was granted to Mr. Ng should remind judges in the state court system that they have the tools to release low-income people \u201con alternative and more creative forms of bail, and they\u2019re failing to do it.\u201dThe cases of wealthy defendants\u2019 receiving special bail conditions are not limited to international defendants.Mr. Dreier, prosecutors said, used his criminal proceeds to support a lavish lifestyle, including ownership of the apartment, property in the Hamptons, a valuable art collection and an $18 million yacht.In a written opinion, the judge in the case, Jed S. Rakoff, acknowledged concerns that such an arrangement for Mr. Dreier gave people of means \u201can opportunity for release that poorer people could never obtain.\u201dMany kinds of bail conditions favored the rich, Judge Rakoff said, and, conversely, there were many defendants who were too poor to afford even the most modest of bail bonds or financial conditions of release. \u201cThis is a serious flaw in our system,\u201d he wrote.Still, he added, \u201cit is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who, for whatever reason, can provide reasonable assurance against flight.\u201dOne unusual condition set by Judge Rakoff was that Mr. Dreier had to consent in writing to the use of \u201creasonable force\u201d by the armed guards in case he tried to flee. Mr. Dreier later was sentenced to 20 years in prison.The debate last fall over Mr. Ng\u2019s bail touched on similar issues. Mr. Ng, a Chinese real estate magnate with a net worth of about $1.8 billion, owned private airplanes and had passports from at least three countries, the government said.In a bail hearing, a prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that Mr. Ng, who has pleaded not guilty, had no family or other ties in the United States. \u201cThere is no reason for him to remain,\u201d Mr. Richenthal said. \u201cLiterally zero. Fifty-million-dollar bond is meaningless to him; $20 million is meaningless to him.\u201dThe judge, Vernon S. Broderick, ultimately ruled that there were conditions that could assure Mr. Ng\u2019s appearance in court, and, over the government\u2019s objection, granted the $50 million bail package, including home confinement with round-the-clock security, the monitoring of his phone calls and other strict conditions that he detailed in an order.The latest case involves Mr. Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that include conspiring to violate the United States sanctions on Iran. The case has been widely watched in Turkey: In 2013, Mr. Zarrab was detained by the Turkish authorities in a broad corruption investigation of businessmen with ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister and now Turkey\u2019s president.The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has asked that the judge, Richard M. Berman, deny bail to Mr. Zarrab, saying evidence of his participation in the charged offenses was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d and claiming Mr. Zarrab misled a court officer regarding his international travel and his assets.Mr. Bharara\u2019s office noted Mr. Zarrab had amassed \u201ca considerable fortune,\u201d citing evidence of his ownership in about 20 properties, seven sea vessels, 17 luxury automobiles, a private airplane and over $10 million in artwork.Mr. Zarrab\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Brafman, has argued in court papers that his client, who was born in Iran and moved to Turkey as an infant, is not a risk to flee. Mr. Brafman asked the judge not to detain his client \u201csimply because he is wealthy and lacks ties to the United States,\u201d and he argued that the bail proposal \u201cremoves any possible concern of flight.\u201d\u201cMr. Zarrab is a husband and a father who is committed to his family,\u201d Mr. Brafman wrote, \u201cand would not countenance life as a fugitive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Austria", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate18 PhotosA THREE-BEDROOM VILLA WITH LAKE VIEWS NEAR SALZBURG$2.49 MILLION (2.2 MILLION EUROS)This villa, built in 2012, overlooks the small town of Mattsee and two lakes, Mattsee and Obertrumer, in upper Austria. Situated on a third of an acre, the property is about a seven-minute walk from the shore of Lake Mattsee. With a population of roughly 3,000, Mattsee is 12 miles outside the city of Salzburg.The 4,100-square-foot, three-level home features a glass elevator and geothermal heating, as well as programmable power switches and a high-tech alarm system.The lower level is divided by a central hallway, on one side of which is an apartment with a bedroom, a kitchen and a bath. This floor also has a sauna, wardrobe areas, a storage room, a wine cellar and access to the attached two-car garage.The ground floor, which has a separate entrance, is the main living area. It has an open floor plan, nearly 10-foot ceilings, a glass front wall, a fireplace and a large terrace with an automatic awning. The kitchen cabinets are by SieMatic. A thick marble slab tops the center island. The appliances include many extras, such as a steamer, a warming drawer and a wine refrigerator.The upper level has two large bedrooms, one full and one half bath, a library and two private terraces reached by sliding glass doors.The grounds include a landscaped garden and a heated swimming pool with a counter-current system for training.The home is well suited to people who are older or have disabilities, according to a spokesman for Marlies Muhr Real Estate in Salzburg, which has the listing, as no steps are required to enter from the driveway, and all floors may be reached by way of the elevator.Mattsee\u2019s proximity to Salzburg makes it a popular recreation spot. The town of Mattsee, a two- or three-minute drive from the house, has a full array of shops and restaurants. Lake Mattsee has beaches and a sailing school and is ringed by a walking trail. Mattsee is also less than an hour\u2019s drive from Austria\u2019s official lake district, the Salzkammergut, with numerous lakes, rolling hills and soaring mountains.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Austrian housing market is quite strong, with the total number of residential property sales last year up nearly 17 percent over the previous year, according to a May analysis by the Austrian National Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2015, sales prices rose nearly 8 percent over the same period in 2014.In Vienna, what had been robust price growth slowed to about 4 percent in the fourth quarter, but since 2010, prices in the capital city have risen by more than 50 percent, lately driven by sales of new condominiums, the report said. Outside Vienna, prices have increased by 30 percent during that period.The inventory of available homes on or near major lakes tends to be very limited. \u201cMost houses are owned by families and they pass from one generation to the next,\u201d said Linda Harpham, who works with Delta Immobilien, in Bad Ischl, a spa town in the Salzkammergut. \u201cThat really stops the market moving.\u201d Supply is further limited by restrictions on new development.Properties directly on a lake \u2014 \u201cif you could get something at all\u201d \u2014 typically start at 750,000 euros to 1 million euros, or around $848,000 to $1.13 million, she said.WHO BUYS IN AUSTRIAForeign buyers are usually looking for either a holiday retreat or a place to retire, Ms. Harpham said. British buyers have traditionally made up the largest share of foreign buyers in Austria\u2019s lake areas. But over the last five years or so, those areas have begun to attract more Eastern European buyers, including Hungarians, Czechs and Russians, who \u201cview Austria very much as a safe haven,\u201d because of its stable home values, she said.The foreign buyer mix is even more diverse in \u201csuper prime\u201d markets like Vienna, which is lately attracting more buyers from the Middle East, Switzerland, the United States and Hong Kong, according to Richard Buxbaum, the head of residential marketing for the Otto Immobilien Gruppe, a real estate firm based in Vienna.BUYING BASICSEach of Austria\u2019s nine Bundesl\u00e4nder, or provinces, has different regulations governing what can be built and how it may be used. Buyers should be aware that not all properties may be used as holiday homes, but instead must be permanent residences. (This Mattsee property is currently used as a second home, and may continue to be, according to the Muhr agency.)There are additional restrictions on buyers from outside the European Union. These buyers must apply for a special permit from the Land Transfer Authorities granting them permission to acquire real estate.Transaction costs usually add up to around 10 percent of the purchase price. This includes the 3.5 percent property tax, a 1.1 percent land registry fee, about 2 percent for lawyer\u2019s fees, and 3.6 percent to the agent, Mr. Buxbaum said.Citizens of European Union countries should not have trouble obtaining financing \u2014 usually for up to 60 percent of the purchase price \u2014 but other foreigners may find the banks more reluctant, Ms. Harpham said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYGerman; euro (1 euro = $1.13)TAXES AND FEESThere is no annual property tax.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Students Look to Loan Alternatives to Simplify Process and Ease Burden", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byEducation InnovationFor her first two years at Purdue University, Amy M. Wroblewski, a business major, took out about $20,000 in two private student loans to cover her costs, one with an 8.9 percent compounding interest rate and the other with a 9.7 percent rate.Ms. Wroblewski said she opted for more expensive private loans over federally subsidized loans because the application process was much easier.Then, in May, Purdue, in West Lafayette, Ind., began accepting applications for a different type of student financing, an income-share agreement, or I.S.A., through its \u201cBack a Boiler\u201d program (the university\u2019s mascot is the Boilermaker). Ms. Wroblewski was among the first to apply.Under the program, the college advances money to applicants based on its estimate of their future earnings. (Computer engineering majors may qualify for more aid than, for example, turf science majors because engineers traditionally earn more.) Ms. Wroblewski was approved for $28,000 to help cover tuition and living expenses for her final two years.For the I.S.A., students sign a contract agreeing to repay advances after they leave school by sending a fixed percentage of their income to Purdue for up to nine years; the percentage is also based on the university\u2019s estimate of how much they will make after leaving school. Alumni who earn less than expected may not pay back all they owe (the university promises to forgive unpaid balances after nine years). Those who earn higher-than-expected salaries may have to pay back more than they received, though Purdue says it will cap repayments at 2.5 times the amount advanced.Ms. Wroblewski agreed to pay 3.7 percent of her salary to Purdue for nine years after her graduation. If she were to land her dream job, in the human resources department at Ford Motor, she could make about $88,000 a year, according to Glassdoor, a career advice website. Over nine years, then, she would pay back about $29,300 \u2014 a simple interest rate of about 4.6 percent.\u201cI think it\u2019s an amazing deal,\u201d she said. \u201cI am encouraging all of my friends to apply.\u201dHer parents agreed. \u201cThe numbers were wonderful,\u201d said her mother, Jacqueline, a waitress. Her father, Greg, a parts manager at a collision-repair shop, agreed: \u201cWe told her to jump on it.\u201dAs students and families in the United States have collectively accumulated more than $1.2 trillion in debt, academics and entrepreneurs are dusting off some old financing alternatives like I.S.A.s and rolling out new ones. Like loans, these alternatives let students buy now and pay later; unlike loans, they do not have fixed or variable interest rates.Ted Malone, the executive director for financial aid at Purdue, said the university would suspend payments for graduates who make less than $20,000 a year or are unemployed and actively seeking a job. In any case, he added, the obligation will expire nine years after the first payment is made.If participating students do not graduate, they still must repay the advance, according to the original terms \u2014 starting six months after they leave school. The low-income and unemployed-but-looking protections still apply.Money for Back a Boiler \u2014 about $4.5 million to $5 million \u2014 will come from the Purdue Research Foundation, which runs the university\u2019s endowment, Mr. Malone said. Private contractors will sign up students, collect payments and deal with delinquencies.Plan sponsors \u2014 including private I.S.A. providers, crowdfunding proponents and even private lenders \u2014 say these alternatives are intended to supplement federal below-market student loans, not replace them, because federal below-market loans tend to be cheaper and come with more consumer protections, including a provision tying payments to a borrower\u2019s income. But should the alternatives grow beyond their current embryonic stage, they might be less expensive than private loans and so-called Plus loans, which are for graduate students and undergrads\u2019 parents.A number of entrepreneurs have offered a small number of test-case private I.S.A.s but have been hampered by the absence of a legal framework for such arrangements, which do not qualify as loans because no interest is charged. Lenders and borrowers have asked whether state or federal agencies would regulate the business, whether lawmakers would limit maximum paybacks and how I.S.A.s would be treated by tax authorities.\u201cThere is just a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Casey Jennings, chief operating officer of 13th Avenue Funding, which has run a pilot I.S.A. program that lent $15,000 each to 11 students at a community college in California. Seven years ago, \u201cwhen we started this, we thought, \u2018How hard could this be?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201dNow we know.\u201dThe online providers Upstart and Pave ran programs for two years before closing them in 2014. Both companies now focus on brokering traditional private student loans. SoFi, another online provider, began as a fund allowing Stanford alumni to lend directly to graduate students in the business school, but it soon switched to conventional lending, which it found more profitable.Upstart\u2019s founder and chief executive, Dave Girouard, said it was difficult to get people to buy in to the idea of I.S.A.s. Borrowers likened it to indentured servitude, and potential investors, the source of Upstart\u2019s funds, were skeptical of the risks and returns. In two years, Upstart arranged less than $3 million in I.S.A.s, he said. Since switching to conventional student loans two years ago, Upstart has arranged about $400 million in financing.One active I.S.A. provider, Cumulus Funding in Chicago, offers to lend up to $10,000 in exchange for no more than 10 percent of a client\u2019s annual postgraduation income for two to six years.Education Equity, also in Chicago, has arranged 29 I.S.A.s over the last three years. The founder, Andrew Davis, says that for each $5,000 a borrower requests, his firm charges 0.7 percent of the borrower\u2019s salary for 10 years. Assuming, as Mr. Davis does, that his borrowers will earn an average of $80,000 a year, they would pay back $5,600 for every $5,000 they receive \u2014 a simple interest rate of 12 percent.Other start-ups, including People Capital and Green Note, took a different tack, building crowdfunding websites at which students, for a fee, could ask to borrow directly from friends, family or investors they did not know. Many of these peer-to-peer services are no longer in operation.One that is still operating, WeFinance, focuses on students who do not have access to below-market-rate federal loans \u2014 graduate students, undergraduates who take more than four years to complete their studies, veterans who have exhausted their G.I. Bill benefits and students in educational programs, such as software boot camps, that are not recognized by federal loan programs.Students who are willing to try these alternative approaches say they do so because the application process is less onerous than the one for federal student loans.Aside from Purdue and some of the entrepreneurial approaches, other alternatives are being explored.Susan Dynarski, a professor of education, economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, has proposed replacing the current \u201cbewildering array\u201d of options with a single government program, Loans for Educational Opportunity, in which federal low-interest loans would be repaid via payroll deductions after the students graduate.Professor Dynarski said it could be more efficient to have a federal agency manage this type of program because \u201cthe government is uniquely suited to do this\u201d through the income-tax system.In any case, Zakiya Smith, strategy director of the Lumina Foundation, a private foundation that studies ways to increase the number of American college graduates, said that if prospective students needed to borrow money from any source, they \u201cshould choose colleges based on how much they expect to earn\u201d after they graduate. Affordability matters, she said.An emotional attachment to a particular institution, a desire to stay close to home or other factors can override such calculated logic, Ms. Smith added. But that carries long-term financial risks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative to Fund Republicans Who Back Climate Change Action", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A self-described conservative North Carolina businessman has promised to spend at least $5 million through his political action committee to back five Republican congressional candidates who have supported taking action to curb climate change.Even as his party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee denies the existence of global warming, the businessman, Jay Faison, and his ClearPath Action Fund will spend at least $2 million on digital media campaigns to defend Senate incumbents running in two of the tightest races in the country, Rob Portman in Ohio and Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, a recognition of the senators\u2019 support for clean energy, Mr. Faison said Wednesday. The advertisements are expected to start running this week.ClearPath is also spending several hundred thousand dollars on digital advertising campaigns to support Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Tom Reed and Elise Stefanik of New York, all Republicans running for re-election in similarly tight races.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is prove to the party, through these races, that clean energy wins races, to build a political safe space for the Republican Party to talk about this,\u201d Mr. Faison said in an interview. \u201cIt is difficult for a politician to consistently act in an area with no reward. We have their back.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re also making that case to the Trump campaign.\u201dThe spending comes as Republican leaders have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change and attacked President Obama\u2019s climate change policies. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, has mocked climate science and vowed to cancel the Paris Agreement, the 2015 global accord committing nearly every country on earth to taking action to fight climate change.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, calls Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d But some Republican members of Congress who hope to carve out careers that could outlast Mr. Trump\u2019s have begun to quietly consider how to address climate change, which they believe resonates with a growing segment of voters, particularly young people.Political strategists are paying attention to polls that show Americans expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening. A March Gallup poll found that 64 percent of American adults worry \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d about global warming, the highest number since 2008, and it found that a record 65 percent of Americans attribute global warming to human activity.However, most polls asking voters to rank the importance of issues find that environmental concerns trail far behind concerns about jobs and the economy.Still, in many campaigns, Democrats are attacking Republicans as climate deniers.Some moderate Republicans hope to use their views on climate change to draw a contrast with Mr. Trump.\u201cAll of them need to demonstrate a level of independence from the national party in order to survive,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, speaking of the five lawmakers backed by Mr. Faison\u2019s group. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to declare independence from Donald Trump.\u201dIn 2015, Ms. Ayotte broke with her party to vote against a measure written by Mr. McConnell that would have blocked Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change rules. She also voted for a program to establish grants to schools for climate change education, against a proposal to block the Obama administration from signing on to the Paris climate change accord, and in favor of a federal fund to respond to the threat of climate change.Mr. Portman voted with his party on most of those measures, but also voted in favor of the fund to respond to climate threats. He has worked for years with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a bill to improve energy efficiency in buildings. He is a former board member of the Nature Conservancy and is a co-author of legislation to support cleanup of the Great Lakes.The three House members backed by Mr. Faison\u2019s group are among just 13 Republicans who have signed on to a resolution, offered by Representative Chris Gibson, Republican of New York. \u201cThe resolution was a vehicle to find out which Republicans were willing to step up and take some action,\u201d said Steve Valk, a spokesman for Citizen\u2019s Climate Lobby.In Miami, Mr. Curbelo\u2019s opponent, Annette Tadeo, a Democrat, has slammed his climate positions as hypocritical. \u201cBig oil and gas lobbyists have been filling his campaign coffers with thousands of dollars in cash, in exchange for his advocacy for offshore drilling,\u201d she said in a statement.In Ohio, Mr. Portman is fighting to keep his seat against a former governor, Ted Strickland, who notes his support of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate plan and slams Mr. Portman for voting against it.In upstate New York, a local newspaper, The Post-Star, noted that Ms. Stefanik\u2019s support for the climate change resolution was paired with votes against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change plan. \u201cWe were especially interested in how she could acknowledge climate change in one stand, yet vote to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan (new standards for coal-burning power plants), especially while representing a region that was devastated by acid rain from those plants in the Midwest,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote.Some political observers have drawn comparisons between Mr. Faison and Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic donor whose political action committee, NextGen Climate Action, has spent heavily to push candidates who champion climate change issues. Mr. Steyer emerged as the single biggest political donor of the 2014 cycle, spending $74 million to influence voters, far more than the $5 million pledged by Mr. Faison\u2019s group. Mr. Steyer, whose group has already laid out plans to spend at least $25 million in 2016, disavowed the comparison to Mr. Faison.\u201cFrom what we can tell by the people he is supporting, he is grading Republicans on the curve,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in an interview. \u201cWe have fairly objective standards for grading people, and none of the them come close to meeting our standards.\u201d Mr. Steyer said his group planned to support the Democratic Senate candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire.And while the ads run by Mr. Faison\u2019s group note the candidates\u2019 support of clean energy, showing lush green fields and sparkling blue skies, they never explicitly mention the term climate change. Mr. Faison acknowledges that while he supports Republicans who have supported climate change policy, it is still too politically divisive to actually use the phrase.\u201cClimate change is a divisive term on the Hill and it\u2019s a divisive term among the electorate,\u201d said Mr. Faison. \u201cBut \u2018clean energy\u2019 tells a voter you care about the environment, and deflects attacks about climate change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Odds Publicly, Donald Trump and Karl Rove Hold a Private Meeting", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byKarl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush\u2019s victorious presidential campaigns and founder of a constellation of political fund-raising groups, has called Donald J. Trump \u201ca complete idiot.\u201d He has described him as \u201cgraceless and divisive.\u201d He has said Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts about beating Hillary Clinton in the polls are false.Mr. Trump has reacted with anger to such insults, calling Mr. Rove \u201csad\u201d and questioning his record of success.But two weeks ago, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rove held a private meeting just as the presumptive Republican nominee was courting major party figures.The meeting took place at the Manhattan home of the casino magnate Steve Wynn, a mutual friend who brokered the get-together, according to two people briefed on the meeting and who were granted anonymity to discuss the gathering.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, described it as a \u201cgood meeting,\u201d but did not elaborate. An aide to Mr. Wynn did not respond to an email seeking comment, and Mr. Rove similarly declined to respond.The purpose of the meeting was unclear, although Mr. Rove is the last strategist to help elect a Republican president, and Mr. Trump is lagging organizationally for the general election.If d\u00e9tente was the goal, the meeting did not appear to have a lasting effect: the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling, media-bashing news conference last Tuesday, Mr. Rove was deeply critical of his performance.\u201cI\u2019m not certain it helps him with the people who are swing voters, up for grabs, and it certainly is very unpresidential,\u201d Mr. Rove said on Fox News. \u201cIt would not be a good spectacle for our country to have a President Trump acting like candidate Trump acted yesterday.\u201dThe tense relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rove has deeper significance than just resolving their public sparring. Mr. Rove has longstanding relationships with many of the party\u2019s biggest donors, and has intricate knowledge of how \u201csuper PACs\u201d can help elect candidates.Mr. Rove has talked with Mr. Adelson about what super PAC to use as a vehicle for donating such a large sum of money to support Mr. Trump, including possibly using the Crossroads fund-raising groups, which he helped establish, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Creating a new group would give Mr. Adelson more control over how his money is spent, at a moment when there are a number of super PACs that either exist or are being formed to support Mr. Trump\u2019s bid. Other major donors, such as Rebekah Mercer, who supported the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, are considering backing Mr. Trump through other super PACs.Super PACs cannot coordinate with campaigns, and, so far, the Trump campaign hasn\u2019t signaled formally whether any group has its tacit blessing. In two cases, former aides to the campaign have gone to work for super PACs that support Mr. Trump, despite \u201ccooling-off periods\u201d mandated by campaign finance laws when transitions like that take place.There is one super PAC supporting Mr. Trump that is run by a former aide to Ben Carson. Another proposed group, which would be backed by Tom Barrack, a financier and close friend of Mr. Trump, was created on Thursday, with more than $30 million in commitments, according to CNN.Another group is being advised by Edward J. Rollins, the strategist who was Ronald Reagan\u2019s campaign manager and has deep ties to the Republican Party.That group has faced scrutiny over its ad-buying practices, although it has donor meetings planned with prominent figures such as the financier Julian H. Robertson Jr. But in a recent meeting with Mr. Trump, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III was critical of Mr. Rollins, according to two people briefed on the exchange.Mr. Rollins and Mr. Baker were rivals during the 1980 primary race between Mr. Reagan and the elder George Bush. In an email, Mr. Rollins said he had signed on to help in an unusual year.\u201cIf others think they can do it better, have at it!\u201d said Mr. Rollins in an email. \u201cIt is going to be a tough and expensive campaign and I would assume Mr. Trump and his team would want all the help they can get!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Needing Cash, Some Small Business Owners Bypass the Bank", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersAfter losing her job at LivingSocial, the online deal company that went nearly bankrupt three years ago, Kate Levenstien decided to take a chance on a business that combined two things she loved: bacon and beer.Her plan was to hold an event celebrating the two in a baseball stadium. So she called ballparks in major cities, and the first one to agree was Safeco Field in Seattle, a city she had never visited. Without hesitation, she put down a deposit.She started selling tickets online just as she had helped other people sell their events on LivingSocial. And in May 2014, 6,000 people in Seattle paid about $60 each to eat bacon-themed morsels and sample beers until their arteries cried uncle. Two months later, 8,000 New Yorkers did the same thing at Citi Field.Thus was born the Bacon and Beer Classic.While successful entrepreneurs have plenty of stories about the early risks they took, Ms. Levenstien said she learned something from that first event that helped her build her business and put her on the path to personal wealth: the security of getting money in the door months before people attend an event and using those proceeds to finance the company\u2019s growth.It\u2019s no secret that banks are hesitant to lend to small business owners with unproven ideas, and when banks do lend, they are usually pretty conservative.\u201cWhen the business owner wants to establish that second practice, but there isn\u2019t enough cash flow coming from the first location to finance that build-out, we\u2019ll say not now,\u201d said Noreen Bishop, senior vice president and regional executive for Chase Business Banking. \u201cIf the second location will put that business owner and the first location at risk, we\u2019ll say let\u2019s give it one more year.\u201dFor entrepreneurs who are not in hot sectors like technology, growing their businesses and putting themselves on the path to wealth will have a lot more to do with their tolerance for risk and how they think about cash flow and partnerships.\u201cThe things that you noticed about people who succeed was that many of them were not great innovators,\u201d said Scott Winget, senior managing director of the Center for Wealth Impact at Ascent Private Capital Management, which often works with business owners after they\u2019ve been successful. \u201cThey have a degree of optimism, problem solving skills, but mostly, it\u2019s sheer doggedness.\u201dWhile Ms. Levenstien\u2019s early success was funded by cash flow \u2014 she has produced 15 bacon and beer events, as well as beer-themed events at several zoos and lower-key events like river tubing in Indiana \u2014 she is thinking about her next options. One has been searching for partners, like the stadiums where the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos play.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work and a lot of risk to go to another city,\u201d she said. \u201cSo new venues have joined us as partners. They guide us on what we do. It made us a much more seamless event so we\u2019re don\u2019t say, \u2018We didn\u2019t sell tickets and now we\u2019re on the hook for $70,000.\u2019 \u201dJimmy Bernstein, the chief executive of Howl at the Moon, a chain of live-music bars, said he opened the first 10 locations using cash flow but the cost of each one slowed how fast he could grow.About a decade ago, he brought in investors who have allowed him to focus on running the business, while supplying him with the capital to open new locations. He credited that partnership with helping him to continue building his business when a Seattle location failed in 2006, costing him $1.1 million.\u201cThey said, \u2018Fail fast and move on,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI set my sights on the next project, which was very exciting. It all came back to where it was before.\u201dYet partners can only go so far. Jim McCann, founder and executive chairman of 1-800-Flowers, bought his first flower shop on First Avenue in Manhattan 40 years ago. And then, for 10 years, he said, he opened a new flower shop every six months, giving the store managers an ownership stake in each one.In 1998, in the middle of the boom in internet initial public offerings, he said executives at AOL mentioned to him that he could grow more quickly if he took his company public. In late 1999, the company did just that, right before the markets began to cool.\u201cWe got public on a multibillion-dollar valuation,\u201d Mr. McCann said. \u201cI remember sitting at a big sidewalk cafe on Third Avenue and saying to my brother Chris, \u2018Can you believe we\u2019ve raised this money to meet all our capital needs for the next five years?\u2019 \u201dFor most entrepreneurs, taking their company public is a dream that will remain just that. More realistic types of financing are likely to come as bank loans or lines of credit.\u201cIf it\u2019s just a working capital line, we\u2019d make a recommendation for what they would need to support that business over a 30- to 45-day period,\u201d Ms. Bishop said. \u201cIf it\u2019s equipment, we could finance up to 100 percent of that equipment. If it\u2019s a building that we\u2019re purchasing, generally it\u2019s 80 percent.\u201dLines of credit can be helpful tools for cash flow, but they are generally not an option until a business has been running for several years. And even then, they are going to be limited in size.\u201cIf your business is doing $100,000 revenue, a $100,000 line of credit is not realistic,\u201d said Robert Schapira, the Southwest small business leader at Wells Fargo. \u201cTen to 20 percent of your revenue is the most a business should expect to healthily do this and to pay the line off consistently.\u201dAnd the criteria banks place on making loans often force entrepreneurs bent on creating something quickly to look elsewhere.At an earlier stage in his company, Gregory Zamfotis sought equity investments from family members for his first six Gregorys Coffee locations, which he opened from 2006 to 2013.\u201cWe felt that the banks we had spoken to at the time were not willing to give us the amount of money to really change our lives, and the loan covenants that would come along with that money did not seem that appealing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have been willing to give us $1 million, but that was two and a half stores to us.\u201dSo in 2014, he partnered with Hexagon Hospitality, a venture firm specializing in restaurants, to get financial backing and opened his 17th Gregorys Coffee shop in Brooklyn Heights on Friday.Hexagon \u201cwas more aggressive in their ability to provide financing and more capable of financing at a faster rate,\u201d he said.Ms. Levenstien said that she had been holding off on seeking outside financing, preferring to test out new concepts on her own. This summer, she will run a private Bacon and Beer Classic event at the Republican National Convention and start a new whiskey and fried food festival in Brooklyn in July.She is also planning a new festival this fall called Ramen Festival, which pairs beer and sake with ramen noodles. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing in these sumo wrestlers who are awesome \u2014 these 400-pound guys who are just picking each other up.\u201dAnd that is the entrepreneur\u2019s spirit, which may just lead to great wealth down the line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Plan to Cut Medicare Drug Payments Leaves Senators Skeptical", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byThe official, Dr. Patrick H. Conway, a deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, indicated to the Senate Finance Committee that the administration would probably go ahead with its proposal in some form, and he promised that officials would try to prevent any harm to patients.That did little to calm bipartisan fears. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, called the administration plan \u201can ill-conceived experiment\u201d and suggested that it was a form of \u201chuman subjects research\u201d for which the government needed the consent of patients.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee\u2019s senior Democrat, said he worried that the proposal \u201ccould unintentionally drive seniors toward hospitals,\u201d where treatment is typically more costly and less convenient.That left Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, to quip that the administration had done a good job bringing Republicans and Democrats together, with both parties hearing from constituents who fear that the cuts in Medicare payments could limit access to treatments.In its proposal, the administration wants to change reimbursement formulas to try to encourage doctors to choose lower-cost therapies. The administration said it wanted to require \u201cmandatory participation\u201d for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in three-fourths of the nation\u2019s 7,000 \u201cprimary care service areas,\u201d using reimbursement formulas different from those in the federal Medicare law.For a test, said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, that \u201cseems almost universal.\u201d Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, agreed.\u201cThe scope of the current proposal seems broader than is typical of demonstration projects,\u201d she said.The test is to be conducted under a section of the Affordable Care Act that allows the secretary of health and human services to waive requirements of the Medicare law when trying out new payment models for a specific \u201cdefined population.\u201dThe administration plan goes far beyond such a demonstration project, Mr. Toomey said.Under the proposal, Medicare might set a standard payment rate for a group of \u201ctherapeutically similar drug products,\u201d or pay less for an expensive drug where a less costly alternative was available.However, cancer specialists say that for some treatments, no low-cost alternatives are available.While Dr. Conway said the administration would make adjustments in the final rule, he refused to be pinned down on specifics. When asked by a Democrat why the administration had proposed \u201csuch a large, expansive demonstration,\u201d Dr. Conway said, \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently large sample so that you can evaluate the model.\u201dPart B drugs are often administered in doctors\u2019 offices or hospital outpatient departments.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, said that many doctors, especially those in rural areas and small medical groups, could lose money buying drugs under the administration\u2019s proposal. If they no longer provide the drugs, he said, patients might have to travel to hospital clinics to get the infusions and injections.In a separate action, the Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled a pilot program to speed the review of patent applications for drugs that mobilize the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. Such immunotherapies are among the most expensive medicines approved for sale in recent years, with annual costs exceeding $100,000 in some cases, but they have also shown great promise, scientists say.In the last year, dozens of cancer specialists have complained of exorbitant prices for drugs, including some that seem miraculous and others that extend lives by only a few months. Many of the drugs are covered under Part B of Medicare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama to Meet With Sanders to Nudge Him to Fully Back Clinton", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byPresident Obama will use an Oval Office meeting with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Thursday morning to delicately nudge the losing Democratic presidential hopeful toward a full embrace of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and a unified party effort to defeat Donald J. Trump in the fall, according to administration aides.The conversation, the fifth that Mr. Obama will have had with Mr. Sanders since the primaries began, is to be part of a choreographed series of moves Mr. Obama set in motion this week that are designed to quickly bridge the divide between the two Democratic presidential candidates laid bare in the last few months. The strategy will culminate with the president\u2019s formal endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in the coming days, followed by an appearance with her on the campaign trail soon after.Mr. Obama\u2019s message is intended to be unmistakable: The time has come for Mr. Sanders to harness his formidable constituency in support of his onetime rival even as he continues to press for the progressive policies that animated his base. But it is also clear to the White House that Mr. Obama must broker this particular intraparty peace treaty with patience and respect, or risk angering Mr. Sanders and his millions of supporters.To that end, the president will delay any endorsement of Mrs. Clinton until after the meeting with Mr. Sanders. And a joint appearance is unlikely until after the Democratic primary in the District of Columbia on Tuesday. Mr. Obama will not pressure Mr. Sanders to make a concession before that contest, the final one in the long primary season, advisers said.\u201cWe should be a little graceful and give him the opportunity to decide on his own,\u201d when he wants to leave the race, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said of Mr. Sanders on Wednesday.How the 2008 Obama-Clinton race could inform Sanders\u2019s path forward.White House aides said Mr. Obama was eager to help Mr. Sanders find a way to continue elevating the causes he championed for more than a year \u2014 including addressing income inequality and college tuition affordability, raising the minimum wage and changing campaign finance rules \u2014 but without the anti-Clinton comments that could threaten the Democratic cause.\u201cYou\u2019ve built this enormous grass-roots movement; what do you want to do with that?\u201d said Jen Psaki, Mr. Obama\u2019s communications director, describing what was likely to be the tenor of his conversation with Mr. Sanders. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition of the energy and enthusiasm that he built, and that that is going to be needed to win in November.\u201dFinding a way to help guide Mr. Sanders past his disappointment is the president\u2019s chief goal during the next few days, Obama aides said. During a remarkable and at times bruising political campaign, Mr. Sanders has built an enormous list of Democratic voters that would be invaluable to Mrs. Clinton and to Democratic Senate and House candidates. Aides said Mr. Obama would remind Mr. Sanders that he could receive much of the credit for big Democratic wins if he helps redirect his newfound political energy toward helping Mrs. Clinton.Democratic strategists said the president would play a pivotal role in reaching out to Mr. Sanders\u2019s coalition, although Mrs. Clinton will have to make a visible effort to appeal to her former adversary\u2019s supporters \u2014 much as Mr. Obama did in 2008 after he won a prolonged and at times bitter primary with Mrs. Clinton.\u201cHe\u2019ll be a great surrogate among those Democrats who were supportive of him but are less supportive of her, particularly younger Democrats, in making the case as to why consolidating behind her is important and what\u2019s at stake in the election,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaign and his White House.Mrs. Clinton \u201cneeds to approach those folks with open arms, but there is a truth-telling, reality element of this that he may be better suited for,\u201d Mr. Axelrod added.Some supporters of Mr. Sanders on Wednesday said that they hoped that Mr. Obama would not pressure their candidate to quickly leave the race.\u201cBernie Sanders and the grass-roots political revolutionaries behind him have more than earned the time and the space, just as Secretary Clinton and her supporters did eight years ago, to determine the best steps we can take together to help unite our party against Donald Trump in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d said Jim Dean, the chairman of Democracy for America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders in December.Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which stayed neutral in the race, said Democrats should not \u201cguilt trip\u201d Sanders voters by warning them of the risks of electing Mr. Trump, but instead incorporate their ideas, including expanding Social Security benefits and breaking up big banks, into the party platform.In a taped appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d that is to be broadcast Thursday night, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Sanders, saying he brought \u201cenormous energy\u201d and \u201cnew ideas\u201d to the campaign. The president said Mr. Sanders pushed his rival, making her a better candidate.\u201cShe is whip smart, she is tough and she deeply cares about working people and putting kids through school,\u201d Mr. Obama said, citing some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s main concerns about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cMy hope is over the next couple weeks, we\u2019re able to pull things together.\u201dThe president said Mr. Sanders and his supporters deserved some time to become used to the fact that he did not win. He said that people who poured their hearts into campaigns often became \u201ca little ouchy\u201d and bruised, and needed time to recover.Asked whether he thinks the Republicans are happy with their choice of Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama joked, \u201cWe are!\u201d He then added, \u201cActually, you know what, that was too easy,\u201d and said he was worried about the Republican Party because democracy works when \u201cyou have two parties that are serious.\u201dMichael D. Shear reported from New York, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cracks Appear in Merger of Williams and Energy Transfer Equity", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsA supposedly ironclad $22 billion pipeline deal is showing some cracks. The Williams Companies said on Wednesday that it expected to cut its dividend if its sale to its rival, Energy Transfer Equity, fell through. Despite Energy Transfer\u2019s attempts to renegotiate or wriggle out of the merger, Williams has held firm until now. The payout warning may be a tactic, but the target now seems to be admitting the possibility of failure.Energy Transfer in September agreed to acquire Williams for what was originally a $33 billion cash and stock deal. That was before the sustained slump in oil prices savaged the stock prices of both companies, raising questions about the deal\u2019s financial logic and the debt Energy Transfer is taking on to finance the transaction.With no easy way out in the fine print of the merger agreement, Energy Transfer has turned to unorthodox methods to encourage Williams and its shareholders to reconsider. It slashed by 90 percent its estimate of the financial benefits of the merger, began a dilutive private share placement and warned of big job cuts in Williams\u2019s hometown, Tulsa, Okla.Last month, Energy Transfer said that problems securing a tax opinion from its lawyers meant it might not be able to complete the transaction by a June 28 deadline. While Williams may be open to modifying the deal terms, it has filed a lawsuit to stop Energy Transfer from using the tax issue as an excuse to abandon the merger.Shareholders are skeptical. They valued Williams\u2019s equity at just over $17 billion on Thursday \u2014 a more than 20 percent discount to the value of Energy Transfer\u2019s offer. Yet even as it flagged the threat to the payouts its investors receive, Williams said it was committed to closing the deal as soon as possible after a scheduled June 27 shareholder vote.The warning may be intended simply to persuade undecided owners. The Williams board may also be acting out of an abundance of caution, given the rising probability that the merger\u2019s fate ends up being decided in court. Either way, it suggests the possibility that a once watertight deal has developed a stress fracture.Advertisement"}

But security video taken at a Trump-owned property in Jupiter, Fla., clearly showed him grabbing Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart News, despite his claims that she was \u201cdelusional\u201d for suggesting that he had laid a hand on her.In his interview with Ms. Bash, Mr. Lewandowski repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to Mr. Trump, saying he would do \u201ceverything I can to make sure\u201d Mr. Trump was elected president.\u201cIf I can do that from inside the campaign, that\u2019s a privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can do that from outside the campaign, that\u2019s also a privilege.\u201dMr. Lewandowski did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s first appearance, as of now, is scheduled for Monday on \u201cNew Day.\u201dAn NBC spokesman said that Mr. Lewandowski met on Monday with MSNBC executives to discuss a possible contributor contract, and that the network declined to make an offer.Michael M.

{"Headline": "A Whiff of a Power Struggle in World Cricket", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The International Cricket Council\u2019s meetings normally take place in Dubai. But this year\u2019s annual conference will start Monday in Edinburgh, a move that could be symbolic of the huge changes that may soon engulf cricket.Two years ago, the council restructured, concentrating power and money in the hands of three of the biggest cricket-playing nations: Australia, England and India. The changes, which gave the three nations permanent positions on the main decision-making committees and gave them more I.C.C. revenue than the other 102 members combined, attracted plenty of criticism, some of it from Transparency International.In the past year, the council has begun to take a different direction. Last fall, Shashank Manohar replaced Narayanaswami Srinivasan as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and chairman of the I.C.C., and he immediately criticized the 2014 changes. In November, Manohar said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the three major countries\u2019 bullying the I.C.C.,\u201d declaring, \u201cyou cannot make the poor poorer and the rich richer, only because you have the clout. The I.C.C. runs cricket throughout the world.\u201dSince then, Manohar has mandated that the chairman of the I.C.C. be independent \u2014 rather than simultaneously representing a country while serving \u2014 and resigned as president of the B.C.C.I. to remain in the post. The permanent positions of the \u201cbig three\u201d on the I.C.C. executive committee and finance and commercial affairs committees have been scrapped.Now, the council aims to go further. A five-member panel has been created to conduct a \u201ccomplete review of the 2014 resolutions and constitutional changes\u201d and will report in Edinburgh, aiming to get the council\u2019s board to agree to changes. Manohar would also like to see the B.C.C.I.\u2019s share of I.C.C. revenue reduced, although this decision is now not his. \u201cIt is just at the discussion stage,\u201d his successor as the control board\u2019s president, Anurag Thakur, said this month.Besides further reversing the changes of 2014, the cricket council\u2019s main concern is how to safeguard the future of test cricket, the most prestigious form of the sport. Tests have been played since 1877, but the format is now under threat \u2014 partly because of the rise of the shorter Twenty20 cricket format, especially in domestic leagues such as those in Australia, India and the West Indies; partly from time pressures in the modern world; and also, it is believed, because test matches are so poorly structured. Test matches count toward the world rankings, but there is no overall league structure. The cricket council also believes that the sport needs more teams if it is to survive. Only 10 nations are currently permitted to play test cricket.The council\u2019s favored new structure for test cricket is for seven teams to participate in a Division One, and five in Division Two. Each country would play every other team in its division in a series, either home or away, every two years, with promotion and relegation and with lower-ranked teams able to win promotion to Division Two. Similar plans have failed before, however: the I.C.C\u2019s management first attempted to introduce divisions as far back as 2004.There is renewed optimism this time. It is no coincidence that Division One would comprise seven teams, the same number of votes as are needed from among the 10 full members of the I.C.C. to be voted through. And the boards could also be driven to agree to the changes by self-interest. \u201cA number of member countries are finding that they\u2019re not getting as much from their TV rights for bilateral cricket and they see the need to change and introduce some meaningful context,\u201d Richardson explained in the Cricinfo interview.Similar thinking underpins the council\u2019s hopes to introduce a new league of 13 countries for one-day international cricket; as with the plans for two divisions in test cricket, this would take effect starting in 2019. The rationale is similar to that for test cricket: to introduce more context for the matches, allow emerging countries to rise and thereby help to increase interest from spectators and commercial partners.In the context of the council\u2019s fears about the rise of T20, the decision to return the World Twenty20 to being held every two years, from every four, which is expected to be ratified in Edinburgh, seems a curious one. But the council hopes that the extra revenue generated from more editions of the competition can be used to fund matches within the envisaged two-division test structure. In this way, far from ending test cricket, the hope is that T20 could help to save it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Film About Russian Lawyer\u2019s Death Creates an Uproar", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Six years after his mysterious death in a Moscow prison cell, Sergei L. Magnitsky has become a byword for brutality in President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia. Now, a documentary film that paints Mr. Magnitsky as an accomplice rather than a victim is generating a furor, with critics trying to block a screening of it next week in Washington.Screenings of the film, \u201cThe Magnitsky Act \u2014 Behind the Scenes,\u201d have been canceled in Europe after threats of libel suits from William F. Browder, an American-born financier who fell afoul of the Russian government and hired Mr. Magnitsky, a lawyer and auditor, to investigate a vast tax fraud scheme after the government seized three of his Russian subsidiaries.\u201cThe Magnitsky Act\u201d is to be screened on Monday at the Newseum, a private museum dedicated to the news industry. Lawyers for Mr. Browder and Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s mother, Natalia Magnitskaya, sent a letter to the Newseum this week demanding that it call off the event. After a conference call on Thursday, the museum\u2019s management refused.\u201cWe stand for free speech and free expression,\u201d said Scott Williams, the chief operating officer of the Newseum. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow them not to show the film.\u201d He noted that the museum was not sponsoring the screening, but merely renting out its theater. \u201cWe often have people renting for events that other people would love not to have happen,\u201d he said.Mr. Browder, who lives in London, has accused the film\u2019s director, Andrei Nekrasov, of defaming him and smearing the memory of Mr. Magnitsky. The film asserts that the widely accepted version of Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death is wrong: that the police did not beat him before he died, and that he did not testify that the police had conspired to steal $230 million in fraudulent tax rebates. Indeed, the film says it was Mr. Browder who orchestrated the fraud.Lawmakers are now trying to pass legislation that would impose sanctions on people anywhere in the world for the kinds of human-rights abuses that surfaced in the Magnitsky case. Much to the frustration of the Russian government, the bill would again bear his name. A screening at the Newseum is especially controversial because it could attract lawmakers or their aides. The cavernous museum, which sits on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Capitol, has the text of the First Amendment etched above its main entrance.Speaking from Berlin, Mr. Nekrasov said he had not begun the project intending to undermine the account of Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death. He said that he viewed it more as a docudrama about Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s last days, and that he had consulted Mr. Browder, whom he envisioned as the film\u2019s narrator. But as he began scrutinizing original documents in the case, Mr. Nekrasov said, he began to doubt Mr. Browder\u2019s version of events.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to pin down the moment when I thought it was a lie, it\u2019s a made-up story,\u201d he said. One clue, he said, was that \u201cthere was no sign of whistle-blowing\u201d on the part of Mr. Magnitsky.People familiar with the Magnitsky case expressed doubt that he was in on a conspiracy. \u201cWhen I was in the government,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia, \u201cwe studied closely his tragic case and had a radically different assessment.\u201dIn April, a screening of the film at the European Parliament was called off at the last minute after lawyers for Mr. Browder threatened legal action. The British law firm Carter-Ruck also sent a letter to Arte, a German-French television network that planned to broadcast the film.In the United States, Mr. Nekrasov has retained the Potomac Square Group, a small public affairs and lobbying firm that has worked for Bahrain, Kuwait and Azerbaijan, among other foreign governments. It is run by Christopher Cooper, a former Wall Street Journal reporter. Mr. Cooper rented the theater in the Newseum and declined to say who was paying his company. \u201cI\u2019m putting this event together for the director,\u201d he said.Mr. Cooper said there would be a question-and-answer session with Mr. Nekrasov, moderated by the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, after the screening. The organizers considered inviting Mr. Browder to take part in the session, Mr. Cooper said, and might still do so.Mr. Browder did not return requests for comment. But he has spoken out in the past against the film, calling it \u201ca calculated attempt to harm our campaign and to make people doubt the legacy of Sergei Magnitsky.\u201dLawyers for Mr. Browder have presented substantial documentary evidence, including photographs, that Mr. Magnitsky was beaten in his jail cell. They also cite transcripts of testimony in which he named police officers as being involved in the tax fraud.That Mr. Magnitsky was mistreated in jail is hardly in dispute. The Russian authorities initially claimed he had died from sudden heart failure. But after persistent questions, Russia\u2019s then-president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, ordered prosecutors to open an investigation.In 2011, a human rights panel that advised Mr. Medvedev issued a report concluding that Mr. Magnitsky had been beaten. His health issues went untreated for the 11 months he was in custody. The report said that investigators and prison officials shared responsibility for his death.Mr. Browder was once the largest foreign investor in Russia\u2019s stock market. He defended Mr. Putin, and in 2005, he told a reporter that the newly elected president of Ukraine, Viktor A. Yushchenko, needed to cultivate closer ties with Russia. Since he was expelled from Russia, however, Mr. Browder has become a fierce crusader against official corruption there.Last year, he published a book, \u201cRed Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and One Man\u2019s Fight for Justice,\u201d that delved into the circumstances of Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigating Fertility Clinics With a Click", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byJake Anderson and Deborah Bialis of San Francisco planned to start a family not long after their wedding in 2012. But they soon ran into a roadblock: infertility. At 27, Ms. Bialis was told that her prospects for a successful pregnancy were dim because of an earlier medical condition. Not sure where to turn, the couple sought out a fertility doctor to assess their options.After two years, two doctors and three rounds of unsuccessful fertility treatments costing $75,000, they gave up and decided to try on their own.\u201cIt attacks you emotionally in a way that\u2019s hard to fathom,\u201d Mr. Anderson, 36, said of the experience. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ll be a parent someday and then realize it may not happen, it\u2019s a crisis. It can drive a wedge between partners, and emotionally it is pure hell.\u201dThey saw an opportunity because \u201cwe realized there was no accountability on the clinic level,\u201d Ms. Bialis, now 30, said. \u201cThere was so much miscommunication.\u201dMore than seven million women sought treatment for infertility from 2006 through 2010, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The American fertility market, including treatments and drugs, is estimated to be $3 billion to $4 billion, and growing at 4 percent a year, according to Harris Williams, an investment bank. As women wait longer to begin having children, those numbers have risen. Fertility is tied to a woman\u2019s age, and by the mid-30s, her ability to become pregnant declines considerably.Many fertility patients need more than one treatment cycle. Each cycle costs $14,000 to $17,000, with three generally needed. Adding those to other treatments, the total cost comes to an average of $66,000, depending on where the patient lives, a recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association reported.Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bialis found that the most common methods of finding a fertility doctor or clinic was word of mouth, a referral from an obstetrician/gynecologist, or cold-calling one of hundreds of fertility clinics around the country. Fertility patients are highly likely to leave their first doctor, frustrated by a lack of chemistry and emotional support, they said.\u201cI call this silent suffering,\u201d said Dr. Alice Domar, a psychologist and director of integrative care at Boston IVF, a fertility clinic with more than 20 locations in New England. \u201cIt has to do with sex and female parts, and people don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s a huge industry, but very few things are offered to patients that address the emotional aspects of infertility.\u201dFertilityIQ, which went online this year, provides extensive assessments of doctors, clinics and treatment protocols from patients who fill in detailed questionnaires about their experiences.For couples trying to make one of the most important and expensive decisions of their lives, useful data has been sparse. Dr. Christo Zouves, a San Francisco infertility doctor, said FertilityIQ had \u201cinformation that nobody has ever really collected before.\u201d Because of the expense, time commitment and emotional stress involved, \u201cYou can\u2019t really afford not to have all your ducks in a row before you initiate that first cycle.\u201dThough most applaud FertilityIQ\u2019s efforts, some in the field are skeptical of a website that offers reviews of doctors and clinics in a manner that some have compared to Yelp. As with Yelp, the reviews are subjective and may reflect individual biases that create a skewed portrait.\u201cI would not want to choose my doctor based on a website,\u201d said Dr. Michael M. Alper, medical director of Boston IVF and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIf a relative needed cardiac surgery, would you go to a website and choose? It could be very misleading.\u201dDr. Alper, who has practiced infertility medicine for 30 years, noted that web surveys could provide inaccurate assessments, and that FertilityIQ, being so new, is relying on limited responses for individual doctors. Many of the doctors listed on the site have scores based on just one or two patient reviews.\u201cIf you look through history, doctors and IVF centers have equated quality with pregnancy statistics,\u201d Dr. Alper said. \u201cWhoever had the highest numbers had the best quality. But the problem is, you can control your statistics by how you treat and who you treat.\u201d Patients with complex problems may be turned away, and the best doctors who take on the tougher cases will have more failed attempts and generate lower ratings, he said.Mr. Anderson is aware of such concerns and acknowledges that the site is a work in progress. But it has already evaluated more than 80 percent of all American fertility doctors and includes assessments from 5,000 verified fertility patients, meaning they have produced a bill to authenticate their treatment, he said. Tens of thousands of patients have visited the website, he added.The website has been an important resource for Christine Turner, an executive director at Stella & Dot, a jewelry and accessory company. Married at 34, Ms. Turner and her husband tried to conceive right away and ran into fertility problems. Then living in Atlanta, they went to a clinic recommended by her obstetrician/gynecologist and met with a doctor with whom she did not feel comfortable. The couple spent $40,000 on two unsuccessful IVF cycles.Now living in Houston, Ms. Turner went to the FertilityIQ website, created an account and began to search for a clinic that would match her needs. Through FertilityIQ, she found a doctor at a clinic in Colorado and was able to confirm through evaluations \u201cwho had the best bedside manner and who would be best for me,\u201d she said.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be spending that much money, I want to really make sure I\u2019m putting the money in the right place and into the hands of the right clinic and doctor,\u201d she said. She called FertilityIQ \u201cinvaluable and game-changing\u201d because it connected her to a community of people she might not otherwise know about.Though he applauds the effort, Dr. Alper warned that until the sampling numbers were far higher, \u201cpeople will end up choosing centers for the wrong reasons.\u201dFor now, the website is free. As FertilityIQ grows, eventually people will pay a fee for access to the data, but those who share their own data will become part of the community and retain free access, Mr. Anderson said. The site is free of advertising to avoid conflicts of interest.The start-up is self-financed, and Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bialis have turned away potential investors. Mr. Anderson said he was in no hurry to monetize the site. He pointed to hugely successful Sequoia investments like WhatsApp and Instagram, which focused on building a large audience before generating revenue and were later acquired for a combined $20 billion.Josh Manchester, a venture partner at Foundation Capital in Menlo Park, Calif., favored that approach. \u201cIf they are able to create a customer experience where users of the site benefit and go through the fertility process in as smooth and painless a way as possible, it creates high engagement and evangelical customers. That leads to a fast-growing user base.\u201d\u201cCommunities and networks are the most valuable businesses in the world,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cIn the early years, they all build an audience, not revenue. The good ones are rewarded for patience and not trying to monetize early.\u201dHe and Ms. Bialis have already been rewarded for their patience in another way. Their first child, a boy who was conceived naturally, was born at the end of April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Deal in Congress Likely to Be Delayed Until After Recess", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Emergency financing to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus appeared likely to be delayed until after Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess, as Democrats on Wednesday sharply criticized a new Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion, but with $750 million redirected from other federal programs.But as the Republican negotiators announced Wednesday evening that they had reached a tentative agreement \u2014 which the House approved early Thursday in a 239-171 vote \u2014 Democrats lashed out. They said the proposal was layered with numerous unrelated provisions that they would never accept, including an effort to restrict government financing of Planned Parenthood, the women\u2019s health organization.While Democrats did not have any sway over the House-Senate negotiations, Republicans do not have sufficient votes in the Senate to overcome procedural obstacles and approve the agreement on their own.The White House also said the legislation appeared unacceptable and would further delay the effort to combat the Zika virus, which can cause serious neurological disorders and other deformities in infants born to infected mothers.\u201cWhile we are still awaiting more details on the legislation, it is clear that once again, Republicans have put political games ahead of the health and safety of the American people, particularly pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.\u201cThis plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus and steals funding from other health priorities,\u201d Mr. Earnest added. \u201cThe fact that the Republican plan limits needed birth control services for women in the United States and Puerto Rico as we seek to stop the spread of a sexually transmitted disease is a clear indication they don\u2019t take seriously the threat from the Zika virus or their responsibility to protect Americans.\u201dIn an announcement late Wednesday, Republicans said their proposal included important restrictions on how the emergency money would be used.\u201cUnlike the administration\u2019s request that allowed overly broad authority for federal agencies to use Zika dollars with little accountability, this legislation places tight controls and oversight on spending to ensure that every dollar is being used appropriately,\u201d the statement from the House Appropriations Committee said.In a statement, Representative Hal Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, praised the legislation.\u201cThis is a solid agreement that will adequately and effectively fund resources for our troops and their families, our veterans, and to fight and prevent the spread of the Zika virus,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cIt is the product of careful and thorough deliberations between the House and the Senate, and reflects a responsible compromise that can and should be signed into law.\u201dMr. Rogers urged Democrats to approve the legislation given the expected arrival of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the United States. \u201cMosquito season is upon us; these dollars must get out the door now to help control the spread of the Zika virus and continue longer-term efforts to stop this disease, such as vaccine and treatment development and deployment,\u201d he said.But Democrats, including the party\u2019s Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, had nothing but sharp criticism.\u201cA narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women\u2019s access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,\u201d Mr. Reid said in a statement. \u201cIn short, Republicans are trying to turn an attempt to protect women\u2019s health into an attack on women\u2019s health. We waited four months for Republicans to do anything to combat Zika. Their proposal would be comical except this a public health emergency and it deserves urgency.\u201dThe money to fight the Zika virus was included in an $82.5 billion annual appropriations measure covering military construction and veterans\u2019 affairs programs for 2017.Republicans stressed that the legislation would provide $2.6 billion more for those programs than in 2016, but Democrats said it still did not provide sufficient funding for veterans.It was not immediately clear how congressional leaders might resolve the impasse, or when the federal money for Zika would ultimately be approved.Advertisement"}

On Monday, Mr. Sharif presided over a cabinet meeting via Skype, which government officials insisted was done through a secure connection, to approve the country\u2019s coming budget.Some analysts here say that Mr. Sharif is expected to weather the political storm over the revelations of his family\u2019s offshore wealth, as the opposition is fractured, and claims of corruption have tainted most politicians equally.

{"Headline": "An Expensive Law Degree, and No Place to Use It", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byVALPARAISO, Ind. \u2014 By most measures, John Acosta is a law school success story. He graduated from Valparaiso University Law School \u2014 a well-established regional school here in northwestern Indiana \u2014 in the top third of his class this past December, a semester ahead of schedule. He passed the bar exam on his first try in February.Mr. Acosta, 39, is also a scrupulous networker who persuaded a former longtime prosecutor to join him in starting a defense and family law firm. A police officer for 11 years in Georgia, Mr. Acosta has a rare ability to get inside the head of a cop that should be of more than passing interest to would-be clients.\u201cI think John\u2019s going to do fine,\u201d said Andrew Lucas, a partner at the firm where Mr. Acosta rents office space. \u201cHe\u2019s got other life skills that are attractive to people running into problems.\u201dYet in financial terms, there is almost no way for Mr. Acosta to climb out of the crater he dug for himself in law school, when he borrowed over $200,000. The government will eventually forgive the loan \u2014 in 20 years \u2014 if he\u2019s unable to repay it, as is likely on his small-town lawyer\u2019s salary. But the Internal Revenue Service will probably treat the forgiven amount as income, leaving him what could easily be a $70,000 tax bill on the eve of retirement, and possibly much higher.Mr. Acosta is just one of tens of thousands of recent law school graduates caught up in a broad transformation of the legal profession. While demand for other white-collar jobs has grown substantially since the start of the recession, law firms and corporations are finding they can make do with far fewer in-house lawyers than before, squeezing those just starting their careers.As of this April, fewer than 70 percent of Valparaiso law school graduates from the previous spring were employed and fewer than half were in jobs that required a law license. Only three out of 131 graduates worked in large firms, which tend to pay more generous salaries.\u201cPeople are not being helped by going to these schools,\u201d Kyle McEntee, executive director of the advocacy group Law School Transparency, said of Valparaiso and other low-tier law schools. \u201cThe debt is really high, bar passage rates are horrendous, employment is horrendous.\u201dEven as employment prospects have dimmed, however, law school student debt has ballooned, rising from about $95,000 among borrowers at the average school in 2010 to about $112,000 in 2014, according to Mr. McEntee\u2019s group.Belatedly, many schools are starting to respond to this brutal reality, or at least the collapse in applications it has set off. In February, Valparaiso announced it was offering buyouts to tenured professors. As of May, 14 of 36 full-time faculty members had either accepted the package or retired. The law school plans to reduce its student body by roughly one-third over the next few years, from about 450 today.\u201cMaybe I was na\u00efve, but I didn\u2019t think it would be as stark,\u201d said Rosalie Levinson, a longtime constitutional law professor at Valparaiso who recently headed a committee on restructuring the school. \u201cThe number of tenured faculty that would be leaving \u2014 not gradually but immediately \u2014 just personally, that was difficult.\u201dBut from the perspective of the students caught up in the explosion of unrepayable law school debt, the shake-up at the school, and others like it, look rather pedestrian.Given the tectonic shifts in the legal landscape, the relevant issue may not be how much law schools like Valparaiso should shrink. Today the more important question is whether they should exist at all.If you drove west from the eastern edge of Valparaiso\u2019s campus early this spring, you would have passed a pawnshop, a discount cigarette outlet and, intriguingly, a sign announcing \u201cCaf\u00e9 available for rent,\u201d before reaching the heart of the city\u2019s downtown, which includes the county courthouse and a handful of law offices.When I met Mr. Acosta at one of the offices on an afternoon in late April, he was moving the last of his lawyer swag into the windowless space that will house his practice. He wasn\u2019t scheduled to start work for another few weeks, until after he was sworn into the state bar, but he had the giddiness of a man eager to try on his new professional identity.Mr. Acosta, who retains the erect manner and intense stare of his former colleagues in law enforcement, applied to law school planning to become a prosecutor. But he changed paths after briefly testing the local job market and finding his prospects grim.Unfortunately, the market for defense lawyers in the area was only slightly better. Although he received a few offers, none came with a salary or benefits. The firms offered him little more than a desk and a business card. Any revenue he brought in would have to be shared with the partners 50-50, and they would not be reciprocating.It was at this point that he decided to start his own firm. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to split the money and they\u2019re not doing anything, I\u2019m going to split the money with myself,\u201d he said.Actually, there are others who will be sharing in his income. Mr. Acosta recently became engaged to another Valparaiso law student, Erica Melendez, who graduated this spring and plans to open her own firm specializing in immigration work. Between them they will be nearly half a million dollars in the red while trying to run two businesses and raise Ms. Melendez\u2019s 5-year-old daughter.Still, Mr. Acosta and Ms. Melendez, who speaks fluent Spanish, are better positioned than many of their classmates, who don\u2019t have uniquely marketable skills that would allow them to set off on their own.Earlier that day, I joined five Valparaiso students for lunch at a Mexican restaurant near campus. The main topic of conversation was whether they were more concerned about passing the bar exam, which Valparaiso graduates have struggled to do in recent years, or finding employment.A student named Ethan Legg said that if he could just pass the bar, he could probably find something somewhere. To which his classmate Daria Anderson responded that she didn\u2019t see what good passing the bar would do if you were \u201cworking at Starbucks for less than $40,000 per year.\u201dMs. Anderson had been planning to buy a house for herself and her two children when she was accepted to law school. She had graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington with minimal debt thanks to scholarships, and managed to save about $10,000 working a variety of jobs over the next decade. Although she knew law school would be a financial strain, she decided she would regret not trying.\u201cI would have been sitting at some desk, in somebody\u2019s office, with some type of job, wondering, \u2018Should I have gone?\u2019\u201d she said.Today, she is over $100,000 in debt and her job search has been taxing. With few leads on a legal position, Ms. Anderson has set her sights on a so-called J.D.-advantaged job, such as vetting and negotiating a corporation\u2019s contracts with suppliers. The starting salary is likely to be in the mid-to-high five figures, but she hopes such a job could lead to a more senior position.For students like Ms. Anderson, the problem isn\u2019t just that the market for Valparaiso law graduates is saturated, although it is. Mr. Lucas, the law partner who rents space to Mr. Acosta, complained of a large \u201coversupply of lawyers\u201d in the area.It\u2019s that the market for all recent law school graduates has been relatively saturated.With big-firm jobs drying up, however, many of these graduates began competing for lower-paying spots at midsize firms, which also downsized, and certain government jobs they wouldn\u2019t have sought in an earlier era.\u201cThat takes those jobs off the table,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cIt has ripple effects all the way throughout the profession, so that a small law firm in northwest Indiana can say to recent grads: \u2018We want you to work for free. We won\u2019t pay you.\u2019\u201dLaw schools, for their part, seem strangely oblivious to all this. Officially, many stress the growing availability of jobs for which a law degree is preferred rather than required \u2014 the kind of job Ms. Anderson has been searching for. But given the vagueness of the category, Mr. Campos said, discounting the number of these jobs by 50 percent is a good rule of thumb.\u201cI counsel a lot of students and try to make them realize that a J.D.-advantaged job can be extremely useful,\u201d said Del Wright Jr., a Valparaiso tax law professor who is one of the school\u2019s most popular instructors.\u201cYou see all these businesses, \u2018We Buy Liens\u2019 \u2014 what exactly is going on there?\u201d he continued, explaining that buyers of tax liens can earn hefty state-sanctioned interest rates, as well as fees to get the liens removed. \u201cIf you are entrepreneurial but not the best lawyer, you might look into it.\u201dThe law school at Valparaiso occupies two buildings at the southwest corner of campus: a sprawling brown brick structure that looks as if it might house overflow personnel from a federal bureaucracy, and a smaller, much more elegant red brick building that sits cater-corner from the main compound. I toured them recently with Bruce Berner, a longtime law professor and associate dean at Valparaiso who retired in 2014 but remains a beloved presence on campus.Strolling through the corridors, Mr. Berner could not help pointing out the offices of colleagues who had accepted the buyout and would not be back in the fall. \u201cIvan, if it hadn\u2019t been for something like this situation, wouldn\u2019t have stopped,\u201d he said of Ivan Bodensteiner, a professor who had recently served as interim dean.When Mr. Berner joined the Valparaiso faculty in 1971, he was one of nine professors, and the school focused primarily on legal instruction. But in the mid- to late 1980s, he said, the school put an increasing emphasis on legal scholarship and recruited faculty members who could produce it. Across the country, many law schools were undergoing a similar evolution.It\u2019s no coincidence that the average law school faculty began to grow quickly around this time: Each professor was teaching fewer courses to make time for research. Mr. Berner said he went from teaching 15 or 16 credit hours a year \u2014 typically five classes \u2014 to no more than 12. Every law school seemed to want to emulate Harvard and Yale. (Valparaiso said the growth of its faculty was due in part to an American Bar Association mandate to make its curriculum more comprehensive.)It\u2019s also no coincidence that law schools raised the cost of attending, which helped cover the additional expense. Against the backdrop of a healthy demand for lawyers, fast-rising tuition did not discourage students, who could borrow most (and eventually all) of the cost from the government and frequently pay it back with relative ease. Law school applications generally increased over the next two decades.For Valparaiso, the upmarket strategy had the desired effect. Although the school had long enjoyed a solid reputation in northern Indiana, producing a thick roster of judges, politicians and business leaders, it began to attract applicants from a wider geographical area. Median scores on the Law School Admission Test began to creep up, eventually moving several points above 150, roughly the median for all test-takers nationally.\u201cWhen we were in our heyday, in the late \u201980s, \u201990s,\u201d Mr. Berner said, \u201cwe could always say to the top 10 percent, you could hit something big in Chicago if you wanted. Or D.C. or New York.\u201dIn 2004, former President George H. W. Bush spoke at a gala celebrating the school\u2019s 125th anniversary. It was around this time that Valparaiso, like many law schools, approached its peak competitiveness. Law school applications topped out at just over 100,000 nationally in 2004 and gradually began to decline.For Valparaiso, the bottom fell out in two stages. Applications dropped from over 3,000 in 2007 to under 1,600 in 2009, although this was partly because of a change in recruitment strategy, then below 1,200 a few years later.After this second drop, faculty members and administrators became anxious. \u201cI was chair of the admissions committee and we\u2019re sitting there watching this,\u201d Mr. Berner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201dThe committee agonized over whether it should accept fewer students or keep its class size roughly constant and admit weaker candidates. In the end, it opted for the latter, a decision Mr. Berner admits wasn\u2019t entirely on the merits, since fewer students would have meant less revenue.\u201cThere was a lot of pressure, of course, from the central administration to keep the numbers up,\u201d he said. (Mark A. Heckler, the university president, said that admissions decisions were entirely up to the law school but that the financial model was for the school to fund itself.)By 2014, the limitations of the strategy had become apparent: The figures the school reported for the rate at which its graduates passed the Indiana bar exam, which had already been dipping, crashed to about 61 percent, from about 77 percent the year before. An enormous number of students wouldn\u2019t be able to work as lawyers in the state even if jobs were theoretically available.Andrea Lyon, who was just beginning her first semester as dean of the law school, called a mandatory meeting for all third-year students, to review the grim numbers and urge them to take a handful of remedial bar courses the school was offering. \u201cIt was a panicked meeting,\u201d said Chris Freiberg, who graduated from the law school in 2015.(\u201cI felt I had to address this right away,\u201d Dean Lyon said. \u201cSome students may have viewed it as panic, but that\u2019s not what it was.\u201d)But the following year, bar passage rates ticked up only a few points. The problem was that these rates tend to be a broadly predictable function of scores on the Law School Admission Test. With average test scores dropping as the school relaxed its entry criteria, there were limits to how much the school could improve its bar results.Valparaiso was, in effect, caught in a deflating financial bubble, one most law schools were slow to heed because of the government\u2019s role in financing legal education. Applications ultimately tumbled about 40 percent nationally between 2010 and 2015, and by a roughly similar percentage at Valparaiso.One telltale sign of the bursting bubble was that more prestigious schools began poaching the students of lower-ranked schools after their first year. \u201cWe were losing students to Indiana University,\u201d said Professor Levinson at Valparaiso. \u201cWe lose two to three a year of our honors students to Notre Dame.\u201dBy the fall of 2015, the university\u2019s central administration began to debate several options for overhauling the law school; among the more drastic alternatives were to close it or merge it with another school. In the end, the leadership decided that shrinking the school would suffice.By that point, the faculty put up little resistance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s moral to take someone\u2019s money who can\u2019t make it,\u201d Dean Lyon told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201dMr. Berner, for his part, feels a tinge of regret when he looks back on the years after the 2009 recession. \u201cEveryone had good intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could go back, I think we should have erred a little more on the side of turning people down.\u201dOne side of the top row in Prof. Stephen Wilks\u2019s secured transactions class last semester belonged to a group of five students he named the \u201clegion of boom.\u201dIf you teach at Valparaiso Law School, it\u2019s the legion of boom that makes you believe you are on the path of righteousness. The students radiate intelligence and prepare for class scrupulously.Unusual among their classmates, four of the five had lined up jobs well before graduation, including a broad-shouldered Iowan named Jeremy Hahn, who will be joining the general counsel\u2019s office of a large corporation in Des Moines.You don\u2019t have to talk to Mr. Hahn for very long to figure out that he would succeed in just about any terrain you airlifted him into. In addition to being near the top of his class, he was president of the business law society, editor in chief of the student law journal and head of the graduation steering committee.On the day I turned up, Professor Wilks had stumped his students with an obscure question about collateral. \u201cIf you\u2019d missed this, you would have lost one-third of the available points for this essay question,\u201d he gently chided the class. When I later asked Mr. Hahn if he had known the answer, he admitted that he did, but said he preferred not to call attention to himself for validation.It\u2019s easy to assume that Valparaiso\u2019s decision to scale back its class size means that going forward, the law school will consist much more of people like Mr. Hahn and his fellow legionnaires. If that were the case, the decision might be completely rational.But in reality, that stands almost no chance of coming to pass. That\u2019s because the way Valparaiso and other lower-ranked schools lure students like Mr. Hahn is to offer sizable scholarships, and the only way they can afford these scholarships is if a large proportion of other students pay full freight.Inevitably, many of these sticker-price payers are weak students who lack better options. Research by Prof. Jerome M. Organ, an expert on law school economics at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis, shows that students with low test scores and undergraduate grade-point averages tend to subsidize the stars; this is especially true of third- and fourth-tier schools like Valparaiso. It\u2019s the marginal students who pay the bills, not students like Mr. Hahn.In such a world, schools like Valparaiso essentially face the following choice: Admit a large number of marginal students, or shut down.In the meantime, Valparaiso must keep taking risks on a lot of students, a reality the administration does not exactly hide.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should stop taking chances; I just think we need to take chances intelligently and thoughtfully,\u201d Dean Lyon said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve taught for any length of time, you know pretty quickly if someone has that hunger to do a good job. That makes up for a lot.\u201dA few hours after I spoke with Dean Lyon I drove about 75 miles east to a Meijer store in Goshen, Ind., where I met a 2015 Valparaiso Law School graduate named Sarah Tapia.As a child, Ms. Tapia had siblings who were in and out of jail. She decided in high school that she would become a lawyer to help people like them. \u201cI kind of grew up with that my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of money, because of race, they never really got a fair chance at justice.\u201dShe attended Goshen College, where she studied history, and was admitted to two law schools: Valparaiso and a for-profit school in North Carolina, Charlotte School of Law, that won full American Bar Association accreditation only in 2011.Ms. Tapia struggled her first semester at Valparaiso, but she said her grades steadily improved after that. After graduation, she took a bar prep class and threw herself into studying full time, undeterred by her \u201cmassive\u201d debt load. When she found out she failed, she took a job in the clothing department of Meijer while she prepared to take the test again this past February. But not long before I showed up, she found out that she had failed that test, too.Ms. Tapia is a small woman with long brown hair who often looks down when she speaks. But it would be a mistake to confuse this with a lack of conviction. She urged me to watch the Netflix documentary series \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d which raised questions about the murder conviction of a man named Steven Avery. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I went to law school to do,\u201d she said.From the perspective of an admissions committee looking to take a chance on a high-risk applicant, Ms. Tapia must have presented a compelling case. She had already defied long odds by graduating from college. She had an obvious passion for the law.She had that unteachable impulse to succeed that Dean Lyon said she was looking for. Even today, with two strikes against her, she is determined to keep taking the bar exam until she passes it. There is no doubt in her mind that she will one day be a practicing lawyer, and she may well be right.Still, in the meantime, she has a crushing amount of debt and a job that doesn\u2019t pay her enough to so much as dent it.\u201cWhy does Valpo have an economic structure that looks like Harvard Law School\u2019s?\u201d asked Mr. Campos, the University of Colorado expert on the prospects of recent law school graduates. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to do it. It\u2019s why they have to charge Harvardesque prices.\u201dTwo generations ago, someone like Ms. Tapia could have attended Valparaiso and still made it financially even if her legal career didn\u2019t pan out. Today, that\u2019s simply not possible.\u201cThe bottom line here is that institutions like Valparaiso clearly were fulfilling a valuable role until they were swept up in various forms of craziness in higher education,\u201d Mr. Campos continued.I asked Ms. Tapia if she ever regretted her decision to go to law school. She said she sometimes wondered if \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t have done this, maybe this isn\u2019t what I was supposed to do with my life,\u201d but those moments are pretty fleeting.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade my law degree for anything,\u201d she added. \u201cI would trade the debt.\u201dAn article last Sunday about shrinking job prospects and mounting debt for law students misstated the timetable under which the government would forgive the debt incurred by John Acosta, a graduate of Valparaiso University Law School who is setting up his own criminal law practice. It would be forgiven in 20 years, not 25 years.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the I.R.S.\u2019s treatment of the forgiven amount of Mr. Acosta\u2019s loan. It will probably treat that amount as taxable income; it is not a certainty that it will treat it as such.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Won the Keys to Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byChina Rules10 PhotosSHANGHAI \u2014 Disney had pushed China too hard, putting the company\u2019s plans for a new theme park here in limbo. Now, Robert A. Iger wanted to kick the yearslong negotiations into high gear.Mr. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, took a corporate jet to Shanghai in February 2008 to meet with the city\u2019s new Communist Party boss, Yu Zhengsheng. Over dinner at a state guesthouse, Mr. Iger offered a more conciliatory approach, setting the tone for the next phase of talks.After that, Disney substantially dialed back its demands. In addition to handing over a large piece of the profit, the control-obsessed company would give the government a role in running the park. Disney was also prepared to drop its longstanding insistence on a television channel.For Disney, such moves were once unthinkable. Giving up on the Disney Channel meant abandoning the company\u2019s proven brand-building strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to get everything we want,\u201d Mr. Iger recalled saying at the time.Mr. Iger\u2019s trip and the new attitude in the talks that followed appeased Chinese officials. Before long, they had struck a landmark deal to build the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, opening China to a singularly American brand and setting the pace for multinational companies to do business in the country.But Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with the Communist Party. While that partnership has made it easier to get things done in China, it has also given the government influence over everything from the price of admission to the types of rides at the park.Worried that importing classic rides would reek of cultural imperialism, Disney left out stalwarts such as Space Mountain, the Jungle Cruise and It\u2019s a Small World. Instead, 80 percent of the Shanghai rides, like the \u201cTron\u201d lightcycle roller coaster, are unique, a move that pleased executives at the company\u2019s Chinese partner, the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, who made multiple trips to Disney headquarters in California to hash out blueprint details.Disney then ran with the idea, infusing the park with Chinese elements. The Shanghai resort\u2019s signature restaurant, the Wandering Moon Teahouse, has rooms designed to represent different areas of the country. The restaurant is billed as honoring the \u201crestless, creative spirit\u201d of Chinese poets.Such accommodation is becoming increasingly common. A growing number of multinationals have agreed to cooperate with the Chinese state through alliances, joint ventures or partnerships, all in the hopes of garnering more favorable treatment and gaining access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States.\u201cThis is part of the China trade-off,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cIf your market is so big, we\u2019ll accept rules and regulations we wouldn\u2019t in other parts of the world.\u201dFor Disney, if all goes as planned, the Shanghai park will create an ecosystem of demand in China for movies, toys, clothes, video games, books and TV programs. Mr. Iger has called Shanghai the \u201cgreatest opportunity the company has had since Walt Disney himself bought land in Central Florida\u201d in the 1960s.That site, of course, became Walt Disney World, a group of four theme parks that attracts roughly 40 million visitors annually. About 11 million visitors are expected next year at the Shanghai park, with annual attendance estimated to reach 20 million within a few years, according to Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If all doesn\u2019t go as planned, Disney will suffer the wrath of Wall Street, which expects the resort to offset slower growth at ESPN, the company\u2019s longtime profit engine, and some of its other theme parks. The last thing Disney wants is another Disneyland Paris, a money pit that suffered from cultural miscues and, after 24 years, is still struggling to turn a profit. Hong Kong Disneyland, which is relatively small, has had mixed financial results since opening in 2005.While he delegated certain duties to lieutenants, Mr. Iger has been the guiding force. He pre-tasted the food, which will include items like pork knuckles and Donald Duck-shaped waffles, and decided which characters would appear in the parade. He has held face-to-face talks with Chinese presidents, prime ministers and propaganda officials.Mr. Iger, 65, has sought a personal relationship with China\u2019s paramount leader, President Xi Jinping. After Mr. Iger learned that Mr. Xi\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader, had visited Disneyland in 1980, he pressed his staff to find a photograph. A color photograph shows the president\u2019s father, who died in 2002, wearing a Mao suit, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Mr. Iger presented it to the Chinese leader as a gift and a symbol of their partnership.When Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle last September, Mr. Iger was among the American executives on hand to welcome him. At the White House state dinner a few days later, Mr. Iger was seated at Mr. Xi\u2019s table. Just last month, Mr. Iger flew to Beijing to meet the president at the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the fruits of efforts over the years,\u201d a smiling Mr. Xi told Mr. Iger at a public meeting between the men at the Great Hall of the People in early May. \u201cAnd I believe the new cooperation will continue to yield new outcomes.\u201dIt may be all smiles now, but Mickey Mouse knows all too well what can happen when the Middle Kingdom gets mad.The year was 1997, and Disney had finally found a bit of success in China. \u201cThe Dragon Club,\u201d a Disney cartoon series, was popular in Chinese homes, and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d had given Disney its first big hit in Chinese cinemas. But then came \u201cKundun.\u201dAs part of a now-defunct effort to make films for more sophisticated audiences, Disney agreed to back the director Martin Scorsese, who wanted to make \u201cKundun,\u201d about China\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Chinese government, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, denounced the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.In the end, Disney decided that it could not let an overseas government influence its decision to distribute a movie in the United States. \u201cKundun\u201d was released, and China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling \u201cThe Dragon Club.\u201d\u201cAll of our business in China stopped overnight,\u201d Disney\u2019s chief executive at the time, Michael D. Eisner, recalled.Although \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was screened in Shanghai in the 1930s, Disney really had no measurable business in China until decades later, when Mr. Eisner secured Sunday evening placement for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons on the country\u2019s biggest state-run broadcaster. That led to Mickey\u2019s Corner kiosks that sold consumer goods like Minnie Mouse-branded shampoo, and to more television shows.By the time of the \u201cKundun\u201d debacle, the demand was clearly there. Mr. Eisner just needed to undo the damage.Disney hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and mounted an intense lobbying effort. In October 1998, Mr. Eisner met Zhu Rongji, who had just been named prime minister, at China\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Mr. Eisner apologized for \u201cKundun,\u201d calling it a \u201cstupid mistake,\u201d according to a transcript of the meeting.\u201cThis film was a form of insult to our friends, but other than journalists, very few people in the world ever saw it,\u201d Mr. Eisner said during the meeting. (\u201cKundun\u201d bombed, taking in just $5.7 million against a production budget of about $30 million.)Mr. Eisner said the company had learned a lesson. And he introduced Mr. Iger, then Disney\u2019s international president, as the person who would carry on negotiations for a theme park. The Chinese prime minister responded favorably. Land in Shanghai, he said, had already been set aside.And just like that, the door to China started to reopen.The negotiations that followed were slow and painful. Disney had to navigate a thicket of agencies, bureaucrats and officials. At one point, Disney essentially had to start over in Shanghai, after a senior Chinese official was abruptly arrested on corruption charges unrelated to the park.There were sticking points large and small. Who would control the park? What kind of transportation infrastructure would support it? How were Disney\u2019s nightly fireworks shows going to work in smoggy Shanghai? There was also the not-so-minor matter of introducing Disney characters to a country whose icon, since the Communists took power in 1949, was Mao.\u201cDisney had to educate the Chinese government on how they operate, and the government wanted to persuade Disney that they needed a local partner to make this thing work,\u201d said Tang Jun, one of Mr. Iger\u2019s former lieutenants in China.By 2009, the Chinese government was finally on board. It took a 57 percent stake in the Shanghai resort, which includes revenue from hotels, restaurants and merchandise sold on the grounds. Disney also gave the government a 30 percent piece of the Disney management company that runs the property.It was in stark contrast to the deal with Hong Kong. Desperate to end a tourism slump, Hong Kong had given Disney breathtaking terms, including providing a majority of the construction funds. Disney gave up no management control.Confetti was blasted into the air. A 50-member children\u2019s choir sang as Chinese dancers and drummers paraded onstage. Mickey and Minnie Mouse frolicked in traditional Chinese costumes.\u201cThis is a defining moment in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cAlong with our partner, the Shanghai Shendi Group, today I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Shanghai Disney Resort.\u201dWhen the Communist Party first invited overseas companies into the country in 1979, global businesses had to team up with the state. It wasn\u2019t pretty.As commercial interests clashed with socialist principles, there were wage disputes, allegations of intellectual property theft and conflicts over corporate strategy. To put it in the parlance of a Chinese proverb, it was like two people sleeping in the \u201csame bed, dreaming different dreams.\u201dPepsi found itself managing a tanning factory, as part of its Chinese partnership. McDonnell Douglas claimed that some machine tools had been diverted to a factory that made missiles, in violation of United States rules. The American and Chinese partners in Beijing Jeep disagreed over quality control.\u201cI now tell people, \u2018If you don\u2019t have to do a joint venture, don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Don St. Pierre Sr., an American businessman who worked for Beijing Jeep.After the blowups, China started to allow some companies to go it alone. But Disney didn\u2019t have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the park\u2019s front gate.The partnership is \u201cstructured so that it will work,\u201d said Mr. Iger. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount riding on it.\u201dBut Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade China\u2019s economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the city\u2019s easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disney\u2019s site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises \u201cperformances\u201d by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.\u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201dThe partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disney\u2019s new resort.The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the world\u2019s largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the park\u2019s television and advertising budget, since it controls the city\u2019s biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.\u201cThe more partners you have, the more potential conflicts,\u201d said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.\u201cEach of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations,\u201d he added. A multinational must then \u201ccontend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.\u201dWhen Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesn\u2019t require a ticket.\u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wang\u2019s criticism as \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. \u201cWe made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and there\u2019s a cost to that,\u201d he said.Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of China\u2019s political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disney\u2019s expansion and growth.\u201cI suggest that we shouldn\u2019t allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built\u201d in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. \u201cIf children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.\u201dDisney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with China\u2019s propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the company\u2019s global platform to \u201cintroduce more about China to the world.\u201d And he has done just that.\u201cWhen global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China,\u201d said John A. Quelch, who teaches at Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in China. \u201cThey need to demonstrate that they are willing to promote things the government is interested in.\u201dMr. Iger is trying especially to give Shanghai Disney some Chinese flair. He instructed park designers to infuse as many Chinese elements as possible.Builders collected indigenous trees from all around China, including a 59-foot chestnut oak from Zhejiang Province, to adorn the grounds. A \u201cTarzan\u201d show was directed by Li Xining, an acrobatics expert who once worked for the Chengdu Military Area Command under the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The Broadway version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will be performed entirely in Mandarin \u2014 a first.Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.\u201cWhat are we doing here that will make this park successful in China?\u201d Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. \u201cOne of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that it\u2019s theirs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Populist Anger Upends Politics on Both Sides of the Atlantic", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 From Brussels to Berlin to Washington, leaders of the Western democratic world awoke Friday morning to a blunt, once-unthinkable rebuke delivered by the flinty citizens of a small island nation in the North Atlantic. Populist anger against the established political order had finally boiled over.The British had rebelled.Asked where public anger was greatest, Mr. Trump said: \u201cU.K. U.S. There\u2019s plenty of other places. This will not be the last.\u201dEven as the European Union began to grapple with a new and potentially destabilizing period of political uncertainty, the British vote also will inevitably be seized upon as further evidence of deepening public unease with the global economic order. Globalization and economic liberalization have produced winners and losers \u2014 and the big \u201cLeave\u201d vote in economically stagnant regions of Britain suggests that many of those who have lost out are fed up.Time and again, the European Union has navigated political crises during the past decade with a Whac-a-Mole response that has maintained the status quo and the bloc\u2019s lumbering forward momentum toward greater integration \u2014 without directly confronting the roiling public discontent beneath the surface.But now the question is whether the dam has broken: Before breakfast on Friday, anti-Europe leaders in France and the Netherlands were rejoicing and demanding similar referendums on European Union membership.From its outset, the European Union was a project of elites, one that, at times, moved forward without a clear popular mandate from the masses. Adopting the common currency was deeply controversial in some places, including Germany. The issue of democratic legitimacy has always hung over the unification project, since many significant steps were achieved through treaties that stirred considerable resistance in some countries.European unity remained popular, particularly as the bloc delivered undeniable economic and social progress. But the class frictions beneath the project worsened in the past decade, as the European economy has been battered by recession and an uneven recovery.It is not clear whether the message is getting through to more establishment leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, or what lessons they are taking from the shock of the British exit.European leaders were under pressure to reassure the European public, and the world, that the bloc was not at risk of unraveling. For decades, the European Union had moved forward, always expanding in size and influence. Britain has now reversed that trend.\u201cWe\u2019re completely in uncharted territory,\u201d said Hans Kundnani, a Berlin-based expert in European politics at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Mr. Kundnani said the British vote exposed a contradiction at the core of the European project. European leaders define success as steering member states toward greater political and economic integration. And many of the bloc\u2019s inefficiencies and dysfunctions can be traced to the unfinished work of strengthening European institutions and achieving greater integration between member states in areas such as banking, finance, security and defense.But public opinion is deeply skeptical of this \u201cmore Europe\u201d agenda. Far-right populist leaders have stoked public anxieties and resurgent nationalism by lashing out against immigrants, while portraying the European capital, Brussels, as a bastion of political elites out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people. Far-left populists have demanded a re-examination of the neoliberal economics of free trade and limited regulation, while resisting efforts to deconstruct the social democratic welfare state.\u201cThe E.U. robs us of our money, our identity, our democracy, our sovereignty,\u201d said Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom. \u201cThe elites want more E.U. They think they know better than the people. They look down on the people and want to decide in their place. They want us to be ruled by undemocratic, unaccountable bureaucrats in a faraway place like Brussels.\u201dAnd permeating everything is the weak Continental economy and the crippling debt burden across Southern Europe.\u201cThe E.U. is kind of trapped,\u201d Mr. Kundnani said. \u201cOn the one hand, the instinct will be to move ahead with further integration and reassure the rest of the world that the European Union is not unraveling. But that is very difficult because of the fault lines that exist.\u201dThe British government formally notified the European Union on March 29 that it intends to withdraw from the bloc.He added: \u201cThey are trapped because moving ahead is very difficult. Moving backwards is the last thing they want to do. And the status quo is unsustainable.\u201dBritain has always been a skeptical member of the European household. During the 1990s, Britain chose to keep the pound and not to join the countries sharing a common European currency, the euro. Many of the British concerns about the euro proved true, undermining the bloc\u2019s credibility, even as Britain has remained mostly insulated against the Continent\u2019s still unresolved euro crisis.Before the referendum, some European officials portrayed Britain as an idiosyncratic case that should not be seen as a bellwether for the Continent. But that is a hard argument to make. In France, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front party is experiencing steadily rising popularity as the country prepares for national elections next year. In Germany, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany polled strongly in recent state elections.Donald Tusk, one of the European Union\u2019s top leaders, has started to talk about the risks facing the political establishment. At a speech last month before Europe\u2019s coalition of center-right political parties, Mr. Tusk cautioned his fellow political elites.Britons will make a momentous choice on Thursday that could matter more for their future than any ordinary election.\u201cObsessed with the idea of instant and total integration, we failed to notice that ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our euro-enthusiasm,\u201d said Mr. Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of all the 28 member states in the bloc. \u201cDisillusioned with great visions of the future, they demand that we cope with the present reality better than we have been doing until now.\u201dYet taking action may be difficult, since most analysts say the European Union is paralyzed by the coming national elections in 2017 in France and Germany, the two most powerful countries in the bloc. Neither the French nor the German government is eager to endorse sweeping initiatives for more European integration before the elections out of fear of a populist whipping at the polls.\u201cEurope is very divided and the main European country, Germany, has no will or skills to lead the union \u2014 and is approaching important national elections,\u201d said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes. \u201cFrance is a country in crisis, while Italy has its own problems. I can\u2019t see who would assume a European leadership capable of producing a deeper integration process.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere is a very widespread rejection of politics everywhere. There is a similar mood in the United States, an antipolitical sentiment.\u201dFew industries in Britain are likely to be more directly hit than the financial services industry in London. Damon Hoff, a hedge fund manager, said that he had voted to stay in the European Union, but that he understood the sentiments of those who had voted to leave.\u201cEuropeans don\u2019t feel more prosperous,\u201d he said. \u201cEuropeans don\u2019t feel more empowered. And certainly the British don\u2019t.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou want to be part of something that continuously evolves. Does the European Union feel like it is evolving? No.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting from Turnberry, Scotland; Gaia Pianigiani from Rome; and Milan Schreuer from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guy Hands Resumes Legal Fight With Citigroup Over EMI Deal", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Nearly a decade ago, Guy Hands, the British founder of the European private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners, made a big bet on the storied music group EMI.The acquisition \u2013 announced in 2007 and valued at 4 billion pounds, or about $5.8 billion \u2013 was the largest private equity transaction ever completed in Britain. But it proved to be a disastrous one for Mr. Hands, damaging his reputation as an astute deal maker and erasing much of his personal wealth.Facing a crushing amount of debt, EMI was seized by its lenders in 2011 and acquired by the Universal Music Group the next year.Mr. Hands has placed much of the blame at the feet of Citigroup, which was Terra Firma\u2019s preferred bank before a falling out over the EMI transaction. He initially sued in New York, claiming that the American banking giant made a variety of misrepresentations ahead of an auction for EMI in 2007 that encouraged him to pursue a deal.A jury in Manhattan found in 2010 that Citigroup was not liable in the matter, but that verdict was thrown out by an appeals court. On Tuesday, Mr. Hands resumed his long-running legal battle with the American bank, this time in London.The latest case is centered around \u201coral misrepresentations made to Mr. Hands in 2007 by three senior executives of Citigroup,\u201d Anthony Grabiner, a lawyer representing Terra Firma, said in court in London on Tuesday.Terra Firma is seeking \u00a31.5 billion in damages, reflecting its full investment, as well as lost profits and management fees it claims it would have earned if it had not invested in EMI. Citigroup provided \u00a32.5 billion in financing for the transaction.\u201cAs with the previous claim, this case is entirely without merit,\u201d Citigroup said on Tuesday. \u201cCiti did not make any dishonest statements to Guy Hands or Terra Firma throughout the auction process for EMI and is confident the U.K. trial will confirm this.\u201dMr. Hands is expected to take the stand on Wednesday as the first witness in the case, which is being heard by a judge, rather than a jury, and is expected to run into July.\u201cYour lordship will have to decide who is telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Grabiner said in court on Tuesday.At the time of the Terra Firma deal, EMI was one of four major record labels worldwide, but it faced financial pressures as consumers moved away from buying compact discs and record albums in favor of digital music.Despite pressure on its results, the company remained an attractive takeover target to buyout firms. EMI\u2019s stable of artists over the years included the Beatles, Coldplay and Katy Perry.In November 2006, a consortium of funds managed by the private equity group Permira tried unsuccessfully to buy the company (and Terra Firma briefly considered a takeover proposal at the time.)In April 2007, after two profit warnings, EMI decided to put itself up for sale in an auction, with Cerberus Capital Management and Fortress Investment Group initially expressing interest.As he did in the New York case, Mr. Hands claims he was misled by David Wormsley, Citigroup\u2019s head of investment banking in Britain and a longtime banker to Mr. Hands, about plans by Cerberus to offer a competing bid in an auction for EMI.Terra Firma ultimately was the only bidder in May 2007.Mr. Hands also claims he was misled by two former Citigroup executives about the financial health of EMI: Michael Klein, Citigroup\u2019s former head of global banking; and Chad Leat, then co-chief of Citigroup\u2019s global credit markets.\u201cWe are confident in the merits of our claims and look forward to a positive result,\u201d a Terra Firma spokesman said on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3.5 Billion Cash Infusion", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor.Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom\u2019s main investment fund, in one of the largest-ever investments into a privately held start-up.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known for venture capital investing, though some members of its royal family have made some deals. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, for instance, has invested in Lyft, a competitor of Uber.\u201cWe appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,\u201d Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders and its chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cOur experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.\u201dThe investment came together after David Plouffe, an Uber board member, traveled to the Middle East in March and was invited to the Saudi fund for a briefing. The discussions heated up thereafter, culminating in the deal.Uber has drawn capital from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds, like that of Qatar, have also invested.Other tech darlings have been busy raising money from private investors as well, pushing back any need to join the public stock markets.Uber has been spending not only to expand but also to defend its territory \u2014 which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries \u2014 against incumbents in regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country.The Middle East is among Uber\u2019s increasingly important overseas markets; the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million there. Uber has rolled out its service in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.The start-up said that it now has over 395,000 active riders in the Middle East, up fivefold from a year ago, and 19,000 drivers.Uber said expanding its service may be a boon for Saudi Arabia, a country where women are not allowed to drive because of fatwas, or religious edicts, issued by conservative Muslim clerics that uphold a distinct segregation between the sexes. There is no formal law prohibiting women from driving in the region.\u201cOf course we think women should be allowed to drive,\u201d said Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman. \u201cIn the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn\u2019t exist before \u2014 and we\u2019re incredibly proud of that.\u201dStill, Uber did not say that it planned to hire women drivers in the country, unlike in most other regions where the company operates.Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, who sits on Uber\u2019s public policy advisory board, has worked with Uber to usher the service into the country and has the support of female users of the service, said in an interview that the investment was a clear sign of change coming to the region.Saudi Arabia has looked for ways to expand its economy beyond oil, with the Public Investment Fund \u2014 which is expected to grow to $2 trillion under management after the country\u2019s state-owned oil company goes public \u2014 serving as a crucial part of that strategy. The $3.5 billion investment in Uber is out of the Saudi fund\u2019s roughly $750 billion in total United States assets.Part of Uber\u2019s possible attraction in bringing in a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia\u2019s is that such investors have far longer investment horizons than venture capitalists, who generally seek to cash out their investments after seven to 10 years.As part of the investment, the managing director at the Public Investment Fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, will take a seat on Uber\u2019s board, joining Mr. Kalanick and other directors, including Arianna Huffington.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand how this company has improved urban mobility around the world, and we\u2019re looking forward to being part of that progress,\u201d Mr. Al Rumayyan said in a statement.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Donor Emerges as Key Witness in Corruption Case. What Else Does He Know?", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byOf all the charges and the allegations in a 17-page criminal complaint accusing a powerful New York City union leader of corruption, perhaps the most far-reaching development was woven into the legal boilerplate, essentially hiding in plain sight.A person, referred to as \u201cCW-1,\u201d for Cooperating Witness 1, had agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The cooperator\u2019s name was not mentioned in the complaint unsealed on Wednesday, but several people with knowledge of the matter said it was Jona S. Rechnitz, a central figure in one of the half-dozen continuing federal corruption investigations focused on Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising.But the significance of his decision to join the roster of government witnesses could go far beyond the case against the union leader, and have wide-ranging consequences for Mr. de Blasio.The complaint in the corruption case, along with statements by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York (whose office brought it), and interviews with people with knowledge of the fund-raising inquiries, strongly suggest that Mr. Rechnitz could serve as an important witness in at least one of the fund-raising matters.At a news conference on Wednesday announcing the charges against Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Bharara declined to answer questions about the identity of CW-1 and the degree to which the witness could be helpful in other cases.But he noted that \u201cthe complaint does say that he is assisting other investigations as well; that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201dAlmost all of the fund-raising investigations are being conducted by the same group of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors \u2014 two squads of agents known as C4 and C14 and the prosecutors in Mr. Bharara\u2019s public corruption unit \u2014 that handled the case against Mr. Seabrook, who was arrested along with Murray Huberfeld, a hedge fund financier.While Mr. Bharara also declined to answer questions about the fund-raising inquiries during the news conference, he left little doubt that there were more public corruption cases on the horizon.\u201cAs those of you who come here often appreciate, it is seldom the case that the bringing of a particular charge at a particular date is the end of the matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still investigating lots of different things, and you should expect to see me again.\u201dHowever, the complaint notes that Mr. Rechnitz has pleaded guilty in connection with the corruption case, \u201camong other things,\u201d and is \u201cproviding information to the government in the hopes of obtaining leniency when he is sentenced.\u201dIt also says that Mr. Rechnitz has undergone \u201cextensive debriefings,\u201d and that the information he has provided has been \u201creliable and corroborated by independent evidence.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Rechnitz, Alan Levine, declined to comment.Investigators and others briefed on the matter have said the fund-raising inquiry that had once been focused on Mr. Rechnitz now centers on whether city officials provided him with some benefit for his real estate business in exchange for campaign contributions.The development represented a stark turn of fate for Mr. Rechnitz, 33, who came to New York from Los Angeles to build things: condominiums, hotels and the like. But as he gained a footing in the city, he found that it was easier to build relationships, often founded on money.He and another businessman, Jeremiah Reichberg, who also raised money for the mayor and served on the committee that planned his 2014 inaugural celebration, spent a good deal of time cultivating roughly a score of senior police officials, lavishing some with gifts and trips.Mr. Reichberg, according to people briefed on the matter, is the man identified in the criminal complaint as Co-Conspirator 1 or CC-1, and also was involved in the alleged scheme, although he was not charged.The complaint details a series of trips to the Dominican Republic, Israel and elsewhere that Mr. Seabrook took with Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Reichberg and a top police official. All were paid for by Mr. Rechnitz.The investigation has so far uncovered misconduct by nearly a dozen mostly senior police officials, including five chiefs who have filed for retirement as a result, and a number of other senior officials, who have been transferred to administrative posts pending possible discipline. One detective has been fired.Few of them are likely to be happy about their interactions with Mr. Rechnitz. Indeed, they may share the feelings Mr. de Blasio expressed on Wednesday, which seemed to tumble out when a reporter asked about his connection to the businessman.\u201cI wish I never met the guy,\u201d the mayor said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Iowa, Ted Cruz Savors Lead Role", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byMr. Cruz has gotten to this point by amassing an energized and growing coalition of Christian activists and anti-establishment Republicans, an extensive organization and a deep reservoir of money. But he is also benefiting from a splintered opposition that does not have either the money or the will to halt his rise.Some supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for example, privately say they believe Mr. Cruz cannot be defeated in Iowa. While those claims may in part be gamesmanship \u2014 an attempt to build up Mr. Cruz\u2019s expectations here \u2014 more revealing is that neither Mr. Rubio nor the well-financed outside group allied with his campaign has spent money on television advertising in Iowa assailing Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz, obscured for much of last year by a shifting cast of attention-getting rivals, is relishing the turnabout.Joined on his 45-foot bus by a phalanx of aides and a camera crew from Showtime, and with a second motor coach carrying a swelling group of reporters, Mr. Cruz boasted about the fresh denunciations being directed his way. \u201cI guess something has changed,\u201d he said with barely concealed delight.But what gives his team pause \u2014 and what is to many Iowa Republicans the crucial question leading to Feb. 1 \u2014 is whether Mr. Trump will abruptly end his nice-guy routine with Mr. Cruz and begin attacking him in ads and behind the microphone at his big, highly publicized rallies.\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned about that,\u201d Representative Steve King of Iowa, Mr. Cruz\u2019s highest-profile Iowa surrogate and travel partner for part of the week, said about the possibility of a Trump offensive. \u201cTrump is so completely unpredictable, we don\u2019t know what he might do campaign-wise.

Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThey\u2019re fighting with rocks against bazookas,\u201d Mr. Strawn said.Mr. Cruz has become far more entrenched in Iowa than Mr. Gingrich was at this point in his campaign four years ago. With many conservative activists here feeling a sense of fury toward their party, Mr. Cruz has emerged as the candidate most effectively channeling that boiling anger.Conversations with dozens of Cruz supporters suggest that the dismay Iowa Republicans feel toward Washington is prompting them to coalesce behind Mr. Cruz, whom they see as the only viable conservative contender. \u201cWe need a winner,\u201d Susie Lee, 50, said Monday before Mr. Cruz made a late-night stop at a diner in Missouri Valley. \u201cHuckabee and Santorum are great guys, but they haven\u2019t been in office like Senator Cruz has, fighting.\u201dPamela Oviatt of Logan, a Santorum backer four years ago, showed up before 9 p.m. for Mr. Cruz\u2019s 10:30 appearance. She said that among activists, there was little talk of any rivals. \u201cCruz is the only one that\u2019s in the political system now that anybody is looking at twice,\u201d she said.Ms. Oviatt\u2019s distinction about Mr. Cruz\u2019s being a part of the political system remains a worry for the senator\u2019s backers.Iowa Republican leaders say that he is the preferred candidate among traditional activists. \u201cHe\u2019s winning the within-the-system, anti-establishment folks,\u201d said Don Kass, the Republican chairman in Plymouth County. But the party leaders also say that Mr. Trump is garnering support from people new to the caucuses.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s backers here say they are confident that his attacks on the political status quo will bring out thousands of Iowans who have not previously caucused or even registered as Republicans, and his campaign is trying to register supporters as Republicans. But state party records indicate only modest gains in the numbers of registered Republicans over recent months, a pattern little different from that in past election years. There are now a little more than 612,000 registered Iowa Republicans. In early August, there were about 609,000.The threat Mr. Trump presents has nevertheless cast a shadow of uncertainty over the caucuses and the party. And that, in its own way, has aided Mr. Cruz: Mark Lundberg, the Sioux County Republican chairman, said he thought Mr. Cruz was one of the few candidates running who could appeal to angry Trump legions if Mr. Trump falls short.Mindful of this, Mr. Cruz has seldom mentioned Mr. Trump except to praise him. This week, however, he has started invoking Mr. Trump for another reason.Asked about attacks by some of his rivals, Mr. Cruz said that Mr. Trump was the target of a similar barrage a few weeks ago. He also told diners at a steakhouse in Carroll to expect ads assailing him to be unleashed in the coming weeks \u2014 the sort of onslaught that a true underdog would never receive.His eyes wandering to a political flier on a nearby table, Mr. Cruz seized on a bit of evidence. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a mailer some of y\u2019all may have seen: \u2018Ted Cruz is dangerous!\u2019\u00a0\u201d he read.\u201cYou know what? To the Washington cartel, to the career politicians there that are getting fat and happy and want the gravy train to keep going, that\u2019s exactly right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blue Coat to Sell Itself to Symantec, Abandoning I.P.O. Plans", "Date": "2016-06-12", "News": "Supported byNow, the cybersecurity software company plans to sell itself to Symantec instead.Blue Coat said late on Sunday that it would sell itself to Symantec for $4.65 billion. As part of the deal, Blue Coat\u2019s chief executive, Greg Clark, will take over as the chief executive of the combined security software maker.The deal will create a big provider of security products, both the traditional antivirus kind that has long been Symantec\u2019s focus and the newer online protection services in which Blue Coat has specialized. Executives see little overlap between the two businesses.\u201cWith this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals,\u201d Dan Schulman, Symantec\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.In selling itself to Symantec, Blue Coat will abandon its effort to go public, after having filed plans to do so earlier this month. Many companies weighing an initial public offering also run a private sales process, choosing to sell themselves if they receive an attractive enough offer. While Blue Coat did not formally put itself up for sale, it received interest from a number of potential buyers, and held talks primarily with Symantec.\u201cOnce combined, we will offer customers around the world \u2014 from large enterprises and governments to individual consumers \u2014 unrivaled threat protection and unmatched cloud security,\u201d Mr. Clark said in a statement.Blue Coat has had a number of private equity owners in recent years, including both Bain Capital and, before that, Thoma Bravo.In its I.P.O. prospectus, Blue Coat said that it lost $289 million on top of $598 million in sales for the 12 months that ended on April 30. That compares with a $271 million loss on top of nearly $569 million in sales for the same period a year before.But the company has sought to grow itself under Bain Capital, having made a number of acquisitions to bolster its capabilities.\u201cThis represented a compelling opportunity for us because we could realize some gains for our investors but also reinvest into the combined company,\u201d said David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital. \u201cWe believe very much in the industrial logic and strategic rationale of this transaction.\u201dSymantec, meanwhile, has sought to turn around its fortunes after years of declining sales. Earlier this year, it sold its Veritas data storage unit to the Carlyle Group for $7.4 billion after failing to fully integrate that business into its core offerings.The acquisition of Blue Coat is in some ways a move out of the playbook of Silver Lake. The investment firm previously took a stake in the publicly traded chip maker Avago \u2014 and then supported that company through a string of acquisitions, culminating in a $37 billion takeover of Broadcom last year.Symantec then hired Ajei Gopal, a Silver Lake operating partner, as interim president and chief operating officer, as it embarked on a series of cost cuts. The company had also begun to look for a new chief executive, and Mr. Clark of Blue Coat emerged as a candidate.Silver Lake\u2019s investment in Symantec back in February anticipated a transaction like the Blue Coat deal, with the firm setting itself up to provide additional financing if Symantec were to pursue a deal that needed private equity help. And Silver Lake believes that other, smaller acquisitions may be in the offing for the security software provider in the future.\u201cSilver Lake has had a history of trying to invest in and catalyze leaders in important categories in technology,\u201d Ken Hao, the Silver Lake managing partner who sits on Symantec\u2019s board, said in an interview. \u201cSymantec will become the most valuable, profitable and deepest, widest leader in cybersecurity.\u201dSymantec received financial advice from JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. It took legal counsel from Fenwick & West and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Blue Coat received financial advice from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and legal counsel from Ropes & Gray and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Over 18 Holes in Scotland, Plays 20 Questions", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byBALMEDIE, Scotland \u2014 On the 10th hole of his golf resort here, Donald J. Trump \u2014 asked if defeating Hillary Clinton in November was more of \u201ca par-3 or a par-5\u201d \u2014 said it would \u201cbe very easy.\u201d And on the 18th, when asked if he had more or fewer candidates on his vice-presidential short list than the par of the hole (a five), Mr. Trump allowed, \u201cI\u2019m getting calls from a lot of people, and they want it.\u201dSuch was Mr. Trump\u2019s whirlwind afternoon at Trump International Golf Links here: He touched down on Saturday in his helicopter and, a day after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union threw global markets into chaos, led the international news media on a mad scramble through the dunes of his windswept golf course.Asked what he would tell voters back home who are worried about losing their retirement savings, Mr. Trump dismissed the question. \u201cAmericans are very much different,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t even affect them. I mean frankly, if it\u2019s done properly, if we had proper leadership.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a plummeting pound,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut if it does plummet, I do well. And if it does well, I do well.\u201d\u201cI do well in any case,\u201d he concluded.Moments later, Steve Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s national finance chairman, approached a small group of reporters. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cwanted us to clarify that it is about terrorism and not about religion.\u201dHope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, added, \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201dThe day began with the executive vice president of Mr. Trump\u2019s golf course saying that Mr. Trump would love to take advantage of the weather and give reporters a tour \u2014 but that it would not be an opportunity for them to ask questions.But Mr. Trump quickly threw his team\u2019s plans aside, urging reporters to follow his \u201cgolf buggy\u201d through perhaps the \u201clargest dunes anywhere in the world\u201d and answering questions along the way. At one point, when Secret Service agents tried to halt the press, Mr. Trump looked down from his perch atop a dune and hollered, \u201cGuys, get up here!\u201dAt each hole, Mr. Trump riffed and ad-libbed, throwing out responses as if they were tap-in putts.\u201cTexas will never do that, because Texas loves me,\u201d he said, when asked how, as president, he would handle it if Texas tried to secede.Asked if he had been consulting with his foreign policy advisers over the British result, Mr. Trump seemed to dismiss advisers as a general class: \u201cHonestly, most of them are no good,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the 14th!\u201dBriefly marring the day for the Trump team were a handful of demonstrators who appeared on his property. As the roughly two dozen protesters \u2014 hoisting Mexican flags and handmade signs \u2014 came over a hill and into the view of the gathered news media, resort staffers in red windbreakers immediately hustled the reporters onto the course and behind a hedge, out of sight of the disruption.On the 18th hole, Mr. Trump had one final surprise to share. Do you know who I\u2019m having dinner with tonight, he asked a reporter, before mouthing the name of his dining companion in two voluptuous syllables: \u201cRu-Pert,\u201d he whispered, referring to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media mogul who oversees News Corporation.Moments later, as promised, Mr. Murdoch materialized with his wife, Jerry Hall. Mr. Trump hopped behind the wheel of a golf cart, and Ms. Hall climbed in beside him.Then, with Mr. Murdoch, clad in sunglasses, hanging off the back, the trio set out for yet another tour of, as Mr. Trump put it, \u201cone of the great sights of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Ups Selling Seats on Private Jets Don\u2019t Always Make It", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byItinerariesDannel Schwartz was agonizing over his wife\u2019s 60th birthday gift when she proposed an idea herself.\u201cShe said, \u2018You know, I don\u2019t want to wait on another T.S.A. line. I want a private plane,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, a retired rabbi who splits time between Florida and Maine. \u201cWe laughed. Then comes this email about how it would cost $4 a flight.\u201dIntrigued by the all-you-can-fly model offered by BlackJet, the couple in March paid $15,000 for a membership that would allow them cheap seats on private jets with empty spots, scheduling their first trip for the weekend of April 30.But it quickly became clear that the Schwartzes would not be making the flight to New York. The company stalled when Mr. Schwartz tried to confirm the flight a few days before it was scheduled.A few days later came even worse news in an email from BlackJet.\u201cIt is with great regret and personal disappointment that I need to report the following,\u201d wrote the company\u2019s chief executive, Dean Rotchin. \u201cRecent events have resulted in abruptly ceasing BlackJet operations.\u201dThe Schwartzes\u2019 $15,000 was gone. They said they had wired the money to the company, which told the couple it was no longer accepting credit cards.\u201cNot even one trip,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, 70. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to go through this.\u201dThe Schwartzes\u2019 experience is a warning to travelers considering start-ups that offer relatively inexpensive access to private jets, once out of reach to the average customer. New companies pop up frequently, many with apps that allow travelers to book seats in minutes. But not all of them will survive.But in an interview late last month, he said the collapse happened mainly because a BlackJet official who was crucial to operations left the company, though he would not name the executive.Mr. Rotchin acknowledged that the private jet business was inherently risky and said that the company stopped accepting credit cards late last year because of high fees.\u201cEverybody knew when they signed up that there would be no refunds,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some risk when you pay upfront for anything.\u201dAnother company, Beacon, shut down this year after finding that its membership-based, all-you-can-fly model for private flights between New York and Boston was not sustainable.For travelers looking into private jet services, Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, suggests considering companies that have a history and own their own planes, as opposed to BlackJet, which acted as a broker, matching travelers with empty seats. Several major or developing players \u2014 some of which have evolved since their founding \u2014 have their own fleets, including the 10-year-old XOJet and the 2013 start-up Surf Air.Executives who have tried \u2014 and sometimes failed \u2014 to \u201cdemocratize\u201d private aviation are not giving up. Mr. Rotchin first tried out the plane-hailing concept with Greenjets, which fell into financial trouble and reorganized, becoming BlackJet. He is now considering his next move, but he said he realized that failures like these raise investors\u2019 skepticism and make it more difficult for start-ups to raise money.A founder of Beacon, Wade Eyerly, is now at Wheels Up, which counts the tennis star Serena Williams and the sports broadcaster Erin Andrews among its members. Mr. Eyerly, Wheels Up\u2019s managing director, acknowledged that Beacon had miscalculated the demand for flights between New York and Boston.\u201cBeacon was a failure to execute,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat that.\u201dBut he remains optimistic about consumers\u2019 desire for private air travel, he said. Wheels Up, he noted, is offering a range of memberships and more destinations, and it operates its own fleet through contractors. He also advised consumers to conduct thorough research before choosing a company.\u201cIn a technology-driven world, little companies and big companies can look similar,\u201d said Mr. Eyerly, who also helped start Surf Air.With so many competitors in the private aviation world, travelers can have difficulty telling the difference between stable and shaky companies. Mr. Schwartz, for example, said he looked into BlackJet before buying a membership, but nothing he found indicated that the company would crumble so suddenly.\u201cRed flags should have gone up, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, adding that he should have looked deeper into the company before paying.Those kinds of failures threaten to erode trust in the industry, said Alex Wilcox, chief executive of JetSuite, a seven-year-old jet charter company based in California with its own fleet.\u201cWe\u2019re all going to be painted with the same brush,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think people understand the difference between Spirit Airlines and Singapore Airlines. Hopefully, we can distinguish ourselves in the same way.\u201dMr. Wilcox, Mr. Eyerly and others in the industry said potential customers should look as closely as possible at a company\u2019s financial backing before paying. Talk to the executives and ask tough questions, they said, which is more easily accomplished at small start-ups.A lot of newer companies just do not have a chance of surviving because the cost of operating jets is so high, said Sergey Petrossov, the founder and chief executive of JetSmarter, which several industry insiders said was a successful example of an aviation start-up, allows members to reserve seats on charters and other private planes using an Uber-like app. Although it allowed nonmembers to book seats until last week, only members may use the service now.\u201cThis industry as a whole really operates in an unsophisticated way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who isn\u2019t implementing sophisticated math and yield management isn\u2019t going to survive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave outdated information on booking policies at JetSmarter. Only members may book seats; nonmembers are no longer allowed to do so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Orson Welles: One-Man Band\u2019 and \u2018Citizen Kane: A Filmmaker\u2019s Journey\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byNonfictionAs time marches on, it doesn\u2019t seem impossible that Orson Welles\u2019s legend as the screen\u2019s ultimate Sisyphean showman will outlast any particular familiarity with his movies. Interest in his later career has always been unduly dependent on the fact that he\u2019s the man who made \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d at the preposterous age of 25, but even \u201cKane\u201d is apparently a tough sell in film classes nowadays. Once his 1941 debut\u2019s status as an unmatched screen achievement is no longer meaningful or vivid to budding cinephiles, they may not feel as compelled as their forebears were to seek out the more idiosyncratic splendors of \u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons,\u201d \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d or \u201cChimes at Midnight.\u201dYet as all Wellesians know, those remarkable movies are no mere appen\u00addages to his youthful masterpiece. Starring Welles as Falstaff in a startlingly moss-free amalgam of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry IV, Parts 1 and 2,\u201d \u201cHenry V\u201d and \u201cThe Merry Wives of Windsor,\u201d the last of them is increasingly reckoned by his cultists as superior to \u201cKane\u201d itself. It may also be the only film derived from Shakespeare to resonate primarily as an emotional autobiography. The final full-scale feature film he managed to complete in his lifetime, \u201cChimes at Midnight\u201d is the climactic event of \u201cOrson Welles: One-Man Band,\u201d the third installment of Simon Callow\u2019s \u00adsupremely intelligent life of Welles.Callow is giving Robert A. Caro a run for his money, as his original two-volume plan has expanded to a projected four. Published in 1996, \u201cThe Road to \u00adXanadu\u201d took Welles from birth to \u201cKane\u2019s\u201d premiere. Ten years later, \u201cHello Americans\u201d covered the chaotic years he spent fencing with studio moguls, mounting a stage extravaganza that nearly ruined him (\u201cAround the World in 80 Days\u201d), and promoting himself as a political commentator until he and Hollywood more or less gave up on each other in 1948. In the new book\u2019s preface, Callow puckishly notes that friends commiserated with him over the \u201cterrible decline\u201d in Welles\u2019s fortunes he\u2019d be depressingly obliged to record from then on.But he doesn\u2019t agree, and he\u2019s right to suspect that the conventional career Welles botched might have turned him into \u201cjust .\u2008.\u2008. another filmmaker.\u201d Instead, once Welles relocated to Europe and embarked on his fantastically improvised course of acting in claptrap to help finance movies he shot in bits and patches (\u201cOthello\u201d took him four years), meanwhile experimenting industriously in other media and turning his superb personality into a brand as no movie \u00addirector before or after him has, he became utterly unique. Even as America (in the person of The Herald Tribune\u2019s Walter Kerr) was dismissing him as \u201cpossibly the youngest living has-been,\u201d \u00adEuropean critics had begun lionizing him as a thwarted genius. That \u00adbecame the conventional wisdom once their stateside epigones took up the cry.In 1949, he also played his most indelible role in a movie he didn\u2019t direct: \u00adHarry Lime in Carol Reed\u2019s \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d That part somehow got assimilated into his autobiography well, not least because the film itself looked quasi-Wellesian enough for him to seem like its \u00aduncredited auteur. A bit of doggerel he wrote for a \u201cFaust\u201d pastiche he staged in 1950 sums up how his career\u2019s real unifying principle and focus of interest became the drama of Welles conjuring art however he could: \u201cAll that you see\u2009/\u2009Is all about me.\u201dCallow is circumspect about Welles\u2019s private life, including the all too public \u201cbattle for his waistline\u201d he lost for good at age 45 or so \u2014 something whose psychological effect can\u2019t have been trivial for a man so handsome in his youth. But no previous biographer has so expertly and convincingly analyzed Welles the creative dynamo, from his ebullient love of what Callow calls \u201cHigher Hokum\u201d to the depths of rue in his recurring themes of loss and betrayal. This Welles isn\u2019t the tragic martyr \u2014 permanently nailed to a celluloid cross \u2014 his devotees once saw him as. But he isn\u2019t the self-destructive dilettante his legend\u2019s detractors claim, either.Considering how often this period of Welles\u2019s life has been portrayed as one frustration or defeat after another, the fecundity of what he did achieve is astonishing. One sideline Callow explores at length is Welles\u2019s prescient understanding of television as more than \u201cimitation movies,\u201d but a distinctive new medium with a special gift of intimacy. (Among his other 1950s forays into TV, which are too little seen even today, \u201cThe Fountain of Youth\u201d \u2014 commissioned by, of all people, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball \u2014 is a witty gem.) Callow is also particularly good at reconstructing Welles\u2019s fabled 1955 London stage production of \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d which he himself judged as his best work in any medium.The movies he titanically struggled to make all along included a couple of misfires. I\u2019m no great fan of \u201cMr. Arkadin,\u201d from 1955, or his 1962 adaptation of Kafka\u2019s \u201cThe Trial.\u201d But his arduously cobbled-\u00adtogether \u201cOthello\u201d is a thorny, \u00addynamic visual marvel, and both \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d \u2014 his one return to American filmmaking \u2014 and \u201cChimes at Midnight\u201d are as good as movie directing gets. \u201cChimes\u201d was also the capstone of his long rivalry with Laurence Olivier in interpreting Shakespeare for modern audiences, and though Olivier easily outpointed him onstage \u2014 Welles\u2019s New York \u201cKing Lear\u201d in 1956 was a costly flop \u2014 their duel on movie screens was a different story. However widely acclaimed at the time, Olivier\u2019s Shakespeare films look awfully square today. But Welles\u2019s much more adventurous ones still teem with emotion and life.\u201cOne-Man Band\u201d makes the whole saga so vibrant that treating \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d as the best reason to be interested in Welles comes to seem almost as absurd as only feeling curious about \u201cUlysses\u201d because it was written by the author of \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\u201d But studies of \u201cKane\u201d remain an industry in their own right, and Harlan Lebo\u2019s \u201cCitizen Kane: A Filmmaker\u2019s Journey\u201d \u2014 timed to mark the movie\u2019s 75th anniversary \u2014 is probably the most thorough account yet of the genesis, production and release of Welles\u2019s most famous film. It\u2019s hardly Lebo\u2019s fault that venerating \u201cKane\u201d as guilelessly as he does can\u2019t help seeming quaint up against Callow\u2019s rich chronicle of its energetic \u00adaftermath.Though a lot of the material here will be familiar to Welles buffs \u2014 the key collaboration with the cinematographer Gregg Toland, the vexed question of whether Welles or his co-scenarist, Herman J. Mankiewicz, deserves more credit for the script, and so on \u2014 it\u2019s never been presented this comprehensively. Lebo is especially good at recounting the maneuvers to suppress the film once word got around that it was based on the life of \u00adWilliam Randolph Hearst and Hearst\u2019s minions wheeled into action. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not the most sparkling \u00adwriter \u2014 how can he have spent a quarter-\u00adcentury studying this movie without any of its wit rubbing off? \u2014 and he\u2019s often unable to distinguish substance from trivia, right down to a six-page list of uncredited bit players and extras that may split the difference between obsessiveness and padding.Lebo\u2019s book is useful, and certainly the one I\u2019ll reach for whenever I want to look up a half-remembered detail about \u201cKane.\u201d I don\u2019t know how often that will happen, however, since my admiration for the movie \u2014 despite being undimmed \u2014 doesn\u2019t provide me with much in the way of fresh stimulus. That\u2019s not the case with Welles\u2019s other films, and \u201cOne-Man Band\u201d is an exhilarating reminder that his true greatness began once he\u2019d put \u201cKane\u2019s\u201d virtuoso precocity behind him.ORSON WELLESVolume 3: One-Man BandBy Simon CallowIllustrated. 466 pp. Viking. $40.CITIZEN KANEA Filmmaker\u2019s JourneyBy Harlan LeboIllustrated. 362 pp. Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin\u2019s Press. $27.99.Tom Carson, a freelance critic, is the author of the novels \u201cGilligan\u2019s Wake\u201d and \u201cDaisy Buchanan\u2019s Daughter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With the stigma fading, the N.F.L. could follow if the Raiders, who have been unable to persuade Oakland, Calif., to help them build a new home, can get officials here to help pay for a new domed stadium.Indeed, according to the American Gaming Association, 19 N.F.L. stadiums are less than 20 miles from a casino, and daily fantasy companies allow fans to bet on a lineup of players of their design using a computer or smartphone.Leagues still bar players from betting on games, and some prohibit them from working at or with casinos, presumably to keep them away from bettors trying to recruit them to throw games. But some of the biggest game-fixing scandals have occurred far from Las Vegas, and players are better paid now \u2014 so they are less prone to taking money from gamblers.\u201cI never believed there was a taboo about Las Vegas,\u201d Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman said Tuesday. \u201cGambling is everywhere. Some people are provincial and don\u2019t want to change the status quo. But you have to get with the times. Pro sports are a natural here.\u201dEven without putting teams here, the leagues have embraced Las Vegas, which has hosted an N.B.A. All-Star Game and an N.B.A. summer league. The N.H.L. has held its annual awards dinner here for several years. Teams also accept sponsorships from casinos, and Major League Baseball and the N.H.L. have invested in DraftKings, one of the largest daily fantasy operators.\u201cI think Las Vegas is one of the real crown jewels of communities in the United States,\u201d the owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys told reporters in May. \u201cFor me, I think that certainly the fact that Las Vegas has a gambling aspect to it is far overshadowed by the entertainment value, if you will, the family appeal that you have, the convention appeal.\u201dSkeptics remain. Although the N.F.L.\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, has said he is open to the possibility of a team moving to Las Vegas, he told ESPN in April that the league remained against anything that could sway games.\u201cTo me, where I cross the line is anything that can impact the integrity of the game,\u201d Goodell told ESPN. \u201cIf people feel like it\u2019s going to have an influence on the outcome of the game, we are absolutely opposed to that.\u201dSome observers believe Las Vegas will have a hard time supporting a pro team because so many residents are from elsewhere and root for the teams they grew up with. Many also work in the tourism industry and are busy on game days.\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much new population, because it\u2019s a 24-hour community, because it\u2019s so suburbanized, there isn\u2019t the same sense of community,\u201d said Michael Green, who teaches classes on the history of the city and the state at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.In particular, selling hockey in the desert can be tough, something the owners of the troubled Coyotes learned in Arizona, where the debt-laden team was taken over by the N.H.L.The N.H.L. has never voiced much concern about the gambling in Las Vegas because, as Commissioner Gary Bettman has said on a few occasions, the casinos\u2019 take on hockey games is quite small.\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about the integrity of our game,\u201d Bettman said Wednesday.The much bigger issue for the N.H.L. has been the financial viability of a franchise in a nontraditional hockey market (meaning not very cold).The N.H.L. is hoping this time is different.On Wednesday, the league\u2019s 30 governors, or owners, unanimously approved a new team for Las Vegas that will be owned by Bill Foley, a financial services tycoon, who will pay a $500 million expansion fee. The team, which has not been named yet, will begin playing in the 2017-18 season in the new T-Mobile Arena, built by MGM Resorts International and the venue operator, AEG. About 14,000 fans have placed deposits on season tickets.\u201cWe think this is a tremendously exciting opportunity not just for Las Vegas but for the league as well,\u201d Bettman said, pointing to the city\u2019s growing population and reputation for entertainment.Bettman dismissed concerns that an N.H.L. team cannot succeed in a desert city. He noted that the league\u2019s teams in California, Florida and Texas all made the playoffs this past season and that youth hockey participation had grown 37 percent in Nevada in the last decade.The N.F.L. may be an easier sell. Football is far more popular, and the Raiders are a local favorite because of their outlaw image and because they play in neighboring California.But in a chicken-or-egg scenario, the Raiders\u2019 owner, Mark Davis, will not move the team unless he has a new stadium for it to play in, and Las Vegas and Clark County will not help him build that stadium unless he has a green light from the league to move.Davis and the Las Vegas Sands are pushing a proposal to build a $1.4 billion domed stadium that includes $750 million in hotel taxes, but the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee is pushing a more modest plan with a reduced public contribution. Some rival casino and hotel operators in Las Vegas do not want to give the Sands an edge.By the end of July, the committee must send a final recommendation to the governor, who can call a special session of the state\u2019s Legislature so that lawmakers can vote on whether to authorize Clark County to raise its hotel tax.Like all debates over the use public funds for sports venues, the decision is fraught. Proponents say hotel taxes are primarily paid by the 42 million visitors to Las Vegas each year, not local residents, and the stadium will draw lots of out-of-town visitors.\u201cThe amount of publicity it will give Las Vegas around the world will be immense, and the funding will not be on Las Vegas or the state of Nevada, so it\u2019s a unique way to think of how to get this built,\u201d said Tim Leiweke, a consultant hired by the Sands Corporation to help get the stadium built.Opponents argue that money from the hotel room tax could be spent on other needs, like education and transportation, or to expand the convention center to attract more high-paying visitors. They also point to T-Mobile Arena, which was privately financed.\u201cLas Vegas is in a very unique position because it doesn\u2019t need an N.F.L. team to make the stadium work,\u201d said Ed Uehling, a longtime resident who has argued against using hotel taxes for team owners. \u201cYou can really build it, and they will come.\u201dBut significant questions persist. The $1.4 billion price tag does not include buying the land or upgrading the surrounding infrastructure. There are also concerns about building a stadium at a preferred site near McCarran Airport because it could interfere with air traffic. Buying land at other sites could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge appetite for football, but a lot of questions about a stadium,\u201d said Steve Sisolak, chairman of the board of Clark County commissioners. \u201cYou can\u2019t confuse the two.\u201dDavis, who declined to be interviewed, has promised to contribute $500 million toward the cost of a stadium. But he has to deliver on his promise to move his team. Prominent N.F.L. owners like Jones and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots have voiced support for a team in Las Vegas, but at least 24 owners would have to approve any relocation, and Davis would have to pay a sizable relocation fee.To protect Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, Steve Hill, who leads the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee, said the public would not contribute to a new stadium unless the Raiders were allowed to move. He added that taxpayers would not be on the hook for any unexpected increases in the construction cost or in the cost of running the building and said he wanted the Raiders and Sands to split any profits with the public if the stadium generated returns above a certain threshold.Even if the Raiders and Sands resist those demands, Hill said the possibility that an N.F.L. team will move to Nevada was as high as it had ever been, thanks to the melting concerns about the influence of gambling.\u201cIt is somewhat destined that Las Vegas will have an N.F.L. team,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have said that five or 10 years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was taken to task in the street for the \u201cloi travail,\u201d the labor law \u2014 recently pushed through by his government \u2014 that he was in Lunel to promote. A trade unionist wearing a T-shirt challenged him: \u201cYou, you\u2019ve got lots of cash, you buy yourself nice suits.\u201d Without missing a beat, Mr. Macron responded, \u201cThe best way to afford a nice suit is to work.\u201dThe overwhelming majority of the political class, big business, the news media and the intellectual elites have applauded the labor law. For them, the strikes offer yet more proof that France is \u201cunreformable.\u201dEven though no one knows precisely what effect the law will have, very few wage-earners in France, unionists or not, believe that making firing easier will create more jobs. Logically enough, they think it will create more firings. But more important, the French know recent history and can perceive trends.There are 5.7 million unemployed (including the partly unemployed) workers in France today, the equivalent of some 28 million Americans. Action is urgently required. But the great absence from the debate over the labor law in the government is any reference to the reality of the jobs that will supposedly be created. Most people fill that void with dread.The current round of strikes will probably come to an end soon. And Nuit Debout has already largely disintegrated. But its American cousin Occupy Wall Street left a legacy, the idea of the \u201c1 percent\u201d and of the noxiousness of ever-growing social inequalities. What\u2019s going on in France now is similarly clarifying trends: To work in the future, you\u2019ll have to settle for being less well paid, and for having worse health insurance and lower unemployment benefits. As for your children, they\u2019ll live in a world with much greater inequality than yours. That\u2019s the new rule.Sylvain Cypel, a former correspondent and editor for Le Monde, is at work on a book about immigration.

{"Headline": "The Changing Face of Urban Power", "Date": "2016-06-30", "News": "Supported byBlack political power is declining in cities across the country, including Oakland, St. Louis, Cleveland and Atlanta \u2014 even as African-Americans are gaining majority status in an increasing number of suburbs.At the same time, African-American emigration to the South has started to weaken Republican control of some deep red states.In the report, McElwee argues thatThe fact that big donors \u2014 overwhelmingly white, male and high-income \u2014 hold such outsized influence in a city that is extremely diverse both demographically and economically is deeply problematic.At the same time, Bowser lost the three poorest black wards (5,7 and 8), which have a median household income of $42,177 and where single family houses cost an average of $250,000 in 2013, by large margins. Ward 7, across the Anacostia River in the Southeast corner of the city, backed Gray over Bowser 59.48 percent to 28.0 percent.Hispanics, who are likely to hold the balance of political power between whites and blacks, have grown from 2.1 percent of the District\u2019s population in 1970 to 10.6 percent in 2015. Asian-Americans have gone from 0.7 percent to 4.2 percent over the same period.While these percentages still give African-Americans a plurality of the District population, turnout patterns in off-year local elections in which the mayor is chosen serve to weaken black voting strength.The turnout gap between rich and poor wards was even larger, 7.84 points in the 2014 contest. In the most affluent four wards (median household income $95,257), the turnout rate of registered voters was 30.83 percent; in the four poorest wards (median household income $49,520), the turnout rate was 22.99 percent.A surge of young, mainly white voters living in newly affluent neighborhoods emerged as a powerful force in last November\u2019s elections in the District, a seismic shift that mirrors the evolution of the city\u2019s population and could reshape its politics in years to come.The Post found that in the 2014 primary, blacks made up 48 percent of voters compared to 51 percent \u201cother.\u201d In the general election, which included a referendum on legalization of marijuana that brought many young white voters to the polls, blacks were 46 percent to 53 percent \u201cother.\u201dIn the event of a future racially polarized Democratic mayoral primary pitting a major black candidate against a major white candidate, Hispanics would be in a position to determine the outcome.There are some indications of how Hispanic voters might cast their ballots. The February 1989 Chicago mayoral primary provides perhaps the most relevant case study.In an email, Piston wrote that the \u201cfindings constitute suggestive evidence\u201d that in a white vs. black election, Hispanics could provide \u201ca victory for the white candidate, because Latinos tend to view whites more favorably than blacks.\u201dPiston cautioned, however, that the policies espoused by the white and black candidates could also play a crucial role:Latinos are more egalitarian than whites and more comfortable with big government. If the black candidate was to the left of the white candidate in the scenario you describe with respect to these two core values, and if Latinos voted with these two core values in mind, this would draw Latinos on balance to the black candidate.I contacted a number of politicians, operatives, researchers and political scientists to get their assessment of the likelihood that the District will elect a white mayor and got a mixed response.I see no reason why the city can\u2019t elect a white mayor. While I in no way think we are in a post racial era, I do believe that most of the citizens of the city would have no genuine bias on this issue. In fact, the younger folks who have made up most of the city\u2019s growth spurt are far more welcoming of differences than their elders. Like any successful mayoral candidate, the politician would have to speak to issues relevant to those in the city with a plan to tackle crime, affordable housing and continue the improvement in the business climate to achieve job growth, etc. but I certainly think it could be done.Matthew Green, a political scientist at Catholic University, said the prospect of a white mayor is \u201cabsolutely, clearly possible.\u201d He noted that major sections of the city have been transformed, in most cases resulting in more whites:The city has been changing pretty dramatically. There are neighborhoods I don\u2019t even recognize anymore.There are, however, some dissenters.Garry Young, director of the Center for Washington Area Studies at George Washington University, downplayed the possibility that Washington could elect a white mayor, noting thatAfrican-American\u2019s remain the largest racial group in the District with close to 50 percent. Non-Hispanic whites still only make up a tad more than one third.Young also pointed out thatThe dynamic that seems in play now is you have black candidates who attract the business community and white voters in Northwest and then do well enough among black and Latino voters elsewhere to win the Democratic primary. That\u2019s a proven winning strategy. Could a white candidate put together the same sort of coalition? Possibly \u2014 and one day probably as I think the District\u2019s continues to become whiter \u2014 but I think it\u2019s still a long-shot in the short run.Hal Wolman, a political scientist at George Washington put an entirely different spin on the question:One of the biggest differences is on the question whether blacks and white have the same opportunities for jobs: 74 percent of whites say yes compared to 40 percent of blacks. Another major difference is on the question of whether the American system of justice is biased against African-Americans. Blacks say it is, by 68 to 26, while 69 percent of whites say the system in not biased, and 25 percent say it is.Despite the particular demographic profile of the District, the population trends in Washington are emblematic of shifts taking place in a number of major cities.The geographic movement of African-Americans will produce a shift in black political power from some cities to surrounding suburbs and to states in the South.Georgia, for example, is a state where Democrats are making gains, so much so that the Clinton campaign is considering a possible drive to win what has been a solidly red state. The slow but steady increase in the percentage of Georgia residents who are minorities is crucial to this process.By far the dominant trend, however, is the migration of African-Americans from center cities to the suburbs.metropolitan areas in the growing parts of the country are registering the greatest numeric gains in suburban black population. The suburbs of Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Dallas experienced the largest increases in black population during 2000-2010.Driving the movement of African-Americans to the suburbs, Frey wrote,are the young, those with higher education, and married couples with children \u2014 attributes that characterized white suburbanization for almost a century.Politically, the migration out of cities to the suburbs will lead to some diffusion of black political power, but not necessarily to a diminishment.Over time, African-Americans in the Washington metropolitan area may be forced through demographic change to cede some power in the District, which has a population of 672,228. At the same time, African-American control of Prince George\u2019s County might be an avatar of a deeper transformation. The county not only has a population of 909,535, but it also has a member of Congress who can actually vote, unlike the District\u2019s quasi-congressional representation. By most standards, this is not a bad deal.A focus on the black-white-Hispanic urban splits can serve to obscure what is possibly a more salient development: the ongoing political alignment of well-educated, relatively well-off whites with racial and ethnic minorities. It is this racially and ethnically diverse urban-metropolitan coalition that currently supports Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party and that elected Barack Obama twice. It is viscerally opposed to Donald Trump.The opposition to this liberal-Democratic urban-oriented coalition, the rural and exurban pro-Trump alliance, appears, in turn, to be similar to center-right coalitions forming across Europe \u2014 most immediately to the right-populist segment of the British electorate that on June 23 threw its weight behind Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.it\u2019s clear that densely populated urban areas with a lot of young people such as Hackney and Islington in London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union.Most large urban centers elected to stay part of the European Union, particularly in London, where many local authorities delivered vast majorities for the pro-EU campaign.There is an ongoing struggle, then, for cultural as well as economic resources, within rapidly transforming metropolitan-urban centers \u2014 just as there is a struggle for broader forms of power between regions and between countries. As both traditional and cosmopolitan values form the basis of alliances that sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate, the opportunities for a peaceful reshaping of coalitions on both the left and the right are there. But as conflicts related to economic and social modernization erupt at locations as far apart as Ferguson and Falluja, the potential is also clear for ever more dangerous conflict.Advertisement"}

Berry also returns to his favorite plot device: resurrecting a long-buried historical secret upon which potential disaster rests. The secret this time is a scenario first understood \u2014 and then hidden \u2014 by America\u2019s oldest fraternal organization, the Society of the Cincinnati. Turns out the founding fathers made one very big planning mistake: If the president and the vice president die at the same time on Inauguration Day before taking the oath of office, the result is a leaderless government and a constitutional crisis. For enemies of the state, that can mean only one thing: opportunity.According to \u201cThe 14th Colony,\u201d the old Soviets discovered the oversight, and their rogue agents have decided to finally take revenge on the United States for what is presented as the subterfuge cooked up between Ronald Reagan and the pope that led to the fall of the U.S.S.R. (Anyone not a fan of the 40th president is hereby warned that in this book, he\u2019s a genius.) Their weapons: decades-old nuclear suitcase bombs, which were hidden on American soil long ago, and sleeper agents. The suspense: Who will get to them first?The fact that the book is being published during an election year when we are about to have a lame duck president should make the worst-case scenario feel especially relevant, particularly with recent revelations about the real White House\u2019s meticulous transition planning in response to terrorism. But compared with the terrorists of today, Berry\u2019s villains are so creaky, they seem less threatening than quaint.The big questions range from the \u201cwho done it?\u201d to the existential. Did the suicide victim actually kill himself, or did an evil force drive him to it? What is that force? What does God demand from his children? Unfortunately, Hall gives all of these questions equal weight, which tends to undermine the book\u2019s loftier philosophical aspirations, as does the presence of ye olde Devil-worshipping sex cult. In the end, this update is caught between its high and low impulses, and feels more like the rehashed \u201cExorcist\u201d than like the moody first season of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d Its demons are predictable, down to their growling voices and evil laughs, especially in comparison with devils that may be closer to home \u2014 or actually in your home, or at least the home you married into.Maya Stern is a former special-ops helicopter pilot, now a suburban flight instructor and mother, who was forced out of the military when the whistle-blower posted a video online of her ordering an airstrike that killed a number of unarmed Iraqi civilians. As is the wont in such books, death follows her home, and the story opens with the murder of her husband, scion of a wealthy Establishment family, by masked gunmen. (It turns out her older sister was also a murder victim, killed before the book begins, when Maya was still in combat.)Left a single mother with a small child and some residual PTSD, Maya installs a nanny cam in her den, and the next thing you know, her dead husband shows up, alive and on video. The twists begin there and don\u2019t stop until all the murders add up, company fraud is exposed, the rot at the heart of a twisted family is revealed and the rug is entirely pulled out from under the reader.The story begins, once again, with a death \u2014 a gruesome one, involving an ax in a young mother\u2019s head \u2014 then cycles backward in time to how it happened, playing peekaboo with the motivations and history of its cast: the grieving widower, a professor at a local college; his lovely wife, a.k.a. the victim; their young daughter; and the three damaged brothers who once lived in their home and act as their babysitters and renovation team, and whose parents committed suicide. All of the above are sympathetic and suspicious in equal measure, a result of Brundage\u2019s ability to peel away the onionskin layers of emotion that define any relationship. As the clues accumulate and the killer is revealed, the truth becomes both horrifying and inevitable.Travel writers of the National Geographic-meets-Departures kind populate the book, with Will as the exemplar. He is the employee of a magazine called (surprise) Travelers: a man with a big expense account, a small salary, a mysterious boss who keeps disappearing into a hidden back room, and a disgruntled wife \u2014 who was also a Travelers writer until she left her job for \u201cother opportunities,\u201d as yet unspecified. On a junket to French wine country Will meets a gorgeous Australian, and though he refrains from breaking his wedding vows, when he encounters her again on a trip to Argentina he gives in to temptation, an act that has some unexpected repercussions. Needless to say, no one\u2019s job is quite what readers might assume.Simply consider the fact that Travelers is a magazine where communications are delivered by hand, by couriers, in sealed envelopes, as opposed to email or mobile phone. And it seems to suffer not at all from the current economic malaise affecting its competitors, and for that matter old media in general. It\u2019s enough to make anyone raise an eyebrow.Turns out travel writing is great cover for all sorts of clandestine activity, both official and not, and Will gets sucked right in. He\u2019s almost determinedly na\u00efve (one of the reasons he was hired, apparently, and the reader will guess what everyone is up to long before our hero does), though he also proves surprisingly adept at learning the particulars of self-defense, surreptitious photography and other illicit skills \u2014 as do many of his colleagues, who turn out to be not so deskbound after all.It\u2019s all highly entertaining and more than a little fantastic. But it\u2019s easy to suspend your disbelief in sheer enjoyment at Pavone\u2019s use of language, not to mention a James Bond-worthy itinerary that takes the otherwise ink-stained wretch from Brooklyn to Paris by way of Dublin, a Russian billionaire\u2019s yacht and a remote village in Iceland, as he evades a variety of secret-service types, enforcers and that even more frightening contemporary golem, the megalomaniac businessman.The story of an outbreak that started as a military experiment gone awry, decimating the human population by turning it into vampires, and the heroic efforts of the few remaining survivors to remain human (literally and emotionally), it\u2019s pretty much \u201cTwilight\u201d meets the Bible meets \u201cThe Hot Zone.\u201d That sounds messy, but it has proved a surprisingly powerful formula. The final installment begins in the year 98 A.V. \u2014 After Virus \u2014 a time when the 12 original sources of infection, or apostles of destruction, have been killed thanks to a young Jesus figure named Amy, who sacrificed herself to save mankind. The surviving small community of humans, living in the Texas Republic, are beginning to feel complacent and let their guard down, clearly a sign that something is about to go wrong.Which, of course, it does. It turns out the vamps are not gone, merely biding their time, because the original carrier, the \u201cZero\u201d who brought the disease from the jungles of Bolivia and started it all, has been hiding out in the ruins of Grand Central Terminal, nursing his grievances and preparing for a final battle. His great love was taken from him when he was still human, and he wants everyone to feel his pain; though it\u2019s not the most original motivation, it is effective. When Amy returns for the final showdown, to stand for and then with her friends, the lines between good and evil are blurred.It would be unfair to reveal who dies and who lives, but chances are you can guess the outcome of the last battle \u2014 though said battle is not itself the end of the book. Instead there is an epilogue after a coda after a conclusion, as if the author could not quite bring himself to say goodbye to the world he had imagined. That\u2019s understandable: Lengthy as the book is, it is also compulsively readable.In the end, a subplot involving the transformation of a giant shipwreck into a usable ark meant to take a small slice of humanity to a virus-free island off the coast of Australia provides resolution \u2014 or at least a reason for Cronin to fast-forward to 1003 A.V. Amy herself has become legend, giving rise to a sect of \u201cAmmalites,\u201d scientists who study \u201cThe Book of Twelves\u201d and a mystical finale that is both manipulative and strangely moving. By the time you\u2019ve made your way through it, you\u2019ll never look at a bat in quite the same way again.Yasmin has brought her child to Fairbanks from England to visit her husband, who has been making a documentary on Alaskan wildlife and living with a native tribe, but immediately after they land they are told he has been killed in a fire that wiped out the village. Refusing to believe the local authorities, sympathetic though they seem, Yasmin and her daughter embark on what becomes an epic journey in a stolen truck into the wilderness \u2014 and the politics of fracking \u2014 to track him down. It seems like a fool\u2019s adventure, except the alternating voices of mother and daughter are so compelling, it\u2019s hard not to want to go along for the ride.As they drive, pursued by another truck and with warnings of dire weather ahead, the book skates smoothly over issues of environmentalism, tribal rights and the relationship of the deaf and hearing worlds, including the question of what it means to have a \u201cvoice.\u201d The temperature drops, the action heats up and the suspense builds with the storm, speckled by alluring scientific tidbits on the subjects of stars and species. Following her own moral compass, Yasmin, it turns out, knew what she was doing all along, and the real criminals are those who disguise selfish intentions, both financial and personal, in the rhetoric of selflessness. Even a white-out can\u2019t hide the darkness within.It\u2019s a pointed reminder that between Soviets, viruses and sociopaths, it may be the unknown that is scariest of all.Vanessa Friedman is the fashion critic of The Times.Advertisement"}

With a bill that takes effect Friday, they yielded to a state court mandate to either treat poor districts more equitably or see the public school system shut down on July 1.The fierce standoff over school financing was an outgrowth of Mr. Brownback\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wholesale indulgence of the Republican trickle-down myth that sweeping tax cuts somehow produce revenue growth, not deficits. He pioneered the largest tax cuts in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history in 2012 and 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a $1.1-billion package that favored the upper brackets and quickly led to plummeting state revenues and reduced spending.As a result, public school budgets were shortchanged, with aid declining to $3,800 per pupil from $4,400 during Mr. Brownback\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure, and poorer schools were hit hardest by staff cuts. Until this week, the governor and Legislature, sued by four poorer districts, openly defied the State Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandate for greater fairness in state school aid. In a bare-knuckled fight, the court was denounced repeatedly by Brownback allies and threatened with vindictive cuts in its own budget.But the court held fast, and its threat to shut down the schools forced an agreement this week that will increase poor districts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financing by $38 million in the next school year. Funds were diverted from other state budget lines to cover this. But, most critically, the new formula also redistributed money from wealthier districts to meet the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandate.As vicious as the fight has been, it may prove to be a mere skirmish in a larger court challenge focused on the State Constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement that a properly financed education be provided for all Kansas students. State school spending is more than $4 billion annually, but a lower court has found that the sum falls short of constitutional standards by more than $500 million.

The problem for Viacom is that its directors other than Mr. Redstone have decided to oppose a leadership change and support Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 board being illegitimate. There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company. And if Mr. Redstone is indeed incompetent, then his interest goes to the trust from which Mr. Dauman and George Abrams have been removed. If Viacom does pursue litigation, it may be a cue for National Amusements and Mr. Redstone to finally unseat the Viacom board. National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments. This would allow National Amusements to raise the ante if Viacom does litigate over the amended bylaws. Viacom has difficult decisions to make and very little time to make them in.

{"Headline": "Going Dirty", "Date": "2016-06-25", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisOVER the course of the past two months, Donald J. Trump has assailed Hillary Clinton as \u201ca world-class liar,\u201d suggested that she had a role in the death of a White House aide while Bill Clinton was president, darkly referenced Mr. Clinton\u2019s marital affairs and said \u2014 in a 41-minute rip of a speech on Tuesday \u2014 that Mrs. Clinton had \u201cperfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\u201d Once again, the nation seems to be marching toward another brutally nasty presidential campaign, with Mr. Trump leading the parade.But in a year when so many staples of American politics have faltered \u2014 television advertisements, polling, big-ticket endorsements, to name a few \u2014 will the negative campaign, whether wielded by Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, be the reliable weapon it has proved to be in presidential campaigns over the course of American history? Is there anything left to say about two candidates who are so well known and so polarizing?And Mr. Trump, whom Mrs. Clinton hammered with a series of hard-hitting television advertisements about his temperament over the past week, is in even worse shape in that poll: 70 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him. He has been pelted with damaging information. That did not stop him from sweeping aside a packed Republican field and briefly leading Mrs. Clinton in some national polls.\u201cThis is probably just a different ballgame,\u201d said Deborah J. Brooks, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \u201cIt seems like they are at historically high levels of unfavorable ratings, and they are better known than other candidates. It makes it really hard to compare to past races.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s gone way beyond anything I\u2019ve seen over the past 40 years of campaigns,\u201d said Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution. \u201cCandidates typically worry about a backlash from going negative. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to worry about a backlash.\u201dMost candidates, concerned about voters turning on them for being negative, try to leave the toughest attacks to television advertisements or surrogates, such as a running mate. Not Mr. Trump. He has happily done them himself \u2014 in TV appearances, speeches and tweets. (That said, his anemic campaign finance report released last week suggests that he doesn\u2019t have the money to pay for advertisements.)In the process, Mr. Trump has often barged past the boundaries of propriety and truth, and at no apparent cost, at least among his supporters. In recent years, presidential campaigns have made it a practice to release detailed documentation of the charges they make in negative advertisements or speeches: a list of votes, transcripts from interviews, legal documents. Media organizations have become increasingly rigorous in policing advertisements, calling out errors and falsehoods that could prove an unwanted embarrassment for the campaign making the accusation.This has not been the case with Mr. Trump. \u201cYou say, \u2018My opponent did this,\u2019 so you have to provide some evidence that they did something,\u201d said Richard R. Lau, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. \u201cBut Trump doesn\u2019t care what the truth is. Trump has gotten so much free advertising for saying outrageous things.\u201dHis approach, attention-grabbing and arguably entertaining, served him well in the crowded field of a Republican primary. But Mr. Trump is now competing for support among a much broader electorate, and against a candidate who has far more experience in presidential campaigns \u2014 and in being the target of all kinds of attacks.Indeed, many analysts said, there is a strong argument that he is vulnerable to a negative campaign in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. Opinions on Mrs. Clinton seem set in cement at this point; short of her being indicted, it\u2019s hard to imagine information that could dramatically change voters\u2019 opinions of her.By contrast, Mr. Trump may be one of the most famous people on the planet, but his life off the public stage has not received much scrutiny, as became clear with the revelations about Trump University, described by some of its students as a fraud.\u201cWhile people know who Donald Trump is, they do not know a lot about him,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who worked for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign and first presidential campaign. \u201cThere is very little awareness of his business record, or other aspects of his career. I think when a story runs about the number of lawsuits he\u2019s been engaged in or the number of people he\u2019s sued or the number of people he\u2019s stiffed payment, that\u2019s new information.\u201dNegative campaigning, as much as voters say they disapprove of it, tends to work. With its dark and detailed invocations of a candidate\u2019s votes and quotes, a negative campaign can provide voters with the type of information they need to make an informed choice.The most effective attacks portray a candidate as ideologically or culturally alien, unqualified for the job or a threat to national security or the economy.In 2004, President George W. Bush lampooned his Democratic opponent, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, with a video clip of Mr. Kerry in a wet suit that made him appear to be windsurfing back and forth across the water. It made Mr. Kerry seem slightly effete, while reinforcing a central Bush critique of Mr. Kerry\u2019s candidacy: that he was a flip-flopper.Four years later, during the Democratic primary in Texas, Mrs. Clinton broadcast an advertisement showing a young girl sleeping peacefully in bed as a telephone rings in the background at 3 a.m., presumably with bad news. Supporters of Mr. Obama were riled, but it raised legitimate questions about the ability of Mr. Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois, to deal with a breaking foreign crisis.No matter the obstacles, there are powerful incentives for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton to turn to negative campaigning. The sheer volume of attacks churning the political ecosphere \u2014 on Facebook, Twitter and cable news \u2014 means it takes a lot for a candidate to break through. \u201cThe news media love to cover the negativity,\u201d said John G. Geer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University. \u201cAnd the ad people know it.\u201dAnd with their high unfavorable ratings, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have considerable strategic motivation to go on the attack.COREY LEWANDOWSKI, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager until he was forced out last week, said in an interview before his departure there was still much left to tell voters about the former secretary of state.\u201cLook, if you remember during the first Clinton administration \u2014 when Bill was there \u2014 that was 16 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people forget what he was like as a president, and what his policies were. Particularly new voters. And I think many people overlook what Hillary Clinton\u2019s record was like as United States senator.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t started,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there is an opportunity to remind people that her career in public service goes well beyond secretary of state.\u201dJoel Benenson, who is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior strategist, was similarly bullish on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects for making the case against Mr. Trump. Mr. Benenson said Mr. Trump had largely been spared during the primaries.\u201cThey didn\u2019t take him on,\u201d Mr. Benenson said. \u201cThey were running in a primary, they were competing for like-minded voters. You have to draw meaningful contrasts and they didn\u2019t do that.\u2019\u2019\u201cEverything he represents and that he is showing day after day is how dangerous and divisive he is and how that undermines our national security and will crash our economy,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen we make a choice, you want to know the good and bad about who you are considering,\u201d Mr. Geer said. \u201cCandidates will only tell you that they are wonderful.\u201dAdam Nagourney is Los Angeles bureau chief and a former chief national political correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro 2016 Finds the Spark It Was Lacking", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byGlobal SoccerLONDON \u2014 A few days after voting to separate from the European Union, England found a far faster way out of Europe: via the playing field. When England lost, 2-1, to Iceland, the smallest nation ever to qualify for the European Championships, it was another victory in this year of the underdog. Iceland\u2019s win was a merited one Monday, primarily because of the team\u2019s organization and its never-say-die Scandinavian spirit.The one thing uniting England\u2019s players and its politicians right now is that neither realize how isolated and ridiculed they are. For the English, the loss on Monday was a parody of self-delusion. It ranks as the biggest shame on England \u2014 which invented the game of soccer \u2014 since 1950, when it was knocked out of the World Cup by the United States, a group of part-time players assisted by the Haitian Joe Gaetjens.At least Gaetjens, the scorer of the only goal in that game, was a striker. The first Icelandic scorer on Monday, and the best player on the field in Nice, France, was a defender, Ragnar Sigurdsson.A journeyman eking out a living by playing in the Russian league for Krasnodar, Sigurdsson reacted more quickly than any Englishman could to a very simple ploy.It was a long throw-in, a basic tactic devised in England, that gave Sigurdsson his opportunity. On Monday, England seemed to know neither who formed its best team, nor what its most effective tactic was. Sigurdsson, on the other hand, never lost sight of what he was on the field to do.His defending was as exemplary as England\u2019s was inept. Sigurdsson made 10 clearances and 5 interceptions, won four aerial duels and made one tackle as the last man in defense on Monday.That last-ditch tackle defined him. For a second, Jamie Vardy, the Leicester City striker renowned for his speed, seemed to have a clear shot at the goal. Then Sigurdsson caught up to him, snapped into the tackle and won the ball, extinguishing England\u2019s last hope.The resignation of England\u2019s veteran manager, Roy Hodgson, was immediate and inevitable after the loss. The deeper source of England\u2019s humiliation lies in the fact that seven of every 10 players in the Premier League now come from abroad. Many come from other European Union countries, which until now have had automatic passport rights to Britain. So maybe that is the long-term plan to improve British soccer? Withdraw from the European Union and take back sovereignty over the players in \u201cthe best league on earth\u201d? L\u2019Equipe, the French sports newspaper, had one word for Iceland\u2019s accomplishment. It was \u201cg\u00e9nial,\u201d or awesome. A Sunday quarterfinal against France, at the Stade de France, is next up for the minnow of this year\u2019s tournament.It was almost as if a great light had been switched between the two areas where soccer is greatest. \\The Euros came alive on Sunday and Monday. It started with Antoine Griezmann\u2019s opportunist goals for France and continued as Eden Hazard\u2019s dancing feet lifted Belgium. Julian Draxler and Mario G\u00f3mez showed that Germany does have an extra dimension. And Graziano Pell\u00e8 put the finishing touch to Italy\u2019s thoroughly meritorious dethroning of Spain, the 2012 and 2008 champion.While all that was happening, while Europe\u2019s big guns began to show their light, the Copa Am\u00e9rica faded into darkness. The violence, smothering of talents and questionable refereeing in the final was as depressing as anything seen at the Euros. And its aftermath \u2014 the \u201cretirement\u201d of Lionel Messi and the suspicion that half the Argentina side might go with him \u2014 is not so much an admission of a lifetime of underperformance by its players as a rebellion against the corruption of the Argentine soccer federation.Its corruption ran close to FIFA\u2019s. Julio Grondona led FIFA\u2019s finance committee for years, and he was also head of the Argentine soccer federation for 35 years \u2014 a third of its entire existence. But he was avuncular, and he could convince Diego Maradona, and later Messi, to play for their country. Now, with no real leadership and no clear pattern of how it should embrace and get the best out of genius, Argentina has lost another tournament it was expected to win.Argentina differs from England in that it has, or had, the best lineup of attacking players in the world. The players must take some responsibility for their string of failures, but the administrators are the real betrayers.In soccer, \u201cthe Beautiful Game\u201d is only a memory. It is reduced to cheering for the underdogs to beat the high and not-so-mighty through sheer determination. And Iceland, with a population of about 330,000, the same as the city of Leicester, moves on, while England heads home. In 1992, Denmark voted to move away from the European Community when it rejected the Maastricht Treaty. Later that same month, Denmark became the smallest country to win the European Championships. Scandinavian success and E.U. politics overlapped 24 years ago. So what about this year, with Iceland winning it all?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Hillary Clinton, a Risk of Excess Caution in Economic Policy", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWith the threat of terrorism dominating the headlines, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign advisers may not have stuck that slogan to the wall at their headquarters in Brooklyn, as James Carville did for her husband, Bill, in Little Rock, Ark., nearly a quarter-century ago.But they might as well have. For one thing, Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and strong favorite to win the presidential election come November, proposed to draft Mr. Clinton as an economic adviser. Moreover, she has hitched the economic strategy of her presidential bid to the animating principle that defined his presidency: jobs, jobs and more jobs.Her lodestar? The economy of spring 2000, when unemployment reached its lowest level since the inauguration of Richard Nixon 30 years before, and when the real earnings of American households in the middle \u2014 white, black or Hispanic \u2014 achieved a peak that has not been reached again to this day.\u201cYou can aim for a lot of targeted policies in life,\u201d said Gene B. Sperling, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and President Obama, who has offered advice to Mrs. Clinton during her two presidential campaigns. \u201cBut few come close to what you get from tight labor markets.\u201dTrue enough. Her general proposition \u2014 that creating economic conditions in which employers are desperate to attract workers to fill jobs is the best way to improve wages and benefits \u2014 is correct. And with today\u2019s jobless rate still close to 5 percent, who wouldn\u2019t like to see 3.8 percent unemployment?But the mantra that worked in the 1990s is nonetheless ill-matched to the momentous challenges posed by a nation split by vast inequities of income and opportunity; where the very idea of getting ahead has become an abstraction to tens of millions of Americans.\u201cShe needs one or two big ideas that are proportionate to the scale of the problems we are facing,\u201d said Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary during President Clinton\u2019s first term, yet endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. \u201cHer instinct is to be incrementalist.\u201dA big part of the problem is the erosion of America\u2019s working class. It has been hollowed out as trade and technology have done away with most of the well-paid jobs once available to Americans without a college degree, tipping many of them into a service economy of low wages, uncertain hours and little job security.Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals \u2014 such as tax incentives for businesses that share profits with their employees or invest in forlorn bits of the country like Appalachia, or a \u201cclawback\u201d of tax benefits when companies move jobs overseas \u2014 could help.With interest rates near zero, infrastructure amounts to a slam-dunk investment opportunity. Continuing to defer the maintenance of America\u2019s crumbling highways and water systems will certainly be more costly than fixing them now.Still, there is something anachronistic about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s focus.Her turn against the trans-Pacific trade agreement with Asian countries \u2014 a deal she once supported \u2014 makes sense within her overall strategy. Why waste time and political capital on an agreement that might make the economy more efficient but will not create lots of jobs? Still, this does not amount to a strategy about global trade.To be sure, Mrs. Clinton has been pushed to some of these positions by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Their show of force in politically crucial Rust Belt states underscored how important it was to strike a pro-manufacturing, trade-hostile stance.And yet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s careful collection of tweaks and prods is no match for the challenge.That might make her look judicious. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would raise $15.3 trillion in new taxes, mostly to pay for government-financed health care for all. Mr. Trump would cut tax revenue by $9.5 trillion, promising impossible growth in return. But excessive judiciousness can hamstring progress.What about dismissing the deficit scolds who shape the outdated Washington Beltway consensus and borrowing $1 trillion or so to sharply increase the spending on infrastructure, letting states and municipalities select the investments and manage the job?How about taking advantage of the cheapest oil prices in a very long time to propose a carbon tax? Or how about imposing a progressive wealth tax to tap into the good fortune of 160,000 American families at the very tip of the wealth pyramid, who are on their way to pass $12 trillion to the next generation, much of it untaxed.Mrs. Clinton, of course, is not the only candidate indulging in nostalgia. Witness Donald Trump\u2019s bombastic appeal to white working class men uncomfortable in an America where one must dial \u201c1\u201d for English.Still, she has a rare opportunity. If she wins, she may well come into office with the political wind at her back: a Senate returned to Democratic control and a divided Republican Party with only a tenuous hold on the House.Americans have just lived through perhaps the most progressive presidency since the 1960s. President Obama raised tax rates on the rich and expanded health insurance for millions of Americans. Facing stubborn resistance in Congress, he leaned on his executive powers to improve working conditions.Yet the nation\u2019s enormous inequities just got bigger. The income of the richest 1 percent grew 27 percent from 2009 to 2014. The average gain for everybody else barely exceeded 4 percent. A future projected along these lines does not look promising.Bernie Sanders talks about a revolution. Mrs. Clinton might want to try to deliver one.Advertisement"}

But its overriding theme is that technology should be an engine of equality rather than elitism.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s agenda includes having the federal government step in to help fill a finance gap, as banks have cut their loans to small businesses and venture capital funding is concentrated in a few regions, led by Silicon Valley.Her plan calls for \u201csupporting incubators, accelerators, mentoring and training for 50,000 entrepreneurs in underserved areas,\u201d and increasing funding for several existing programs that offer tax credits and financing for community development and small businesses.\u201cThis is a pragmatic plan that could help leverage what happens in Silicon Valley so that there\u2019s innovation and job growth throughout the country,\u201d said Karen Kornbluh, former United States ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, who is an adviser to the Clinton campaign.The Clinton program also links start-ups with the student loan crisis. Under her plan, young entrepreneurs could defer payments on their federal student loans for up to three years. The relief might also apply to the early employees of start-ups, like the first 10 or 20 workers, according to the plan.The deferred payment plan, the campaign document states, could mean that \u201cmillions of young Americans\u201d would not have to pay interest or principal on their loans \u201cas they work through the critical start-up phase of new enterprises.\u201dIt is clearly a nod to young voters, who overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries.The Clinton plan offers a liberal immigration initiative that has long been a favorite of technology executives and venture capitalists: automatically issuing permanent resident status to people who earn graduate degrees in science, engineering and mathematics from accredited universities.The Clinton program also would dedicate additional funding and resources to Obama administration policies in areas like building broadband networks in rural areas, encouraging computer science education for elementary and high school students, and job training in technology fields.Skeptics questioned spending to \u201cdouble down\u201d on programs that have not yet proved effective.\u201cNo one seems to be evaluating these programs,\u201d said Thomas Lenard, president of the Technology Policy Institute, a nonprofit research foundation.Jeffrey Eisenach, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning policy research group, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a technology plan, it\u2019s a government spending plan.\u201dBut other technology policy experts were impressed by the Clinton campaign document as a whole.\u201cShe\u2019s got a technology and innovation agenda, and this suggests it would be a strong focus in a Clinton presidency,\u201d said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit policy research group. \u201cThat in itself is a message.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tokyo Governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, Resigns Over Spending Scandal", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 The governor of Tokyo resigned on Wednesday, after he admitted using funds intended for political campaigns to pay for personal travel and entertainment, setting off a public furor.\u201cI thought it would be disruptive to have an election with the Rio Olympics right around the corner,\u201d he said in the assembly after submitting his resignation. \u201cMy main concern was for the Games.\u201dPlummeting approval ratings and defections by political allies ultimately persuaded him, however.The amounts that Mr. Masuzoe has been accused of spending improperly on himself and his family are hardly vast by the standards of modern politics-and-money scandals. There are reimbursements of a few hundred dollars here for restaurant meals, and a few thousand dollars there for hotel stays.In a report issued this month, lawyers hired by the governor to review his spending found 4.4 million yen, or about $41,000, in expenses over several years that they called \u201cinappropriate, but not illegal.\u201d Mr. Masuzoe apologized and said that there had been \u201csome mixing of public and personal\u201d in his spending, but that he had not knowingly broken any rules. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.Still, the relatively minor scale of his reported excesses did not help him.If anything, the public\u2019s antagonism appears to have deepened. The word that has perhaps been most frequently used to describe the episode is sekoi, meaning cheap or petty. That Mr. Masuzoe might nickel-and-dime taxpayers and contributors for spa trips seems to have struck a rawer nerve than if he had engaged in wholesale theft.\u201cI\u2019m angry. This is sekoi \u2014 too sekoi,\u201d Shigeru Kamibayashi, a member of the assembly from the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, where Mr. Masuzoe has spent most of his political career and which supported his bid for governor, said after the lawyers issued their report. The word has been ubiquitous in newspaper and social media references to the scandal.Among the spending that the lawyers labeled inappropriate were purchases of manga comic books, some worth just a few dollars, and a silk calligrapher\u2019s robe from a Shanghai tourist gift shop. Mr. Masuzoe charged them to his campaign organization, which by law is supposed to finance only political activities, though experts say the definition is vague enough that politicians routinely stretch it to cover private expenses.Mr. Masuzoe\u2019s travel costs in office have also come under criticism. He has taken large groups of aides on trips to London, New York and Paris, flying first class and staying in upscale hotels. Japanese news outlets have reported that he has used government limousines to travel back and forth to a home he owns in a spa town southwest of Tokyo 48 times since April last year.\u201cIs the leader of a major global city supposed to stay in a second-rate business hotel?\u201d he said on one occasion, defending his global travels as necessary to burnish Tokyo\u2019s brand ahead of the Olympics. Later, after an outpouring of complaints, he began expressing more contrition, but the damage had already been done.Mr. Inose quit in December 2013 after he acknowledged receiving a loan of more than half a million dollars from a hospital operator during an election. He denied that the money was for political purposes, but critics called it an undisclosed campaign contribution.Liberal Democratic members of the Tokyo assembly were among lawmakers from seven parties who were preparing to pass a no-confidence motion against Mr. Masuzoe on Wednesday, a threat that appears to have cemented his decision to resign. A series of recent newspaper opinion polls showed that three out of four voters wanted him to quit.His last day in office will be Tuesday, and an election to replace him is expected to take place on July 31 or Aug. 7. It will add to a busy political calendar in Japan, with elections for the upper house of the national Parliament set for July 10.His repeated promises not to waste taxpayer money ultimately bounced back at him.\u201cI\u2019ve eliminated waste,\u201d he said in response to initial criticism of his travel spending in March. \u201cBut when you have to spend, you have to spend.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Team Owners Invest in a Passion for Racing at Le Mans", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported bySpecial Report: 24 Hours of Le MansThe 24 Hours of Le Mans is one of the rare top auto races in which amateur racers, or \u201cgentleman drivers,\u201d take part, racing in a category all of their own.Often overlooked, however, is the fact that the Le Mans grid features one of the most diverse collections of team owners in racing. They come from a variety of countries and professions, including those whose lives are devoted to racing, as well as part-time owner-entrepreneurs. There is an oil magnate, a car-parts salesman, a former professional soccer player and even a Hollywood star.For all the diversity, it became clear in a series of interviews that there are two things that bind the group of owners: considerable sums of money (or a knack for raising it) and a boundless passion for the sport.\u201cFor me, it wasn\u2019t a job, it was a passion,\u201d said Hugues de Chaunac, a Frenchman whose company, Oreca, provides the chassis for nine teams racing in Le Mans and is a partner in the Toyota prototype team at the highest level of the competition.De Chaunac, 70, started out as a math teacher in a private school to finance his amateur racing habit. \u201cBut to really follow my passion, I had to set up a business,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it was always more important to win races than to win money. And because I am driven by my passion for racing, I always reinvest money in the racing.\u201dHe founded Oreca in 1973, and it grew into a vast racing-car-parts business \u2014 one of the top three in Europe. The company also builds racing cars for others. Graeme Lowdon, 51, a Briton who has a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering as well as an M.B.A., is sporting director of the Manor Motorsport team. This weekend, the team is fielding a car made by Oreca in the LMP2 category. Lowdon was a lifelong racing fan when he began working in sales in the power-station industry. While at the ABB Group in Switzerland he became involved in a client\u2019s sponsorship of an IndyCar team when the client needed someone who knew about racing. But he said that his love of the sport had come long before that.\u201cThe story really goes back to my dad,\u201d Lowdon said. \u201cMy dad was a builder who was a very keen car fanatic, and he used to drive up to Charterhall circuit and watch people like Jim Clark.\u201d \u201cHe had a large library of racing books and car brochures, and I grew up with the love of cars,\u201d he added. \u201cI followed Formula One in particular from a very early age, and I can remember putting up a poster on my wall and filling in who won the races.\u201d In 1996, Lowdon created Industry OnLine, an information exchange for clients in the power business providing information, communication and commerce. He also set up a Formula Renault team at that time, and in 2000, he merged his team with the Manor Formula Renault team. He worked on the commercial side of the team and created some other start-ups \u2014 including, in 2000, a company providing communications to high-speed vehicles. By 2010, Manor had made it to Formula One.\u201cWhen the F1 entry was accepted, it became full time, and more,\u201d Lowdon said, so he sold all of his businesses to focus only on Formula One. But he doesn\u2019t spend his own money in racing.\u201cThe thing with sponsorship which I learned is that it is incredibly effective if it is used for the right purposes,\u201d he said, adding that if it is not, then it\u2019s a waste.Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez, a Mexican insurance entrepreneur, is well aware of that, although this year, in his first year as a team owner at Le Mans, he still spends some of his money on his team, RGR Sport by Morand. He is also driving in the race, in the LMP2 class. Gonz\u00e1lez, 38, comes from a racing family \u2014 his father and brother were racers \u2014 and he started racing in go-karts at 10. He worked his way up, in Formula 3 in Mexico, the Panamericana Indy Lights, and then to the World Series by Nissan in Europe in 2003. At 25, he decided that he would not have a career as a driver and quit racing. He created a successful insurance brokerage, working with Mexican companies and the Mexican government. \u201cI had a break of seven or eight years, nothing to do with motorsports,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I stopped racing in 2003, I completely forgot about racing because I took it as a new era, or a new part of my life, and I had already done it, so I had to take care of that, and I decided to forget about racing.\u201d When he returned to racing, he said it took him a year \u201cto get up to speed,\u201d but the second year, in 2011, he won the American Le Mans Series LMPC. In 2012 he started in the World Endurance series, where in 2013 he won the LMP2 class.This is his first season with his RGR Sports team. He also will be the promoter of the Le Mans series race in Mexico this year. Scott Sharp, 48, another team owner and driver, has had the racing bug all his life. The son of Bob Sharp, a six-time winner of the Sports Car Club of America series, he grew up in racing, winning the Indy Racing League title in 1996 and the American Le Mans Series in 2009.\u201cI grew up in the family business and it was always sort of expected that I would own a team,\u201d said Sharp, who is fielding his Extreme Speed Motorsports team in the LMP2 category this weekend. \u201cI love racing, I have been at racetracks since I was 6 months old, and I started go-kart racing at 8. There has never been a year that I haven\u2019t gone all over the country driving, and I don\u2019t ever see myself going away from that. It\u2019s a super passion of mine.\u201dSharp rose up through the racing categories in the United States. He is now one of the longest-standing racers in the IndyCar series, having participated in 147 races in 14 years. He has also raced in the American Le Mans series and another sports car series. Despite his family racing pedigree, his parents insisted that he go to college. He studied business, which would end up serving him well as a team owner. \u201cI always say that my masters was in racing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause literally you do everything: You are doing the marketing, you are doing the finance, you are doing the sales, you are doing the management. It is all there.\u201dSharp said that being both owner and driver offered an advantage in that he cannot criticize the team for having a bad staff or bad operations, since he made the team, hired the staff and directs it.This year, Olivier Panis, a former Formula One driver, and Fabien Barthez, who was goalkeeper for the French soccer team that won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European championship, are running a team, with Barthez driving. Then there is the actor Patrick Dempsey, star of the television series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d A former driver, he has put driving on hold as he pursues film projects as a producer, director and actor. For several years, Dempsey combined racing with acting and even considered driving full time. But this year he decided to be just a team owner, with his Dempsey Proton Racing team, while he evaluates his racing future. \u201cWe had such a great year last year and reached all of the goals we set out to achieve, and so this was a question of re-evaluating what we wanted to achieve this year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd certainly for me, focusing on my other career as a producer and as a director was something that I had to consider as well.\u201dDempsey said that he had continued his involvement as a team owner because he felt it complemented his career in Hollywood.\u201cWorking with Porsche to see how they approach a season, or how they approach a race, or how they approach a success or setbacks, is really helping me in my other career as well, with the work-ethic mentality, all of that is very beneficial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe level of preparedness is so great, and especially in Hollywood there is sometimes less of that. Going into producing and certainly into directing, being prepared is the most important thing to be.\u201dBut above all, Dempsey has a passion for the sport. \u201cThere is a sense of a heightened reality in all of it \u2014 whether it be in your testing or your preparation and also just the camaraderie, and then the competition, you look at life in a different manner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal sport, it\u2019s a tough sport, but it\u2019s rewarding on so many levels for me personally and psychologically and emotionally \u2014 and on a spiritual level there is something about it that is really quite hard to put into words.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Central Banks Worry About Engaging World Markets After \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-26", "News": "Supported byAs global markets reel after an establishment-rattling vote by Britain to sever ties with Europe, investors are again expecting central banks to ride to the rescue.And that may be the problem.Or so believe a number of investors and economists who worry that another round of central bank intervention in the markets will compound the sense of alienation, frustration and anger at global elites that encouraged a majority of Britons to opt for leaving the European Union.Traditionally, market participants have tended to cheer central bank activism.In times of financial panic, wholesale bond buying, negative interest rates and disbursing cash directly to consumers (the yet-to-be-deployed weapon in the central banker\u2019s armory) have been seen as easy policy substitutes for governments unwilling or incapable of taking action themselves.But, as the world\u2019s leading central bankers finished a weekend of brainstorming in Basel, Switzerland, as to what their next move might be, some feared that this time around they might do more harm than good.\u201cPeople say that central bankers have not done enough, but they have done too much already,\u201d said Stephen Jen, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund in London.But the British referendum results and the sharp fall in the markets that followed brought an extra urgency to the two-day meeting.On Saturday, Agust\u00edn Carstens, the head of Mexico\u2019s central bank and chairman of the bank\u2019s policy group that monitors the global financial system, said that committee members had \u201cendorsed the contingency measures put in place by the Bank of England and emphasized the preparedness of central banks to support the proper functioning of financial markets.\u201dAdding to global political tensions were parliamentary elections on Sunday in Spain, where the anti-austerity left-wing party Podemos was expected to continue its recent run of electoral success.While the sell-off in stocks on Friday was very sharp, market participants said over the weekend that they were heartened that major market makers were able to absorb the selling fairly well.Playing a central role were exchange-traded funds, which at one point on Friday accounted for close to 50 percent of overall trading volume in stocks. That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the funds were largely unknown a decade ago as an investment option for investors.The ability for investors to quickly and successfully buy and sell stocks and bonds, the crucial advantage that exchange-traded funds have over mutual funds, is seen by regulators as critical in times of acute financial stress.Part of the conundrum for central bankers is that the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like Lehman Brothers going bankrupt in September 2008, which provided authorities with an unassailable excuse to intervene. Lehman\u2019s failure caused markets to seize up and financial institutions to stop dealing with each other.But when the crises that rock global finance are social and political, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend any form of extraordinary intervention.And that is what worries analysts, who for some time now have been concerned that interventions by central banks were distorting markets by making them less liquid and creating anomalies such as what currently exists in Japan.There, the nation\u2019s central bank owns 34 percent of the country\u2019s government bonds and is one of the top 10 shareholders in 90 percent of the companies listed on the stock exchange, according to data from Bloomberg.\u201cCentral banks have done everything to jury-rig markets,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes. \u201cWhat makes you think they won\u2019t want to do more?\u201dMr. Jen, the hedge fund manager, scoffed at the notion that the extraordinary central bank interventions of recent years were designed to stamp out deflationary threats and spark an increase in prices and economic activity in stagnant economies in Europe and Japan.\u201cWe have plenty of inflation, it\u2019s just asset price inflation,\u201d he argued, referring to elevated equity, bond and housing markets that have been one consequence of these policies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t live in cities anymore, and they are grumpy about their jobs.\u201dInterestingly, one of the most vocal critics of central bank overreach has been the Bank for International Settlements itself.For years now, two senior economists at its research arm, Claudio Borio and Hyun Song Shin, have been arguing via speeches and papers that artificially low interest rates have created pernicious asset bubbles in equity and housing markets in the developed world and debt frenzies in emerging markets like China and Brazil.These views were highlighted again on Sunday in Basel with the presentation of the bank\u2019s annual report.In a speech, Jaime Caruana, the bank\u2019s managing director, said that extremely low interest rates were a threat to global financial stability as they \u201cdepress risk premia and stretch asset valuations.\u201dThe result, Mr. Caruana contended, was the threat of a \u201closs of confidence in policy making\u201d and \u201cunrealistic expectations about growth and the ability of present policies to lift global growth.\u201dWhile couched in platitudes, Mr. Caruana\u2019s message was clear enough. Persistent central bank interventions have not only created dangerous distortions, they have added to a sense of worldwide cynicism that these measures have not accomplished their central aims: lifting economic growth and increasing wages.But, Mr. Brigden said, central bankers will have a harder time justifying an intervention when the markets are going haywire because of an election upset somewhere.Of course, bashing central bankers is always a popular and easy pastime for politicians, economists and investors alike.It is also true that central bankers in Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States have consistently said that their actions have been forced by the unwillingness of politicians and governments to act themselves.\u201cMonetary policy cannot do it alone,\u201d said Daniel C. Dektar, a bond investor at Amundi Smith Breeden, a global asset manager. \u201cPeople have been left behind, which is creating anti-establishment sentiment in just about every democracy in the world. You would think that at some point governments would get the message.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But historians say they believe this is the first time that the president of an elite university has met with the descendants of slaves who had labored on a college campus or were sold to benefit one.\u201cI came to listen and to learn,\u201d Mr. DeGioia said in an interview, describing the discussion as \u201cmoving and inspiring.\u201dMs. Bayonne-Johnson, an amateur genealogist and retired teacher, said she believed Mr. DeGioia was willing to take necessary steps \u201cto honor the sacrifice and legacy\u201d of her ancestors.\u201cHe asked what could he do and how could he help,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt was a very good beginning.\u201dThe meeting comes as officials at Georgetown continue to grapple with how to address the college\u2019s complicity in the slave sale. The slaves, who were owned by the Jesuit priests who founded and ran the college, were sold for about $3.3 million in today\u2019s dollars.A portion of the profit \u2014 about $500,000 \u2014 was used to help pay off Georgetown\u2019s debts at a time when the college was struggling financially. The slaves, who had lived on Jesuit estates in Maryland that had helped to finance the college\u2019s operations, were uprooted and shipped to plantations in Louisiana.A working group assembled by Mr. DeGioia in September has been considering whether the university should apologize for profiting from slave labor, create a memorial to those enslaved, or provide scholarships for their descendants, among other possibilities. The report is expected to be released this summer, Mr. DeGioia said.\u201cGeorgetown has made a decision to recognize the humanity of the problem they\u2019re dealing with, to treat it as more than a public relations problem,\u201d Mr. Wilder said.The search for descendants of the men, women and children sold in 1838 intensified in the fall after Georgetown students called on the university to remove the names of the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry from two campus buildings. The priests were two of Georgetown\u2019s early presidents. Both were involved in the slave sale. Mr. DeGioia, who had already called for a campuswide discussion about the college\u2019s roots in slavery, agreed to change the names of the buildings.\u201cThese were real people,\u201d Ms. Bayonne-Johnson said of her enslaved forebears, \u201cand I wanted to put faces on them for him.\u201dBill Morlin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Much of his speech was devoted to urging his followers to continue fighting for causes like universal health care, free public college and an end to fracking, regardless of who wins the general election in November.The event, which was organized by National Nurses United, a labor union that campaigned heavily for Mr. Sanders, featured discussions about how to encourage like-minded people to run for local offices and to push groups to work together on issues like racial justice, income inequality and electoral changes. One session included discussion of protest methods, using mock sit-ins and arrests, for the Democratic National Convention next month in Philadelphia.Panels included \u201cThe Robin Hood Tax: Challenging Wall Street, Neo-Liberalism and Perpetual Debt\u201d and \u201cEnding Voter Suppression, Mass Incarceration, Deportations and Gender Inequality.\u201dMr. Sanders did not attend, though \u201cBernie 2016\u201d hats, buttons and pins were easy to spot, and songs from the senator\u2019s rallies, like Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cAmerica,\u201d blasted through speakers. Conference attendees effortlessly repeated elements of his stump speech \u2014 \u201crigged economy,\u201d \u201ca corrupt campaign finance system.\u201dSome of Mr. Sanders\u2019s Democratic surrogates did show up, like Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who delivered a fiery speech urging people not to allow the party to return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201dThe question of whether to support Mrs. Clinton in November was not an official topic of discussion, but it was on a lot of minds nonetheless.\u201cI\u2019m very frustrated by people who are like, \u2018Vote blue, no matter who,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ramos Rios said. \u201cI feel like we are being threatened with the boogeyman of the dream state and not confronting the actual difficulty that we have in front of us, which is we are being ruled by an oligarchy.\u201dSome at the Chicago gathering said they might vote for a third-party candidate. Others said they would write in Mr. Sanders\u2019s name. (None of the people interviewed said they would vote for Mr. Trump.)Curtis Anderson, 29, an estate groundskeeper from Plainfield, Ill., said that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton, but that that was about all he would do for her. \u201cI campaigned 500 hours for Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t campaign five minutes for Hillary.\u201dNaomi Klein, a progressive author, spoke on Friday night at a panel about the way some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters were feeling. \u201cLet\u2019s not be afraid to admit that we come here wounded and that we also come here in pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are grieving political losses, dreams tantalizingly tasted but ultimately unrealized.\u201dPolls suggest that a large majority of people who voted for Mr. Sanders will back Mrs. Clinton, and in tight races in swing states, her campaign will welcome that support.On the opening panel Friday night, the journalist Juan Gonzalez said that he belonged to the antiwar group Students for a Democratic Society in 1968, and that like some other members, he sat out the presidential election that fall. Richard M. Nixon beat Hubert H. Humphrey by less than a percentage point, and Mr. Gonzalez said he wondered whether the result could have been different.\u201cOur slogan was, \u2018Vote with your feet.

When it closes on June 26, it will have offered 45 pieces of theater, music, dance and digital works, 12 of them premieres \u2014 and dozens of talks, events, encounters and parties.

As Ms. McKenzie talked, she often paused to greet theater directors and artists from all over the world, many coming to see a matinee of Jo\u00ebl Pommerat\u2019s epic French Revolution drama, \u201c\u00c7a Ira.\u201dAmsterdam \u201cis a city with the most fantastic cultural life and several world class institutions \u2014 the opera, Dutch National Ballet, the Koncertgebouw orchestra, the Toneelgroep,\u201d Ms. McKenzie said. \u201cIn bringing international work here, you have to be adventurous, surprising and different. One of my aims is to find you an experience that you won\u2019t forget.\u201dOver four and a half hours, we move from the attempt by Louis XIV and his finance minister to raise taxes for the bankrupt state of France; their efforts to get the nobility and clergy to pay taxes alongside the bourgeoisie or third estate; the eventual formation of the representative Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the fight to write a declaration of the rights of man versus the urgent needs to address famine, fear and lawlessness.Mr. Pommerat, whose work should be much better-known to English-speaking audiences, manages to make a thrilling edge-of-the-seat drama out of the political infighting and partisanship that forged a democratic process. It is politics as riveting theater, the best history lesson you\u2019ve ever attended. It is also entirely relevant to the issues now confronting Europe: austerity, nationalism, refugees, the rise of ultraright political parties, and conflicting ideas about the meaning of freedom, equality and fraternity.Mr. McBurney is alone on stage, alternating between incarnating Loren McIntyre and reverting to himself as he muses on the workings of memory and the nature of time, and deals with his (invisible) 7-year-old daughter who keeps demanding food, drink and stories. It is a compelling, and often moving, performance, and a work that asks you to think about technology, belief systems, social customs, rapacious materialism, the environment and theater itself. You can see Mr. McBurney creating the effects before your eyes; you know a team of technicians is hard at work. Nonetheless, it\u2019s the imagination that does the transporting.That wasn\u2019t the case with \u201cPrivacy,\u201d a coproduction by two Dutch theater companies, Die Warme Winkel and Wunderbaum, which featured two naked actors (Wine Dierickx and Ward Weemhoff) talking about their sex lives, toilet problems and fertility issues. It was clearly an attempt to explore the boundaries of what can be said onstage (the fertility conversation feels most painfully wrong), but it felt more like a workshop than a realized piece.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Single Senator Stymies the Export-Import Bank", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thursday is an ignominious anniversary for the government agency that helps finance foreigners\u2019 purchases of American exports. Thanks to a single senator, it has been a full year since the 82-year-old Export-Import Bank could approve deals exceeding $10 million, a limit that rules out high-dollar deals on airplanes, power generators, heavy equipment and nuclear reactors.More than 30 transactions worth more than $20 billion to American businesses are stuck awaiting assistance for their buyers, in the so far vain hope that Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama and once a bank supporter, will end his power play and allow the agency to fully function.Last June 30, the so-called Ex-Im Bank two blocks from the White House closed its door to all new business after a faction of conservative Republicans, denouncing \u201ccorporate welfare,\u201d blocked renewal of its charter.\u201cIt\u2019s very troubling to me, and I think a lot of others, that one person can hijack a process and keep the export credit agency from functioning in the United States when two-thirds of Congress support it,\u201d Mr. Rice said.Two weeks ago, G.E. announced it would expand manufacturing of gas turbines in France rather than Greenville, S.C., in return for French export financing for sales in countries including Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Mexico.Last September, G.E. announced a flurry of moves: creating up to 1,000 jobs in the Czech Republic to produce turboprop aircraft engines; shifting 500 power-project jobs from Texas, South Carolina, Maine and New York to France, Hungary and China; promising 1,000 energy-sector jobs in Britain, whose export bank will finance up to $12 billion in G.E. sales to Brazil, Ghana, India and Mozambique; and relocating 350 engine manufacturing jobs from Waukesha, Wis., to a new factory in Canada.\u201cIs it going to put G.E. out of business? Absolutely not,\u201d Mr. Rice said. \u201cWe can go to a plant in France, or a plant in Switzerland and Germany.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cA lot of our suppliers can\u2019t come with us.\u201dBoeing is working with Britain\u2019s agency to finance airplane purchases for unspecified customers, on the condition that Boeing use Rolls-Royce engines. A company based in Bermuda canceled a contract for satellites, a company in Singapore declined Boeing\u2019s bids to sell satellites and Ethiopian Airlines wrote the manufacturer that the lack of Ex-Im Bank financing threatened \u201cour ability to purchase Boeing aircraft in the future.\u201dMr. Shelby was unavailable over several days to discuss the issue, a spokeswoman said. She instead provided a statement that the senator \u201cbelieves that his actions are in the best interest of the American taxpayer.\u201d\u201cNearly 99 percent of all American exports are financed without the Ex-Im Bank,\u201d it said, \u201cwhich demonstrates that the bank is more about corporate welfare than advancing our economy.\u201dThe bank makes money, through proceeds from its loans and insurance lines, but conservatives cite the risks to taxpayers. The bank\u2019s chairman, Fred P. Hochberg, said he had not talked with Mr. Shelby all year, adding, \u201cIn Washington, not returning a call is an art form.\u201dThe Ex-Im Bank was created during the Depression as a lender of last resort for exporters\u2019 foreign customers that cannot get commercial loans. More than 60 countries followed the United States\u2019 lead. China\u2019s export credit operation is by far the largest.By one measure, the lack of a quorum at the American bank would not seem a problem. In recent years, about 98 percent of applications for help have been for loans under $10 million. But in dollar terms, two-thirds of all assistance has gone for deals exceeding that amount, mostly for customers of big-item manufacturers like Boeing, G.E., Caterpillar, Westinghouse and John Deere.\u201cWe will certainly need a quorum at the bank for the project\u2019s completion,\u201d said Courtney A. Boone, a Westinghouse spokeswoman.Especially in the developing world, some countries require that exporters bidding for sales have backing from an export credit agency. So some American companies are seeking or accepting support from foreign agencies, which in turn require bidders to create jobs in their countries.Foreign carriers like VietJet \u201ccontinue to believe that the United States wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to dismantle its Export-Import Bank,\u201d said Tim D. Neale, a Boeing spokesman. \u201cBut the other issue is to what degree does this have a chilling effect on ongoing sales campaigns for future deliveries?\u201dAlso in May, a Boeing official at its facility in Alabama publicly criticized Mr. Shelby, saying he was putting local jobs and suppliers at risk.Mr. Shelby has stood firm, endearing him to conservative anti-government groups crusading to close the bank \u2014 and known to spend freely against politicians who cross them. Their blessing was especially important to the senator as he faced a conservative challenger in Alabama\u2019s March Republican primary. Mr. Shelby suggested to colleagues and reporters that he would let his committee act on the Ex-Im board nominee afterward.\u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t do this before the primary,\u2019\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the banking committee. \u201cWe took that to mean he\u2019d do it after he won his primary.\u201dYet Mr. Shelby continues to block Senate confirmation of J. Mark McWatters, formerly an aide to the Republican chairman of the House banking committee.Senate Democrats recently tried to force a Senate vote, bypassing Mr. Shelby\u2019s committee, but they needed the Senate\u2019s unanimous consent. Mr. Shelby objected, without further word.She added, \u201cI don\u2019t go to bed worrying about the executives at Boeing or G.E., because guess what? They have options. The American worker doesn\u2019t have options.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strategy Session With Some of Education\u2019s Top Thinkers", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byBy James E. RyanLearning technologies offer great potential to improve education, but whether that potential will be realized depends on three key factors, which have less to do with technology itself and more to do with the people using it.First, we need to ensure that we don\u2019t lose sight of the \u201clearning\u201d in learning technologies. We need to keep in mind that students learn at different rates, that it is critical to master a topic before moving to the next, that students who are engaged are likely to learn more and learn more deeply, and that active learning is more likely to engage students than passive learning.It follows that technologies that tailor learning to the pace and interests of students are likely to have bigger payoffs than those that do not.Second, we need to recognize that this is an adaptive challenge, not a technical one. We have to be thinking about fundamental questions like how we organize classes and schools, how we use time, how we think of the role of the teacher and what we expect students to learn. These are not technical questions but questions about organizational behavior and the role of teachers and principals.Finally, we must be committed to impartial, third-party evaluations of learning technologies. We need to know what is working and for whom. But we cannot rush to judgment. We need to balance our sense of urgency with patience and deliberation, recognizing that fundamental change takes time.Dean of faculty, Harvard Graduate School of EducationBy Jeffrey SelingoNearly 40 percent of American workers hold a bachelor\u2019s degree. Fifteen percent of mail carriers have a four-year degree, as do one in five clerical and sales workers.Getting a bachelor\u2019s degree is what going to college means to most Americans. Students who do not march along are often considered \u2014 or consider themselves \u2014 failures.Yet the decades-long march to college has actually closed off options for young people.As recently as the 1970s, a high school graduate had a number of options: get a good-paying job right away, enlist in the military, find a trade apprenticeship or go to college.Today, there are really only two options: the military or college. Yet only 52 percent of young people have either a two- or four-year degree or an industry certificate by the time they reach their mid-20s.Nearly half of the American work force has these jobs today, but many of them will soon be retiring. As many as 25 million of all new job openings in the next decade will be for middle-skill jobs.We need job-training institutions on par with academic institutions to attract students interested in pursuing these skilled jobs.The school receives more than 4,000 applications each year for 230 spots.We need more such pathways for students who don\u2019t want to travel the one route we offer them now.Author, \u201cThere Is Life After College\u201dBy Nicholas ChristakisOne of the most difficult challenges I faced this year was answering a Native American student\u2019s poignant question: Why should she put any faith in institutions in our society when those institutions had betrayed her people in generations past?\u201cThe same Constitution with its protection of the rights to free expression and assembly that you revere,\u201d she said, \u201cwas previously of no use to people like me.\u201dStudents of all kinds are joining traditions that revere free expression, wide engagement, open assembly, rational debate and civil discourse.But it is illiberal to use these traditions to censor others, to besmirch fellow students and to treat ideological claims as perforce facts. When students (and faculty) do this, they are burning the furniture to heat the house.Open, extended conversations among students are essential to the pursuit of truth, to moral learning and to social progress. The faculty must show students a way forward: to be harder on the problems society faces, but easier on each other. We cannot be a community of searchers and learners if we do not share the same principles at the core of our universities.Disagreement is not oppression. Argument is not assault. Words \u2014 even provocative or repugnant ones \u2014 are not violence. The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.If we fail to see this, we risk confirming for our students the old joke that we wouldn\u2019t want to join a club that would have us.Professor of social and natural science, Yale UniversityBy Marybeth GasmanIn 2014, for the first time, the nation\u2019s student body \u2014 from kindergartners to 12th graders \u2014 was majority-minority.Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States over all will be majority-minority as well. Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? I don\u2019t think so. Faculty members receive little, if any, training on teaching, and even less on diversity issues.First, these minority-serving institutions assume success on the part of their students rather than seeing them from a deficit perspective. Second, they focus on what the student needs to learn rather than what is convenient for the professor. Third, faculty members work together on classes and curriculums that empower students. Fourth, faculty members allow students to bring their full identities to the classroom. And last, the institutions give students the opportunity to participate in culturally relevant assignments.These approaches require a deeper understanding of teaching and a commitment to student learning.To meet the needs of a diverse group of students, Ph.D. programs must consider teaching in addition to research when training graduate students. Research is essential, but we also must ensure that our diverse nation truly learns.Professor of education, University of PennsylvaniaBy Harold LevyFor most of its history, America ignored the talents and potential of most Americans. We will never know what great progress might have been made in science, medicine, business and many other fields if we had taken advantage of the brainpower and abilities of all our people \u2014 regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or income level.But people from low-income families continue to face enormous obstacles.These low-income students lack money, don\u2019t get adequate counseling in high school and face many other barriers that more affluent students never encounter. To enable more low-income students to get a higher education, colleges should make socioeconomic diversity a priority. They should encourage outstanding low-income students to apply, simplify the application process and make transparent the actual tuition price and financial aid possibilities for students from struggling families.In addition, colleges should devote more financial aid to those who need it and less to those who don\u2019t, by reducing so-called merit scholarships. Colleges should also re-examine their policies of giving preferential admissions to the children of alumni.Current policies are resulting in an enormous waste of talent. We need to recommit ourselves to the American dream and being the land of opportunity for all.Executive director, Jack Kent Cooke FoundationBy Marvin KrislovWith student activism sweeping the country over issues like sexual assault, police brutality and racial inequality, American higher education is at a crossroads, as it was in the 1960s during the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.How best to serve a new generation of students facing challenges from changing demographics, rising income inequality, political tumult and doubts about whether the nation can overcome its deepest divides?How can the value of liberal arts be demonstrated when public discourse increasingly defines educational value in terms of initial income?How will higher education create a truly inclusive environment for a diverse group of students who question traditional modes of teaching and learning?First, the faculty and staff must maintain high academic standards and rigor, empowering students with the intellectual tools they will need.Second, we must welcome diverse populations and teach our students to embrace multiple perspectives, while valuing their personal experiences.Third, our institutions must serve as laboratories for collaboration to create sustainable futures that balance idealism with financial realities.Fourth, we must help our students find meaning in their education by communicating options and opportunities to apply learning, and by embracing new possibilities created by technology.All parties should have a voice in these conversations: student activists who are demanding a more relevant education, parents who are making emotional and material investments in their children and faculty members who are protecting academic freedom. We all must learn from each other.President, Oberlin CollegeBy Annette Gordon-ReedOne of the most important issues that educators face is skepticism about liberal arts education in an era that seems to be pushing STEM \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math. This is not just happening in the United States. Calls to cut support for so-called soft disciplines are also made in Europe and Asia.But just recently, the governor of Connecticut used his line-item veto power to cut support for the humanities. We seem to be rejecting the idea that it is essential for society to have people who are broadly educated, who can investigate, analyze and present their findings logically and clearly, without the aid of numbers or code.The commission took the position that \u201cthese goals cannot be achieved by science alone.\u201dWe need more homegrown engineers, but not everyone wants to be an engineer, or can be. Innovation is spurred by people who are creative in different ways. Gathering ideas from seemingly disparate fields can bring new ways to think about problems, allowing creativity to flourish.We need K-12 systems that produce students able to take advantage of all that higher education has to offer. This suggests a need for greater cooperation between those schools and our institutions of higher learning.Professor of American legal history, Harvard UniversityBy John PalfreyIt is a mistake to say that diversity and free expression cannot coexist. And yet, on campus after campus, that has been the choice served up this year: You are either for diversity, equity and inclusion in our communities, or you are for free expression. The strength of our communities depends upon a commitment to upholding both, even \u2014 perhaps especially \u2014 when it is hardest to do so.The American experiment is about the coexistence of diversity and free expression. That coexistence has not been easy, nor has it been all that successful, especially for those who have less power. And free expression has been interpreted in ways that have tended to support those in authority, rather than all people equitably.That the American experiment has not yet been entirely successful, nor fairly carried out, does not mean that the principles are wrong.Diversity and free expression ought to coexist on our campuses in particular. One purpose of education is to bring young people into contact with those of different backgrounds so that they might learn from one another.But free expression and its close cousin, the right to assemble peaceably, do not mean that anyone can say anything to anybody at any time. The First Amendment has been interpreted to permit certain restrictions of time, place and manner on speech. On our campuses, students and faculty need to act respectfully to one another to build community.The idea of diversity and free expression opposing one another may serve some immediate political purposes, but it will not serve our society in the long run.Head of school, Phillips Academy, AndoverBy Deborah TuerkheimerCampus rape is finally receiving the attention it merits. But efforts to address the problem are developing in a scattershot fashion, largely because of confusion about the university\u2019s role in responding to sexual assault.Professor of law, Northwestern UniversityBy Carol DweckEvery fall I face my class of college freshmen and announce: \u201cYour old job is over; your new job starts today.\u201dTheir old job was getting into a good college. Their new job is to become a person who will make a meaningful contribution to society.This is the generation that will determine the future of our world. Will we succumb to climate change? Will we foster equality? Will we steward new technologies to serve rather than undermine human needs and values?The answers depend on whether we can help students look beyond their next test score to focus on longer-term learning and life goals.In a recent nationwide study, led by David Yeager of the University of Texas, 9,000 ninth graders were asked what kind of assignment they wanted (even if it didn\u2019t affect their grade): 63 percent wanted an easy assignment over a challenging one.The most exciting schools in America today are predicated on the belief that intellectual abilities can be developed. They foster that belief in all of their students. And they reinforce it with rigorous, meaningful learning, allowing students to envision their future contributions. These schools understand that this can make all the difference in the world.Professor of psychology, Stanford UniversityBy Marc BrackettRegardless of all the honors classes they took in high school, or the science, technology and engineering classes they cram into their college curriculum, students today will not be fully prepared to compete in an increasingly global business environment.The problem \u2014 and the solution \u2014 is not intellectual. It\u2019s emotional.A survey of more than 123,000 students at 153 colleges by the American College Health Association in 2013 found that more than half experienced overwhelming anxiety and about a third felt deep depression during the school year.This is, or should be, worrisome to educators and policy makers, not only because of the suffering that results but also because research demonstrates that the way people manage their emotions matters for personal growth and the success of the broader society and economy.The Nobel laureate James J. Heckman has written that teaching \u201cnoncognitive\u201d skills, including recognizing and regulating emotions, would be a cost-effective way to increase work force productivity and quality.Teaching emotional intelligence \u2014 or what\u2019s more broadly referred to as social and emotional learning \u2014 to children and adults has proved to be effective and sorely needed.It\u2019s frustrating that policies to mandate and finance evidence-based approaches to social and emotional learning are slow to come. A few states have acted on their own. Leaders in Washington and across the nation need to work to equip America\u2019s youth to be competitive for the new global century. Our future \u2014 and our children\u2019s future \u2014 depends on it.Director, Yale Center for Emotional IntelligenceBy Freeman HrabowskiRecently, I visited my hometown, Birmingham, Ala., to recognize high-achieving eighth graders from public schools. I found myself reflecting on my own experiences as a 12-year-old in that city, participating in the Children\u2019s March of 1963 to fight for access to a better education, and I wondered: Just how far have we come?Only about half of students who begin college now will have earned a degree six years later; the completion rates are much lower for students of color. The gap is equally striking by income. More than 80 percent of Americans from families in the top income quartile have attained a bachelor\u2019s degree by age 24; under 10 percent of those from families in the bottom income quartile have done so. It\u2019s clear that increasing access to college is not enough.It is not acceptable for so many students to work hard to earn a college education, often going into debt, and not to succeed.We need communities that view student success as a collective responsibility. Young people need adults who set expectations and help them develop critical thinking skills and a sense of self. We need public policies that encourage all sectors to work together. There are no quick fixes. There weren\u2019t any quick fixes 50 years ago either, but through decades of commitment and hard work, we have made progress.We must remain committed.President, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyBy John B. King Jr.The $1.2 trillion that borrowers and their parents owe on student loans for college is an eye-popping number \u2014 one that some policy analysts, pundits and journalists often cite in declaring a student loan crisis.But a related challenge that deserves greater attention is the college completion challenge. President Obama has called for America to again lead the world in college graduation. Far too many students start college but do not finish; students of color, first-generation and low-income students are dropping out at higher rates than their white or better-off peers. If students borrow, they may not earn enough money to repay their loans. The typical defaulter owes less than $9,000.The bottom line is this: Debt without a degree often leads to default.Colleges, states and the federal government can change this. The Obama administration has made college more affordable by adding tens of billions in student aid and creating tax credits for college tuition, made it easier for students to repay their loans, and encouraged graduating on time.Across the country, innovative leaders are showcasing strategies that work.The University of Hawaii\u2019s graduation rate has improved significantly since the university began giving students incentives to attend class full time.These promising examples offer hope, but colleges cannot tackle this challenge alone. Congress should support proposals such as structuring the Pell grant program to raise completion rates and providing incentives to scale up other innovative approaches. States need to share responsibility, starting by reversing the trend of disinvestment in higher education.Secretary of educationBy Joni FinneyCollege is becoming less and less affordable to more and more families higher and higher on the socioeconomic ladder.According to a recent report from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University, families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay a significant portion of their gross income to send a student to a public four-year nondoctoral institution. On average, it cost 16 percent (in Alaska) to 33 percent (in New Jersey) of their income in 2013.Private institutions offered no relief, requiring outlays of 16 percent (Idaho) to 45 percent (Rhode Island) of family income.Even the safety net of community colleges is fraying. Families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay 11 percent (Mississippi) to 22 percent (Minnesota) of income to enroll in public two-year institutions.If state policy makers are serious about improving education attainment, as they often promise to do, they must make it a priority to lower the financial burden of higher education on students from low- and middle-income families to increase their chances of enrolling and graduating.Unless we make college affordable for people of all financial means, opportunity through higher education will be a false promise.Director, Institute for Research on Higher EducationBy Randi WeingartenFor people who choose educating others over enriching themselves, college debt can seem insurmountable.The American Federation of Teachers recently started a series of student debt clinics to help our members mitigate the crippling college debt incurred by millions of American students and their families. For some participants, the clinics have been life-changing.In October, a young adjunct professor from Miami attended a two-part A.F.T. debt clinic. Crushed by more than $168,000 in student loan debt and monthly payments exceeding $2,000, this professor, a single mother, was desperate. After one day of training, she applied for income-based repayment and was able to reduce her monthly payment to $700. On the second day, she told the group that it was the first good night\u2019s sleep she\u2019d had in three years.Many people simply can\u2019t afford to seek higher education, or they pay dearly when they do. Forty-seven states are spending less per student than they did at the start of the recession, after adjusting for inflation. Tuition costs have skyrocketed, putting more of the burden on students and their families.When our country realized the value of educating all students through high school, we made high school universally free. The same should be done for college today.The men and women who teach in our public schools, colleges and universities have invested in their own education so that they can, in turn, invest in the students in their classrooms. They know they won\u2019t be rewarded with huge paychecks, but neither should they be punished with crushing college debt.President, American Federation of TeachersAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Bankrupted His Atlantic City Casinos, but Still Earned Millions", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byATLANTIC CITY \u2014 The Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel is now closed, its windows clouded over by sea salt. Only a faint outline of the gold letters spelling out T-R-U-M-P remains visible on the exterior of what was once this city\u2019s premier casino.Not far away, the long-failing Trump Marina Hotel Casino was sold at a major loss five years ago and is now known as the Golden Nugget.At the nearly deserted eastern end of the boardwalk, the Trump Taj Mahal, now under new ownership, is all that remains of the casino empire Donald J. Trump assembled here more than a quarter-century ago. Years of neglect show: The carpets are frayed and dust-coated chandeliers dangle above the few customers there to play the penny slot machines.On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, often boasts of his success in Atlantic City, of how he outwitted the Wall Street firms that financed his casinos and rode the value of his name to riches. A central argument of his candidacy is that he would bring the same business prowess to the Oval Office, doing for America what he did for his companies.\u201cAtlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview in May, summing up his 25-year history here. \u201cThe money I took out of there was incredible.\u201dHis audacious personality and opulent properties brought attention \u2014 and countless players \u2014 to Atlantic City as it sought to overtake Las Vegas as the country\u2019s gambling capital. But a close examination of regulatory reviews, court records and security filings by The New York Times leaves little doubt that Mr. Trump\u2019s casino business was a protracted failure. Though he now says his casinos were overtaken by the same tidal wave that eventually slammed this seaside city\u2019s gambling industry, in reality he was failing in Atlantic City long before Atlantic City itself was failing.But even as his companies did poorly, Mr. Trump did well. He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen.In three interviews with The Times since late April, Mr. Trump acknowledged in general terms that high debt and lagging revenues had plagued his casinos. He did not recall details about some issues, but did not question The Times\u2019s findings. He repeatedly emphasized that what really mattered about his time in Atlantic City was that he had made a lot of money there.Mr. Trump assembled his casino empire by borrowing money at such high interest rates \u2014 after telling regulators he would not \u2014 that the businesses had almost no chance to succeed.His casino companies made four trips to bankruptcy court, each time persuading bondholders to accept less money rather than be wiped out. But the companies repeatedly added more expensive debt and returned to the court for protection from lenders.After narrowly escaping financial ruin in the early 1990s by delaying payments on his debts, Mr. Trump avoided a second potential crisis by taking his casinos public and shifting the risk to stockholders.All the while, Mr. Trump received copious amounts for himself, with the help of a compliant board. In one instance, The Times found, Mr. Trump pulled more than $1 million from his failing public company, describing the transaction in securities filings in ways that may have been illegal, according to legal experts.Mr. Trump now says that he left Atlantic City at the perfect time. The record, however, shows that he struggled to hang on to his casinos years after the city had peaked, and failed only because his investors no longer wanted him in a management role.There are those here who fondly remember Mr. Trump\u2019s showmanship, the thousands he employed in a struggling city, and the tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue his casinos generated.\u201cHe was a great person for the company,\u201d said Scott C. Butera, the president of Mr. Trump\u2019s company at the time of its 2004 bankruptcy. \u201cWith his oversight, his brand and marketing, he\u2019s really adept.\u201dMany others were glad to see him go.\u201cHe put a number of local contractors and suppliers out of business when he didn\u2019t pay them,\u201d said Steven P. Perskie, who was New Jersey\u2019s top casino regulator in the early 1990s. \u201cSo when he left Atlantic City, it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Sorry to see you go.\u2019 It was, \u2018How fast can you get the hell out of here?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s truly going to be an incredible place,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it the eighth wonder of the world.\u201dThe Taj was certainly of outsize proportions: Its 42-story tower was New Jersey\u2019s tallest building, and the casino was the world\u2019s largest.In a remarkably short time, Mr. Trump had become a commanding figure in Atlantic City, with his casinos accounting for nearly a third of its gambling revenues and employing more than 8,000 people.Harrah\u2019s agreed to provide Mr. Trump, who did not put any additional money into the deal, with $220 million in financing to build the project, to pay him a $24 million construction management fee and to give him half the profits.The following year, Harrah\u2019s scuttled its partnership with Mr. Trump and sold him its stake in Trump Plaza for more than $220 million.In the end, Mr. Griffin got the company, while Mr. Trump won the still-unfinished Taj Mahal.Mr. Trump told the commission in 1988 that he could rein in expenses, because conventional lenders were lining up to give him money at low interest rates. He said he abhorred junk bonds, which were then popular, because they carried a bigger risk of default and thus came with higher interest rates.Less than two weeks before the casino opened, Marvin B. Roffman, a casino analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, an investment firm based in Philadelphia, told The Wall Street Journal that the Taj would need to reap $1.3 million a day just to make its interest payments, a sum no casino had ever achieved.\u201cThe market just isn\u2019t there,\u201d Mr. Roffman told The Journal.Mr. Trump retaliated, demanding that Janney Montgomery Scott fire Mr. Roffman. It did.\u201cIt was doomed way before the start,\u201d said W. Bucky Howard, who was promoted by Mr. Trump to president of the Taj five days after it opened, in a recent interview. \u201cI told him it was going to fail. The Taj was underfunded.\u201dAfter more than tripling as new casinos opened through the 1980s, gambling revenues in Atlantic City flattened in 1990, rising by just 1.35 percent, as gamblers grew more cautious in light of a national recession. All were hurt, recalled Mr. Perskie, the casino regulator, but none were in the catastrophic financial shape of Mr. Trump\u2019s.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate empire in Manhattan, where the recession cut property values, was also failing.In an August 1990 report, New Jersey regulators noted the \u201csheer volume of debt\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s holdings: $3.4 billion, including $1.3 billion on the casinos and $832.5 million in loans personally guaranteed by Mr. Trump. Regulators warned then that \u201cthe possibility of a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.\u201dThe Taj Mahal missed its November debt payment. The Castle was also late.Just over a year after it opened, the Taj Mahal was in bankruptcy court, followed in 1992 by both the Plaza and the Castle. In the plan that was worked out, Mr. Trump ceded to the lenders a 50 percent stake in the businesses in return for lower interest rates. The lenders agreed to defer certain principal and interest payments and hold off on personal claims against Mr. Trump for five years. But there was little or no reduction in the enormous debts that would plague his gambling empire far into the future.Mr. Trump now says he looks back on the period as his golden era in the casino business.\u201cEarly on, I took a lot of money out of the casinos with the financings and the things we do,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cAtlantic City was a very good cash cow for me for a long time.\u201dOthers were hurt.\u201cHe helped expand Atlantic City, but he just did not put the equity into the projects he should have to keep them solvent,\u201d said H. Steven Norton, a casino consultant and a former casino executive at Resorts International. \u201cWhen he went bankrupt, he not only cost bondholders money, but he hurt a lot of small businesses that helped him construct the Taj Mahal.\u201dBeth Rosser of West Chester, Pa., is still bitter over what happened to her father, whose company Triad Building Specialties nearly collapsed when Mr. Trump took the Taj into bankruptcy. It took three years to recover any money owed for his work on the casino, she said, and her father received only 30 cents on the dollar.Donald Trump has said that his brushes with financial disaster in the early 1990s reminded him of a lesson his father had taught him: Do not leave yourself on the hook for loans.\u201cMy father knew, like I knew, you don\u2019t personally guarantee,\u201d Mr. Trump is quoted saying in \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,\u201d by Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, a former reporter for The Times. \u201cI\u2019ve told people I didn\u2019t follow my own advice.\u201dHis agreements with lenders and the two casino bankruptcies in those years still left Mr. Trump personally responsible for more than $100 million in debt, and his agreements had only delayed the day of reckoning to June 30, 1995.Step 1 came in 1993, when his company sold more junk bonds, adding another $100 million in debt to the Trump Plaza casino. More than half of the new money went to pay off Mr. Trump\u2019s unrelated personal loans.Becoming a public company burdened Mr. Trump with the responsibility of putting shareholders\u2019 interests first. But Mr. Trump, the largest shareholder and chairman of the board, could generally meet that obligation by obtaining approval from his board of directors and disclosing financial details in securities filings. The board\u2019s three outside members were widely seen as bowing to his wishes.A week after the initial public offering, the new company began using some of the almost $300 million it had raised to clear Mr. Trump\u2019s personal debts. During his financial pinch two years earlier, Chemical Bank had forced Mr. Trump to give up his ownership of the Trump Regency, a hotel next to the Trump Plaza. He held an option to buy it back for $60 million, which included debt on the hotel and $35.9 million that he personally owed the bank from his purchase of a Manhattan property. The new company exercised that option, in effect transferring Mr. Trump\u2019s debt to its own balance sheet.But some analysts \u2014 and the stock market \u2014 saw the $525 million that the public company had paid for the Castle as too much. The stock began a long slide, falling from about $35 a share before the sale, to $12 months later. Shareholders sued, alleging that the Castle\u2019s purchase price, which included roughly $175 million in cash to Mr. Trump\u2019s private holding company, had been a \u201cgross and unjustified\u201d sweetheart deal for Mr. Trump. (He later settled the suit.)Another crucial deadline came in 1998. Mr. Trump personally owed $13.5 million to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment bank that had underwritten the initial public offering in 1995; under the terms of that loan, he was in danger of defaulting, because the stock price of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts had fallen so low. A default would have made him lose control of the company. Instead, the casino company lent him the money to pay back the bankers. A shareholder sued, accusing the board of directors of breaching its fiduciary responsibility.\u201cT.H.C.R. is a casino and entertainment company,\u201d the lawsuit, filed in 1999, said. \u201cIt is not in the business of loaning money. The company desperately needed (and needs) cash to shore up its deteriorating financial condition.\u201d (The suit was dropped in 2000, shortly after Mr. Trump paid the company back.)Indeed, the company posted losses of $66 million in 1996, $42 million in 1997 and $40 million in 1998. Those losses would continue.Still, Mr. Trump made money, receiving $1 million a year for what was essentially a part-time job. In 1996, he was paid a $5 million bonus. The public company lent him $3 million to cover costs he had incurred while exploring whether to open a casino in Indiana, then forgave the loan when the stock met price targets.The casino company leased office space in Trump Tower in Manhattan, and Mr. Trump\u2019s other businesses were paid to entertain its \u201chigh-end customers.\u201d It was later alleged in a lawsuit that at least part of the money was paid for big-name performers, including Celine Dion, Tony Bennett and Billy Joel, who had appeared at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. In its response, Mr. Trump\u2019s company did not challenge that allegation.Trump casinos reported paying about $300,000 a year in \u201cpilot costs\u201d to transport high rollers in Mr. Trump\u2019s jet. The company never disclosed in securities filings just how much the jet was used for casino purposes.The public company\u2019s collapse began in 1999. Just three years after spending about $60 million to buy back the former Trump Regency Hotel and pumping in millions for renovations, the company closed it. The company spent another $26 million to demolish the building, taking a $125 million write-off.In 2000, Mr. Trump fired the chief executive and installed himself in the role, promising he would turn things around. The share price was by then hovering near $3.\u201cStock price is always a concern,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cI was focused very much on my Manhattan real estate over the last number of years. Now, I\u2019m going to be focused much more in Atlantic City.\u201dThough he has acknowledged mistakes in piling crippling debt on Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Donald Trump has steadfastly maintained that his resorts were the best-run and highest-performing casinos in Atlantic City.\u201cThe casinos have done very well from a business standpoint,\u201d he told Playboy magazine in 2004. \u201cPeople agree that they\u2019re well run, they look good and customers love them.\u201dIn reality, the revenue at Mr. Trump\u2019s casinos had consistently lagged behind their competitors\u2019 for a decade before larger forces ravaged the industry. Beginning in 1997, his share of the Atlantic City gambling market began to slip from its peak of 30 percent.Revenues at other Atlantic City casinos rose 18 percent from 1997 through 2002; Mr. Trump\u2019s fell by 1 percent.Competition grew more intense in 2003, when the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa opened. The $1.1 billion, 40-story resort redefined the concept of an Atlantic City luxury casino. Revenues at Trump casinos dropped another 6 percent in a little more than a year.Had Mr. Trump\u2019s revenues grown at the rate of other Atlantic City casinos, his company could have made its interest payments and possibly registered a profit. But with sagging revenues and high costs, his casinos had too little money for renovations and improvements, which are vital for hotels to attract guests. The public company never logged a profitable year.\u201cThere\u2019s something not right when every single one of your projects doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d said Mr. Roffman, the casino analyst.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump attributed his declining market share in those years to the fact that his three casinos were competing with one another, a tacit acknowledgment that he overbuilt.\u201cThat was the bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is that I saved a lot of money in terms of dealing with costs.\u201dThe year the Borgata opened, Mr. Trump was already asking his bondholders to accept less money, in preparation for a third casino bankruptcy. Yet, at the same time, he managed to pull more money out of the company for himself, The Times found.Since taking Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts public, Mr. Trump had been bound by a \u201ccontribution agreement\u201d that required him to engage in the gambling businesses only through his own company and banned him from personally owning more than 5 percent of the stock in any other casino company. So when he bought 10 percent of the shares in Riviera Hotel and Casino, a company based in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump was required to grant an option to purchase the shares to his public corporation.However, when Mr. Trump sold the Riviera shares in April 2004, the company, which was entitled to the proceeds, simply canceled the option, without explanation.The company\u2019s description of the sale did not disclose Mr. Trump\u2019s profit or how he had sold the shares. But in its securities filings, Riviera reported that Mr. Trump had sold the shares in a privately negotiated sale for $10 a share, well above the going price. That would have generated a gain of more than $1 million.Asked to review the transaction by The Times, James D. Cox, a professor at Duke University Law School who specializes in corporate and securities law, said such \u201cmaterial omissions of fact\u201d in the filings by the Trump company could have resulted in criminal charges \u201cif it is knowing and willful,\u201d though such charges are rare.\u201cI think the biggest thing is, it understates his compensation,\u201d Mr. Cox said.At the time, the company was also asking its lenders for a break, and headed toward another bankruptcy.\u201cBasically, that sounds like a fraudulent conveyance,\u201d said David Skeel, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\u201cThe company is throwing away money,\u201d Professor Skeel said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of giving big bonuses to your executives right before you file for bankruptcy.\u201dBut lawyers involved in the bankruptcy case said the transaction had apparently gone unnoticed.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump said that he did not recall the transaction or why the board had canceled its option.Months later, in November 2004, the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the third such trip for Trump casinos.This time bondholders took a $500 million loss. Mr. Trump, who stepped down as chief executive but remained chairman of the board, agreed to invest $55 million of his own money in the company, perhaps his first cash investment. He still received $2 million a year under a \u201cservices agreement,\u201d which included the use of his name.Shares sometimes traded below a dollar, but Mr. Trump said the problems had been fixed.\u201cFor the first time ever, this will be a deleveraged company,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Las Vegas Sun in 2005.Not everyone agreed. Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime investment bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette had backed out of a deal with Mr. Trump to invest in the company shortly before the bankruptcy was filed. Suing for $26 million in fees, the bankers said in court papers that the casinos would be back in bankruptcy court within five years because Mr. Trump\u2019s revenue projections were too rosy and the company was still carrying too much debt.\u201cThe Trump name does not connote high-quality amenities and first-class service in the casino industry,\u201d lawyers for the investment bank said. \u201cRather,\u201d the Trump name is associated with \u201cthe failure to pay one\u2019s debts, a company that has lost money every year, and properties in need of significant deferred maintenance and lagging behind their competitors.\u201d (The dispute was later settled.)When Donald Trump has been pressed on his casinos\u2019 performance during his presidential campaign, he has repeatedly said he left Atlantic City at the right time.\u201cAtlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City,\u201d he said during a Republican Party debate last September, according to a transcript. \u201cI knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it.\u201dThat would suggest Mr. Trump willingly left sometime around 2006, the year that revenues peaked in Atlantic City and that Pennsylvania allowed its first casino to open, a development that marked the start of a rapid downward spiral in the city. The drop-off was exacerbated by the recession that began in 2008.But in early 2009, as Trump casinos lurched toward bankruptcy for the fourth time, Mr. Trump was still trying to hang on. At loggerheads with board members who had been selected by bondholders after the 2004 bankruptcy, he offered to buy all or a part of the casino company bearing his name. He was rebuffed, and he quit the board soon after.Testifying in bankruptcy court in Camden, N.J., Mr. Trump argued that the company could not use his name, since shortly before filing the bankruptcy it had stopped paying him the $166,000 a month he received under the services agreement. He testified that his brand was worth $3 billion. He also testified that he was personally negotiating the settlement of a lawsuit in Florida that would yield more than $100 million for the company.And contradicting what he had said after the prior bankruptcy, he testified that the company\u2019s debt load was still too high.\u201cThis time, the debt is being cut by a lot, and the company is really poised,\u201d he said.There were odd moments on the stand. Mr. Trump, for example, vastly understated his role, saying he \u201cbecame very much less involved with the company\u201d during years when he was actually chairman of the board and chief executive, and \u201cwas on the board in a very minority position\u201d during years when he had been chairman.As in previous cases, others warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises should not be trusted. This time it was Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor who had a major stake in the company. (The two men now describe themselves as friends and Mr. Icahn supports Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.)Mr. Icahn\u2019s team argued that the remaining debt was still unsupportable, that the Trump name was replaceable, and that a windfall from the Florida lawsuit was wishful thinking. Under Mr. Trump, the company had a long history of making rosy revenue projections and never meeting them, Mr. Icahn\u2019s lawyer argued.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he left Atlantic City when he did because he failed in his effort to buy back the casinos. But he said the timing worked out well for him, in the end.\u201cIn 2009 they were worth a hell of a lot more than they are now,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re better off lucky than good.\u201dTrump Marina was soon sold for $38 million, less than 10 percent of what the company paid Mr. Trump for it in 1996. The Plaza was shuttered. The Florida lawsuit that Mr. Trump had valued at more than $100 million produced nothing for the company. Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka sued the company, saying their brand was being tarnished by the ramshackle appearance of the Taj Mahal.Mr. Trump continued to earn money from the casinos. In 2011, the casinos reported leasing a Trump helicopter for $390,000 and spending $236,000 for \u201cTrump labeled merchandise,\u201d including $197,000 for Trump Ice bottled water.In retrospect, David Hanlon, a veteran casino executive who ran Merv Griffin\u2019s Atlantic City operations at the time of the Resorts battle, said, Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that \u201chis name had real value.\u201d\u201cThey were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cThey let him strip out assets. It was awful to watch. It was astonishing. I have to give Trump credit for using his celebrity time and time again.\u201dFor a time, Mr. Trump lent a glamorous sheen to the faded resort city. But some of his former investors no longer see the value.\u201cPeople underestimated Donald Trump\u2019s ability to pillage the company,\u201d said Sebastian Pignatello, a private investor who at one time held stock in the Trump casinos worth more than $500,000. \u201cHe drove these companies into bankruptcy by his mismanagement, the debt and his pillaging.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Challenges of 2016", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "At the end of 2015, we asked what you felt was the greatest challenge facing the United States in the coming year. Over a thousand readers responded, and while their answers varied widely, a few common themes emerged. Below are some of the issues readers brought up the most frequently:Climate change The climate crisis dwarfs all other issues. Climate change has put weather on steroids. The oceans are becoming acidified. The adverse consequences are already having a disparate impact on the poor. And it will only get worse. We need to use less energy, replace fossil fuels with renewable energy (like wind and solar) for our remaining energy needs, and adopt land use practices that stop deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. Even if we stopped all carbon pollution today, impacts would continue to increase for some time due to the time lag in our climate system. It is important that we both move to eliminate fossil fuels, and begin to prepare for the impacts we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid through smarter planning and actions to improve the resilience of communities to stronger and more frequent storms, droughts, heat waves and sea level rise.The biggest challenge faced by America in 2016 is that of moving our energy use away from fossil fuels in order to address climate change.There is overwhelming scientific consensus that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to use of fossil fuels is warming earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate, and will result in sea level rise, loss of agricultural areas and increasingly severe weather events. The challenge is to create the political will to take aggressive action consistent with this knowledge by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.The EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clean Power Plan, and recent Paris agreement are steps in the right direction, but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sufficient to put us on a safe path. We can achieve a greater reduction of carbon emissions by creating incentives which work throughout the economy to encourage conservation and a shift to low-carbon energy. Incentives such as a tax on fossil carbon can accomplish this without damaging the economy, if carbon-tax revenues are returned to households, for example as a dividend similar to a tax refund.As Bernie Sanders so simply said in the debate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTerrorism can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring down our civilization, but climate change can.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMoney in politicsThe biggest problem the United States faces in 2016 is the restoration of a constitutional democracy run by the people and for the people. We are on a slippery slope where gerrymandering, voter suppression and above all, limitless dark money in elections, has placed our country in the hands of a powerful ruling oligarchy. If any of the G.O.P. candidates is elected in 2016, through subsequent appointments, the Supreme Court will become an even more powerful tool of corporations and the super-rich. America will definitely continue on an irreversible slide into corporate fascism.There are many important issues (guns, terrorism, climate change, labor, immigration, globalization, infrastructure, defense, investment, taxation, healthcare, education, research) but they are all at the mercy of campaign finance reform. Fix the fixing of elections by the wealthy and corporations, and we can fix anything.EducationThe greatest challenge is to change our educational system so that it encourages and teaches critical thinking, the evaluation of claims and evidence, and the understanding of logical argument. American citizens could then understand the evidence for and consequences of global climate change, understand other cultures and their values, and understand how to evaluate candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and legislators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claims and lies. We could then move beyond ignorance and hatred to empathy, compassion, and more active participation in ridding ourselves of injustice and inequality.Education reform \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just in 2016, but in every year. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really serious about giving every child an opportunity in this country, then we will work to have quality education \u00e2\u0080\u0094 good teachers, adequate resources, diverse classes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 available to all communities. This should require creative solutions, maybe more charter schools, or integration policies between districts, and above all, a greater commitment to change. It is a tragedy that with every passing year, more and more kids go through the American school system with a semblance of an education and little opportunity to attain more.America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest challenge is our shortfall in civic education. Its absence and the resulting dysfunction make us more vulnerable to every foreign and domestic threat. The whole country, from Senators to voters to candidates, needs remedial classes in basic governance. This lack of understanding leads to disappointment, a sense of betrayal, powerlessness and cynicism. Congress is certainly not modeling good government, but I suspect the uninformed electorate, lacking the information to direct its outrage, helps perpetuate the problem.Some years ago the teaching of Civics (how-a-bill-becomes-a-law, the balance of powers, and the basics of the electoral process) as a required course was ended. It was supposed to be integrated into other classes, but in many cases was simply set aside. The right and duty of every citizen to know about our government, to engage is the civil process and to vote needs to be elevated again. Oh where are those 7th grade civics teachers of my youth?PolarizationOur own culture of divisiveness is our biggest challenge. Tragically, this self-inflicted problem prevents us from dealing effectively with any of our other challenges (climate change, race relations, income inequality, Middle East Policy, declining infrastructure, underfunded basic science, etc., etc, etc.).The biggest threat to the United States is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The poisonous political state this country has seen develop over the past ten years or so has caused almost a standstill for economic and social growth. There are too many people with anti-attitudes about immigrants, social reforms, and economic disadvantages for the working class. People seem to be turning on each other instead of embracing what has made our country great over the centuries. We should be past the hate mongers, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far from it. In fact, it seems to be getting worse.The greatest challenge that U.S. society faces is the loss of capacity for meaningful national dialogue. As greater numbers of citizens lose their trust not just in institutions from government health agencies to grounded journalism, we seem to become more focused on truthiness than on a skeptical relationship with reliable data. If we cannot even agree on basic facts and reasonable scientific hypotheses (such as climate change), finding ways to take meaningful action becomes increasingly difficult.As someone who grew up in a tiny politically conservative agricultural community who now lives in a politically liberal urban area, I have friends on varying sides of these epistemological divides. I experience ever widening gaps as I navigate these relationships.InequalityThe widening disparity between the rich and the poor, with the shrinking of the middle class is a challenge that might just tear into the democratic fabric of America. Historically, America has rarely been threatened by the specter of inequality of this magnitude.The biggest challenge facing the United States in 2016 is social and economic inequality and how to narrow the gap between rich and poor. The way American institutions are performing now (for example, the education system from kindergarten to university, the tax system, the impoverished public sector, our social and religious values) we will soon arrive at a caste system in which reform will be impossible and America will become a very different country.The biggest threat facing the United States in 2016 is the same one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faced us for almost four decades: Class warfare by the wealthy on the working class. Bernie Sanders understands this, while none of the other candidates do.We are watching the elimination of our middle class without a shot fired. We are on a steady march towards another era of the Robber Barons where there will be just two classes: rich and poor, and with the majority of Americans having less money, who will provide the fuel for our consumer-driven economy? And what will happen to our tax revenues? And then how will we service our debt to creditors like China and others? Most empires fail within before they fail to external enemies, and unless we reverse this war on the working class by our oligarchy, our empire will fail too.\u00a0Though the concerns above came up frequently, they were far from the only ones readers mentioned. Below, a sampling of other readers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thoughts on the year ahead:Reducing gun violence. About 90 Americans die every DAY from homicide, suicide, and accidents with guns. This dwarfs that of every other developed country. The proliferation of guns is a big reason for this (yes there are other factors too). Despite the fact that most Americans want sensible and enforceable gun laws, Congress refuses to act \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because of the NRA and their ilk. This cannot be blamed on Citizens United, because it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the political will of a determined few against the apathy of the many. Until Americans stand up (at the ballot box, statehouse, and Congress), they will continue to be injured and killed by guns at theaters, schools, their own homes, and virtually anywhere. We must care enough about our fellow Americans to stop this national suicide.The biggest challenge America faces in 2016: getting people out to vote.We are faced with opportunities to make a difference in various aspects of making our votes count in 2016. The person who is elected to president will no doubt in their tenure have the responsibility to choose and appoint a Supreme Court Justice. There are many ramifications from this choice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive rights, health care opportunities, just election rights, civil rights.People, such as in Wisconsin, have been shown that elections have consequences. Our state was lax in voting. We have been left with government leaders who have taken away jurisdiction over open records, voting, court actions, environmental issues, health care benefits, educational opportunities, workplace statues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many aspects of our every day living that used to be taken for granted. Perhaps through this turmoil, citizens will realize yes, their votes do make a difference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even more, the lack of their votes makes a huge difference.Racism, in all its aspects and manifestations. Implicit racism affects relationships and interactions among people and within communities. Although different ethnic groups experience the negative effects of racism in different degrees and intensities, whenever incidents occur that are horrific or even simply incompatible with what we consider to be commensurate with our American values, it plays a role in virtually every social conflict in the U.S. We need to confront racism openly, honestly and with as much integrity as we can muster. Maybe we can then deal with manifest discrimination.A federal national debt of $20 trillion with no meaningful plan of repayment is a national disgrace. Both parties are to blame. As interest rate rise, the cost of this debt will further squeeze the federal budget for years to come. Just ridiculous. We must cut current spending or raise taxes and embark on a meaningful plan of repayment.Our biggest challenge will be resisting the urge to panic. Terrorists will inevitably strike somewhere, sometime, more than once. We will require calm and resolve, not politicians who seek advantage by scaring us to death, nor public officials who, good intentions aside, cannot display empathy. Never have Franklin Roosevelt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed wiser. We have, of course, much more to fear, but fear itself is likely to be the worst danger.Overcoming the widespread ideas that rich people are the root of all evil and that more government is the answer to our problems would be at the top of my list.Right now the biggest challenge is to elect a president who can be trusted to lead this nation with competence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 someone who is rational, sane, level-headed, open-minded \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no cronyism, no ego trips.The greatest challenge is designing a work/home environment in which both mothers and fathers may earn a living and take care of their children and domestic life as a family. The old 40-hour work week model, in which fathers brought home the bacon while dependent-spouse mothers fried it up in a pan, is pass\u00c3\u00a9. Children need to be nurtured by both parents, and females as well as males need to earn our keep and use our talents and skills in the marketplace.In my view the biggest challenge that we face is restoration of our faith in the American way of life. We need to restore our pride in America and our can do ways. We need to restore our confidence in our ability to lead. We need to embrace our emerging diversity as a strength. We need to confidently look to the future and our place in that future. We need to reject talk of fear and rejoice in our ability to confront the overcome the challenges that we will face in the days ahead. As a country we are too good, too strong, too wise to give in to defeatism and negativity. As a country we have been blessed; let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use our blessing to return with strength and confidence to our place as a model for others to emulate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It a Crime to Be Poor?", "Date": "2016-06-11", "News": "Supported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 IN the 1830s, the civilized world began to close debtors\u2019 prisons, recognizing them as barbaric and also silly: The one way to ensure that citizens cannot repay debts is to lock them up.In the 21st century, the United States has reinstated a broad system of debtors\u2019 prisons, in effect making it a crime to be poor.If you don\u2019t believe me, come with me to the county jail in Tulsa. On the day I visited, 23 people were incarcerated for failure to pay government fines and fees, including one woman imprisoned because she couldn\u2019t pay a fine for lacking a license plate.I sat in the jail with Rosalind Hall, 53, a warm, mild-mannered woman with graying hair who has been imprisoned for a total of almost 18 months, in short stints, simply for failing to pay a blizzard of fines and fees relating to petty crimes (for which she separately served time). Hall has struggled for three decades with mental illness and drug addictions and has a long history of shoplifting to pay for drugs, but no violent record.Tears welled in her eyes as she told how she was trying to turn her life around, no longer stealing, and steering clear of drugs for the last two years \u2014 but her fines and fees keep increasing and now total $11,258. With depression and bipolar disorder, she has little hope of getting a regular job, so she is periodically arrested for failing to pay.This time, she had already spent 10 days in jail for failing to pay restitution for five bad checks written eight years ago to a grocery store. The bad checks totaled a bit more than $100, but with fees and charges added on she still owes $1,200 in restitution on them \u2014 and that\u2019s after eight years of making payments.\u201cIf I can\u2019t afford to pay it, how can I pay it?\u201d Hall asked me, as we sat in a visiting room in the jail. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201dHall survives on food stamps, castoff clothes provided by churches, a friend\u2019s willingness to give her a room, and $50 a month she earns by cleaning a woman\u2019s house. She allocates $40 to paying restitution, leaving her just $10 a month in cash for her and her beloved puppy (whom her neighbor looks after whenever she\u2019s jailed for debts).\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent true that we have debtor prisons in 2016,\u201d says Jill Webb, a public defender. \u201cThe only reason these people are in jail is that they can\u2019t pay their fines.\u201cNot only that, but we\u2019re paying $64 a day to keep them in jail \u2014 not because of what they\u2019ve done, but because they\u2019re poor.\u201dThis is as unconscionable in 2016 as it was in 1830, and it is a system found across the country. In the last 25 years, as mass incarceration became increasingly costly, states and localities shifted the burden to criminal offenders with an explosion in special fees and surcharges. Here in Oklahoma, criminal defendants can be assessed 66 different kinds of fees, from a \u201ccourthouse security fee\u201d to a \u201csheriff\u2019s fee for pursuing fugitive from justice,\u201d and even a fee for an indigent person applying for a public defender (I\u2019m not kidding: An indigent person is actually billed for requesting a public defender, and if he or she does not pay, an arrest warrant is issued).Even the Tulsa County district attorney, Stephen Kunzweiler, thinks these fines are a ridiculous way to finance his office. \u201cIt\u2019s a dysfunctional system,\u201d he says.\u201cImpoverished defendants have nothing to give,\u201d Harris says, and the result is a system that disproportionately punishes the poor and minorities, leaving them with an overhang of debt from which they can never escape.The Supreme Court has ruled that people should be jailed only when they refuse to pay, not when they can\u2019t, and in theory safeguards protect the indigent. In practice those safeguards are chimerical, and the poor are routinely jailed for being poor. The way forward is to curb these fees, end the use by courts of private collection companies that add their own charges to the debt, and limit court debt to some percentage of a person\u2019s income.For now, some of the sums owed are staggering. Job Fields III told me he owes $70,000 in fees and fines. \u201cIt seems impossible,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got to think positive.\u201d Cynthia Odom told me that she owes $170,000 and constantly struggles with whether to pay the electricity bill, buy food for her two kids, or pay down the debt and stay out of jail.When kids are affected like that, as they often are, this system of jailing people who can\u2019t pay fines is grotesque as well as Kafkaesque.Amanda Goleman, 29, grew up in a meth house and began taking illegal drugs at 12, and her education wound down after she became pregnant in the ninth grade. For a time, she and her daughter were homeless.But Goleman has turned herself around. She has had no offenses for almost four years and has been drug-free for three. For the last year, by her account and her employer\u2019s, she has held a steady job in which she has been promoted \u2014 but she is still a single mom and struggles to pay old fines while also raising her three children, ages 2, 10 and 13.\u201cIt\u2019s either feed my kids or pay the fines,\u201d Goleman said, \u201cbut if I don\u2019t pay then I get a warrant.\u201d Four times she has been arrested and jailed for a few days for being behind in her payments; each time, this created havoc with her children and posed challenges for keeping a job.Webb thinks that these modern debtors\u2019 prisons are so punitive that the underlying motivation is to stigmatize and punish the poor. \u201cIt hurts their families, it doesn\u2019t make us safer, it\u2019s expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another reason other than animosity toward the poor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Benefits in New York City", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byThousands of New York City residents who are H.I.V.-positive will become eligible for public assistance for housing, transportation and food under a significant expansion of a state program that some activists had feared was being delayed.Advocates were preparing to pressure Mr. Cuomo just before New York City\u2019s annual gay pride parade and festival this weekend. \u201cWe are thankful to the governor that he has finally taken this step forward after a hard-fought campaign,\u201d Mr. Saunders said.Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel, said that Mr. Cuomo had always been committed to expanding the HASA program\u2019s benefits, but that he had had to find a way around a reluctant State Legislature. To broaden the program, Mr. Cuomo is simply modifying a longstanding social services policy that made a distinction between people who showed symptoms and those who did not, Mr. David said. \u201cThe governor took a very creative and important approach to provide services to all people who are living with H.I.V.,\u201d he said.Mr. Banks said the city had estimated that it would spend about $52 million in the first year of the program\u2019s expansion and $89 million a year after that. Mr. David said the state had estimated its contribution would be about $31 million a year.Under the program, the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration helps participants who spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing by reimbursing them the difference. They also get money for transportation and food.Advocates say that housing assistance is an effective way to help keep people with H.I.V. or AIDS from becoming homeless and from spreading the virus. \u201cWhen people have a home, they are taking their medicine,\u201d Mr. Saunders said.\u201cThis is going to help a lot of poor people,\u201d Mr. Johnson, a Manhattan Democrat, said. He added that wealthy, white men often received better services than low-income, black women. \u201cH.I.V. has really become a disease about poverty.\u201dThe governor is likely to continue to feel pressure as advocates seek to bolster services outside New York City. \u201cAdvocates are always going to push the governor, but we view him as a friend,\u201d said Anthony Hayes, vice president of public affairs and policy for the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis. \u201cThere can always be more money and it can always happen faster.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the extension of a state program for low-income H.I.V. patients paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Alphonso David, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s counsel, about what the governor had to do in order to expand services in New York City. Mr. David said Mr. Cuomo had to find a way to work around a reluctant State Legislature, not find a way to work with it.Advertisement"}

It was also the site of a 19th-century engineering feat in the Alps, a rail tunnel that opened in 1882 to great fanfare.In 1879, The New York Times lauded that project as \u201cadding another to the many records of man\u2019s industry and ingenuity in subduing the mightiest obstacles which nature has interposed in the way of free communication between country and country.\u201dIn 1947, the Swiss engineer Carl Eduard Gruner proposed a Gotthard base tunnel, between Amsteg and Bodio, but the route had to be altered several times for engineering reasons.The final breakthrough, on a section between Sedrun and Faido, came in 2010. It took 125 workers in three shifts round-the-clock to install the concrete slab track on which the trains will run, with some sections as deep as 1.4 miles.Five hundred passengers, selected from a lottery that 130,000 people entered, took part in the inaugural ride.Among the leaders in attendance were the Swiss president, Johann Schneider-Ammann, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, Prime Minister Adrian Hasler of Liechtenstein, and Chancellor Christian Kern of Austria.After testing ends this year, around 260 freight trains and 65 passenger trains are expected to travel through the two-tube tunnel each day, reaching speeds approaching 100 miles an hour for freight and 125 miles an hour with passengers. Passenger trains are expected to eventually reach 155 miles an hour.Goods currently carried by a million trucks a year will eventually be moved by trains instead.Palko Karasz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Trump regularly boasts that he is self-funding his presidential bid, but new campaign finance filings show that he is also shifting plenty of money back to himself in the process.The spending raised eyebrows among campaign finance experts and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics who have questioned whether the presumptive Republican nominee, who points to his business acumen as a case for his candidacy, is trying to do what he has suggested he would in 2000 when he mulled making an independent run: \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.\u201d\u201cHe could end up turning a profit if he repaid himself for the campaign loans,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cHe could get all his money back plus the profit margin for what his campaign has paid himself for goods and services.\u201dWhat\u2019s next for a campaign with a big fund-raising gap.In May, the biggest-ticket item was Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the Mar-a-Lago Club, his Florida resort, which was paid $423,000. The campaign paid $350,000 to TAG Air for his private airplanes, $125,000 to Trump Restaurants and more than $170,000 to Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper that houses the campaign\u2019s headquarters.Mr. Trump\u2019s family also profited from the campaign last month, with his son Eric\u2019s Virginia wine business taking in about $1,300.And Mr. Trump, who has said he will not take a salary if he is elected president, paid himself $3,085 in May. The disbursements are related to travel expenses, according to the filings.Mr. Ryan said that the extent to which Mr. Trump was utilizing his own businesses for his run was unprecedented and that because of his unique financial circumstances, he was wading into territory that went beyond the commission\u2019s guidance.\u201cWe don\u2019t have clear answers,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cHistorically, candidates would separate themselves from their business interests when running for office. Trump has done the opposite by promoting his businesses while running for office.\u201dGet the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.While candidates often gain recognition from running for president, they are barred from enriching themselves directly from their campaigns. When a campaign buys copies of a candidate\u2019s book in bulk and distributes them, for example, the candidate cannot accept royalties from the purchases. However, Mr. Ryan notes that the election commission does allow candidates who own commercial property to rent it from themselves at fair market rates, as Mr. Trump has regularly done. Mr. Trump\u2019s use of his branded water and steaks falls into something of a gray area.Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, an election law expert at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, said that Mr. Trump did not appear to be violating any campaign finance laws, but that he could face more scrutiny over the use of his businesses for campaign purposes now that he is more explicitly asking supporters to donate money to the campaign.\u201cIt is something to keep an eye on,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause as soon as you start using campaign money that has come in from donors, not just the money that he has loaned to himself, and he uses it for something that he will personally keep, or his family will personally keep, that is what crosses the line.\u201dWhether Mr. Trump could end up profiting from his campaign remains a subject of speculation; some have questioned if he will eventually ask for the more than $40 million that he has lent to his campaign to be repaid. The eventual effect of the campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s personal brand, which he has said represents a large part of his wealth, also remains unclear.Democrats on Tuesday tried to seize on the payments Mr. Trump made to his businesses as evidence of hypocrisy. Commenters on the liberal website Daily Kos ridiculed Mr. Trump for running a \u201cscampaign\u201d and overstating the personal investment he was making in his campaign by funneling the money back to his empire.Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and Mr. Trump\u2019s main rival this fall, also piled on, taking to Twitter on Tuesday to jab him over the expenditures and his relatively paltry fund-raising sum in one swipe. \u201cWhat is Trump spending his meager campaign resources on?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, himself, of course.\u201dRachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

His\n                                        approach shapes our understanding of credibility and monetary policy, exchange rate behavior and international finance.

By Monday, however, the coalition was taken off the list, after lobbying by Saudi Arabia and some of its wealthiest allies who help finance United Nations humanitarian operations.Mr. Ban offered his explanation Thursday, saying, \u201cI also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many U.N. programs.\u201dBy the standards of mild-mannered diplomat-speak, he went on to issue an uncustomarily direct rebuke. \u201cIt is unacceptable for member states to exert undue pressure,\u201d he said. The Saudi ambassador promptly asserted that there had been no undue pressure.Mr. Ban is wrapping up his 10-year tenure, and world powers are beginning to bargain over who his successor will be and just how independent she or he ought to be.Secretaries general have frequently faced intense political pressure from countries large and small, and Mr. Ban\u2019s time in charge has been punctuated with a number of awkward compromises.Israel was consulted before the release of the report, Mr. Ban\u2019s aides said at the time, and both Israeli and American diplomats lobbied intensely against the listing. In the end, both Israel and Hamas were kept off the list. Mr. Ban declined to address reporters\u2019 questions on the matter at the time, leaving it to his envoy, Ms. Zerrougui, to explain the redaction.The generally risk-averse Mr. Ban has tried to step out a bit more during his last year, but he has also repeatedly had to step back.Morocco has a powerful ally in France, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, which helps explain why the Security Council said nothing to persuade Morocco to reverse its decision. That left Mr. Ban on his own, and within days, his spokesman was compelled to swallow his words.\u201cWe regret the misunderstandings and consequences that this personal expression of solicitude provoked,\u201d said the spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric.A day after he publicly announced the invitation, he appeared before reporters and said Iran could not attend. The State Department made its opposition clear, and demanded that Iran first accept certain conditions that it knew Tehran would find unacceptable. One of Mr. Ban\u2019s aides said he felt betrayed.Asked at a news briefing on Thursday about Mr. Ban\u2019s admission of Saudi pressure, a State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, said, \u201cWe agree with the secretary general that the U.N. should be permitted to carry out its mandate, carry out its responsibilities, without fear of money being cut off.\u201dPressed about American threats to cut off funding, Mr. Toner said, \u201cI\u2019m aware of our own track record.\u201dThe president of the General Assembly, Mogens Lykketoft, who has held the first-ever public hearings for the candidates, has used the terms \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201ccourageous\u201d to describe his ideal future secretary general.That may be unrealistic. It is really up to the five permanent members of the Security Council to choose the next head of the organization, and while many of them have said they want a strong secretary general, they have also avoided calling for one who is independent.As for the Saudi-led coalition, Mr. Ban said he would jointly review the claims made by his special representative, who accused the coalition of indiscriminate attacks against children. Privately, diplomats say such a review could drag on until it vanishes from public memory.Saudi Arabia flatly denied that it had exerted any pressure. \u201cNo, of course not,\u201d the ambassador, Abdullah al-Mouallami, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is not our style. It is not our culture. It is not our spirit to use threats or intimidation.\u201dHe did say that he had met with Mr. Ban\u2019s deputy, Jan Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat, on Monday and expressed his concerns about the listing. He said he told him that \u201cit would have an adverse impact on relations between Saudi Arabia and the United Nations.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hard-to-Sell Assets Complicate European Banks\u2019 \u2018Brexit\u2019 Risks", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byNow, as banks scramble to assess the impact of a British exit from the European Union, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays and others face increased pressure from investors.While they recovered some ground on Tuesday, the stock prices of these banks have fallen sharply after the British vote, on increased fears that they will be unable to sell the billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities that they so desperately need to get rid of.Mike Mayo, a banking analyst with CLSA, refers to what he calls the 5 C\u2019s in describing what ails the big European banks \u2014 a number of which he has worked for during his peripatetic career.These are costs, complexity, capital markets, currency risks and central banks, which engineered the superlow interest rates that are squeezing margins.\u201cThe pain is not going away anytime soon,\u201d he said.Britain\u2019s decision, however, also raises more existential questions about the futures of these entities, which over the decades became rooted in the notion that London was \u2014 and would always be \u2014 the financial locus of Europe.While it is not expected that European banks will immediately resettle their London-based bankers and traders in Zurich, Hong Kong, Frankfurt or New York, the vote \u2014 and its political consequences \u2014 certainly challenges the view that London will continue to be the spiritual and financial hub of these institutions.It was precisely this mind-set that led Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Credit Suisse to hire many thousands of investment bankers and traders to staff fast-growing London offices in the 20 years leading up to the financial crisis.The wisdom at the time was that destinies were being driven by high-risk, high-return trading businesses tapping into a global finance boom centered largely in London.During the heyday, in fact, all three banks were led by executives who rose through the ranks on the strength of their expertise in peddling bonds and derivatives to global investors.Anshu Jain of Deutsche Bank and Robert E. Diamond at Barclays were based in London, while Brady Dougan at Credit Suisse made constant trips to the firm\u2019s office there from New York and Zurich.As regulators forced banks worldwide to cut back on risky businesses in recent years, worried boardrooms unceremoniously replaced the old guard with new leaders who were ordered to exit chancy areas that consumed the cash needed to fund new strategies in areas like wealth management.By any measure, it has not been an easy job.In a global financial environment that is both risk-averse and lacking enough ready buyers and sellers, offloading billions of dollars of mortgage securities, interest rate derivatives and leveraged loans has been a herculean task.Making the job harder is that the traders and investment bankers at these large banks are highly compensated, have big egos and are generally resistant to change.Perhaps the best way to assess a bank\u2019s broad risk profile is to look at its exposure to Level 3 securities, which it is required to disclose regularly. Level 3 assets are securities that because they are so opaque and complex trade very rarely, if at all.So instead of seeing where a stock, bond or more complicated item is trading now, or even a few weeks ago, and then using this information to determine how much the investment is worth, valuing a Level 3 asset requires risk managers to, quite literally, make a guess.The process has come to be known on trading desks as \u201cmark to myth\u201d as opposed to the official vernacular of mark to model.According to their 2015 annual reports, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets: 36 billion pounds for Barclays, 32 billion euros for Deutsche Bank and 31.5 billion Swiss francs for Credit Suisse.At Credit Suisse, for example, Berenberg said that Level 3 assets were 133 percent of the firm\u2019s core capital cushion. The percentage for Deutsche Bank was 96 percent and for Barclays, 49 percent.The bank\u2019s advice to investors? Sell.Since then, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have fallen by 64 percent, Credit Suisse\u2019s by 65 percent and Barclays\u2019 by 53 percent. Reflecting concerns among investors with regard to the risky assets they own, the three banks trade at steep discounts to their book value; Deutsche Bank leads the way at 70 percent.And there are few signs that the selling will let up soon, as a growing number of hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.George Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, made a multimillion-dollar wager against Deutsche Bank after the British vote to leave the European Union.His Soros Fund Management took a short position of 0.51 percent of the bank\u2019s stock on Friday, when the referendum results were announced.Marshall Wace, a London-based hedge fund, took a similar position that day.Both moves were disclosed in regulatory filings in Germany, where investors are required to disclose their short positions once they hit a threshold.In an interview on Tuesday, one of the paper\u2019s three authors, Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen, argued that the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s future in Europe made these banks an even riskier bet, as it will be all the harder to get rid of these securities in such an environment.\u201cAll this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets,\u201d Mr. Riepe said. \u201cAnd because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. It\u2019s very dangerous for the banks.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Revitalized Cleveland Is Ready for Its Close-Up", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetCLEVELAND \u2014 Just before the Republican National Convention begins, this city is making good this week on its longtime plan to renovate a 10-acre public green space, following a trend in major American cities to link park construction with economic redevelopment goals.On Thursday, Cleveland will reopen Public Square after a $50 million, 15-month renovation. More than eight years in planning, the restoration of Public Square turns it into a place that is again green enough for its original 18th-century purpose \u2014 as a pasture for sheep and cattle. It has also helped unleash a strong surge in residential and commercial construction in center city Cleveland.Mr. Corner closed Ontario Street, made Superior Avenue eligible solely for buses, and replaced wide areas of hard pavement and the sharp right angles of street intersections with acres of green lawn, flowing promenades, shade trees and gardens. A fountain near the park\u2019s center invites summertime visitors to wade and cool off. In the winter, the fountain will be converted to a skating rink.Last year, Cleveland issued construction permits for projects valued at $1.5 billion, much of it in the city center, said Edward W. Rybka, the city\u2019s chief of regional development. That is twice the value of projects permitted in 2012.In all, 29 projects with more than $3.5 billion in investment have opened or are scheduled to open in the city center from 2016 to 2018, according to the Downtown Cleveland Alliance, a civic economic development group. The projects are adding 1,500 hotel rooms, converting 1 million square feet of commercial space into about 3,300 residential units and adding 350,000 square feet of office space.Cleveland is emerging as one of the country\u2019s principal centers of biomedical innovation and development, centered on the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University. The city counts 25,000 jobs and 700 companies \u2014 400 more than a decade ago \u2014 that are involved in health and medical research, biomedical device design, information technology and other related activities.\u201cFrom a biomedical standpoint, there is so much talent moving to Cleveland,\u201d said Aram Nerpouni, the chief executive of BioEnterprise, the sector\u2019s nonprofit development group. \u201cWe just want to keep that rolling.\u201dAs the changes come, the city\u2019s three-term Democratic mayor, Frank G. Jackson, is contending with deep differences inside and outside Cleveland about how to link the economic opportunities in the prospering downtown with the city\u2019s poor neighborhoods. Cleveland\u2019s nearly 37 percent poverty rate is one of the highest of any major American city, according to the census.In an interview, Mr. Jackson expressed dismay at a new state labor law, signed on May 30 by the Republican governor, John Kasich, that nullifies a 12-year city ordinance directing contractors working on most city projects to hire Cleveland residents for 20 percent of their labor force. The Ohio Contractors Association and the Republican-controlled legislature asserted that such local quotas, which also were in effect in Akron, made it harder for contractors to hire the best people.The provision, according to figures from Cleveland, generated 4,200 jobs from 2011 to 2015, almost all of them minority workers. \u201cThat local labor provision helped people get jobs in this city,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, who is also warily watching an initiative supported by unions that could make Cleveland the only city in Ohio that requires employers to pay a $15-an-hour minimum wage.The stakes are high. After decades of decline, Cleveland\u2019s population reached nearly 397,000 last year, about 1,000 more residents than in 2010, according to the census. The increase in apartment construction corresponds with a spurt in residents living in center city Cleveland, who now number 14,000, up from 6,000 in 2002. City demographers project that the number of downtown residents could climb to 20,000 by 2020.Just weeks ago, a few blocks from Public Square, the newest downtown project opened: the 600-room, 32-story Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel. Financed by Cuyahoga County, the $275 million hotel is on Lakeside Avenue alongside the Cleveland Convention Center, which will host the news media during the Republican convention from July 18 to 21. The new Hilton is the first major hotel built in the city since 1991, and the largest.Two more hotels \u2014 the $40 million, 180-room Drury Hotel, and the $50 million, 122-room Kimpton Schofield Hotel \u2014 opened earlier this year. Both were constructed from renovated, historic office buildings.A few blocks northwest of Public Square, where the Cuyahoga River empties into Lake Erie, the Wolstein Group and Fairmount Properties developed the $395 million Flats East Bank project, which was completed in two phases. The first phase, opened in 2014, includes a 150-room Aloft Hotel; a 480,000-square-foot, 18-story office tower opened for the accounting firm Ernst & Young, which was founded in Cleveland; restaurants; and a fitness center. The second phase, opened last year, is anchored by a rental apartment building with about 240 units, and ground-floor restaurants and businesses.Closer to Public Square, several renovation projects are under construction. The Weston Group is renovating the 21-story Standard Building on Ontario Street, which opened in 1925, into 250 residences. On the other side of Public Square, Skyline International Development, a Toronto developer, is undertaking a $22 million renovation of the 98-year-old, nearly million-square-foot Renaissance Cleveland Hotel, with close to 500 rooms.Next door to the hotel is Terminal Tower, the 52-story office building that has been a signature of Cleveland\u2019s skyline since it opened in 1930. The K&D Group, one of northeast Ohio\u2019s largest apartment owners, is converting the building into 300 apartments.And six blocks away is the Metropolitan at the 9, a $275 million mixed-use project that converted an empty 45-year-old office building on Ninth Street into a 155-room Marriott Metropolitan Hotel, 150 rental apartments, and retail space and restaurants. Just around the corner, Heinen\u2019s Fine Foods last year opened a 33,000-square-foot grocery store, the first such supermarket in downtown Cleveland.Few projects in downtown Cleveland were as complex as the rebuilding of Public Square. Much of the design, construction and financing of the project was overseen by two civic groups, the Land Studio and the Group Plan Commission. Below ground, engineers reconstructed water, electric and communications infrastructure at a cost of $13 million, paid for by the utilities. Above ground \u2014 after $37 million more in construction costs, most of it privately financed \u2014 the Public Square\u2019s vehicular traffic patterns were replaced by a splendid and safe pedestrian corridor between new neighborhoods on the downtown\u2019s west and east sides.\u201cIt\u2019s the connector that we always needed,\u201d said Ari Maron, a former Land Studio board member and developer of several downtown projects. \u201cEvery great city has a central downtown park, a green space to gather. Now we have ours.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet page on Wednesday about the revitalization of Cleveland described incorrectly the location of the Flats East Bank project, a $395 million mixed-use development. It is northwest of Public Square, not northeast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ban Ki-moon\u2019s Thankless Position", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "Supported byEditorialFor many people, the affair will not come as a shock. The United Nations has developed an unenviable reputation over the years for hypocrisy in its approach to human rights. The United Nations Human Rights Council is famous for the human-rights violators who have figured among its rotating membership, which currently includes Saudi Arabia.As for Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to withdraw financial support, the United States, while not making threats on this scale, has itself refused to pay its dues, both to achieve policy objectives and to reform a bureaucracy that Congress has long regarded as bloated.Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the second United Nations secretary general, once declared that the organization \u201cwas created not to lead mankind to heaven, but in order to save humanity from hell,\u201d and that is especially true today for the grouping of 193 nations, ranging from geographic specks like Nauru to giants like China and great powers like the United States. A clash of agendas, perspectives and contributions is inevitable, with richer countries trying to use their wealth to get their way and poorer countries using their greater numbers to get theirs.But for all its inefficiency, the United Nations provides a unique venue for nations to mingle and meet and, through its many agencies, one of the most effective global means of gathering and distributing development and medical aid, helping children around the world, protecting world heritage sites, supplying peacekeepers to separate warring armies and doing myriad other global missions. As the clich\u00e9 has it, if there were no United Nations you\u2019d have to invent it.Which is another way of saying he had no real choice.

{"Headline": "Medicare and Social Security Trustees Warn of Shortfalls", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Wednesday that the financial outlook for Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund had deteriorated slightly in the last year and that Social Security still faced serious long-term financial problems.Under existing law, the trustees said Wednesday, Medicare\u2019s hospital trust fund would be depleted in 2028, two years earlier than projected in last year\u2019s report.In addition, they said, the Social Security trust funds for old-age benefits and disability insurance, taken together, could be depleted in 2034, the same year projected in last year\u2019s report. Tax collections would then be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits through 2090, they said.Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of all federal spending.Obama administration officials often say the Affordable Care Act has slowed the growth of health spending, compared with estimates made just before the law was adopted in 2010.But the trustees said Wednesday that the short-term financial outlook for Medicare had worsened in the last year because of changes in their assumptions and expectations. Medicare actuaries now expect higher use of inpatient hospital services, as well as lower projected improvements in workers\u2019 productivity and lower payroll tax revenue, as a result of slower growth in wages in the next few years.In their report, the trustees \u2014 four administration officials \u2014 said that the costs of Medicare and Social Security would grow faster than the economy through the mid-2030s because of the aging of the baby boom generation. As for Medicare, they said, \u201cgrowth in expenditures per beneficiary exceeds growth in per capita gross domestic product over this time period.\u201dThe projected growth in Medicare spending will not immediately set off automatic cuts in the program under a controversial provision of the Affordable Care Act that generally requires such cuts when spending is expected to exceed certain benchmarks. However, such cuts could be required in a few years under the trustees\u2019 forecast.Under current projections, they said, the automatic cuts could take effect for the first time in 2019.Medicare now spends an average of nearly $13,000 per beneficiary, and this figure is expected to exceed $16,000 in five years, the report said.\u201cHigh-cost drugs are a major driver of Medicare spending growth,\u201d said Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Such projections in years past have prompted leaders in both parties to at least broach the idea of benefit cuts or tax increases for entitlement programs.By contrast, President Obama said in Elkhart, Ind., this month that Social Security should be made \u201cmore generous,\u201d and that \u201cwe could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more.\u201dTreasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday that he saw no contradiction there. The two objectives \u2014 ensuring the solvency of Social Security and increasing benefits \u2014 are \u201cnot at all inconsistent\u201d if they are discussed in the context of \u201ca broader conversation\u201d about taxes and benefits, he said.The report predicts that Social Security will provide a modest cost-of-living adjustment, increasing benefits by two-tenths of 1 percent next year. But, it warned of a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in Medicare premiums in 2017 for about 30 percent of beneficiaries. Under assumptions in the report, the standard premium, now $121.80 a month, would rise to $149, and the change could be announced just weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8.Congress took action last year to shore up Social Security\u2019s disability insurance trust fund, but the report says the legislation was a short-term fix. The law postponed the projected depletion of the disability trust fund by seven years, to 2023, Mr. Lew said.Like other Democrats, Mr. Lew said the report showed the \u201cpositive impact\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. Since the health law was signed, he said, \u201cincreases in health care costs have slowed substantially.\u201dCarolyn W. Colvin, the acting commissioner of Social Security, said Americans should begin a serious discussion of how to close the \u201cfuture financing gap\u201d in Social Security. Sixty million people now receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is expected to reach 76 million by 2025.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Governor of Jakarta Bucks Indonesia\u2019s Party Politics", "Date": "2016-06-04", "News": "Supported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Since becoming governor of Jakarta in 2014, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama has shown little patience for incompetent bureaucrats or alleged \u201cbudget irregularities\u201d \u2014 the local term for corruption.His new target is a political system run by aloof oligarchs.Mr. Basuki, 49, has vowed to run to stay in office in February as a political independent. His goal is to separate himself from the powerful national parties that have emerged during Indonesia\u2019s transition to democracy, which began with the collapse of the military-backed dictatorship of President Suharto in 1998.Mr. Basuki has long been considered a political outsider, partly because he is a Christian and an ethnic Chinese steering the capital of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation, and his decision to run without a party affiliation has shaken the country\u2019s political establishment.Since Indonesia began holding free elections in the late 1990s, independent candidates have won lesser local government and legislative posts, but Mr. Basuki\u2019s breakaway is by far the most significant. Jakarta is the country\u2019s political, social and economic center, accounting for 16 percent of the national gross domestic product in 2015, according to the country\u2019s Central Statistics Bureau.Most of the 10 parties that have seats in the country\u2019s Parliament and cabinet are run by political dynasties, former Army generals or business tycoons who bankroll them. The rest are Islamic-based groups whose political ideology changes depending on which of the bigger parties they can latch onto in a coalition.Regional-level politicians are mostly beholden to their political masters at national offices in Jakarta, who can accept or reject their planned candidacies even if they are doing well in opinion polls. And parties usually demand that candidates pay a fee to run and require them to finance their own campaigns, analysts say.Mr. Basuki, in effect, has positioned himself as an alternative to a national political system \u201cthat many in Jakarta are fed up with,\u201d said Charlotte Setijadi, a visiting fellow with the Indonesia studies program at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.\u201cI think that this is an image that will serve him well for this election,\u201d she said.The governor, the grandson of a tin miner from Guangzhou, China, has a reputation for bluntness. He has his detractors, including squatters whose slum neighborhoods have been demolished to make way for public works projects and commercial developments, and political adversaries who have questioned a land reclamation project in North Jakarta that is under investigation by the country\u2019s anticorruption agency.But his style has won over many Jakartans, in particular younger voters and lower-middle-class families.They have also been swayed by his administration\u2019s policies, including fast-tracking infrastructure projects, among them a mass rapid transit system, the sprucing-up of a city of more than 10 million people with a small army of street sweepers and the institution of a \u201csmart card\u201d program to subsidize health care and education for the poor.Recent polls have indicated that Mr. Basuki, popularly known as Ahok, has double-digit leads over several other possible candidates for the Feb. 17 election, and that more than 80 percent of probable voters want him to run as an independent.\u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint the young people,\u201d he said to reporters recently after announcing his decision. \u201cI told them I will be an independent, but they have to understand that this is a sacrifice.\u201dThe governor can thank one particular group of young people for helping him to buck politics as usual. A grass-roots volunteer movement that is autonomously backing his plan says it has already collected the signatures of the 525,000 Jakartans \u2014 roughly 7.5 percent of the city\u2019s eligible voters \u2014 needed to cement his place on the ballot.The group, Teman Ahok (\u201cFriends of Ahok\u201d in the Indonesian language), says it will not stop until it gets a million signatures, which must be verified by the country\u2019s General Elections Commission.Working out of a one-story house in South Jakarta, the group\u2019s members have been remarkably resourceful. They have created an app, for example, enabling motorcyclists to pick up signature forms and deliver them to the group\u2019s office at no cost.To pay for its operations, the group also sells Ahok merchandise, including T-shirts, stickers and bracelets, although it did receive an initial donation of 500 million rupiah, or about $37,000, from a political consultancy in Jakarta to help it get up and running.Mr. Basuki and Teman Ahok leaders have separately said that they are not collaborating and that they have met in person only three times.Mr. Basuki, who was previously deputy governor of Jakarta, assumed the city\u2019s top position in November 2014 after his boss and predecessor, Joko Widodo, was sworn in as the country\u2019s seventh president.But as he waited to become governor, he resigned from his political party, the Great Indonesia Movement Party, known as Gerindra, after it pushed through legislation in Parliament eliminating direct elections for provincial governors, mayors and district chiefs.Critics called the legislation, which was later overturned, a meanspirited attempt to keep regional leaders under the control of Jakarta by having them appointed by local legislatures dominated by major parties.Mr. Joko himself, despite being president, is only a rank-and-file member of his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or P.D.I.P., and has at times been hamstrung in carrying out policies and appointing senior officials because of opposition from party leaders.Analysts said Mr. Basuki apparently did not want to suffer the same fate. He spurned an offer to run under the umbrella of the P.D.I.P., whose chairwoman is Megawati Sukarnoputri, a former president, the daughter of Indonesia\u2019s founding father, Sukarno, and a leading member of the country\u2019s political elite.Now the party has made it clear that it will try to stop what senior members have called deparpolisasi, an Indonesian term meaning the weakening of the political monopoly of large parties by independent candidates like Mr. Basuki.The Jakarta campaign chief of the party said it was speaking with Gerindra and other establishment parties to jointly nominate a candidate to challenge Mr. Basuki, The Jakarta Post reported.During Jakarta\u2019s 2012 governor\u2019s race, when Mr. Basuki was Mr. Joko\u2019s running mate as the candidate for vice governor, opponents made issues of his ethnicity and religion. But one recent survey indicated that nearly two-thirds of the city\u2019s residents felt ethnicity and religion would not be issues in the February election.Sandiaga Uno, a prominent businessman who is likely to be one of Mr. Basuki\u2019s opponents, has acknowledged that the governor\u2019s independent run should wake up the political establishment.\u201cIf they don\u2019t get the right candidate that is supported by the people, they would be facing an independent bid that is supported by the people,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical parties need to come up with a strategy to attract the best talent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barack Obama, the President of Black America?", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "OpinionWhat the haters and the hagiographers get wrong.Supported byIT was a crucial speech, high-stakes even for a man used to giving important speeches: The first black president of the United States had to acknowledge, and then bind up, the nation\u2019s racial wounds. A year ago, after the massacre of nine souls at prayer at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, Barack Obama traveled to Charleston, S.C., to eulogize its pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney.When Mr. Obama stood in the pulpit, I saw him as thrust into a peculiar position: He nobly assumed a symbolic, though not individual, guilt for the hate that had been visited on Charleston, largely because the white killer appeared to despise black progress, and there was no clearer representation of that progress than President Obama.To do that, the president brilliantly evoked grace as an antidote to hate and preached in a black style to forge healing and redemption. He ended with a stirring rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d As the call and response of the black church came full circle, Mr. Obama was at his best when he was at his blackest. It was a rare display of unapologetic race pride.We are now approaching the last months of the Obama era. He will be remembered as a great, but flawed, president, and many of those flaws have to do with how he has addressed race \u2014 or avoided doing so.In his first two years in office, President Obama performed herculean deeds in rescuing the banks, restoring the economy, bailing out the automobile industry and getting his signature health care legislation passed. It was an astonishing record of success despite bitter right-wing resistance to his presidency and the alarming racist reaction to a black man being in charge.I have twice worked hard to help get this president elected. I have known Barack Obama since the early 1990s, and for a time we belonged to the same church in Chicago. Watching him as president, I greatly admired how this highly intelligent and supremely confident figure managed the affairs of state with verve and swagger. No matter how much I disagreed with him about policy or politics I was deeply moved by his historic achievement. Still, I am frustrated. Because the president has hit some targets in the path to racial progress, but missed a great many as well. And that is not a sentiment I or other fellow black scholars, preachers and activists are supposed to express.That\u2019s because black America has carried on an unrepentant love affair with Mr. Obama.There is good reason to celebrate Mr. Obama\u2019s importance to black America. It is hard to overstate the symbolic significance and positive effects of a black man commanding the most celebrated seat of power. His black brain and tongue have changed America forever.But gales of black pride have swept aside awareness of his flaws, and when those flaws are conceded, gusts of black defiance play down their meaning and significance. Mr. Obama\u2019s most ardent black fans ignore how he often failed to speak about race or use his powers to convene commissions or issue executive orders to lessen black suffering; his nastiest black critics lambast him as an ineffectual leader who has done little to protect blacks from racial assault or lift them from economic misery. Neither the haters nor the hagiographers do the Obama legacy justice.Mr. Obama\u2019s failure to take to the bully pulpit on race unhappily coincided with the rise of racial demagogues. Part of the racist reaction to Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency has found its troubling apotheosis in Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s surprising run for the White House has amplified our country\u2019s worst racial instincts in a generation.It is unsurprising that the man who led the \u201cbirther\u201d movement disputing Mr. Obama\u2019s American citizenship should build a campaign that reflects elements of the \u201cbirther\u201d bigotry: anti-Muslim talk, xenophobia toward Mexicans and hostility toward blacks at his rallies. It\u2019s possible that if the president had spoken more forcefully on race, it might have blunted some of the bigotry that fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, or at least provided a compelling alternative to his vision of race. Now, in addition to working to get Hillary Clinton elected, Mr. Obama must more aggressively address the racism that he has never been eager to acknowledge or confront, and that thrives in deep pockets of the support for Mr. Trump.But where has that anger been?It has been my experience that Mr. Obama and his inner circle bristle at black efforts to hold him accountable on race. They have shown little ability to distinguish loving and thoughtful criticism from unprincipled attack. This approach has signaled admirers to view even reasonable dissent as racial treason.The Obama administration\u2019s resentment of black criticism hasn\u2019t kept it from tapping the deep well of black solidarity. Thus it is a one-way street: African-Americans should never bother as a group to request that Mr. Obama be held accountable as a black man, yet the Obama administration has from the start skillfully exploited the always strong support for the president.If the president might reasonably fend off some criticism by noting that Congress has limited what he can accomplish, it is distressing to see what he has made of the powers he has: cabinet and Supreme Court nominations and the ability to use the presidency to highlight racial injustice.It is true that he brought us the first black attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., but he largely skimped on black cabinet appointments until pressured by black politicians to name more African-Americans in his second term. A few months after Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, the Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, Marcia Fudge, scolded him for the lack of diversity in his second-term cabinet choices. At the start of his second term Mr. Obama had appointed nine new cabinet members, including three women and one Latino. Mr. Obama eventually named Anthony R. Foxx as transportation secretary and Mel Watt as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency \u2014 and added Jeh Johnson as secretary of homeland security, John King Jr. as education secretary and Loretta Lynch as successor to Mr. Holder. It\u2019s a respectable tally, but it doesn\u2019t break any of his predecessors\u2019 records.The president justly boasts of his record of diverse appointments to the federal bench. On the Supreme Court, however, he has unfortunately passed up three opportunities to nominate the first black woman to the court. \u201cBut at no point did I say: \u2018Oh, you know what? I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot. Can you find me one?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said in April, referring to the Illinois hometown of Merrick B. Garland, his latest, and stalled, nominee to the Supreme Court. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a white guy, but he\u2019s a really outstanding jurist. I\u2019m sorry. I mean, you know, I think that\u2019s important.\u201d Diversity appears to be set off against quality in Mr. Obama\u2019s thinking, a common mistake also made by opponents of diversity.Beyond appointments, the president\u2019s reluctance to highlight black suffering is lamentable. He seems capable only of being forced to do for black citizens what he willingly does for others. For instance, Mr. Obama traveled to Newtown, Conn., two days after the shooting deaths of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School. He later called that the worst day of his presidency. Yet he had to be prodded to return to his home base, Chicago, as it suffered a rash of black death.On that visit, Mr. Obama lamented the absence of male role models, claiming that government alone couldn\u2019t end violence because \u201cthis is not just a gun issue\u201d but an issue of \u201cthe kinds of communities that we\u2019re building\u201d and that when \u201ca child opens fire on another child, there is a hole in that child\u2019s heart that government can\u2019t fill.\u201d This was mourning mixed with scolding; in Newtown, there were no reprimands for the grieving.It has been dispiriting, too, to hear the president remind his most loyal constituents that he is \u201cnot the president of black America\u201d \u2014 as if they were na\u00efve enough to believe that he represented only, or primarily, black interests. Mr. Obama may not be the president of black America, but he is the president of black Americans, and he owes them the same regard he has for all citizens. He went to New Jersey just a few days after Hurricane Sandy hit. Yet in the face of a more complex, government-made disaster, he took months to make it to Flint, Mich., where thousands of poor black residents are dealing with contaminated drinking water with less immediate federal support than the hurricane victims were offered.The president has been guided by a view of race that may be termed strategic inadvertency. He believes policies should not be shaped with a view to helping blacks specifically, but supports ideas from which they are likely to benefit. This reflects his faith in universal rather than targeted remedies for black suffering: Blacks will thrive when America flourishes. \u201cI do think that the discussion about targeted strategies versus broad-based strategies is probably the central fault line around which I may be criticized by African-American leaders,\u201d the president told me in an Oval Office interview in 2010. \u201cI really am very confident I\u2019m right on it.\u201d He said that this concept guided how he thought he should govern as president: \u201cI\u2019ve got to look out for all Americans, and do things based on what will help people across the board who are vulnerable and who need help.\u201dBut even the famed sociologist William Julius Wilson, whom Mr. Obama credits as influencing his views on this subject, has changed his mind. In his 2009 work \u201cMore Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City,\u201d he argued that we should underscore \u201cspecific issues of race and poverty.\u201d Mr. Obama would have been wise to do the same.President Obama is an extraordinary figure who has done some good things in bad times, and some great things under impossible circumstances. As the first black president he has faced enormous difficulties and has had to weather a steady downpour of bad faith from the right wing and racist resistance from bigoted quarters of the country. He has been torn between America\u2019s noble ideals of democracy and its cruel realities of race \u2014 a tension he rode into office, and one that occasionally defeated his desire to reconcile the best and worst halves of the nation he governs.Mr. Obama\u2019s presence in office has reflected our most hopeful embrace of change, even as it throws light on the deeply entrenched bigotry that would reverse such change. He has been reluctant to speak about race, and hesitant to champion the causes of a valuable, if vulnerable, black constituency. He was not always free to relax into his blackness, out of fear that it would frighten white America. There was a lot he couldn\u2019t do. But because of what he did do, the road will undoubtedly be easier for the next black president.Michael Eric Dyson, a professor of sociology at Georgetown, is the author of \u201cThe Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byThe Treasury, employing sanctions techniques that helped pressure Iran to give up much of its nuclear program, said it would seek to impose what are known as secondary sanctions against the reclusive communist country. That means that it could cut off from the American financial system any bank or company that conducts banking transactions with Pyongyang.As a practical matter, that would largely affect Chinese banks, which facilitate North Korea\u2019s financial transactions with Beijing, its largest trading partner. It could also affect some institutions in the nominally autonomous Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, as well as in Singapore, where Pyongyang has often gone to hide the true nature of its banking activities, and to pay for missiles, nuclear fuel and the huge infrastructure it has built around those programs.In interviews, administration officials said they were still sorting through the evidence that North Korea was involved, and left open the possibility that the thieves deliberately left evidence implicating the country to throw investigators off their trail. It could be months, the officials said, before they reach any conclusions, and in the end the perpetrators of the attack may not be definitively known.Only once \u2014 in the case of North Korea\u2019s attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which was promoting a movie depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s unpredictable young leader \u2014 has President Obama publicly accused another country of using computer code to wreak havoc in the United States.In this case, the sanctions were proposed most immediately because of a Treasury investigation that concluded North Korea uses hard currency to finance its nuclear and missile programs. The department invoked a section of the Patriot Act to ban banks from processing any banking transaction that runs through North Korea.The key test will be the reaction of the Chinese. American officials will have a chance to find out next week: Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew are traveling to Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, where the isolation of North Korea will be a major subject of discussion. China voted for the latest United Nations sanctions, but Beijing\u2019s fears of provoking a collapse of North Korea\u2019s government still outweigh its desire to rein in Mr. Kim\u2019s government.The bigger mystery is whether Mr. Kim is also trying to show that he can undermine the global financial system, his best way of getting back at the West and his Asian neighbors for their support of sanctions. Two cybersecurity firms identified Pyongyang as the culprit behind a series of cyberattacks against Asian banks, including the theft that spirited $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.South Korea has blamed North Korea for the attacks on its firms. Elements of the code in those attacks closely track some of the code found in the more recent bank thefts.Banks in the United States are already prohibited from doing business with financial institutions in North Korea. But the recommended rules would require them to perform additional due diligence to ensure they are not inadvertently transacting with North Korean financial institutions or the Pyongyang government through shell companies or other fictitious entities.The rules are the result of a monthslong effort by the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to determine whether North Korea is a haven for money laundering.With that designation established, the Treasury secretary is able to take aggressive measures to cut off the country\u2019s access to the United States financial system.Other countries have also been stepping up efforts to isolate North Korea. In March, the United Nations Security Council said its members had 90 days to sever banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions.The recent attacks on Asian banks exposed new vulnerabilities in the way banks move money around the world.North Korea\u2019s possible involvement in those cyberattacks has raised alarms about Pyongyang\u2019s ability to exploit Swift, the global bank messaging network. But the attack did not go to the core of the Swift system; instead, it was analogous to stealing a credit card number to post a phony transaction in the Visa or MasterCard system.Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finance Is the Master Technology \u2014 and It\u2019s Funded the World", "Date": "2016-06-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cThe very rich are different from you and me,\u201d Ernest Hemingway has F. Scott Fitzgerald write in the original version of \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d comes the response, \u201cthey have more money.\u201dThis famous (and wholly fictional) exchange is memorable because it captures so succinctly one of the great fascinations of finance, how it is at one and the same time something so completely mysterious and so utterly banal. It also poses an important question: Does having more money than someone constitute a difference only in quantity, or in quality? Does the increase of financial wealth just make for more of the same \u2014 or does it change people in a more essential way?Hemingway was exploring these questions on the level of the individual. William N. Goetzmann, the Edwin J. Beinecke professor of finance and management at Yale, is shooting for bigger game in his new book, \u201cMoney Changes Everything: How Finance Made Civilization Possible.\u201d His goal is to explore the consequences of the invention and growth of finance for whole societies. As his title suggests, his conclusion is that they are firmly positive. Financially advanced societies, he argues, are very different from financially primitive ones \u2014 and not just in that they have more money.The idea that dominates this magnificent history of money and finance, and brings order to the erudite survey of modern research that Goetzmann has marshaled, is that finance is a \u201ctechnology of civilization\u201d \u2014 a way of thinking about and doing things that has been the central facilitator of the material, artistic and cultural accomplishments that we call civilized life. Indeed finance, Goetzmann argues, is a sort of master technology, from which an astonishing range of our most basic habits of mind derives.It is now generally agreed, for example, that in the West both numeracy and literacy were invented not in the context of scientific or artistic pursuits, but in the service of finance and commerce. The peculiar geography and climate of Mesopotamia led in the early third millennium B.C. to the formation of the first great agglomerations of people \u2014 sprawling cities at a time when the Mediterranean world could boast only glorified villages. The unprecedented scale of such societies required a revolution in the methods of economic organization. Autarkic subsistence farming had to be replaced by specialization, the division of labor and coordination on a massive scale. The innovation developed by the clerical bureaucracies to enable this transition was the invention of financial accounting. And it was only as part of this new financial system that writing and abstract numbers \u2014 those epochal inventions that so clearly transformed the subsequent history of humanity in so many other fields \u2014 were invented.If the invention of writing and math is not surprising enough, Goetzmann also argues convincingly that finance is responsible for our modern conception of time. Pre-monetary society operated on sacred time, with the day divided up by ecclesiastical offices or prayer times, and the year into high days and holy days that reflected the cycle of the seasons or the phases of the moon. Financial reasoning and, in particular, the calculation of compound interest demanded a more regimented scheme arbitrated by objective mathematical rules rather than clerical authority. \u201cIn essence,\u201d as Goetzmann memorably puts it, \u201cfinancial technology is a time machine\u201d \u2014 a set of ideas and practices that enable us to shift economic value backward and forward through time. As a result, we owe to financial innovation conventions as basic as the detachment of the calendar from the astronomical year \u2014 the ancient Sumerians introduced a 360-day year in order to make calculating interest easier.Many more of our most fundamental concepts and institutions turn out to be byproducts of financial innovation. Modern ideas of probability and risk, of ethics and morality, and of appropriate models of commercial and even political organization \u2014 all were forged in the furnaces of finance, Goetzmann argues. Because financial innovations \u201cchanged human behavior,\u201d money really can be said to have made the modern world.It is a fascinating thesis, brilliantly illuminated by scores of vivid examples, generously illustrated with a wealth of pictures, comprehensive in its geographical and temporal scope, and in my view almost entirely convincing. There is one aspect of it, however, where both historical evidence and contemporary experience make me less comfortable with Goetzmann\u2019s story.Goetzmann views the progress of financial innovation as an example of humans\u2019 ingenuity in overcoming technical and material challenges. \u201cLike other technologies,\u201d he writes, finance \u201cdeveloped through innovations that improved efficiency. It is not intrinsically good or bad.\u201dImplicit in this analysis is the conviction that the problems that financial innovations were historically invented to solve are primarily, or even exclusively, technical in nature. They are the problems of how to produce, exchange and consume scarce resources most efficiently. They can be cleanly separated, that is to say, from any political aspect: the eternal dilemma of who should get what, and why.In Goetzmann\u2019s view, money and \u00adother payment technologies, for example, evolved to facilitate exchange, and so a more efficient allocation of goods across space. The institutions of debt and interest, meanwhile, were invented to enable those who had surplus resources now to lend them to others until they needed them at some future time \u2014 making more efficient the allocation of resources over time.It goes without saying that there is a venerable tradition of economic thought that argues that this is not the case. One does not have to be a hard-core Marxist to entertain the idea that finance is not, and did not evolve as, a neutral tool to improve the operation of the free market \u2014 itself an ethically colorless state of nature in human relations. This alternative view is in perfect agreement that finance is indeed one of the most powerful tools for the organization of human activity ever invented. But it holds that it arose historically, and continues to be used today, to codify and enforce relationships built on power and luck as much as to facilitate voluntary and rational decision-making.In my view, it is important to take this alternative perspective seriously, because it is difficult to explain the history of finance without it. Goetzmann\u2019s masterly overview itself provides many examples of ingenious financial innovations that have notably not succeeded in changing human behavior, despite being better technical solutions to the problems at hand. His erstwhile Yale colleague, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, long ago showed that the conventional model of asset pricing systematically underestimates the likelihood of catastrophic volatility \u2014 and offered a more realistic alternative. Another, the economist Robert Shiller, won a Nobel Prize for proposing new types of insurance instruments that would enable households to mitigate the impact of economywide recessions and real estate crashes. Perhaps most significantly of all, the American Social Security system is almost universally acknowledged to be unsustainable in its current form \u2014 and countless well-reasoned proposals exist for its reform.Yet banks still use unreliable asset pricing models; households remain at the mercy of aggregate booms and busts; and Social Security continues to glide merrily toward its doom. Seek the reason for the failure of the ingenious financial solutions that have been proposed, and it is difficult not to detect the hand of vested interests, or indeed simply the sheer inertia of a gridlocked congressional system.\u201cMoney Changes Everything\u201d \u2014 I agree, but politics changes even money itself.Felix Martin is a partner at 1167 Capital and the author of \u201cMoney: The Unauthorized Biography.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Founders Fund Leads a Financing Round for Nubank, a Brazilian Start-Up", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The billionaire and prominent Silicon Valley financier Peter Thiel has returned to investing in Brazil, even as the country remains mired in recession and faces almost weekly political upheavals.A Nubank spokeswoman, Mariana Netto, responded to an email inquiry seeking information on the new financing and a request for an interview with a company executive by saying, \u201cAt the moment, we do not have any information.\u201dThe new investment values Nubank at approximately $500 million, according to two individuals, significant for a company less than three years old.The Founders Fund backing of Nubank appears to be its first investment in Brazil and South America, at least based on disclosed and known investments. The firm, just over 10 years old, raised its first fund back in 2005.On the surface, backing Nubank may seem to be a counterintuitive move as many institutional investors have fled Latin America\u2019s largest economy in recent years, and its gross domestic product has decreased for three straight quarters.Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has a reputation for going against the grain. But Founders Funds notes on its website that being contrarian \u201cdoes not mean simply doing the opposite of what the majority does.\u201d Rather, the company says, \u201cThe most contrarian thing to do is to think independently.\u201d Taking on Brazil\u2019s financial establishment is certainly that.They have been neither vulnerable to the moribund economy the rest of the country has grappled with over the last several years nor the policies enacted by leftist governments that have led the country since 2003. That is partly because Brazil has long had extremely high interest rates. Its current benchmark Selic rate stands at 14.25 percent.The current deepening recession and rising inflation are increasing pressure on the Central Bank to raise the rate even further. While the Central Bank kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting, economists expect an increase when it meets later this month and continued pressure for more increases throughout this year. That is in part because, \u201cInflation will remain a key macro issue in 2016,\u201d according to a research note published on Dec. 30 by Alberto Ramos, Head of Latin America Economic Research for Goldman Sachs.That also means higher credit card interest rates. Many Brazilians already pay annual rates as high as 415.3 percent as of the end of November, up from 327.8 percent one year earlier, according to Central Bank data. Average annual credit card interest rates in Brazil have risen in 10 of the last 11 months, reaching 99 percent in November, up significantly from 74.5 percent in the same month in 2014, according to that same Central Bank report.In contrast, Nubank has not changed its 7.75 monthly interest rate in over a year. It also hopes that being digital both reduces overhead and results in better customer service. Banks, after telecommunications companies, usually generate the most customer complaints in Brazil.

{"Headline": "A Polish Collector\u2019s Passion for Art and Dance", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingPOZNAN, POLAND \u2014 The reception area of Grazyna Kulczyk\u2019s private office looks a bit bare because many items have already been packed away.But the view is intact: the rooftops of Poznan, a city of brick buildings in west-central Poland. \u201cIt is a lovely view,\u201d she said, smiling and looking out over the green park. Ms. Kulczyk, one of Poland\u2019s richest women and one of its most prominent art collectors and patrons, is moving her private cultural foundation out of the Stary Browar, or Old Brewery, an abandoned factory complex she bought in 1998 and renovated into an art and performance space. The red-brick buildings, which also house a shopping mall, restaurants and a cinema, now belong to Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management. Ms. Kulczyk sold Stary Browar for \u20ac290 million, or $326 million, in November. The dance program she funded there, Stary Browar Nowy Taniec (Old Brewery New Dance), will stay, but the foundation and her art collection \u2014 one of the most important in Poland focusing on modern works from the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 will be moving out. But while Ms. Kulczyk, 65, may be wistful about what she has created in her hometown, she is determined to press forward.By early 2018, her Muzeum Schuss is expected to open in the Engadine Valley of the Swiss Alps. The museum will house site-specific projects by Polish and international artists including Piotr Uklanski, Monika Sosnowska and Rosemarie Trockel. The museum will also host a residency program and include an exhibition space. The money she raised from the sale of Stary Browar will go toward a new museum of contemporary art and dance in Warsaw. Ms. Kulczyk\u2019s foundation, Art Stations Foundation by Grazyna Kulczyk, has focused much of its work on promoting contemporary dance and choreography as well as organizing gallery exhibitions around works from her collection. She is currently in negotiations with the city government to work out a public/private partnership deal, which would be a permanent space for her vast collection of over 500 Polish and international modern and contemporary works, and would be the first private collection open to the public in Poland. Ms. Kulczyk last year was included in the list of the world\u2019s top 200 collectors by Art News magazine. She is a member of London\u2019s Tate Modern acquisitions committee for Russia and Eastern Europe, and last year she became a member of the Modern Women\u2019s Fund at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\u201cShe is not jumping at each art fair and buying everything she likes \u2014 she is really profiling,\u201d said Anda Rottenberg, the former director of the Zacheta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw and one of Poland\u2019s most renowned art historians. \u201cThis is the difference between just having the art and having a collection.\u201dThe daughter of a dentist and a Polish pilot who flew with Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force during World War II, Ms. Kulczyk was raised in postwar Communist Poland. By the time she entered university to study law in the 1970s, she was hanging out with poets, writers and artists, and had also started collecting Polish film posters. After what she calls her \u201cbohemian fun\u201d of university life, she married Jan Kulczyk, a businessman who built his fortune in postwar Poland in energy, telecommunications and car dealerships. The couple had two children before divorcing in 2005; Mr. Kulczyk died last year. As their wealth grew, so did Ms. Kulczyk\u2019s interest in buying art \u2014 which, she acknowledges, was initially purchased more for aesthetic reasons than for long-term collecting goals.\u201cEven if it looks like the choices at the time were obvious and purely visual,\u201d she said, partially in Polish and partially in English, \u201cnow coming back 30 years later, I get something more out of it.\u201d\u201cArt gathering and art collecting, there is a distinction,\u201d she continued, sitting on the couch dressed in knee-high black leather boots, leather trousers and a gray blazer. \u201cIt is a linguistic thing but it is really a philosophy.\u201d Early on she focused her collecting on modern Polish art, with a particular interest in female artists. That brought her into contact with influential gallerists like Monika Spr\u00fcth, whose galleries in London, Berlin and Los Angeles represent Jenny Holzer and Cindy Sherman. \u201cShe was very interested in buying art by women,\u201d Ms. Spr\u00fcth said. \u201cThis approach is very interesting, it is very genuine, not because it is fashionable right now to do.\u201dMs. Kulczyk also became increasingly interested in how Polish art, in many senses cut off from Western artistic practice during the Communist years, could be placed in context alongside international artists. \u201cWhat is really interesting is the way in which she displays her collection in relation to works she has acquired by modern and contemporary artists from further afield, including Donald Judd, Agnes Martin and Andy Warhol, opening up the regional focus to a broader international context,\u201d Frances Morris, the new director of London\u2019s Tate Modern, wrote in an email. Works from her collection are often lent out to shows across the globe, and in 2014 the first exhibition of her collection outside Poland was shown at the Santander Art Gallery in Madrid; the show, \u201cEverybody is Nobody for Somebody,\u201d showed works by Polish artists including Miroslaw Balka and Zofia Kulik along with international names like Olafur Eliasson and Antoni T\u00e0pies. \u201cWe always tell people, if you collect, you need to collect what you like because it is the only way you will have a cohesive and interesting personal collection,\u201d said Isabelle Paagman, Sotheby\u2019s European head of private sales, who first worked with Ms. Kulczyk in 2002 when she bought two Warhol silkscreens over the telephone. \u201cWe completely skipped that chapter with her,\u201d Ms. Paagman said. \u201cWe talked about the content and visual outcome and so she never needed to think about that. It was inherent before she started to collect.\u201dMs. Kulczyk has long promoted a 50/50 split between art and commerce; the commercial side of a venture like Stary Browar financed the artistic side. She wants to bring that same philosophy to Warsaw, a city that has a vibrant art scene of commercial and public galleries and spaces, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Center for Contemporary Art. Ms. Kulczyk also hopes to bring a strong focus on contemporary dance to her Warsaw endeavor. Stary Browar Nowy Taniec is currently the only place in Poland that presents and develops modern choreography year round. \u201cWhen I met her, one thing I loved about her was she was coming in with a big interest in performing arts and she supports a lot of contemporary dance, which is something that is totally meritorious,\u201d said Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, a Mexican-Canadian artist whose works Ms. Kulczyk has collected over the years.\u201cI often say my work is closer to performing arts than visual arts. So that kind of precedent made me feel really close to her,\u201d he added. \u201cI like the idea of people who understand that collections are something living and something that is performing and something that has a certain theatricality and practicality.\u201dUntil an agreement is drawn up between Ms. Kulczyk and Warsaw officials, the focus for now is on the museum in Switzerland, where Ms. Kulczyk has a home. Located near St. Moritz and less than two hours from the Swiss art centers of Geneva, Zurich and Basel, the museum \u2014 part of which is a former brewery \u2014 is being renovated by two young Swiss architects, and two young curators, Niels Olsen and Fredi Fischli, are in charge of coming up with the exhibition programming. \u201cShe trusts young people, which I think is really important as a collector,\u201d Mr. Olsen said. \u201cI think this makes her unique because often collectors and institutions follow one track but she goes differently, she goes to unexpected routes.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changing Kenya\u2019s Landscape for Wildlife and Jobseekers", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byFixesRUKINGA SANCTUARY, Kenya \u2014 Twenty years ago, this wildlife corridor in southern Kenya was in jeopardy. A scarcity of jobs in this impoverished, arid landscape meant people were hunting wild giraffe and antelope for meat, and chopping down trees to make charcoal. With fewer trees, desertification loomed. Water was so precious that local cattle herders lit fires at water holes to keep giraffes and zebras from drinking.The animals had less vegetation to eat and less forest cover. Cutting down trees combined with poaching decimated wildlife in this 500,000-acre swath of the Kasigau migration corridor, which bisects Tsavo, Kenya\u2019s largest national park. Tsavo, roughly the size of Wales, is home to half the country\u2019s estimated 25,000 elephants.Mercy Ngaruiya, known as Mama Mercy, is a community leader in the village of Itinyi. \u201cPeople used to come with buckets of meat,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was killing animals. People were cutting trees for charcoal. They said, \u2018What else are we going to do for money?\u2019\u201dAgainst the odds, things have changed. Illegal tree cutting and poaching have fallen significantly. Previously, rangers from Wildlife Works, the local conservation group that initiated the shift, would find 8,000 wire snares in a year. Last year they found fewer than 300.In 1998 there were no elephants on the 75,000 acres of Rukinga Sanctuary where Wildlife Works is based, said Rob Dodson, vice president of African operations. Now wildlife has returned. One recent evening, a herd of elephants, including babies, gathered at a water hole during a tranquil sunset. As many as 2,000 elephants live in the corridor, depending on the season; so do zebra, giraffe, buffalo, warthogs and several kinds of antelope, from slender dik-diks to impala. Lions had vanished from the area; now there are about 40, including two males seen lounging by a water hole on a hot Friday afternoon.Illegal activities haven\u2019t been wiped out. In January, seven elephants were poached for ivory. Every week rangers catch people burning trees to produce charcoal. But forest and wildlife in the Kasigau Corridor have been visibly revitalized by conservation efforts. And poaching has dropped. In the last few years, Wildlife Works hired more unarmed local rangers to supplement the Kenyan Wildlife Service, and in 2014 Kenya toughened its poaching laws. Seventy-six elephants were killed for ivory in the area in 2012, in contrast to 21 last year.The key to preserving wildlife here is human relationships. Impoverished locals need alternatives to poaching and burning. So Wildlife Works has created hundreds of new jobs, including increasing the number of its rangers sevenfold to 85 in the past few years. (Many are former charcoal burners and poachers themselves.) Critically, this expansion won support for conservation from local elders and villagers, and the organization is now their county\u2019s third-largest employer.This community development work got a much-needed financial lifeline when Wildlife Works started the world\u2019s first REDD+ project in 2011. REDD+, which stands for \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,\u201d is an international system to combat climate change by preserving forests. It essentially pays communities in poor countries not to cut down trees.Preserving this swath of forest in the Kasigau Corridor avoids emitting more than 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide per year for the next 30 years.Since 2011, Wildlife Works has sold carbon credits and earned millions of dollars shared by landowners, investors, Wildlife Works and the local community. Money for the community finances schools, scholarships, water pipes, reservoirs and other public works that serve 150,000 people. The support was critical for getting the local community to support conservation.\u201cNow if someone cuts down trees or kills animals, people will report them,\u201d said Mama Mercy.REDD+ was controversial when it introduced nearly a decade ago. Critics feared fraud, and that the developed world would use carbon credits as an excuse to keep burning fossil fuels instead of curbing them. Supporters said poor countries needed financial incentives to preserve forests rather than cutting them down for fuel, farming and grazing.At first, locals were also skeptical. Mama Mercy recalled that when people first heard about REDD+ they said, \u201c\u2018How do we get money from trees? The air? These people are cheating us.\u2019 It was really complicated.\u201dEducating locals about REDD+ and getting them on board was essential, because REDD+ uses international social auditors to enforce a requirement for informed consent from communities.From 2009 to 2011, Wildlife Works\u2019 team of local Kenyans met with about 60 elders, chiefs and heads of community councils to explain how the complex project works.\u201cThey thought people were coming to get their land,\u201d said Pascal Kizaka, a retired local chief. \u201cWe had to go and talk to them and preach. It took a year and a half to make the people understand.\u201dAlthough several tribes live in the area, Swahili is commonly spoken, so language was not a hurdle. Local leaders eventually gave consent to sell carbon credits on behalf of the community.\u201cPeople were so desperate,\u201d said Dodson, of Wildife Works. \u201cThey had nothing to lose. They said, \u2018It sounds mad, but let\u2019s give it a go.\u2019\u201dThe forest was assessed by teams that measured trees in 480 sample plots across Kasigau Corridor. Independent environmental consultants from the United States used analytical software involving 60 algorithms to determine the amount of carbon in the forest.Results were verified by the environmental audit firms Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance, both based in Washington. The latter\u2019s social audit includes weeks of meeting with local councils and questioning them independently.In the early days, critics feared that \u201ccarbon credit cowboys\u201d would displace or exploit locals and pocket profits. But setting up and verifying REDD+ is too complicated, expensive and stringent for speculators to make easy money. Rolling out REDD+ cost Wildlife Works about $4 million, each audit costs about $70,000, and verification requires evidence that REDD+ has benefited the community and environment.The biggest pitfall is managing a multiparty project and building consensus among many community councils. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to fail an audit. Getting back on your feet if a project fails is tough,\u201d said Dodson. \u201cOrganizationally, it is fraught with danger.\u201dWhen Wildlife Works\u2019 REDD+ project was verified, credits were sold on Markit, a London-based financial trading platform. The companies and other organizations that have purchased credits to offset their carbon emissions or fulfill corporate social responsibility policies have included Barclays, BNP Paribas, Allianz, the French postal service La Poste, and Kering, the holding company for Gucci, Saint Laurent and other luxury brands.Wildlife Works sold $3 million worth of carbon credits in 2012, $2.5 million worth in 2013, and more than $5 million in 2014.Carbon credit revenues are divided up with one-third going to landowners, roughly another third to Wildlife Works\u2019 projects in Kenya, and the rest divided among the community and Wildlife Works in the United States, including its investors.Community councils most commonly decide to use their shares for clean water projects or schools.\u201cPeople used to go long distances to get water, six kilometers or more,\u201d said 24-year-old Zahira Kastoka, who grew up in Itinyi. Now there are water storage tanks near her home.\u201cREDD has changed things in so many ways,\u201d she said. Kastoka got a high school scholarship through Wildlife Works, where she now works as an office administrator. Without the grant, her single mother could not have afforded school fees; Kastoka\u2019s older sister had to drop out after fourth grade.In 1998, few local youths were enrolled in college or in other tertiary institutions; now hundreds are. Over the years, more than 3,200 students have been awarded some $260,000 in high school and higher education scholarships.For example, Mwolo Muasa, who grew up near Wildlife Works, had to drop out of school after his mother died when he was 10. But a few years later, he got a Wildlife Works scholarship, without which, he says, \u201cI would have ended up a street kid.\u201d Now 29, he helps lead Wildlife Works\u2019 forest plot sampling, having studied environmental science at Kenyatta University in Nairobi.Carbon credits have also financed precious new jobs. Before REDD, Wildlife Works had 65 employees in 2010. Now it has more than 300 who work in a small garment workshop, greenhouse and tourist lodge and as rangers, mechanics and office staff members. Before carbon credits there were 12 rangers hired from local villages; now the 85-strong force patrols a much larger area.In 2009, Korchinsky read a magazine article about REDD+ and wondered if Wildlife Works could sell carbon credits. At the time, there was no method with which to measure the carbon in Kasigau\u2019s shrubby drylands forest. So Wildlife Works hired independent environmental consultants to design one.One challenge today is planning for the future and managing expectations if carbon credit sales slump. In 2015, sales of Wildlife Works\u2019 carbon credits fell to about half that of the previous year. Hesitant buyers were awaiting the outcome of the United Nations\u2019 climate change summit meeting in December.As a result, there were fewer scholarships. \u201cSome people had to drop out of school,\u201d said Mama Mercy. \u201cSome girls married early. Parents want to educate children but there\u2019s no work.\u201d\u201cLast year was difficult,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe hope this year won\u2019t be the same.\u201dREDD+ agreements span only 30 years, so it\u2019s uncertain what will happen when the contract expires. Dodson hopes that by then there will be enough economic development and jobs to sustain the community and preserve the forest and wildlife.Ivo Mulder, the REDD+ green economy adviser for the United Nations Environment Program, said large-scale national initiatives that span entire counties or provinces and better control deforestation are a model for the future.Worldwide, there are many REDD+ projects. However, the carbon credit market is limited and there are not enough buyers driven by corporate social responsibility. An oversupply of voluntary credits \u201creduces prices and makes it difficult to make REDD+ projects financially viable,\u201d said Mulder.Selling carbon credits from large government-backed REDD+ projects to other governments can make a bigger dent in combating global deforestation, though they are complicated to set up.Back on the ground in the Kasigau Corridor, this environmental framework has already changed the landscape for flora, fauna and humans alike.Kizaka, the retired local chief, recalled that big trees sheltering wildlife and cattle were being destroyed every day for charcoal. But now, he said: \u201cIf we show you photos before the carbon project and the present situation, the vegetation has changed. It has blossomed.\u201dFrom beneath the acacias in the Kenyan bush, one can still see the forest for the trees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Said to Have Deal With Boeing to Buy Passenger Planes", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byIran has reached an agreement with the Boeing Company for the acquisition of new passenger planes to help modernize its outdated fleet, state-run Iranian news media reported on Tuesday.Such an agreement, if completed, would potentially be worth many billions of dollars to Boeing and amount to the most prominent commercial transaction between an American company and Iran since sanctions linked to Iran\u2019s nuclear program were lifted six months ago. It also would send a strong signal that Iran and the United States, despite decades of antipathy, might be moving toward normalized ties.Numerous obstacles remain to such an agreement, most notably other American sanctions on Iran that are not related to the Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, including a ban on using dollars in trade with the country. The restraints have dissuaded many international banks and financial companies, fearful of running afoul of American laws, from venturing into the Iranian market.Also unclear is whether Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who often describes the United States as his country\u2019s most dangerous threat, would countenance such an agreement.Nonetheless, Boeing, with the United States government\u2019s permission, has been in discussions for months with Iranian aviation officials about their dire needs for new airplanes.Iranian officials have said they will need to acquire at least 400 planes in coming years to replace their commercial fleet, one of the world\u2019s oldest. It includes some Boeing models that predate the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah.Asked about Mr. Akhoundi\u2019s assertion, a spokesman for Boeing at the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters, John Dern, did not deny it.In an emailed response, Mr. Dern said, \u201cWe do not discuss details of ongoing conversations we are having with customers, and our standard practice is to let customers announce any agreements that are reached.\u201dMr. Dern\u2019s statement also cautioned: \u201cAny agreements reached will be contingent on U.S. government approval.\u201dBoeing\u2019s most important foreign competitor, Airbus, announced a deal worth roughly $27 billion in January to sell Iran 118 aircraft. There has been speculation that Boeing has been negotiating a similar transaction involving roughly 100 planes.But the Airbus agreement has not been completed, partly because it also requires United States regulatory approval since a significant portion of Airbus plane components are American.Asked about the status of the Airbus deal, a spokesman, Justin Dubon, said in an emailed response, \u201cAs with any agreement, it takes some time to finalize.\u201dSome American critics of Iran expressed skepticism about the Iranian reports of a Boeing deal, describing them as an exaggeration and part of what they called Iran\u2019s attempts to portray itself as a legitimate economic partner.\u201cThese deals are more aspirational than a reality,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that is highly critical of Iran.Mr. Dubowitz said aircraft deals with Iran were tricky in part because some areas of the country\u2019s civilian aviation industry were controlled by Iranian businesses linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which remain subject to American sanctions.\u201cIt\u2019s a due-diligence nightmare,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just for the companies but for the banks that finance the deals.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Dubowitz and others also noted that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, an architect of the nuclear agreement, will be up for re-election next year and needs to show that the agreement has been economically beneficial.Under that agreement, completed in January with the United States and other world powers, many economic restraints on Iran were rescinded or relaxed in exchange for verifiable guarantees by Iran that it is engaged in only peaceful atomic work.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s promised benefits, however, have been slow in coming. Iranian officials have complained that nonnuclear American sanctions remain a major impediment, dissuading many foreign companies from investing in and trading with Iran.Proponents of the nuclear deal, Mr. Kupchan said, have been wagering that it will help Iran evolve in a direction less hostile to the United States and other Western powers.\u201cFor that, Iranian elites have to know that the U.S. wants constructive interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Boeing sells 100 planes to Iran, it would send exactly the right vibe.\u201dUnited Against Nuclear Iran, a New-York based advocacy organization, has claimed some responsibility for Iran\u2019s frustration, through a campaign that warns companies that they could risk incurring American legal problems by engaging in business with Iranian entities.The organization claimed responsibility for the cancellation of an international forum on opportunities in Iran\u2019s natural gas industry that had been scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Barcelona, Spain.Anthony Bright, operations manager for INconnect, a Czech company that had organized the forum, said in an emailed statement that it had been postponed until December. Mr. Bright did not provide a reason.Nicola Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Much Will \u2018Brexit\u2019 Stress Banks? Some Ways to Tell", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byMoment of TruthAmong all the anxieties that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has provoked, here\u2019s another one: Are big banks going to be in trouble?Taxpayers in Europe and the United State might want to know.The Brexit vote could very well be a test of whether governments have, since the financial crisis of 2008, limited the threat that large banks pose to the wider economy.In 2008, governments around the world decided to spend huge sums bailing out their nations\u2019 banks, underscoring that they were \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Brexit will go a long way toward telling us whether they still are.Today, banks are stronger. They have more capital, meaning they borrow less money to finance their loans and trading. Lower borrowing makes them more stable. The banks also have higher reserves of liquid cash they can tap into if it becomes hard to borrow money in the markets.So, how are they doing? Here are some ways to assess the stress in the financial system.The valuations on bank stocks also look awful, particularly a yardstick called the price-to-book ratio. This effectively compares a bank\u2019s market value with its net worth as stated in its balance sheet. If that ratio is below one, it suggests investors are skeptical about the bank. Deutsche Bank is trading at around 30 percent of its net worth, a big discount. In the United States, Bank of America is trading at just under 60 percent of its book value, a ratio even lower than in 2009, when losses from the financial crisis were still piling up.But it can be a mistake to think that a bank is in dire trouble because its stock is slumping or its valuation looks sickly. The declines might reflect investors\u2019 belief that it will be harder for the banks to make profits in the future, particularly if Brexit leads to a recession. Or it may be a signal that the market believes the bank will have to break itself up, or sell operations, to become more streamlined. But this is something a bank can do without help from the taxpayer.Let\u2019s look at the swaps on UniCredit, a large Italian bank. An investor on one side of the credit default swap makes a payment to an investor on the other side of the swap. The investor making the payment stands to receive a big payout if UniCredit defaults. That probably won\u2019t happen, of course. But if the cost of that insurance against default rises because of fears stirred up by an event like the Brexit crisis, the investor who bought the insurance against default before the crisis, when it was cheaper, can now sell the swap for a profit.And what is this swaps market telling us now about the banks? The good news: The costs of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging.But if the Brexit crisis pushes European banks to use such loans, it may be hard to track how much they are borrowing. One of the ways in which Greek banks were helped last year during the country\u2019s debt crisis was through a loan facility called the emergency liquidity assistance. But the European Central Bank, and some national central banks, typically do not break out exactly how much each country is borrowing under that loan program, which added to the confusion last year.Why do these loans matter in assessing what the Brexit crisis tells us about too-big-to-fail?So far, those who contend that the post-recession banking overhaul has significantly strengthened the system are winning the debate. Further evidence for their position: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that all but one of the United States\u2019 largest banks had unconditionally passed annual stress tests, and were thus allowed to distribute money to their shareholders. But it\u2019s too early to see if the overhaul has succeeded. The real test would be whether a major European country that uses the euro \u2014 Britain does not \u2014 voted to follow Britain out of the European Union.It\u2019s a frightening prospect, but it might take that to really test whether the too-big-to-fail banks can fail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Venture Capital Needed, or Wanted", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byThe business world is filled with starry-eyed entrepreneurs who hope that the blessings of angel investors and venture capitalists will transform their start-up dreams into companies with billion-dollar valuations.But some successful start-ups have been bucking the trend by growing and expanding without taking a dime from major outside equity investors.Ron Rudzin, an entrepreneur from Queens with a long history in the furniture business, took $350,000 of his own money to write a business plan in 2007 to form his online mattress company, Saatva.\u201cPeople who raise money, rather than be self-funded, tend to spend wildly because it\u2019s other people\u2019s money and they throw a bunch of stuff on the wall and see what sticks. I don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d Mr. Rudzin said. \u201cI\u2019m much more meticulous and efficient. I might go a little slower, but in the end I believe I win.\u201dAt age 16, he took a job at Jennifer Furniture, a fledgling company that later became a national chain selling convertible sofas and furniture. He spent more than 20 years working his way from sales representative to store manager and to vice president of national sales. He held equity interests in four of its stores as the company expanded into a national chain.After he left Jennifer Furniture, he invested in various enterprises, but he had always had his eye on starting his own e-commerce company. \u201cI felt the world was going in that direction,\u201d he said.Mr. Rudzin\u2019s vision was to sell American-made, high quality, coil-based mattresses online at a fraction of the price retailers charged for store-based brands. He added service to the equation by having them hand-delivered and set up in customers\u2019 home. It worked. \u201cWe were the first ones out there,\u201d he said.The company said that sales, which totaled $2 million in its first full year in 2011, surged to $76 million in 2015. Mr. Rudzin is projecting sales of $180 million this year and at least $275 million in 2018.Saatva has added two other lines of mattresses, foam and latex, and offers three firmness levels. The company had gained enough visibility to be asked to donate a mattress for Pope Francis during his visit to a Philadelphia seminary in 2015.Those who buck the odds by \u201cbootstrapping\u201d their own enterprises are rare, experts say.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge anomaly,\u201d said Mark Walsh, head of innovation and investment at the Small Business Administration. He estimated that as few as one in 50 brick-and-mortar companies and one in 10 online companies could build their businesses into $50 million or $100 million enterprises on their own.But taking venture capital can be risky. In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.\u201cWe don\u2019t need it,\u201d said Harrison Tang, a founder of Spokeo. But Mr. Tang, 34, did not always feel that way. When he created Spokeo with three college buddies from Stanford University in 2006, he tried to get equity financing, but was turned down by more than six angel and venture capital investors. Even his father, an entrepreneur himself, told his son he never expected to get the money he lent him back.\u201cThat\u2019s how much confidence people had in us,\u201d Mr. Tang said, laughing. But he \u2014 and his three other founders \u2014 Ray Chen, Mike Daly, and Eric Liang \u2014 pressed on by borrowing $300,000 from parents and other family members.Initially, Spokeo was a free program that aggregated information about people from social network sites, like Facebook and Friendster.When the founders ran short of cash in 2008, they revamped the site, turning it into a people search program that gathers data based on names, phone numbers and email addresses, and started charging a subscription fee. The company said that its revenue surged to $78.5 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2011. Mr. Tang expects revenue to easily exceed $100 million by 2018.Mr. Tang said he was proud that all four founders remain with the company, which might not have been the case if equity investors had been involved. \u201cWe have been winning,\u201d he said.So, he wrote a business plan around importing such beef from Uruguay, New Zealand and Australia for his M.B.A. thesis at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business in 2005.Though very popular now, organic food was a concept met with much skepticism at the time.\u201cMy professor hated it, and my classmates thought it was a terrible idea,\u201d he said. Even his parents wondered why a man with degrees from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Management and Technology program and an M.B.A. from Dartmouth would want to start a meat company.\u201cPeople thought that it was only tree-huggers who were into organic, and tree-huggers were vegetarians, not meat eaters,\u201d he said.In 2006, Mr. Ehrlich tried to find angel investors, but refused to accept the terms. \u201cThey wanted between 10 percent and 20 percent equity for a six-month loan,\u201d he said.So he used $100,000 from savings and student loans to secure debt financing. It was a tough slog in those early years, and Mr. Ehrlich nearly decided to shut down in 2008. But everything changed in early 2009, when he signed on two national retailers, Wegmans and Costco.The company, which is based in Woburn, Mass., said it sold 10.1 million pounds of grass-fed beef in 2015, up from 240,000 pounds in 2008. Sales, which totaled $665,000 in 2008, surged to $7 million in 2009 and more than $50 million in 2015.Equity investors are now coming to him, and he\u2019s the one turning them down.Verde \u2014 like Saatva and Spokeo \u2014 does not rule out taking venture capital money in the future. But these founders say it would be for strategic rather than financial reasons to bring on venture capital expertise.\u201cMost V.C.s are former entrepreneurs themselves,\u201d said Ben Veghte, a vice president at the National Venture Capital Association. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been in the trenches and understand what it takes to build something from nothing and to build a successful company.\u201dAnd for businesses with plans to go public, the guidance of a venture capitalist may be needed.Mr. Walsh of the Small Business Administration said it was rare that a company went public without at least some outside equity holders.\u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing a company going public on the Nasdaq in the last 20 years who arrived at the I.P.O. with only management owning the company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a rite of passage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump, aided by two teleprompters, presented the version of himself on Tuesday evening that Republican Party officials had desperately craved \u2014 softer, serious and sophisticated.\u201cI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never ever let you down,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech at his golf club here. \u201cI will make you proud of your party and our movement.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s disciplined performance was geared at soothing nervous voters and at stopping the flight of high-ranking Republicans. And it came just hours after Mr. Trump reminded them why they had been concerned in the first place.A series of missteps and vicious attacks \u2014 with targets that included former rivals, entire nationalities and religious groups \u2014 has led to fears that Mr. Trump has doomed Republican chances of taking back the White House and keeping the party\u2019s hold on the Senate. It was the type of calm performance that Mr. Trump has delivered before, only to revert to form within days.\u201cTonight\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t change much,\u201d said Dan Senor, who supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the primaries and who has been an adviser to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. \u201cEven tonight, there are conversations that maybe, just maybe, he says these offensive things because he actually believes them.\u201dMr. Ryan maintained his endorsement of Mr. Trump, but Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois withdrew his. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who never publicly endorsed Mr. Trump, urged Republicans who had endorsed the candidate to withdraw their support.\u201cThey are waiting for him to change, and he is not going to change,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who supported Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio in the primaries, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is like the old story of the scorpion and the frog \u2014 the Republican Party is the frog and Donald Trump is the scorpion, and we want these assurances he\u2019s going to stop doing these things but he can\u2019t, because it\u2019s in his nature.\u201dTim Pawlenty, a Republican and the former governor of Minnesota, was not quite as pessimistic, saying he still had \u201chope for at least some improvement.\u201d\u201cEven modest changes would help,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Trump vanquished a legion of primary opponents without much change in demeanor or strategy, he is entering a race in which he is trailing in polls. His support among college-educated suburban voters in battleground states is especially low, according to polling conducted by Republican groups.Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump head into the presidential race with the worst favorable ratings of any presumed nominee in decades.The Trump campaign is also working to ramp up its fund-raising operations, with the candidate holding at least four events this week.On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel. Mr. Trump is expected to attend both the meeting and the lunch.And on Friday evening, Mr. Trump is to attend a fund-raiser in Richmond, Va., though the invitation that went out just over a week before the event did not specify where it would be held. It also did not have host names, tiers of donors or even a request for a specific dollar amount \u2014 all basics of most political fund-raisers.Mr. Trump has complicated matters by resisting efforts to engage in routine telephone calls to donors and to make gentle requests of people to write checks. Some donors who have been approached have given tepid responses, worried about their names showing up in a public campaign-finance filing.Some aides have also grumbled privately about a trip Mr. Trump has planned for the end of the month to Scotland and Ireland, to tour his golf courses. Three aides, speaking anonymously to discuss internal frustrations, said they worried that the trip would distract him from his campaign.The Trump team has had trouble filling positions, in part because some Republicans they tried to recruit turned down their offers, worried about how a Trump line on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could affect their job prospects. The campaign has spent two months searching for a communications director, after an early prospect fell through, according to one of the three aides and two people who were approached about possible jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that the candidate was always planning for a progression.\u201cThe campaign evolves, as it always does, from a primary strategy to a general-election strategy, and there are very different issues,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to refocus on jobs and the economy.\u201dMr. Trump made clear on Monday that regardless of his campaign staff members\u2019 job titles, he was his own chief strategist. On a conference call first reported by Bloomberg Politics, Mr. Trump belittled his aides for having sent a memo urging surrogates to stop talking about the judge in the Trump University case. Instead, Mr. Trump said, his supporters should keep criticizing the jurist, Gonzalo P. Curiel, and should suggest the reporters asking questions about his comments are \u201cracists.\u201dMr. Carson said he believed that Mr. Trump could be perfectly suited for the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re in more of a W.W.E. brawl stage as a nation right now,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to World Wrestling Entertainment, \u201cand the people who tend to appeal to that group tend to do better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s stance on Donald J.

{"Headline": "One Man\u2019s Quest to Get Americans to Care About Rugby", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "FeatureIn the U.S., the sport has long been overshadowed by football. Now a former bond trader is working to bring it back to the mainstream.Supported byLast fall, he was thinking of his late father and the National Football League games they used to attend at the old Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. On cold days, they sat on copies of the Sunday paper and used phone books to keep their feet from freezing on the frigid concrete. They saw the same people every weekend in the stands. They felt they were part of the game in a way that was hard to put into words. All his life, Schoninger had been going to N.F.L. games \u2014 10 last year with his teenage son, Charlie. Charlie loved football, but to Schoninger it seemed that on the professional level, the ethos of the game, which evolved from rugby more than a century ago, had curdled. Materialism and profiteering had eaten away any nobility the N.F.L. game once possessed, leaving in its place a violent, vainglorious, $13-billion-a-year entertainment spectacle staged by helmeted mercenaries for the enrichment of grasping billionaires. Rugby was different, or seemed so, even in the nature of the game: Players vied for the ball in scrums, bulled it forward in mauls, booted it through goal posts or dashed with it across the try line in the course of 80 nearly continuous minutes of free-flowing improvisation, versus what unfolded in the three-plus hours it took to play a 60-minute N.F.L. game, where the actual amount of action averages only 10 minutes 43 seconds. In football, specialists did the same thing over and over; in rugby, you played offense and defense \u2014 anyone could score.One day in February, Schoninger confided to me that his secret ambition was to supplant the N.F.L. He was kidding. Or not. It was hard to tell.\u201cThe N.F.L. is on top right now, and rugby is at the bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut things always look better at the top and worse at the bottom than they really are.\u201dPRO Rugby, his new league for a sport that in America has a fan base that would barely register as an N.F.L. rounding error, was just two months from kicking off its 30-game season in April, with clubs in Denver, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego and Obetz, Ohio. Opening day was marked D-Day on a wall calendar.\u201cWhat if nobody comes?\u201d I asked. Rugby-dream stress was showing on Schoninger\u2019s face in a way it hadn\u2019t when I asked the same heartless question in October.\u201cYou mean what happens if I don\u2019t sell a single ticket, or a single hot dog, or a single parking space? If nobody buys any PRO Rugby T-shirts or hats? If I don\u2019t get one sponsor? If nobody wants to broadcast a single game?\u201dHe shuddered.\u201cI\u2019m all in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve become a rugby believer. If I fail, it\u2019s not the money I\u2019ve spent \u2014 well, it\u2019s the money I\u2019ve spent, but it\u2019s also that I was wrong. Wrong about the support from the rugby community. Wrong about the time being right. That\u2019s what would hurt. It\u2019s like opening a restaurant and then no one comes. That would hurt. But then, if this were easy, it would have been done already.\u201dThe first bona fide rugby in the United States was played in 1874, between Harvard and McGill University. Six years later, at Yale, the future T. rex of American sports was hatched when Walter Camp, the innovative coach and writer known as the father of American football, separated the rugby scrum into football\u2019s \u201cline of scrimmage.\u201d Both rugby and football were popular in American colleges and universities in the early 20th century, and at one point, alarmed by the prevalence of injuries, Stanford and Berkeley gave up football for rugby \u2014 a programming decision that was reversed after New Zealand\u2019s mighty All Blacks, on a tour in 1913, humiliated a squad of all-stars in California, 51-3.New Zealand and other top teams were not represented when the United States won Olympic rugby gold medals in Antwerp in 1920 and Paris in 1924. The 17-3 victory in Paris over a heavily favored French team by a United States squad made up mostly of California collegians was one of the greatest upsets in Olympic history. But the outraged reaction of some 40,000 French fans at the Stade Colombes jeopardized the very principle of the better and more peaceful world through sports on which the modern Olympics were based. David Wallechinsky recounts the scene in \u201cThe Complete Book of the Olympics\u201d: \u201cAfter two French players were injured, the U.S. team was booed and hissed the remainder of the game. Fighting broke out in the stands, and Gideon Nelson, an art teacher from Illinois\u201d \u2014 and a United States reserve player \u2014 \u201cwas knocked unconscious after being hit in the face with a walking stick.\u201d The Americans left the field under a police escort and a barrage of rocks and bottles.Rugby was dropped from subsequent Olympics. In America the game went into a long dormancy from which it did not emerge until the 1960s, when it began to catch on again with colleges and clubs. Ed Hagerty, whose life before rugby included a turn as an altar boy in Grace Kelly\u2019s wedding in 1956, discovered his passion for the game at Holy Cross in 1963. \u201cIt was kind of countercultural,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe wore discarded football jerseys.\u201d After graduation, Hagerty played for local clubs in New York and was working as the publisher of Popular Science when he quit to eke out a living as editor of Scrumdown, a rugby newspaper started in 1975 by Jon Prusmack. One of the first Scrumdown editorials summed up the state of the American game, suggesting that ruggers from New Zealand, Australia and Britain were to their American counterparts what Rudolf Nureyev was to Zorba the Greek.To close the talent gap, promote and govern the sport at all levels and establish a United States national team, the 115,000-member organization known today as USA Rugby was formed in 1976. This August, rugby is returning to the Olympics after a 92-year hiatus. The United States will defend its gold medal in Rio de Janeiro, playing a shorter, less complex form of the game that features seven players on a side instead of the traditional 15.Reflecting his faith and his cool appraisal of numbers, Schoninger spent a year at Emory University studying theology, then transferred to Tulane, from which he graduated in 1982 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He landed a $13,000-a-year job as a runner on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and later worked as a construction manager for Morse Diesel, the general contractor for the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. He returned to Wall Street in 2000 to trade stocks and bonds at Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer. Bearish by temperament, with a keen feel for risk, he eventually started his own shop, DJS Capital Management, managing a bond portfolio of several hundred million dollars for more than a dozen clients.In 2013 Schoninger bought an inactive company called Stadium Capital Financing Group that Morgan Stanley needed to unload to comply with new banking regulations. Trying to revive the business, he began shopping for undervalued second-tier sports teams (minor-league baseball, lacrosse, D-league basketball) whose revenues might be leveraged to raise capital for new stadiums. He wasn\u2019t having much luck when, in the autumn of 2014, he was introduced to Jason Moore, an Australian sports-marketing impresario who for years had been trying to raise up to $300 million to create an American rugby league drawing on the N.F.L.\u2019s gladiatorial-entertainment template. \u201cWe wanted to showcase rugby the way Americans consume sports, marketing it with American pizazz and style,\u201d Moore told me. He aimed to sell franchises, host games in midsize soccer venues and pay players upward of $100,000, but he had yet to secure the all-important \u201csanction\u201d from USA Rugby, without which it is difficult to hire referees, coaches or players or to get insurance.\u201cThere were 61,500 people at Soldier Field, the largest rugby crowd in American history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat was the moment things changed for me. I realized that if great teams wanted to play here, and you could fill Soldier Field, you could do well building a professional league.\u201dSchoninger met with USA Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Nigel Melville, a former scrum-half captain of the English national team, in fall 2014. Using USA Rugby\u2019s demographic and event data, Schoninger spent the winter doing due diligence. He drew up budgets for what he envisioned would be six league-owned franchises. He would start modestly, building around cities with vibrant rugby clubs and prominent teams among the hundreds of college and university rugby programs. Salaries ranging from $20,000 to $35,000 would be on a par with other second-tier professional sports vying for sunlight in the shadow of the N.F.L. Through Facebook, he could reach rugby fans with a precision never before possible. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have built a league on my budget without social media,\u201d he says.The expenses for each team \u2014 salaries, coaches, training facilities, venue costs, marketing, uniforms \u2014 would run to about $1.5 million per year. Schoninger didn\u2019t have, or want, partners, and would be financing everything himself the first year. Revenues \u2014 who knew? Could he get sponsors? Sell broadcast rights? How many people would buy tickets? When professional rugby began in England, the first Harlequins game, at Stoop stadium, drew around 1,400. Fans now routinely fill all 14,800 seats, and games at the national stadium in Twickenham attract capacity crowds of 82,000. A survey by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association found that there were 1.3 million rugby \u201cparticipants\u201d in the United States, some 431,000 of them hard-core devotees who played or watched the game more than eight times a year. (The N.F.L., for comparison\u2019s sake, estimates its fan base at 202 million.)In April 2015, the USA Rugby board, which had considered many proposals over the years, agreed to sanction Schoninger\u2019s plan. Schoninger intended to kick off exactly a year later \u2014 hoping to ride the public interest generated by the Rugby World Cup in the fall of 2015 and the return of rugby to the Olympics in Rio this summer. First, he needed a name and a logo. He couldn\u2019t use the word \u201cleague\u201d because \u201crugby league\u201d signified a much less popular version of the game that developed after the so-called Great Schism of 1895, when working-class players from northern England who wanted to be paid split off from teams adhering to the supposed purity of amateur competition. A branding firm in San Francisco proposed a number of logos and names. Some, like the National Rugby Association, or N.R.A., were red-carded for unwanted connotations. Logos that looked decent on a ball or jersey might look crummy on a trailer or a pitch. He finally settled on a red oval shaped like a rugby ball with the winning name in block letters: PRO, for Professional Rugby Organization. He added the word \u201cRugby\u201d below the acronym lest there be any confusion about what PRO actually stood for.Having never been the public face of an organization, Schoninger found himself in some novel situations. In December he sat down in the Pig \u2019N\u2019 Whistle bar in Manhattan with Matt McCarthy, a host of a webcast called Rugby Wrap Up. McCar\u00adthy reached across the table and palpated Schoninger\u2019s arm.\u201cDoug, I just want to make sure you\u2019re real \u2014 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m as real as you are,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201c\u2014 because you\u2019re like Sasquatch to most American rugby fans.\u201dThe league\u2019s initial website and its Facebook page went up in October, and Sasquatch had been living and dying on the number of \u201clikes.\u201d He was relieved that only one fussbudget had taken issue with the redundancy in the name PRO Rugby. He hired a director of operations, Stephen Lewis, a well-connected Scotsman who was named USA Rugby\u2019s 2014 coach of the year. Dominic DeFalco, a recent Penn State graduate who played rugby there, came aboard over the summer as assistant director. Just before Christmas, Schoninger organized a skills combine in San Diego to assess domestic prospects and shoot footage for video spots.There were setbacks. Schoninger couldn\u2019t find a venue for a team in New York, and his hopes were further hindered by the state\u2019s exorbitant workman\u2019s-compensation insurance rates. Philadelphia\u2019s rugby community was not as vigorous as he\u2019d hoped. Venues in the Boston area didn\u2019t pan out. By January it was clear that the first season would feature no teams on the East Coast. But Sacramento proved fertile ground. Having three teams in California meant that players could travel to some games by bus instead of plane, saving Schoninger $1,500 a game on transportation.When I stopped by the office in February, coaches had been hired, the schedule set, but Schoninger wasn\u2019t sure how many players \u2014 drawn mostly from the U.S., with a sprinkling of international stars \u2014 would sign contracts, and he hadn\u2019t found a national sponsor or settled on a broadcast deal.\u201cI was always the downside guy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take risks if you don\u2019t understand the downside. But here we are, two months away, and no one can tell me what our revenues are going to be.\u201dCardio training for Sacramento players. The league\u2019s inaugural season \u2014 five teams, 16 weeks, 30 games \u2014 began in April.Lewis, the director of operations, came in to say he\u2019d heard from the San Francisco coach, Paul Keeler, that no one liked the colors of the team\u2019s uniform.\u201cToo much gray,\u201d Lewis said.\u201cThe designer wanted gray \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be evocative of San Francisco fog,\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cNo one likes it.\u201d\u201cWe can change it.\u201dDeFalco pulled up computer photos of all the proposed league uniforms \u2014 a palette of bold colors meant to evoke the geography of each team\u2019s city.\u201cAre we paying this guy to come up with these designs?\u201d said Lewis, who had already dubbed his boss the Mad Couturier because he insisted on putting a line across the jerseys to mark the upper limit of a legal tackle.\u201cWhat\u2019s our rule?\u201d Schoninger said.\u201cCriticism is only accepted with suggested solutions,\u201d DeFalco said.\u201cIn some ways, the reason you have a Season 1 is so you can fix things in Season 2,\u201d Schoninger said, sighing.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m running for court clerk in one of those elections where there\u2019s only one candidate,\u201d he said as he parked.When he finished explaining why viewers might want to witness the fruition of his rugby dream instead of, say, assess the structural features of Finnish lapphunds at the Sacramento Dog Show, also taking place that day, he headed to Bonney Field. The temperature was climbing to near-record levels. He was frazzled from weeks of cross-country travel and negotiations. The cable channel ONE World Sports would be broadcasting a third of the season. AOL was live-streaming the Sacramento game. Hawk-Eye Innovations, a sports-technology company, was producing the seven-camera video feed. Thanks to a payroll imbroglio, he\u2019d recently spent seven hours manually entering salary information for his 130 new players. Where was the credit-card machine Bank of America had promised? And why, oh why, had he scheduled opening-day games in two cities? The Ohio team\u2019s flight barely got in to Denver in the midst of a blizzard.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be like a snow day, and people will show up,\u201d he said.\u201cDouglas wakes up every morning, and the glass is half full,\u201d said his wife, Abigail Asher, a noted art consultant.When the gates of Bonney Field opened, early arrivals huddled in the shade of the press box. In the V.I.P. tent, waitresses were loading tables with dishes of salsa and colored tortilla chips.At 3:30 the players were announced \u2014 Sacramento in green and white; San Francisco in fog-free red and black. It\u2019s a risible misconception that rugby is populated by athletes inferior to high-level American footballers. The \u201cboys,\u201d as they are called by coaches, fans and even the players themselves, are built like a herd of genetically modified water buffalo and seem as inexhaustible as a class of A.D.H.D. preschoolers.For all the finesse and savvy the players need to succeed in a game that they, not the coaches on the sideline, control, rugby still has a brutal heart. Lest there be any doubt, an ambulance was parked behind the bleachers. But it\u2019s a paradox of the sport that helmetless rugby players may actually suffer fewer concussions than their cousins in the N.F.L. The concussion rate at last year\u2019s World Cup, according to USA Rugby, was 11 per 1,000 player-hours, compared with an estimated 54 per 1,000 player-hours last season in the N.F.L. (The N.F.L. calculates concussions per game, not per player-hour.) Credit below-the-shoulder tackling rules and self-preservation \u2014 not having a helmet lessens the temptation to deploy your head as a spear.At 4 o\u2019clock, Dan Power, a loquacious former rugby player with a gift for decoding the chaos on the pitch, leaned into his press-box mike and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the wait is finally over.\u201dPreseason odds had made the talent-laden San Francisco team the heavy favorite, and at first the game unfolded accordingly. It was all a bit bewildering to the untutored eye. The ball would vanish in a clot of bodies and then mysteriously reappear on the grass like a giant egg, and a scrum half would pluck it up and fling it underhand across the field in what might become a series of thrilling laterals that delivered it to a speedster on the wing who would hie down the sideline and fling himself across the try-line, jabbing the ball onto the ground for the proverbial \u201ctouch down.\u201d The heat began to afflict players on both sides with cramps, and occasionally some of the boys were leveled by head-on collisions that left them looking as if the next game they played might in fact be the game they played in heaven.When play resumed, San Francisco lock Nick Grass, evidently having missed the memo about fellowship and respect, was sent off with a yellow card after he appeared to gouge the eyes of Sacramento flanker Kyle Sumsion. \u201cA little bit of \u2018How\u2019s your father\u2019 going on out there,\u201d said the color commentator, Lou Stanfill, framing the fisticuffs in sports-talk fashion as an exchange of pleasantries. (Grass was later suspended for six games.) When San Francisco hooker Tom Coolican was yellow-carded, Sacramento used its two-man advantage to pull ahead. The crowd of just under 3,400 drummed their feet on the aluminum bleachers. The home team closed out the win, 37-25. The fans stood and clapped, and then the players from both teams lined up in front of the stands and applauded the crowd.For the moment, as the heat of a sun-baked afternoon ebbed, he lingered in the afterglow of the day\u2019s success, reviewing the debut with anyone who wanted to talk about it. He fell into conversations with the announcers as they packed up, and the coaches, and one of the stadium managers, who said 800 people had paid for parking. Even the Mad Couturier\u2019s jersey tackle line had gotten good reviews. He chatted with the players who were gathered under the V.I.P. tent swigging beer and carbo-loading plates of lasagna in preparation for their professional responsibilities next week. A few fans who recognized Schoninger waited patiently to thank him, and he fell into conversation with them too. It was getting dark. His wife and son were waiting to go back to the hotel, but he kept getting tangled in talk \u2014 in essence the same conversation he\u2019d been having day after day for the last year and a half, a rolling, jabbering maul of rugby rugby rugby. Sure, it was all in a day\u2019s work, but it was more than that. It was what needed to be done; it was part of what he\u2019d come to think of as his mission, spreading the gospel of the professional game, one convert at a time.\u201cThese,\u201d he said, still a bit amazed, \u201care my people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Finds Trump\u2019s Disruption Unwelcome", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley\u2019s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the old-fashioned way, by going into the family business, in the old-fashioned industry of real estate. He\u2019s not the valley\u2019s kind of entrepreneur.Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley\u2019s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple.\u201cThere is some surprise among tech executives \u2014 or perhaps just na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 that the tech mainstream is now a target,\u201d said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects right-of-center tech workers.Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif., house that included \u201ca full exchange of views,\u201d an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday.The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7.\u201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,\u201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide.Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research.Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash \u2014 and lots of it.\u201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He\u2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization,\u201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. \u201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That\u2019s a lot of money to leave on the table.\u201dWhether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question.Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. \u201cI know Trump\u2019s supporters are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not vocal. They don\u2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled.\u201dIn at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump.Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \u201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn\u2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s pushing back on Trump.\u201dEarlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon \u201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash.\u201dBobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views.\u201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,\u201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. \u201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate.\u201dYet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump\u2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has \u201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon\u2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment.The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States.Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech\u2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years.\u201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry\u2019s power and ubiquity in American life,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. \u201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won\u2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly.\u201dIn other words, he said, \u201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont\u2019s Worst Nightmare", "Date": "2016-01-06", "News": "FeatureRob Bilott was a corporate defense attorney for eight years. Then he took on an environmental suit that would upend his entire career \u2014 and expose a brazen, decades-long history of chemical pollution.Supported byWhite had lived in Vienna, a northern suburb of Parkersburg, and as a child, Bilott often visited her in the summers. In 1973 she brought him to the cattle farm belonging to the Tennants\u2019 neighbors, the Grahams, with whom White was friendly. Bilott spent the weekend riding horses, milking cows and watching Secretariat win the Triple Crown on TV. He was 7 years old. The visit to the Grahams\u2019 farm was one of his happiest childhood memories.When the Grahams heard in 1998 that Wilbur Tennant was looking for legal help, they remembered Bilott, White\u2019s grandson, who had grown up to become an environmental lawyer. They did not understand, however, that Bilott was not the right kind of environmental lawyer. He did not represent plaintiffs or private citizens. Like the other 200 lawyers at Taft, a firm founded in 1885 and tied historically to the family of President William Howard Taft, Bilott worked almost exclusively for large corporate clients. His specialty was defending chemical companies. Several times, Bilott had even worked on cases with DuPont lawyers. Nevertheless, as a favor to his grandmother, he agreed to meet the farmer. \u2018\u2018It just felt like the right thing to do,\u2019\u2019 he says today. \u2018\u2018I felt a connection to those folks.\u2019\u2019The connection was not obvious at their first meeting. About a week after his phone call, Tennant drove from Parkersburg with his wife to Taft\u2019s headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. They hauled cardboard boxes containing videotapes, photographs and documents into the firm\u2019s glassed-in reception area on the 18th floor, where they sat in gray midcentury-modern couches beneath an oil portrait of one of Taft\u2019s founders. Tennant \u2014 burly and nearly six feet tall, wearing jeans, a plaid flannel shirt and a baseball cap \u2014 did not resemble a typical Taft client. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t show up at our offices looking like a bank vice president,\u2019\u2019 says Thomas Terp, a partner who was Bilott\u2019s supervisor. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s put it that way.\u2019\u2019Terp joined Bilott for the meeting. Wilbur Tennant explained that he and his four siblings had run the cattle farm since their father abandoned them as children. They had seven cows then. Over the decades they steadily acquired land and cattle, until 200 cows roamed more than 600 hilly acres. The property would have been even larger had his brother Jim and Jim\u2019s wife, Della, not sold 66 acres in the early \u201980s to DuPont. The company wanted to use the plot for a landfill for waste from its factory near Parkersburg, called Washington Works, where Jim was employed as a laborer. Jim and Della did not want to sell, but Jim had been in poor health for years, mysterious ailments that doctors couldn\u2019t diagnose, and they needed the money.DuPont rechristened the plot Dry Run Landfill, named after the creek that ran through it. The same creek flowed down to a pasture where the Tennants grazed their cows. Not long after the sale, Wilbur told Bilott, the cattle began to act deranged. They had always been like pets to the Tennants. At the sight of a Tennant they would amble over, nuzzle and let themselves be milked. No longer. Now when they saw the farmers, they charged.Wilbur fed a videotape into the VCR. The footage, shot on a camcorder, was grainy and intercut with static. Images jumped and repeated. The sound accelerated and slowed down. It had the quality of a horror movie. In the opening shot the camera pans across the creek. It takes in the surrounding forest, the white ash trees shedding their leaves and the rippling, shallow water, before pausing on what appears to be a snowbank at an elbow in the creek. The camera zooms in, revealing a mound of soapy froth.\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken two dead deer and two dead cattle off this ripple,\u2019\u2019 Tennant says in voice-over. \u2018\u2018The blood run out of their noses and out their mouths. ... They\u2019re trying to cover this stuff up. But it\u2019s not going to be covered up, because I\u2019m going to bring it out in the open for people to see.\u2019\u2019The video shows a large pipe running into the creek, discharging green water with bubbles on the surface. \u2018\u2018This is what they expect a man\u2019s cows to drink on his own property,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about high time that someone in the state department of something-or-another got off their cans.\u2019\u2019At one point, the video cuts to a skinny red cow standing in hay. Patches of its hair are missing, and its back is humped \u2014 a result, Wilbur speculates, of a kidney malfunction. Another blast of static is followed by a close-up of a dead black calf lying in the snow, its eye a brilliant, chemical blue. \u2018\u2018One hundred fifty-three of these animals I\u2019ve lost on this farm,\u2019\u2019 Wilbur says later in the video. \u2018\u2018Every veterinarian that I\u2019ve called in Parkersburg, they will not return my phone calls or they don\u2019t want to get involved. Since they don\u2019t want to get involved, I\u2019ll have to dissect this thing myself. ... I\u2019m going to start at this head.\u2019\u2019The video cuts to a calf\u2019s bisected head. Close-ups follow of the calf\u2019s blackened teeth (\u2018\u2018They say that\u2019s due to high concentrations of fluoride in the water that they drink\u2019\u2019), its liver, heart, stomachs, kidneys and gall bladder. Each organ is sliced open, and Wilbur points out unusual discolorations \u2014 some dark, some green \u2014 and textures. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even like the looks of them,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It don\u2019t look like anything I\u2019ve been into before.\u2019\u2019Bilott watched the video and looked at photographs for several hours. He saw cows with stringy tails, malformed hooves, giant lesions protruding from their hides and red, receded eyes; cows suffering constant diarrhea, slobbering white slime the consistency of toothpaste, staggering bowlegged like drunks. Tennant always zoomed in on his cows\u2019 eyes. \u2018\u2018This cow\u2019s done a lot of suffering,\u2019\u2019 he would say, as a blinking eye filled the screen.\u2018\u2018This is bad,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said to himself. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s something really bad going on here.\u2019\u2019But his father, who late in life enrolled in law school, encouraged Bilott to do the same. Surprising his professors, he chose to attend law school at Ohio State, where his favorite course was environmental law. \u2018\u2018It seemed like it would have real-world impact,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It was something you could do to make a difference.\u2019\u2019 When, after graduation, Taft made him an offer, his mentors and friends from New College were aghast. They didn\u2019t understand how he could join a corporate firm. Bilott didn\u2019t see it that way. He hadn\u2019t really thought about the ethics of it, to be honest. \u2018\u2018My family said that a big firm was where you\u2019d get the most opportunities,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I knew nobody who had ever worked at a firm, nobody who knew anything about it. I just tried to get the best job I could. I don\u2019t think I had any clue of what that involved.\u2019\u2019At Taft, he asked to join Thomas Terp\u2019s environmental team. Ten years earlier, Congress passed the legislation known as Superfund, which financed the emergency cleanup of hazardous-waste dumps. Superfund was a lucrative development for firms like Taft, creating an entire subfield within environmental law, one that required a deep understanding of the new regulations in order to guide negotiations among municipal agencies and numerous private parties. Terp\u2019s team at Taft was a leader in the field.As an associate, Bilott was asked to determine which companies contributed which toxins and hazardous wastes in what quantities to which sites. He took depositions from plant employees, perused public records and organized huge amounts of historical data. He became an expert on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s regulatory framework, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act. He mastered the chemistry of the pollutants, despite the fact that chemistry had been his worst subject in high school. \u2018\u2018I learned how these companies work, how the laws work, how you defend these claims,\u2019\u2019 he said. He became the consummate insider.Bilott was proud of the work he did. The main part of his job, as he understood it, was to help clients comply with the new regulations. Many of his clients, including Thiokol and Bee Chemical, disposed of hazardous waste long before the practice became so tightly regulated. He worked long hours and knew few people in Cincinnati. A colleague on Taft\u2019s environmental team, observing that he had little time for a social life, introduced him to a childhood friend named Sarah Barlage. She was a lawyer, too, at another downtown Cincinnati firm, where she de\u00adfended corporations against worker\u2019s-compensation claims. Bilott joined the two friends for lunch. Sarah doesn\u2019t remember him speaking. \u2018\u2018My first impression was that he was not like other guys,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty chatty. He\u2019s much quieter. We complemented each other.\u2019\u2019They married in 1996. The first of their three sons was born two years later. He felt secure enough at Taft for Barlage to quit her job and raise their children full-time. Terp, his supervisor, recalls him as \u2018\u2018a real standout lawyer: incredibly bright, energetic, tenacious and very, very thorough.\u2019\u2019 He was a model Taft lawyer. Then Wilbur Tennant came along.The Tennant case put Taft in a highly unusual position. The law firm was in the business of representing chemical corporations, not suing them. The prospect of taking on DuPont \u2018\u2018did cause us pause,\u2019\u2019 Terp concedes. \u2018\u2018But it was not a terribly difficult decision for us. I\u2019m a firm believer that our work on the plaintiff\u2019s side makes us better defense lawyers.\u2019\u2019Bilott sought help with the Tennant case from a West Virginia lawyer named Larry Winter. For many years, Winter was a partner at Spilman, Thomas & Battle \u2014 one of the firms that represented DuPont in West Virginia \u2014 though he had left Spilman to start a practice specializing in personal-injury cases. He was amazed that Bilott would sue DuPont while remaining at Taft.\u2018\u2018His taking on the Tennant case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018given the type of practice Taft had, I found to be inconceivable.\u2019\u2019Bilott, for his part, is reluctant to discuss his motivations for taking the case. The closest he came to elaborating was after being asked whether, having set out \u2018\u2018to make a difference\u2019\u2019 in the world, he had any misgivings about the path his career had taken.\u2018\u2018There was a reason why I was interested in helping out the Tennants,\u2019\u2019 he said after a pause. \u2018\u2018It was a great opportunity to use my background for people who really needed it.\u2019\u2019This did not sit well with the Tennants, who began to suffer the consequences of antagonizing Parkersburg\u2019s main employer. Lifelong friends ignored the Tennants on the streets of Parkersburg and walked out of restaurants when they entered. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you,\u2019\u2019 they said, when confronted. Four different times, the Tennants changed churches.Wilbur called the office nearly every day, but Bilott had little to tell him. He was doing for the Tennants what he would have done for any of his corporate clients \u2014 pulling permits, studying land deeds and requesting from DuPont all documentation related to Dry Run Landfill \u2014 but he could find no evidence that explained what was happening to the cattle. \u2018\u2018We were getting frustrated,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t blame the Tennants for getting angry.\u2019\u2019With the trial looming, Bilott stumbled upon a letter DuPont had sent to the E.P.A. that mentioned a substance at the landfill with a cryptic name: \u2018\u2018PFOA.\u2019\u2019 In all his years working with chemical companies, Bilott had never heard of PFOA. It did not appear on any list of regulated materials, nor could he find it in Taft\u2019s in-house library. The chemistry expert that he had retained for the case did, however, vaguely recall an article in a trade journal about a similar-sounding compound: PFOS, a soaplike agent used by the technology conglomerate 3M in the fabrication of Scotchgard.Bilott hunted through his files for other references to PFOA, which he learned was short for perfluorooctanoic acid. But there was nothing. He asked DuPont to share all documentation related to the substance; DuPont refused. In the fall of 2000, Bilott requested a court order to force them. Against DuPont\u2019s protests, the order was granted. Dozens of boxes containing thousands of unorganized documents began to arrive at Taft\u2019s headquarters: private internal correspondence, medical and health reports and confidential studies conducted by DuPont scientists. There were more than 110,000 pages in all, some half a century old. Bilott spent the next few months on the floor of his office, poring over the documents and arranging them in chronological order. He stopped answering his office phone. When people called his secretary, she explained that he was in the office but had not been able to reach the phone in time, because he was trapped on all sides by boxes.\u2018\u2018I started seeing a story,\u2019\u2019 Bilott said. \u2018\u2018I may have been the first one to actually go through them all. It became apparent what was going on: They had known for a long time that this stuff was bad.\u2019\u2019Bilott is given to understatement. (\u2018\u2018To say that Rob Bilott is understated,\u2019\u2019 his colleague Edison Hill says, \u2018\u2018is an understatement.\u2019\u2019) The story that Bilott began to see, cross-legged on his office floor, was astounding in its breadth, specificity and sheer brazenness. \u2018\u2018I was shocked,\u2019\u2019 he said. That was another understatement. Bilott could not believe the scale of incriminating material that DuPont had sent him. The company appeared not to realize what it had handed over. \u2018\u2018It was one of those things where you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading what you\u2019re reading,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018That it\u2019s actually been put in writing. It was the kind of stuff you always heard about happening but you never thought you\u2019d see written down.\u2019\u2019Bilott learned from the documents that 3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades. In 1961, DuPont researchers found that the chemical could increase the size of the liver in rats and rabbits. A year later, they replicated these results in studies with dogs. PFOA\u2019s peculiar chemical structure made it uncannily resistant to degradation. It also bound to plasma proteins in the blood, circulating through each organ in the body. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered that there were high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of factory workers at Washington Works. They did not tell the E.P.A. at the time. In 1981, 3M \u2014 which continued to serve as the supplier of PFOA to DuPont and other corporations \u2014 found that ingestion of the substance caused birth defects in rats. After 3M shared this information, DuPont tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon division. Of seven births, two had eye defects. DuPont did not make this information public.In 1984, DuPont became aware that dust vented from factory chimneys settled well beyond the property line and, more disturbing, that PFOA was present in the local water supply. DuPont declined to disclose this finding. In 1991, DuPont scientists determined an internal safety limit for PFOA concentration in drinking water: one part per billion. The same year, DuPont found that water in one local district contained PFOA levels at three times that figure. Despite internal debate, it declined to make the information public.(In a statement, DuPont claimed that it did volunteer health information about PFOA to the E.P.A. during those decades. When asked for evidence, it forwarded two letters written to West Virginian government agencies from 1982 and 1992, both of which cited internal studies that called into question links between PFOA exposure and human health problems.)By the \u201990s, Bilott discovered, DuPont understood that PFOA caused cancerous testicular, pancreatic and liver tumors in lab animals. One laboratory study suggested possible DNA damage from PFOA exposure, and a study of workers linked exposure with prostate cancer. DuPont at last hastened to develop an alternative to PFOA. An interoffice memo sent in 1993 announced that \u2018\u2018for the first time, we have a viable candidate\u2019\u2019 that appeared to be less toxic and stayed in the body for a much shorter duration of time. Discussions were held at DuPont\u2019s corporate headquarters to discuss switching to the new compound. DuPont decided against it. The risk was too great: Products manufactured with PFOA were an important part of DuPont\u2019s business, worth $1 billion in annual profit.But the crucial discovery for the Tennant case was this: By the late 1980s, as DuPont became increasingly concerned about the health effects of PFOA waste, it decided it needed to find a landfill for the toxic sludge dumped on company property. Fortunately they had recently bought 66 acres from a low-level employee at the Washington Works facility that would do perfectly.By 1990, DuPont had dumped 7,100 tons of PFOA sludge into Dry Run Landfill. DuPont\u2019s scientists understood that the landfill drained into the Tennants\u2019 remaining property, and they tested the water in Dry Run Creek. It contained an extraordinarily high concentration of PFOA. DuPont did not tell this to the Tennants at the time, nor did it disclose the fact in the cattle report that it commissioned for the Tennant case a decade later \u2014 the report that blamed poor husbandry for the deaths of their cows. Bilott had what he needed.The Tennants settled. The firm would receive its contingency fee. The whole business might have ended right there. But Bilott was not satisfied.\u2018\u2018I was irritated,\u2019\u2019 he says.DuPont was nothing like the corporations he had represented at Taft in the Superfund cases. \u2018\u2018This was a completely different scenario. DuPont had for decades been actively trying to conceal their actions. They knew this stuff was harmful, and they put it in the water anyway. These were bad facts.\u2019\u2019 He had seen what the PFOA-tainted drinking water had done to cattle. What was it doing to the tens of thousands of people in the areas around Parkersburg who drank it daily from their taps? What did the insides of their heads look like? Were their internal organs green?Bilott spent the following months drafting a public brief against DuPont. It was 972 pages long, including 136 attached exhibits. His colleagues call it \u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s Famous Letter.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018We have confirmed that the chemicals and pollutants released into the environment by DuPont at its Dry Run Landfill and other nearby DuPont-owned facilities may pose an imminent and substantial threat to health or the environment,\u2019\u2019 Bilott wrote. He demanded immediate action to regulate PFOA and provide clean water to those living near the factory. On March 6, 2001, he sent the letter to the director of every relevant regulatory authority, including Christie Whitman, administrator of the E.P.A., and the United States attorney general, John Ashcroft.DuPont reacted quickly, requesting a gag order to block Bilott from providing the information he had discovered in the Tennant case to the government. A federal court denied it. Bilott sent his entire case file to the E.P.A.\u2018\u2018DuPont freaked out when they realized that this guy was onto them,\u2019\u2019 says Ned McWilliams, a young trial lawyer who later joined Bilott\u2019s legal team. \u2018\u2018For a corporation to seek a gag order to prevent somebody from speaking to the E.P.A. is an extraordinary remedy. You could realize how bad that looks. They must have known that there was a small chance of winning. But they were so afraid that they were willing to roll the dice.\u2019\u2019With the Famous Letter, Bilott crossed a line. Though nominally representing the Tennants \u2014 their settlement had yet to be concluded \u2014 Bilott spoke for the public, claiming extensive fraud and wrongdoing. He had become a threat not merely to DuPont but also to, in the words of one internal memo, \u2018\u2018the entire fluoropolymers industry\u2019\u2019 \u2014 an industry responsible for the high-performance plastics used in many modern devices, including kitchen products, computer cables, implantable medical devices and bearings and seals used in cars and airplanes. PFOA was only one of more than 60,000 synthetic chemicals that companies produced and released into the world without regulatory oversight.\u2018\u2018Rob\u2019s letter lifted the curtain on a whole new theater,\u2019\u2019 says Harry Deitzler, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in West Virginia who works with Bilott. \u2018\u2018Before that letter, corporations could rely upon the public misperception that if a chemical was dangerous, it was regulated.\u2019\u2019 Under the 1976 Toxic Sub\u00adstances Control Act, the E.P.A. can test chemicals only when it has been provided evidence of harm. This arrangement, which largely allows chemical companies to regulate themselves, is the reason that the E.P.A. has restricted only five chemicals, out of tens of thousands on the market, in the last 40 years.It was especially damning to see these allegations against DuPont under the letterhead of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious corporate defense firms. \u2018\u2018You can imagine what some of the other companies that Taft was representing \u2014 a Dow Chemical \u2014 might have thought of a Taft lawyer taking on DuPont,\u2019\u2019 Larry Winter says. \u2018\u2018There was a threat that the firm would suffer financially.\u2019\u2019 When I asked Thomas Terp about Taft\u2019s reaction to the Famous Letter, he replied, not quite convincingly, that he didn\u2019t recall one. \u2018\u2018Our partners,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018are proud of the work that he has done.\u2019\u2019Bilott, however, worried that corporations doing business with Taft might see things differently. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not stupid, and the people around me aren\u2019t stupid,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t ignore the economic realities of the ways that business is run and the way clients think. I perceived that there were some \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 responses.\u2019\u2019The letter led, four years later, in 2005, to DuPont\u2019s reaching a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A., which had accused the company of concealing its knowledge of PFOA\u2019s toxicity and presence in the environment in violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act. (DuPont was not required to admit liability.) At the time, it was the largest civil administrative penalty the E.P.A. had obtained in its history, a statement that sounds more impressive than it is. The fine represented less than 2 percent of the profits earned by DuPont on PFOA that year.Bilott never represented a corporate client again.It was one thing to pursue a sentimental case on behalf of a few West Virginia cattle farmers and even write a public letter to the E.P.A. But an industry-threatening class-action suit against one of the world\u2019s largest chemical corporations was different. It might establish a precedent for suing corporations over unregulated sub\u00adstances and imperil Taft\u2019s bottom line. This point was made to Terp by Bernard Reilly, DuPont\u2019s in-house lawyer, according to accounts from Bilott\u2019s plaintiff\u2019s-lawyer colleagues; they say Reilly called to demand that Bilott back off the case. (Terp confirms that Reilly called him but will not disclose the content of the call; Bilott and Reilly decline to speak about it, citing continuing litigation.) Given what Bilott had documented in his Famous Letter, Taft stood by its partner.A lead plaintiff soon presented himself. Joseph Kiger, a night-school teacher in Parkersburg, called Bilott to ask for help. About nine months earlier, he received a peculiar note from the Lubeck water district. It arrived on Halloween day, enclosed in the monthly water bill. The note explained that an unregulated chemical named PFOA had been detected in the drinking water in \u2018\u2018low concentrations,\u2019\u2019 but that it was not a health risk. Kiger had underlined statements that he found particularly baffling, like: \u2018\u2018DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2018support confidence\u2019\u2019 seemed bizarre, as did \u2018\u2018protective of human health,\u2019\u2019 not to mention the claim that DuPont\u2019s own data supported its confidence in its own guidelines.Still, Kiger might have forgotten about it had his wife, Darlene, not already spent much of her adulthood thinking about PFOA. Darlene\u2019s first husband had been a chemist in DuPont\u2019s PFOA lab. (Darlene asked that he not be named so that he wouldn\u2019t be involved in the local politics around the case.) \u2018\u2018When you worked at DuPont in this town,\u2019\u2019 Darlene says today, \u2018\u2018you could have everything you wanted.\u2019\u2019 DuPont paid for his education, it secured him a mortgage and it paid him a generous salary. DuPont even gave him a free supply of PFOA, which, Darlene says, she used as soap in the family\u2019s dishwasher and to clean the car. Sometimes her husband came home from work sick \u2014 fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting \u2014 after working in one of the PFOA storage tanks. It was a common occurrence at Washington Works. Darlene says the men at the plant called it \u2018\u2018Teflon flu.\u2019\u2019In 1976, after Darlene gave birth to their second child, her husband told her that he was not allowed to bring his work clothes home anymore. DuPont, he said, had found out that PFOA was causing health problems for women and birth defects in children. Darlene would remember this six years later when, at 36, she had to have an emergency hysterectomy and again eight years later, when she had a second surgery. When the strange letter from the water district arrived, Darlene says, \u2018\u2018I kept thinking back to his clothing, to my hysterectomy. I asked myself, what does DuPont have to do with our drinking water?\u2019\u2019Joe called the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (\u2018\u2018They treated me like I had the plague\u2019\u2019), the Parkersburg office of the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection (\u2018\u2018nothing to worry about\u2019\u2019), the water division (\u2018\u2018I got shut down\u2019\u2019), the local health department (\u2018\u2018just plain rude\u2019\u2019), even DuPont (\u2018\u2018I was fed the biggest line of [expletive] anybody could have been fed\u2019\u2019), before a scientist in the regional E.P.A. office finally took his call.\u2018\u2018Good God, Joe,\u2019\u2019 the scientist said. \u2018\u2018What the hell is that stuff doing in your water?\u2019\u2019 He sent Kiger information about the Tennant lawsuit. On the court papers Kiger kept seeing the same name: Robert Bilott, of Taft Stettinius & Hollister, in Cincinnati.But Bilott faced a vexing legal problem. PFOA was not a regulated substance. It appeared on no federal or state list of contaminants. How could Bilott claim that 70,000 people had been poisoned if the government didn\u2019t recognize PFOA as a toxin \u2014 if PFOA, legally speaking, was no different than water itself? In 2001, it could not even be proved that exposure to PFOA in public drinking water caused health problems. There was scant information available about its impact on large populations. How could the class prove it had been harmed by PFOA when the health effects were largely unknown?The best metric Bilott had to judge a safe exposure level was DuPont\u2019s own internal limit of one part per billion. But when DuPont learned that Bilott was preparing a new lawsuit, it announced that it would re-evaluate that figure. As in the Tennant case, DuPont formed a team composed of its own scientists and scientists from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. It announced a new threshold: 150 parts per billion.Bilott found the figure \u2018\u2018mind-blowing.\u2019\u2019 The toxicologists he hired had settled upon a safety limit of 0.2 parts per billion. But West Virginia endorsed the new standard. Within two years, three lawyers regularly used by DuPont were hired by the state D.E.P. in leadership positions. One of them was placed in charge of the entire agency. \u2018\u2018The way that transpired was just amazing to me,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018I suppose it wasn\u2019t so amazing to my fellow counsel in West Virginia who know the system there. But it was to me.\u2019\u2019 The same DuPont lawyers tasked with writing the safety limit, Bilott said, had become the government regulators responsible for enforcing that limit.Bilott devised a new legal strategy. A year earlier, West Virginia had become one of the first states to recognize what is called, in tort law, a medical-monitoring claim. A plaintiff needs to prove only that he or she has been exposed to a toxin. If the plaintiff wins, the defendant is required to fund regular medical tests. In these cases, should a plaintiff later become ill, he or she can sue retroactively for damages. For this reason, Bilott filed the class-action suit in August 2001 in state court, even though four of the six affected water districts lay across the Ohio border.Meanwhile the E.P.A., drawing from Bilott\u2019s research, began its own investigation into the toxicity of PFOA. In 2002, the agency released its initial findings: PFOA might pose human health risks not only to those drinking tainted water, but also to the general public \u2014 anyone, for instance, who cooked with Teflon pans. The E.P.A. was particularly alarmed to learn that PFOA had been detected in American blood banks, something 3M and DuPont had known as early as 1976. By 2003 the average concentration of PFOA in the blood of an adult American was four to five parts per billion. In 2000, 3M ceased production of PFOA. DuPont, rather than use an alternative compound, built a new factory in Fayetteville, N.C., to manufacture the substance for its own use.Bilott\u2019s strategy appeared to have worked. In September 2004, DuPont decided to settle the class-action suit. It agreed to install filtration plants in the six affected water districts if they wanted them and pay a cash award of $70 million. It would fund a scientific study to determine whether there was a \u2018\u2018probable link\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a term that delicately avoided any declaration of causation \u2014 between PFOA and any diseases. If such links existed, DuPont would pay for medical monitoring of the affected group in perpetuity. Until the scientific study came back with its results, class members were forbidden from filing personal-injury suits against DuPont.A reasonable expectation, at this point, was that the lawyers would move on. \u2018\u2018In any other class action you\u2019ve ever read about,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says, \u2018\u2018you get your 10 bucks in the mail, the lawyers get paid and the lawsuit goes away. That\u2019s what we were supposed to do.\u2019\u2019 For three years, Bilott had worked for nothing, costing his firm a fortune. But now Taft received a windfall: Bilott and his team of West Virginian plaintiff lawyers received $21.7 million in fees from the settlement. \u2018\u2018I think they were thinking, This guy did O.K.,\u2019\u2019 Deitzler says. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he got a raise.\u2019\u2019Not only had Taft recouped its losses, but DuPont was providing clean water to the communities named in the suit. Bilott had every reason to walk away.He didn\u2019t.Bilott represented 70,000 people who had been drinking PFOA-laced drinking water for decades. What if the settlement money could be used to test them? \u2018\u2018Class members were concerned about three things,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018One: Do I have C8 in my blood? Two: If I do, is it harmful? Three: If it\u2019s harmful, what are the effects?\u2019\u2019 Bilott and his colleagues realized they could answer all three questions, if only they could test their clients. Now, they realized, there was a way to do so. After the settlement, the legal team pushed to make receipt of the cash award contingent on a full medical examination. The class voted in favor of this approach, and within months, nearly 70,000 West Virginians were trading their blood for a $400 check.The team of epidemiologists was flooded with medical data, and there was nothing DuPont could do to stop it. In fact, it was another term of the settlement that DuPont would fund the research without limitation. The scientists, freed from the restraints of academic budgets and grants, had hit the epidemiological jackpot: an entire population\u2019s personal data and infinite resources available to study them. The scientists designed 12 studies, including one that, using sophisticated environmental modeling technology, determined exactly how much PFOA each individual class member had ingested.It was assured that the panel would return convincing results. But Bilott could not predict what those results would be. If no correlation was found between PFOA and illness, Bilott\u2019s clients would be barred under the terms of the agreement from filing any personal-injury cases. Because of the sheer quantity of data provided by the community health study and the un\u00adlimited budget \u2014 it ultimately cost DuPont $33 million \u2014 the panel took longer than ex\u00adpected to perform its analysis. Two years passed without any findings. Bilott waited. A third year passed. Then a fourth, a fifth, a sixth. Still the panel was quiet. Bilott waited.\u2018\u2018This case,\u2019\u2019 Winter says, \u2018\u2018regardless of how hugely successful it ends up, will never in the Taft firm\u2019s mind replace what they\u2019ve lost in the way of legal business over the years.\u2019\u2019The longer it took for the science panel to conduct its research, the more expensive the case became. Taft continued to pay consultants to interpret the new findings and relay them to the epidemiologists. Bilott counseled class members in West Virginia and Ohio and traveled frequently to Washington to attend meetings at the E.P.A., which was deciding whether to issue advisories about PFOA. \u2018\u2018We were incurring a lot of expenses,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says. \u2018\u2018If the scientific panel found no link with diseases, we\u2019d have to eat it all.\u2019\u2019Clients called Bilott to say that they had received diagnoses of cancer or that a family member had died. They wanted to know why it was taking so long. When would they get relief? Among those who called was Jim Tennant. Wilbur, who had cancer, had died of a heart attack. Two years later, Wilbur\u2019s wife died of cancer. Bilott was tormented by \u2018\u2018the thought that we still hadn\u2019t been able to hold this company responsible for what they did in time for those people to see it.\u2019\u2019Taft did not waver in its support of the case, but the strain began to show. \u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Sarah Barlage, Bilott\u2019s wife, says. \u2018\u2018He was exasperated that it was lasting a long time. But his heels were so dug in. He\u2019s extremely stubborn. Every day that went by with no movement gave him more drive to see it through. But in the back of our minds, we knew that there are cases that go on forever.\u2019\u2019His colleagues on the case detected a change in Bilott. \u2018\u2018I had the impression that it was extremely tough on him,\u2019\u2019 Winter says. \u2018\u2018Rob had a young family, kids growing up, and he was under pressure from his firm. Rob is a private person. He didn\u2019t complain. But he showed signs of being under enormous stress.\u2019\u2019In 2010, Bilott began suffering strange attacks: His vision would blur, he couldn\u2019t put on his socks, his arms felt numb. His doctors didn\u2019t know what was happening. The attacks recurred periodically, bringing blurry vision, slurred speech and difficulty moving one side of his body. They struck suddenly, without warning, and their effects lasted days. The doctors asked whether he was under heightened stress at work. \u2018\u2018Nothing different than normal,\u2019\u2019 Bilott told them. \u2018\u2018Nothing it hadn\u2019t been for years.\u2019\u2019The doctors ultimately hit upon an effective medication. The episodes ceased and their symptoms, apart from an occasional tic, are under control, but he still doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis.\u2018\u2018It was stressful,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, \u2018\u2018not to know what the heck was going on.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018There was relief,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, understated nearly to the point of self-effacement. \u2018\u2018We were able to deliver what we had promised to these folks seven years earlier. Especially since, for all those years, DuPont had been saying that we were lying, trying to scare and mislead people. Now we had a scientific answer.\u2019\u2019DuPont\u2019s continuing refusal to accept responsibility is maddening to Bilott. \u2018\u2018To think that you\u2019ve negotiated in good faith a deal that everybody has abided by and worked on for seven years, you reach a point where certain things were to be resolved but then remain contested,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I think about the clients who have been waiting for this, many of whom are sick or have died while waiting. It\u2019s infuriating.\u2019\u2019As part of its agreement with the E.P.A., DuPont ceased production and use of PFOA in 2013. The five other companies in the world that produce PFOA are also phasing out production. DuPont, which is currently negotiating a merger with Dow Chemical, last year severed its chemical businesses: They have been spun off into a new corporation called Chemours. The new company has replaced PFOA with similar fluorine-based compounds designed to biodegrade more quickly \u2014 the alternative considered and then discarded by DuPont more than 20 years ago. Like PFOA, these new substances have not come under any regulation from the E.P.A. When asked about the safety of the new chemicals, Chemours replied in a statement: \u2018\u2018A significant body of data demonstrates that these alternative chemistries can be used safely.\u2019\u2019When asked about the Madrid Statement, Dan Turner, DuPont\u2019s head of global media relations, wrote in an email: \u2018\u2018DuPont does not believe the Madrid Statement reflects a true consideration of the available data on alternatives to long-chain perfluorochemicals, such as PFOA. DuPont worked for more than a decade, with oversight from regulators, to introduce its alternatives. Extensive data has been developed, demonstrating that these alternatives are much more rapidly eliminated from the body than PFOA, and have improved health safety profiles. We are confident that these alternative chemistries can be used safely \u2014 they are well characterized, and the data has been used to register them with environmental agencies around the world.\u2019\u2019This advisory level, if indeed announced, might be a source of comfort to future generations. But if you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood. It is in your parents\u2019 blood, your children\u2019s blood, your lover\u2019s blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water. The Environmental Working Group has found manufactured fluoro\u00adchemicals present in 94 water districts across 27 states (see sidebar beginning on Page 38). Residents of Issaquah, Wash.; Wilmington, Del.; Colorado Springs; and Nassau County on Long Island are among those whose water has a higher concentration of fluorochemicals than that in some of the districts included in Rob Bilott\u2019s class-action suit. The drinking water in Parkersburg itself, whose water district was not included in the original class-action suit and has failed to compel DuPont to pay for a filtration system, is currently tainted with high levels of PFOA. Most residents appear not to know this.Where scientists have tested for the presence of PFOA in the world, they have found it. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia.\u2018\u2018We see a situation,\u2019\u2019 Joe Kiger says, \u2018\u2018that has gone from Washington Works, to statewide, to the United States, and now it\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s global. We\u2019ve taken the cap off something here. But it\u2019s just not DuPont. Good God. There are 60,000 unregulated chemicals out there right now. We have no idea what we\u2019re taking.\u2019\u2019Bilott doesn\u2019t regret fighting DuPont for the last 16 years, nor for letting PFOA consume his career. But he is still angry. \u2018\u2018The thought that DuPont could get away with this for this long,\u2019\u2019 Bilott says, his tone landing halfway between wonder and rage, \u2018\u2018that they could keep making a profit off it, then get the agreement of the governmental agencies to slowly phase it out, only to replace it with an alternative with unknown human effects \u2014 we told the agencies about this in 2001, and they\u2019ve essentially done nothing. That\u2019s 14 years of this stuff continuing to be used, continuing to be in the drinking water all over the country. DuPont just quietly switches over to the next substance. And in the meantime, they fight everyone who has been injured by it.\u2019\u2019Bilott is currently prosecuting Wolf v. DuPont, the second of the personal-injury cases filed by the members of his class. The plaintiff, John M. Wolf of Parkersburg, claims that PFOA in his drinking water caused him to develop ulcerative colitis. That trial begins in March. When it concludes, there will be 3,533 cases left to try.An article on Jan 10. about legal action against DuPont for chemical pollution referred incorrectly to DuPont\u2019s response in the 1970s when the company discovered high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of workers at Washington Works, a DuPont factory. DuPont withheld the information from the E.P.A., not from its workers. The article also misstated the year DuPont agreed to a $16.5 million settlement with the E.P.A. It was 2005, not 2006. In addition, the article misidentified the water district where a resident received a letter from the district noting that PFOA had been detected in the drinking water. It was Lubeck, W.Va. \u2014 not Little Hocking, Ohio. The article also misidentified the district where water tested positive for PFOA at seven times the limit. It was Little Hocking, not Lubeck. And the article misidentified the city in Washington State that has fluorochemicals in its drink-ing water. It is Issaquah, not Seattle.Nathaniel Rich is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u2018\u2018Odds Against Tomorrow.\u2019\u2019 He lives in New Orleans and is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and The Atlantic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen: After Brexit, the People\u2019s Spring Is Inevitable", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 IF there\u2019s one thing that chafes French pride, it\u2019s seeing the British steal the limelight. But in the face of real courage, even the proudest French person can only tip his hat and bow. The decision that the people of Britain have just made was indeed an act of courage \u2014 the courage of a people who embrace their freedom.Brexit won out, defeating all forecasts. Britain decided to cast off from the European Union and reclaim its independence among the world\u2019s nations. It had been said that the election would hinge solely on economic matters; the British, however, were more insightful in understanding the real issue than commentators like to admit.British voters understood that behind prognostications about the pound\u2019s exchange rate and behind the debates of financial experts, only one question, at once simple and fundamental, was being asked: Do we want an undemocratic authority ruling our lives, or would we rather regain control over our destiny? Brexit is, above all, a political issue. It\u2019s about the free choice of a people deciding to govern itself. Even when it is touted by all the propaganda in the world, a cage remains a cage, and a cage is unbearable to a human being in love with freedom.The European Union has become a prison of peoples. Each of the 28 countries that constitute it has slowly lost its democratic prerogatives to commissions and councils with no popular mandate. Every nation in the union has had to apply laws it did not want for itself. Member nations no longer determine their own budgets. They are called upon to open their borders against their will.Countries in the eurozone face an even less enviable situation. In the name of ideology, different economies are forced to adopt the same currency, even if doing so bleeds them dry. It\u2019s a modern version of the Procrustean bed, and the people no longer have a say.And what about the European Parliament? It\u2019s democratic in appearance only, because it\u2019s based on a lie: the pretense that there is a homogeneous European people, and that a Polish member of the European Parliament has the legitimacy to make law for the Spanish. We have tried to deny the existence of sovereign nations. It\u2019s only natural that they would not allow being denied.Brexit wasn\u2019t the European people\u2019s first cry of revolt. In 2005, France and the Netherlands held referendums about the proposed European Union constitution. In both countries, opposition was massive, and other governments decided on the spot to halt the experiment for fear the contagion might spread. A few years later, the European Union constitution was forced on the people of Europe anyway, under the guise of the Lisbon Treaty. In 2008, Ireland, also by way of referendum, refused to apply that treaty. And once again, a popular decision was brushed aside.When in 2015 Greece decided by referendum to reject Brussels\u2019 austerity plans, the European Union\u2019s antidemocratic response took no one by surprise: To deny the people\u2019s will had become a habit. In a flash of honesty, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, unabashedly declared, \u201cThere can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.\u201dBrexit may not have been the first cry of hope, but it may be the people\u2019s first real victory. The British have presented the union with a dilemma it will have a hard time getting out of. Either it allows Britain to sail away quietly and thus runs the risk of setting a precedent: The political and economic success of a country that left the European Union would be clear evidence of the union\u2019s noxiousness. Or, like a sore loser, the union makes the British pay for their departure by every means possible and thus exposes the tyrannical nature of its power. Common sense points toward the former option. I have a feeling Brussels will choose the latter.One thing is certain: Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will not make the union more democratic. The hierarchical structure of its supranational institutions will want to reinforce itself: Like all dying ideologies, the union knows only how to forge blindly ahead. The roles are already cast \u2014 Germany will lead the way, and France will obligingly tag along.Here is a sign: President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain take their lead directly from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, without running through Brussels. A quip attributed to Henry Kissinger, \u201cWho do I call if I want to call Europe?\u201d now has a clear answer: Call Berlin.So the people of Europe have but one alternative left: to remain bound hand-and-foot to a union that betrays national interests and popular sovereignty and that throws our countries wide open to massive immigration and arrogant finance, or to reclaim their freedom by voting.Calls for referendums are ringing throughout the Continent. I myself have suggested to Mr. Hollande that one such public consultation be held in France. He did not fail to turn me down. More and more, the destiny of the European Union resembles the destiny of the Soviet Union, which died from its own contradictions.The People\u2019s Spring is now inevitable! The only question left to ask is whether Europe is ready to rid itself of its illusions, or if the return to reason will come with suffering. I made my decision a long time ago: I chose France. I chose sovereign nations. I chose freedom.Marine Le Pen is president of the National Front party in France. This essay was translated by John Cullen from the French.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Veers From Party Line on Gun Control", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that people on the terror watch list should be barred from buying firearms, putting himself in the center of a gun-control debate in Congress revived by the worst mass shooting in United States history.Mr. Trump\u2019s stance, expressed in a Twitter post, does not necessarily jibe with the positions of the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association, whose endorsement Mr. Trump frequently boasts about on the campaign trail. His tweet could be read to support measures pushed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans in Congress, reflecting the unusual nuances of the issue, which touches on public safety and civil rights beyond the Second Amendment.On the same morning, a group of Democrats took to the Senate floor in a filibuster to protest the lack of improvement in gun safety measures in recent years.\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who spoke on and off for more than 14 hours. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just come back to the Senate this week and pretend like this is business as usual.\u201dWhen he finished talking shortly after 2 a.m. on Thursday, Mr. Murphy said he had secured agreement for votes on the measures.The filibuster drew significant attention online, with supporters tweeting support and encouragement as the hours dragged on. Mr. Murphy acknowledged that support after ending the filibuster.The Democratic legislation, sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, would seek to prevent individuals on the government\u2019s terror watch list from purchasing guns on the recommendation of the Justice Department alone. Ms. Feinstein unsuccessfully proposed a similar measure last year, after 14 people were killed by an Islamic extremist couple in San Bernardino, Calif.The legislation she is now proposing goes even further, covering not just people on the watch list at the time of purchase, but anyone who had been on the list in the preceding five years. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, had been on the list but was removed after an F.B.I. investigation turned up no evidence that he was plotting any crimes.The group has supported a competing measure put forward by Republicans, led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas. Under the proposal, when someone on the watch list tried to buy a gun, federal prosecutors would have three days to persuade a judge that there is probable cause to deny the purchase. Democrats say that burden is too high.Senate Democrats are hoping to resurrect legislation to prevent those on the government\u2019s terrorist watchlist from purchasing guns.\u201cThe N.R.A. believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period,\u201d said Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the group\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watch list to be removed.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump confirmed that he met with Mr. Cox in New York on Tuesday, though the terror watch list was not on the agenda.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not clarify Wednesday how far his proposal would go or articulate which of the dueling measures \u2014 Mr. Cornyn\u2019s or Ms. Feinstein\u2019s \u2014 Mr. Trump most agrees with.Democrats were not counting on Mr. Trump\u2019s support and almost seemed not to want it. They have been more than happy to associate him with the N.R.A., which Democrats view as the biggest obstacle to gun control.Republicans are under pressure to show some action in response to the Orlando shooting, and Mr. Cornyn said on Wednesday evening that he was working with Ms. Feinstein on a potential compromise. But Ms. Feinstein, speaking to reporters after a classified briefing on the Orlando shooting that Mr. Cornyn also attended, said she doubted a deal would be reached.As for Mr. Trump\u2019s role, she was dismissive. \u201cOh, Trump just makes everything worse,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.During the primaries, Mr. Trump, who is a gun owner, spoke often about his affinity for guns as a way to prove his conservatism. He is in step with the N.R.A. on virtually all other gun issues, including his opposition to a ban on assault weapons. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m going to save your Second Amendment,\u201d he said Wednesday at a rally in Atlanta.Here is how they illustrate the differences between the country\u2019s political parties.As he has after other mass shootings, Mr. Trump said Wednesday that more gun ownership was the answer, not less. He said that the carnage could have been minimized \u201cif some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction.\u201dActual floor debate on any of the proposals in Congress was not expected until Thursday at the earliest.Mr. Murphy was aided by a large cast of Democrats but especially his fellow Connecticut senator, Richard Blumenthal, as well as Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the minority whip.They yielded briefly for questions from Republicans but otherwise talked incessantly about the need for tighter gun control. By early evening, the Democrats brought out a poster showing photographs of victims of the Orlando shooting. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, stood next to the poster, reading out the victims\u2019 names and speaking about their lives.A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said that the speechmaking by Democrats was merely delaying the consideration of the gun-related measures, as well as proposals on F.B.I. financing and other amendments to the Senate appropriations bill.Jonathan Lowy, director of the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that while the Democratic legislation was \u201ca very promising step in the right direction,\u201d none of the proposals currently under consideration go far enough.\u201cWe need to require background checks for all gun sales if we truly want to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and other dangerous people,\u201d Mr. Lowy said.Mr. Lowy added that he still does not entirely understand what Mr. Trump is proposing. \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t enact the tweet into law \u2014 you need more specifics than that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what actual legislation, if any, Trump actually supports.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Atlanta, Emmarie Huetteman from Washington, and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Having Won, Boris Johnson and \u2018Brexit\u2019 Leaders Fumble", "Date": "2016-06-28", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 With their giddy celebrations of \u201cindependence day\u201d having given way to political and economic turmoil, one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union: They had no plan for what comes next.The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or \u201cBrexit.\u201d But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign.In changing their tune, the leaders of the anti-European Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union \u2014 which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week \u2014 would be available to help finance the National Health Service.For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services.Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and right-wing groups like the U.K. Independence Party eager to build support.\u201cThere is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010.\u201d\u201cIt is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cI do not believe that is so.\u201dSuggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, \u201cBritish people will still be able to go and work in the E.U.; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down.\u201dNot only that, he asserted, \u201cThere will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market.\u201dWhat he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in decision-making.But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member.Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his free-market economic credentials.But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. \u201cI worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,\u201d he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right.The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, \u201cRemain,\u201d against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U.K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics.\u201cThere was no coherence, because it wasn\u2019t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,\u201d he said.Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of free-market economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said.\u201cAnd now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a one-party government that must reflect the schism in itself,\u201d he said.In the aftermath of the Leave campaign\u2019s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp\u2019s plan.The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: \u201cThere is no plan. The Leave campaign don\u2019t have a post-Brexit plan.\u201d Then the legislator added, \u201cNumber 10 should have had a plan,\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Favors at Fort Surrender: New Twist in History of Police and Borough Park", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkNew York, like most places of human habitation, has a long history of bribery, but until now the literature did not reveal any documented episodes in which the graft was packaged as Christmas presents and delivered by two Orthodox Jewish businessmen dressed up as elves.Mayor Bill de Blasio had absolutely nothing to do with the Christmas presents, but it is his unique fate to have taken political contributions from the two businessmen. The federal complaint lays out a dynamic in which gifts and bribes were provided by the men to the police commanders in direct exchange for favors they sought.The two men have ties to a neighborhood where the ambitions of police commanders depend on their ability to maintain cordial relationships with elements of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.Generations of Brooklyn commanders, particularly in the precincts serving Borough Park and Crown Heights, have made or broken their careers by doing the right favors.One night in December 1978, hundreds of Hasidic protesters swarmed into the 66th Precinct station house in Borough Park, destroyed a Teletype machine, flung thousands of files onto the floor and got into a pitched battle with police reinforcements summoned by the four officers who were overwhelmed by the mob.A T-shirt was created by patrol officers with a new nickname for the precinct: Fort Surrender.In the same neighborhood two decades later, on an evening in June 1997, thousands of Hasidim chased off deputy sheriffs who had gotten into a scuffle with a scofflaw whose car they were trying to tow. However, the two-star police chief in charge of Brooklyn South, George Brown, refused to immediately release the young man from custody, despite the demands of community leaders and politicians.However essential, compromised or straightforward the relationships were between police commanders and community leaders, the kind of gross bribery charged in the complaint was never part of the picture. Police commanders responded to political leaders, who in turn saw reliable voting blocs that did not need to be wooed with costly advertisements or get-out-the-vote campaigns.If the criminal complaint is to be believed, the two men at the center of the case, Jeremiah Reichberg, 42, of Borough Park, and Jona S. Rechnitz, 33, sought favors like police escorts through traffic, harassment of rivals, help with arrests, intervention in business disputes and placards for parking privileges.In exchange, they delivered gifts like video game systems as Christmas presents to the homes of senior commanders, or flew them on trips to Las Vegas, or treated them to family vacations. One episode of currying favor is said to have involved hiring a security firm owned by the family of a police executive at One Police Plaza.The charges are sordid. The two businessmen were involved in these relationships, according to the indictment, well before Mr. de Blasio took office. With the departure of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who used his personal fortune to fund his political ambitions, the businessmen turned their attention to Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Rechnitz served as a member of his inaugural committee and later gave $102,300 to a political action group allied with the mayor.Mr. de Blasio has said he raised money to advance a liberal agenda in the State Legislature.What the two men sought or received from his administration, if anything, is not known.\u201cLook,\u201d Mr. de Blasio told reporters last week of Mr. Rechnitz, \u201cI wish I never met the guy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Schools Punished Teenagers for Being Victims of Sexual Assault, Complaints Say", "Date": "2016-06-07", "News": "Supported byThe New York City Education Department has a pattern of discrediting and punishing victims of sexual assault, particularly if they are black and poor, according to two complaints filed in recent days with the United States Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.One of the complaints, filed on June 1, states that on Feb. 5, a 15-year-old girl with developmental delays and an I.Q. of 71 was walking through a hallway at Teachers Preparatory High School in Brooklyn when seven boys confronted her and directed her into a stairwell. There, the complaint says, two of the boys forced her to perform oral sex on them while the others watched.Six days later, the girl reported the encounter to a guidance counselor and was interviewed by administrators and police officers, the complaint states. According to a report made by an assistant principal in the city department\u2019s Online Occurrence Reporting System that day, included in the complaint, the girl said that one of the boys \u201cgrabbed her face\u201d and made her perform oral sex on him.The next day, however, the assistant principal interviewed the girl again, this time in the presence of one of the boys who had watched the encounter. Based on that interview, the assistant principal concluded that the sex had been consensual and updated the online occurrence report to say that \u201cupon further investigation\u201d the student \u201cadmitted it was a consensual act not forced.\u201d As a result, the girl was given a suspension for six days for engaging in sexual acts on campus.After a hearing a month later, the suspension was withdrawn and the city Education Department said it would be expunged from her record. But the complaint says that the student\u2019s mental health and academic performance have suffered, and that she lives in fear both of retaliation by her assailants and of the prospect that school \u201cadministrators will again seek to punish her for another imaginary crime.\u201dThe second complaint, filed on June 4, states that on Nov. 5, a 13-year-old student at Middle School 584 in Brooklyn was between classes when a male student punched her in the genital region, causing her to fall. The male student then simulated sex on top of her, with her arms pinned to the ground and her school uniform riding up.The male student was suspended for a month and then returned, at which point the girl became afraid to go to school, the complaint states. Despite the school\u2019s claim that it would separate the students, it did not, and they had three classes, as well as lunch, gym and music, together. The girl\u2019s mother sought a safety transfer, but rather than expedite the request, the department took nearly seven weeks to find a new school for her, the complaint asserts. One school to which the girl wanted to transfer, which her sister attended, required an audition, and she was rejected. Two other schools that department officials at first suggested might take her subsequently said they could not enroll her. The complaint said the girl might be forced to repeat her grade because of the number of days of school she missed while waiting to be transferred.The complaint filed in November states that on April 2, 2015, a 13-year-old girl who was in eighth grade at Spring Creek Community School was waiting for the bus after school when a male student dragged her into an alleyway and sexually assaulted her, forcing her into anal and oral sex. The male student made a video of the encounter and subsequently disseminated it among other students, and the girl, who was already traumatized by the assault, became the subject of taunts and harassment, the complaint says. In response, the school principal told the girl to stay home from school because her presence would only \u201cmake things worse,\u201d the complaint says. She missed nearly a month of school before a safety transfer was approved.Ms. Goldberg said in an interview that when she filed the first case, she thought it was an aberration, but after learning about the two other cases, she now believes there is a pattern within the city\u2019s Education Department of indifference to the needs of black victims of sexual assault.The department has one coordinator responsible for ensuring the district\u2019s compliance with Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in federally financed schools. Ms. Goldberg called that inadequate.In the two recent complaints, Ms. Goldberg asked the federal Education Department to conduct a joint investigation with the Department of Justice into whether the city\u2019s Education Department violated Title IX by depriving the students of the benefits of an education and retaliating against them for making complaints of sexual assault. She also asked the federal Education Department to review the adequacy of the city\u2019s Title IX resources and mandate that the city department publicly release statistics regarding the number of sexual assaults that are reported, the number of cases that are investigated, their outcomes, and the frequency of victims\u2019 being transferred.A spokeswoman for the city department said school staffs were trained in the department\u2019s policies on sexual assault reporting.\u201cOur legal team is reviewing these deeply troubling complaints and will respond to the Office for Civil Rights regarding any pending matters,\u201d the spokeswoman, Devora Kaye, said. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of all students and staff, and we have policies in place that ensure that incidents are reported, investigated and appropriately addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "4,223 Central Park Benches With Stories to Tell", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byIn the park, there are 9,485 of them. You sit on them. To rest. Read a book. Sip coffee. Polish off a pulled-pork sandwich. Feed the pigeons. Wait for a friend, maybe a spy. Or it\u2019s a sluggish day when you have nothing to do, and this is a delicious place to accomplish absolutely nothing.Or you can drift off and muse on the plaque affixed there, representing a story behind the bench. The Central Park bench. You aren\u2019t just sitting on wood. You are sitting on memories.There is, for instance, a bench on the Mall that reads, \u201cTwo Red Foxes and a Pup.\u201dWhat could that possibly mean?It means this. Last year, Karen May wanted to adopt a bench as a surprise 65th-birthday gift for her husband, Tony, a retired investment banker. She inscribed it: \u201cTony, win, lose or break even, you always have me. Love Karen.\u201d When their two sons were young and he came home from his work on Wall Street, they would rush to greet him and ask, \u201cHey, Poppy, did you win, lose or break even?\u201d And he would reply that he broke even, because that was what much of life was about, breaking even.While Ms. May was so inclined, she figured she would adopt an adjoining bench for her children.When her elder son, Theodore, proposed to his girlfriend, Lucinda, he wrote a brief children\u2019s book for her called \u201cTwo Red Foxes,\u201d because foxes were a recurring theme in her upbringing (as when a fox sped across the field when her father proposed to her mother). The foxes were stand-ins for Ms. May\u2019s son and his fianc\u00e9e. And there was the fact that her younger son, Thornwell (Ms. May\u2019s maiden name), went by the nickname Pup.So she adopted the benches and engraved them with memories. People will sit there and not know. But she knows.If you can afford it, it\u2019s simple enough. Pay $10,000 (it began at $5,000) and you get to put a plaque on a bench, saying almost whatever you want (within limits of decorum: no cursing, no advertising), up to a suggested maximum of four lines of 30 characters each. And then it\u2019s there forever.Ms. LaMorte consulted her tablet for the latest count: 4,223 of the benches adopted. About 250 go each year, she said. While plenty of benches remain unadopted, some areas are sold out. For instance, all the benches facing the lake. The ones lining the Mall. Those near the Great Lawn. Those along Wien Walk.There are three styles of benches: the simple wood-and-concrete version; the World\u2019s Fair style, with its circular armrests, dating to 1939; and the Central Park settee, based on the benches used during the park\u2019s creation, circa 1858. There are also several dozen handmade rustic benches. With those, you have to fund a restoration of an entire park area and the cost starts at about $500,000, not something to rush into.Quite often, Ms. LaMorte said, benches are adopted to remember a relative or friend who has died. Or on occasion, a pet, generally a dog, though a few cats are honored as well. Something like 840 of the plaques have \u201cmemory\u201d in their wording. There are some Sept. 11 remembrances.Three years ago, a woman chose a bench in memory of herself for when her final date comes. It hasn\u2019t yet. The plaque, set to go, sits in one of Ms. LaMorte\u2019s desk drawers.Increasingly, Ms. LaMorte said, \u201cwe have more plaques that are happy.\u201d Graduations or birthdays or birth wishes or wedding gifts. A Japanese couple, when they returned to Japan after a lengthy stretch in the city, adopted a bench that reads: \u201cWe leave our hearts in New York after 23 years of our adventure here.\u201dThere are a lot of benches in the playground areas commemorating births. One man adopted five benches, one for each of his grandchildren, who received them on their 16th birthdays.Last year, Victor Schiller required a birthday present for his wife, Nancy. She told him, emphatically, no jewelry, thereby ruling out his go-to category.He thought and thought, and then he had it. Give her one of the benches.They didn\u2019t even live in New York. They lived in Charlottesville, Va., but they had bought a place in Manhattan that they inhabited roughly a week each month. They think Central Park is truly wonderful. Mr. Schiller, 59, is retired from creating technology start-ups. Ms. Schiller, 57, is retired from investment work focused on Bulgaria.He gave her the bench, and was she happy. He waited on the inscription so she could have a say. They conferred and agreed on: \u201cWe Would Make the Same Mistake All Over Again! Vic & Nancy Schiller. Still Best Friends.\u201dThey did not reveal what the mistake was. Understandably, their three mystified children asked them, but lips sealed. Each has guessed, Umm, did you mean me? Well, of course not. No!Was it waiting so long \u2014 11 years \u2014 to have children? Wrong.How about buying the apartment in New York? Incorrect, not even close.So they don\u2019t know.That\u2019s what reporters are for. To crack open mysteries, shine flashlights into dusty corners. Sometimes that\u2019s very hard. Other times, less so. In this case, the Schillers were ready to give it up. It was possible to find out in the most ordinary way \u2014 by asking them.The two met when she was 20 and he was 22. They got engaged a year later. Mr. Schiller called his mother to break the good news. His mother dropped the phone. When she calmed herself enough to pick it up, she told him, \u201cYou\u2019re making a big mistake!\u201dMs. Schiller called her mother. Her mother said, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dThose withering cautions, of course, are what mothers are legally required to say. And, of course, 20-somethings are under well-established protocol to ignore them.Which is what the Schillers did.

A few at the beginning were handled by others, but since then they\u2019ve been all his doing.In the stinging sun the other day, he was out getting it done on a bench in the Ramble. As usual, the park was bubbling with activity. Wordlessly and with focused attention, he lined up a spot in the direct center, meticulously routed out a hole, then screwed in the plaque. Four screws. In less than 10 minutes, he was done. The inscription read: \u201cYou are the image of the rose shining within me like the flame within a lamp \u2026,\u201d a line modified from \u201cThe Little Prince.\u201dMr. Young paints the benches too, spiffs them up, fixes them when weather chews them up.He came to New York from Birmingham, Ala., after the plant he worked in, making slats for train boxcars, shut down. Not long after he got to New York, he was riding in an elevator and noticed that it passed the 12th floor and then went to 14. No 13th floor. The unlucky thing.Now wait a minute, Mr. Young thought, I was born on the 13th. On a Friday no less. To him, it\u2019s a lucky number. So he went to a dentist and had a front tooth plated with gold and 13 engraved on it. He likes to play the numbers. Every day for 25 years, he has played 1313 at $5 a pop. Never hit, but he keeps at it.How did he like his work? \u201cI just love the park,\u201d he said. \u201cBest place to be. Since I\u2019m from the South, it reminds me of home.\u201dOnce he put on a plaque that a man had ordered to propose to the woman he was dating. The man must have missed some important signals. Her answer was a flat no. Benches aren\u2019t returnable. Lou Young had to remove the failed plaque and replace it with one bearing nonmatrimonial expectations. (You can always change your plaque, but that\u2019s another $1,000.)One day about 10 years ago the Bench Guy was out in earnest with newly arrived plaques. He had one to do at the southwest corner of the Great Lawn. He screwed it on, then took a look and saw it said Louis Young. He thought, \u201cInteresting, this guy has the same name as me.\u201dTurned out, one of the recurrent donors to the park, who had adopted 18 benches and given them as gifts, had gotten to know and admire Lou Young from watching him do his bench work. So she gave him a bench.The plaque reads: \u201cLOUIS YOUNG FOR HIS CARE AND DEDICATION TO CENTRAL PARK SINCE 1985.\u201dIt\u2019s not cheap to adopt a bench; you could buy a decent used car for the cost. But there is fund-raising. Nicole Vest battled leukemia for two and a half years before she died in February 2015. She was 34. Her family and friends debated what to do to honor her memory. She was cremated, and there was no place to go and pay respects. Someone suggested a bench, and everyone liked that idea.They set up an appeal on a fund-raising website. Family and friends chipped in, as did others, people who had never met Ms. Vest but knew one of her friends or relatives. The effort kicked off on March 10 of last year. It attained its goal by April 1. About 90 people donated, some giving as little as $20. They adopted a bench just north of the sailboat pond.What to put on it? They wanted something original. \u201cI didn\u2019t want something that was used all the time, like beloved sister and daughter,\u201d said Michelle Lapworth, Ms. Vest\u2019s sister.Ms. Vest loved butterflies. She had a butterfly tattoo on her ankle, wore a butterfly necklace. Her best friend found a quotation from Hans Christian Andersen, and that met with approval. \u201c\u2018Just living is not enough,\u2019 said the butterfly. \u2018One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.\u2019 In Memory of Nicole E. Vest 1981-2015.\u201dAnother story, pet included. When Chris Branca died much too young in an accident at 33 last April, his family wanted to remember him with a bench. They also wanted to remember his dog.Buddha, a bulldog, had died a year earlier. Mr. Branca delighted in going to the park with Buddha. He lived further downtown. He drove there with Buddha. He was particularly fond of the Sheep Meadow.Dogs are prohibited from the grass there. Nonetheless, that expanse beguiled Mr. Branca. Weekend after weekend, he went there with Buddha. \u201cHe would get a ticket all the time and just pay it,\u201d said Lindsey Branca, his sister. \u201cThat was his personality. He was a little bit defiant.\u201dSo, the family, which runs a real estate company, adopted adjoining benches, one for Mr. Branca and one for Buddha.Mr. Branca was an abiding fan of Maurice Sendak\u2019s \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are.\u201d With great frequency, he wore a Wild Things T-shirt. His best friend suggested a Wild Things line that was adapted for the inscription: \u201cFor Chris Branca. In all of us there is Fear, Hope and Adventure. In all of us there is a Wild Thing.\u201dThe adjoining bench bears the plaque: \u201cFor Buddha Branca Chris\u2019s Bulldog forever by his side.\u201dA memorial service was held at the benches. Some 80 people attended. Subsequently, friends have visited the benches, taken pictures, sent them on to the family.A few weeks ago, his mother went to check on the benches and two of his childhood friends were sitting on them, chatting away. She sat down, slipped into the conversation. Another time, she looked in on the benches and a high school friend of Mr. Branca\u2019s was resting there. It turned out that he was in town visiting. He lives in Puerto Rico.Benches. Benches. Benches. They can serve many purposes. He came to New York from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. She arrived from St. Petersburg, Fla. They met in March 2014, at a friend\u2019s birthday party. Chrissy Crawford made such an impression on Enrique Corredor that on the way home in a cab, he texted her to ask her out. Things went excellently from then on.As a boy he used to play in the park, dissolving into the Ramble. For years, he had had a dream that when he proposed to a woman, he would do it with one of the benches whose inscriptions he read. Right where he used to play. He just needed the woman.Now he was set.What to put on it? He trawled the internet, looking up love poems, romantic sayings. \u201cI was surprised, but some of the best love lines were in letters written by Henry Kissinger,\u201d he said.Yes, of course.Nonetheless, he kept going. He came across something from \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d Rhett Butler proposing to Scarlett O\u2019Hara: \u201cSay you\u2019re going to marry me. Say yes. Say yes.\u201d Ms. Crawford was from the South. That would do it. He altered it somewhat and made the plaque: \u201cMy dearest Chrissy. Say you will marry me. With all my love and promise. Enrique. June 2015.\u201dHe picked a day for the surprise. He had gotten the engagement ring of Ms. Crawford\u2019s grandmother that he was going to use. But it rained. He had to push it back. He didn\u2019t know, but the new date was the wedding anniversary of her grandmother.He suggested they run in the park. Ms. Crawford made it clear they had to leave by a certain time, for she had a business meeting. She has an online art gallery. He is an investment banker.They ran. \u201cHe kept stalling and wanting to walk around and get coffee, explore,\u201d she remembered. \u201cI was so angry with him by the time we got to the bench.\u201dHe told her, \u201cHey, Chrissy, look at that bench.\u201d The anger dissipated. He dropped to his knee. She said yes.It was an expensive way to propose, considering it can be done free, but he didn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have to pay for an engagement ring, so I get off on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I looked on it as a creating an heirloom. Leaving our mark on the city.\u201dSomething like 43 million people visit the park every year. Once a month or so, the couple will swing by, sit on the bench, their bench, and amid the park\u2019s placidity, contentedly gaze at the humanity filing past, and feel good.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Needs Help That Only Congress Can Provide", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Given the dismal employment report for May, released on Friday, it would be cruel and unusual for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. The report is more evidence that the economy is already slowing; it clearly does not need the Fed to tap the brakes by raising rates.What it needs is for Congress to step up with federal investment and federal spending now, when borrowing costs are still low and when consumers and businesses are clearly unable to generate full employment.The economy created 38,000 jobs in May, the worst monthly tally since employment began to recover from the recession, back in 2010.Taking a broader view, job growth has been decelerating for the past year, from a monthly average of 200,000 over the past 12 months to an average of 116,000 over the past three months.The news on unemployment last month was also bad. The jobless rate dropped, from 5 percent in April to 4.7 percent, but not because of more hiring. It fell because people left the labor force \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a sign that job opportunities are lacking. A decline in the size of the work force does not signal a sudden national attack of laziness and, in this case, it does not signal retirements: The recent decline has occurred among people ages 25 to 54.Worse, the numbers for May would have been even weaker but for the fact that 470,000 people took part-time jobs last month, even though they needed and wanted full-time work. Involuntary part-time status signals hardship for individuals and wasted human capital in the broader economy. In all, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underemployment rate remains stuck at 9.7 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an elevated measure of distress and lost potential.In previous eras, before Republican majorities in Congress devoted themselves solely to thwarting the White House, stewarding the economy with federal fiscal policy was known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpriming the pump\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009claying a foundation for growth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was one of the acknowledged duties of Congress. It still is a congressional duty, but one that has gone willfully unmet.The economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural resilience can overcome some congressional intransigence. But over time, it will not and cannot overcome the drag of sustained poor stewardship.That is not to say that bolstered federal investment in the economy is a cure-all or that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican-led Congress is wholly to blame for the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems. But it is wholly to blame for not doing what only it can do to foster a fair and flourishing economy.Only federal investment can repair and modernize the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s infrastructure, provide financing to hire more teachers, support basic scientific research and combat climate change \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of which would create good jobs today and prosperity in the future.The alternative is the deteriorating status quo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Russian Oil Company Is for Sale \u2014 Again", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 For sale in Russia this summer: one repossessed asset, well loved and maintained. Seller is motivated. Everything must go.In this fire sale, the asset is Bashneft, the oil company once owned by Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, who was prosecuted and put under house arrest. And the seller is the Russian state, in desperate need of cash.At the right price, investors will bite. But the sale, and dozens of others taking place around the country, will reinforce Russia\u2019s reputation in the global markets for uncertainty.Early in his tenure, President Vladimir V. Putin pursued a policy of controlling the so-called commanding heights of the economy with a nationalization push that elbowed Russian and foreign owners out of strategic industries. Now, he is inviting investors back, as Russia faces the economic fallout from a second year of Western sanctions and low commodity prices.The political about-face, part of the seemingly endless cycle in Russia between nationalization and privatization, adds to investors\u2019 worries about being blindsided.In the early post-Soviet period, privatization was viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But those opportunities are just happening over and over again under Mr. Putin.Bashneft is coming full circle. Bashneft, Russia\u2019s sixth-largest oil company, was first privatized in a series of sales in the early 2000s. Then it was renationalized in 2014 when Mr. Yevtushenkov was put under house arrest. Now, it is for sale again.\u201cAny buyer today should understand the risks,\u201d Aleksandr Y. Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said of the latest planned resale of 51 percent of Bashneft. \u201cIn a few years, this deal, too, could be unwound for one reason or another.\u201dSuch uncertainty is a big reason investors remain wary of Russian stocks.Consider the differing perceptions of Brazil and Russia. Both developing countries are big commodity exporters facing serious economic headwinds. But investors are willing to pay only about half as much for a Russian company as they would for a Brazilian business with the same earnings potential, according to Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank.Illustrative of Russia\u2019s stock troubles is Gazprom, the state-controlled oil giant that was once the country\u2019s biggest company. Gazprom\u2019s market value was $52 billion on Tuesday, down from its peak in May 2008 of $367 billion.Russia\u2019s mighty oil, mining and industrial holdings looked like a good deal in the early 1990s during the transition from communism to capitalism. The government tried to create a society of stockholders out of the Soviet ashes by giving everyone vouchers representing shares in state-owned businesses. But the chaotically run effort largely flopped.Hard up for money ahead of an election in 1996, President Boris N. Yeltsin tried a new tack of catering to rich insiders. He sold companies on the cheap to a new class of wealthy Russians.After Mr. Putin assumed power on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1999, he vowed to eliminate these oligarchs \u201cas a class.\u201d Three years later, police arrested Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, then Russia\u2019s richest man as owner of the Yukos oil company, bought in the sale under Mr. Yeltsin.The primary pumping asset became Rosneft, the state oil company. Rosneft was partly privatized; the state sold 13 percent on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.Foreign investors have been hurt, too.In 2006, Russian regulators forced the Western oil giant Shell to sell a 25 percent share in its valuable Sakhalin Island field after threatening to shut it down for environmental violations. The threat went away after Gazprom, the state gas giant, gained control of the field.It was Shell\u2019s second run-in with the Russian agenda. The company\u2019s oil assets in the country were nationalized in 1918, and Shell was only partly compensated by the Soviet government.Bashneft\u2019s story is perhaps one of the most tangled.In 1993, the Russian government transferred Bashneft to the regional government of Bashkortostan, at a time when Mr. Yeltsin was trying to curry favor with local leaders. In the early 2000s, the regional government sold shares to a company owned by local elites, Ural-Invest. In the years after, Mr. Yevtushenkov steadily picked up shares through a holding company called Sistema, in deals that were certain to have been approved by the Kremlin, according to oil analysts.Then the government changed its mind. In 2014, prosecutors asserted that the company\u2019s original transfer \u2014 21 years before \u2014 to a regional government had been illegal. So all subsequent transactions were voided.Mr. Yevtushenkov was ensnared by the flurry of criminal and civil cases that followed. His shares were handed over to the state.Mr. Yevtushenkov was finally cleared in a ruling late last year. Sistema won $950 million in a lawsuit against the previous owner, Ural-Invest. A spokesman for Sistema declined to comment.Russia\u2019s view of Bashneft has changed, too. Mr. Putin in April removed Bashneft from a list of so-called strategically important companies, despite substantial proven oil reserves of 2.2 billion barrels. The move clears the way for the company\u2019s potential sale to overseas investors.The for-sale signs are broadly up again. Along with Bashneft, the government plans to offer shares in Sovcomflot, a shipping company; Alrosa, a diamond mining company; VTB, a state bank; and Rosneft.Investors are already sniffing around. Russian oil companies, one run by a former chief executive of Rosneft, have announced plans to bid for Bashneft. Executives and government officials in India and China have said the countries\u2019 energy giants are potentially interested in buying shares in Rosneft.The government needs money to cover a portion of Russia\u2019s projected deficit this year of 2.4 trillion rubles ($36 billion), up from 1.95 trillion rubles ($31 billion) last year. And the privatization push is one of the few ways for the government to raise money.Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis make it difficult for Russia to hold bond sales, a common method for governments to cover budget shortfalls. While the United States Treasury has not specifically outlawed Russian bond deals, it has told American banks not to underwrite them.At a meeting of presidential economic advisers last month, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former minister of economy, suggested that the Kremlin spur growth by easing international tensions, as another option along with privatization. Mr. Putin responded that Russia would not \u201cbargain with its sovereignty.\u201dRussia insists that the government will do better this time around with the privatization plan. Dmitry Pristanskov, head of the Federal Agency for State Property, who is overseeing the effort, said the early post-Soviet sales were partly rolled back because corruption had tainted the process.\u201cAt the time, 25 years ago, there was no clear criteria for choosing an investor,\u201d Mr. Pristanskov said. He said the state now carefully vetted potential buyers for criminal ties or flaws like weak compliance departments, limiting the risk that deals will fall apart later. \u201cThis is exactly what we do differently today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
