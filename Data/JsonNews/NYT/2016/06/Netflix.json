{"Headline": "Ready to Form! Three Animated Reboots for Kids", "Date": "2016-06-09", "News": "Supported byCritic's Notebook\u201cVoltron\u201d had a moment of trendiness in the mid-1980s, and now this mildly humorous action franchise is being dusted off by Netflix in an 11-episode series available Friday. There\u2019s an hourlong origin story (the other installments are 22 minutes each) that tells how five teenagers become the pivotal line of defense against nasty-looking space invaders.The five are destined to pilot giant robotic lions, machines whose questionable aerodynamics make you wonder whether a child influenced by the original \u201cVoltron\u201d grew up to design the Pontiac Aztek. Purists will notice differences from the 1980s version, mostly in which character is piloting which lion. Also, in an age of more diverse kiddie-show casting, it\u2019s jarring that all five heroes are guys.But there is a female presence, Princess Allura. There is also a strong team-building message, since the five robots are at their most formidable when they join together and form the titanic Voltron. This is a show for the age of SEAL Team 6 heroism, individuality sublimated in the interest of making a powerful fighting force.At some point during each episode, one Tubby\u2019s screen is activated for a brief video featuring actual humans. In the installment \u201cBouncy Ball,\u201d the video showed toddlers at a park playing with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a bouncy ball. These videos are shot from the perspective of the show\u2019s target audience, preschoolers, with the cameras at toddler level. Often, the heads of grown-ups aren\u2019t even in the frame. Thus the children in these vignettes live in a land populated by headless giants who order them around. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201cThat can be fixed, can\u2019t it?\u201d he says by way of urging Wendy to chill out. Sure, Pete, that can be \u201cfixed,\u201d by shelling out a wad of cash for a new phone, which will also require a new, more expensive monthly plan, and let\u2019s not even get into how Wendy is going to salvage all her contacts, apps and old text messages. Next to this e-catastrophe, dealing with Captain Hook will seem like a vacation.Anyway, Michael makes a terrible first impression, but he grows more tolerable by the second episode (also showing Sunday), and the series is colorfully drawn and generally harmless.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.The European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.The result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.The internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.But that is not how it has been playing out.\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201dThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.Until the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.In the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.But even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201dThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.And Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.How will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.Nobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201dEmail: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}

Sorry, I Blacked Out.", "Date": "2016-06-29", "News": "Supported byWe first see her covered in blood and cowering in a bathtub. Then the story jumps back to another unhappy moment, when she learns by phone that her husband is leaving her. Her response to that is to take a tire iron to his car. That\u2019s our first inkling of her violent streak, but there will be plenty more across the season\u2019s eight episodes. For instance: She\u2019s sitting in that bathtub because she may have killed someone during one of her periodic blackouts.\u201cMarcella\u201d makes you pay attention, and it makes you work to keep up. From moment to moment, that seems like a decent bargain, thanks to the taut work of the three directors, whose previous assignments include \u201cBroadchurch\u201d and the original \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d and an excellent cast \u2014 Nicholas Pinnock as Marcella\u2019s shifty husband, Sinead Cusack as his domineering boss, Harry Lloyd as a murder victim\u2019s brother, Jamie Bamber as a detective sympathetic to Marcella.Eventually, though \u2014 actually, pretty quickly \u2014 you may start feeling more disbelief than you care to suspend. Detailing the reasons would give away too much of a multistranded plot that ties together serial murder, murder for hire, real-estate machinations, family melodrama and the usual squad-room clich\u00e9s (whiteboards, forensics, expository dialogue).The biggest problem in this regard is that from very early on, you can\u2019t quite believe that Marcella is even allowed to be on the case, because she should be a suspect herself. The writers realize this and try to ease our discomfort with one of those \u201cI\u2019m going out on a limb for you\u201d speeches from a superior officer.But as her blackouts, fits of rage and violations of procedure continue, the improbability becomes impossible to look past.Marcella is portrayed as both an excellent detective and a basket case in a way that doesn\u2019t add up (despite the past traumas that are introduced as explanations), and her blackouts feel like plot devices, there just to keep things mysterious. After the season finale, you may find yourself just as much in the dark as Marcella.Advertisement"}

But has terrorism achieved its other goal, of intimidating Americans?The question itself is not simple. Americans have their individual answers. A sampling of data shows that by many measures, people say they are very concerned. But they are not acting like it.Polls suggest Americans are more concerned about terrorism than they have been in years. Soon after the San Bernardino attack, a Gallup survey found that 16 percent of respondents said terrorism was the most important problem facing the country.No other problem scored higher \u2014 and it was the highest such number for terrorism in 10 years. Gallup also found in December that 51 percent of people polled said they were \u201cvery worried\u201d or \u201csomewhat worried\u201d that they or someone in their family would become a victim of terrorism, the highest reading since right after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.Attendance at live concerts sends a mixed message, at least going by figures from the Live Nation Entertainment, a large concert organizer.

{"Headline": "Greed, Passion, Lust, Betrayal, and the Olympics in Between", "Date": "2016-06-10", "News": "In Brazil, the popular TV serials called telenovelas have so tight a grip on viewers that even the Olympics on home turf take a back seat in prime time.Supported byWhen the Olympics begin in Rio during the first week of August, the eyes of the world will be watching Brazil. The eyes of Brazil, meanwhile, will be watching Camila Pitanga.On weeknights, Globo broadcasts five one-hour telenovelas, a marathon of greed, passion and freighted glances, interrupted only by two newscasts and a sitcom. The most coveted time slot is 9:15, when as many as 50 million people tune in, roughly one-fourth of the country\u2019s population. For the sake of comparison, the Oscars this year brought in 34 million viewers, a little more than one-tenth of all Americans. Of course the Oscars are an annual event. Most telenovelas, as soaps here are called, air Monday through Saturday and have a life of about 200 episodes.The shows and Globo are the national soundtrack, the running din in living rooms and restaurants, as well as countless taxis with dashboard TVs, adding an unscripted element of suspense for everyone on the road. For Grupo Globo, a multimedia goliath described as \u201cBrazil\u2019s most powerful company\u201d by The Economist, Rede Globo is an engine of profit without peer.In fact, this particular Olympic contest will be surprisingly close. And odd as it may sound, telenovelas might win.While Rede Globo is one of a handful of Brazilian television networks with the rights to air the Games, the rivals have a small fraction of the audience. And though the company will broadcast events throughout the day and parts of the night, Globo will essentially be a sports-free zone during prime time.Yes, the opening ceremony will be broadcast live. But pre-empt telenovelas between 6:30 and 10:30? No way, said Monica Albuquerque, Globo\u2019s head of artistic development. There will be breaks for highlights and results, but the schedule won\u2019t change just because the greatest athletic spectacle on earth has come to town.\u201cThe country would stop,\u201d she said, if soaps went on hiatus. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural. It\u2019s part of life. I can\u2019t imagine Brazil without soaps.\u201dWhat if some Brazilian athlete is on a tear?\u201cYou flash,\u201d she said, flicking her fingers, suggesting a blip of time for a quick update.What if the Brazilian soccer team is going to win gold?\u201cYou flash,\u201d she repeated. Then she paused for a moment, mulling it over. \u201cIf it\u2019s one episode, maybe. O.K. One episode.\u201dGlobo is just catering to its audience. Unless the topic is soccer or, to a far lesser extent, beach volleyball, Brazilians aren\u2019t especially passionate about Olympic sports. But they are gaga for telenovelas, and anyone who would like to understand the country, and its current travails, should look at the torrid affair between Brazilians and their singular take on soaps.\u201cWhat Brazil did with this format is very special and very particular, different than what you will see in the rest of Latin America,\u201d said Maria Immacolata Vassallo de Lopes, of the Center for the Study of Telenovelas at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt introduced realism. It integrated the daily lives of people in a way that is almost journalistic. It\u2019s still melodrama, but done in a realistic way.\u201dAmong those who take this job seriously is Ms. Pitanga, the actress. Not long ago, she was sitting in a sort of reading room at Globo Studios, a sprawling 17.5-million-square-foot mini-city on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s outskirts, where five or six soaps are filmed each day. This is Brazil\u2019s answer to Hollywood.Ms. Pitanga was getting ready for a wardrobe fitting and defending her character\u2019s fictional penchant for inappropriate men. \u201cDo I really need to explain love to you?\u201d she said. Asked if she was looking forward to the Games, she frowned a bit and said that it was unlikely she would catch many events. She won\u2019t have the time.\u201cWe shoot about 35 scenes a day, sometimes six days a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI just pray we\u2019ll get Saturdays off.\u201dBrazil\u2019s telenovelas range from slightly comic and family-oriented (early in the evening) to epic and sexy (later on). Aesthetically, they have more in common with bygone American evening dramas like \u201cDallas\u201d and \u201cKnots Landing\u201d than daytime perennials like \u201cGeneral Hospital.\u201d The stories sprawl, the casts are huge, and before the country\u2019s currency started declining in value a few years ago, an episode could cost the equivalent of $400,000.In a typical year, Globo produces about 2,500 hours of entertainment, the equivalent of more than 1,000 feature-length films. The shows are among the country\u2019s most successful exports, viewed in more than 100 countries, including China, Australia and Serbia.\u201cI was in Russia, visiting the Hermitage Museum in 2009,\u201d said Tony Ramos, a telenovela star for more than 50 years, often called the Robert De Niro of Brazil. \u201cSuddenly we were surrounded by Russians. In my bad English and their bad English, we talked and it was very emotional. They said, \u2018Thank you, thank you.\u2019\u201d Eventually, he said, the director of the museum rescued him.In short, the country has plenty of worries, but telenovelas are not really a way to forget them. In fact, those worries are often embedded right in the shows.Corruption and income inequality are common themes, as are racism, domestic violence, H.I.V. and red tape. Most commonly, telenovelas operate as a kind of analogue for current events.For instance, \u201cVelho Chico\u201d \u2014 the title refers to the S\u00e3o Francisco River, where the show is set \u2014 may look like a humid saga of lust, tears and unruly beards. But it is also a cautionary tale about the environment as well as a critique of contemporary politics. Much of the action revolves around a mafia-don-like figure named Colonel Saru\u00ea who is seizing land and exploiting plantation laborers.\u201cHe\u2019s basically seizing all the assets he can, to accrue as big a fortune as possible,\u201d said Joseph Straubhaar, a professor at the University of Texas and co-author of \u201cLatin American Television Industries.\u201d\u201cBrazilians will know exactly who this guy is because the country is filled with politicians like him, and some of them are pursuing Dilma now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe colonel uses violence, which in the show is kind of a stand-in for corruption.\u201dThere are purely whimsical telenovelas in Brazil, like \u201cO Mapa da Mina\u201d (\u201cThe Map of the Mine\u201d), in which the heroine has a treasure map tattooed near her buttocks. But such shows are outnumbered by the heavier fare. There was a crusading senator on \u201cRei do Gado\u201d (\u201cThe Cattle King\u201d), a ratings monster from 1997. It was so beloved that real senators angled for cameos on the show.Part of the appeal was the special effects required to present the story\u2019s combination of miracles and calamities. But beyond the spectacle, the director, Alexandre Avancini, thinks that the production caught on because it was perfectly timed.\u201cUnfortunately, we live in an era in Brazil with a lot of corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cMoses is not corruptible. He struggles against great power to change the situation. Brazilians can see a little hope in this story.\u201dRecord is privately held and does not release financial details. But Mr. Avancini said that during the show\u2019s run, the audience grew enough that the company added a third commercial break and started to run six commercials per break, instead of four. By January, all 175 episodes had aired, but Record wasn\u2019t done cashing in on this phenomenon. It was getting ready to release a \u201cTen Commandments\u201d movie.For a promo for the film, a group of children was invited one afternoon to romp around on the set, which looked like a gilded patio for a Cleopatra-themed Vogue shoot. To the surprise of the tykes, Guilherme Winter, the amiable hunk who played the grown-up Moses, stopped by. \u201cCan I join you guys?\u201d he said, sauntering up Pharoah\u2019s steps.There was a moment of baffled silence, and then the children shrieked \u201cMoses!\u201d For the next 15 minutes, they jumped on and off him as if he were a jungle gym.\u201cI thought I had lost my mind,\u201d one of the boys joyfully announced.The scrum ended with the entire frolicking bunch gathered on Pharoah\u2019s rug, staring into a Record video camera and shouting \u201cHashtag Ten Commandments!\u201d in Portuguese.Like Globo, Record is running soaps in prime time during the Olympics, including a sequel to \u201cThe Ten Commandments.\u201d The two networks, and a third called Bandeirantes, reportedly spent a total of $190 million in 2009 to buy broadcasting rights from the International Olympic Committee for both the Sochi and Rio Games. The Olympics, which are privately funded, make deals like this all over the world, providing nearly half of all revenue. Sponsorships provide most of the other half.Globo\u2019s director of sports, Jo\u00e3o Pedro Paes Leme, said the company was contractually obligated to broadcast nine hours of the Games a day, and its free channel will broadcast 10 or more hours a day. The company will far exceed that figure, he noted, when its cable sports channels become all-Olympics vehicles. But Globo has only 20 million cable subscribers. It\u2019s a niche product.You\u2019re a sports guy, Mr. Paes Leme. Couldn\u2019t you negotiate for a bit more prime-time space for the Games on Globo\u2019s mammoth, free broadcast channel?\u201cMore than being a sports guy, I\u2019m a TV guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand perfectly the importance of telenovelas.\u201dThe social conscience that defines Brazil\u2019s telenovelas began, paradoxically, with the military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. The government hounded leftist actors, writers and directors who worked in the theater and film and shut down productions it deemed inimical. With nowhere else to work, these artists turned to Globo, a safe haven because the company had a cozy relationship with the government.Globo was founded as a newspaper company in 1925 by a journalist, Irineu Marinho, and was headed for decades by his son Roberto, who led its expansion into other media. Today it includes radio stations, book publishers, magazines, music labels, film productions and dozens of TV channels.Rede Globo started a year after the dictatorship took power, and a marriage of convenience was born. The military needed a pliant broadcasting partner because it wanted to spread its vision of consumer capitalism and squelch the threat of communism. The government went as far as to sell TV sets, on credit, to citizens through its Ministry of Communications.Rede Globo provided friendly news coverage and shunned pro-democracy movements. In return it enjoyed something close to a monopoly on the medium. Critics would come to call Globo the \u201cunofficial ministry of propaganda,\u201d making it an odd place to find avowed communists, like the celebrated writer Dias Gomes. But he and others were considered the best in the business, so Mr. Marinho hired them.For the writers, it was either join Globo or cease working. In his autobiography, \u201cJust a Subversive,\u201d Mr. Gomes wrote that after he signed on with Globo, his days of being arrested and interrogated by the police ended \u2014 unless you count the time he was hauled in and asked how one of his telenovelas would end. (He refused to say.)But while Mr. Gomes and others worked for a major ally of the dictatorship, they never stopped trying to sneak social messages into their scripts. It became a game.When Silvio de Abreu, the Globo dramaturge, wrote telenovelas, he spent a lot of time in the 1970s and \u201980s trying to persuade humorless government censors in Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, that they were missing a joke \u2014 which in some cases was not actually a joke at all.\u201cI wrote a script in which I wanted to show workers striking, which was totally forbidden,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSo I had a boss at this factory who demands that all of the women come to work in high heels, because high heels are more elegant. Well, none of the workers want to wear high heels, of course \u2014 they work at a factory. So they call for a strike. When I went to Bras\u00edlia they said, \u2018You\u2019re telling people it\u2019s O.K. to strike.\u2019 I said: \u2018No. The situation is absurd. It\u2019s a joke, obviously.\u2019 And they said, \u2018O.K.\u2019 And that\u2019s how I showed a strike on television.\u201dMillennials are slightly less devoted to the shows, which is one reason that ratings for the network have declined slightly over the years. But broadband and cable have been slow to spread, so potential rivals, like Netflix, have yet to make real inroads. Last year, Carta Capital, a left-leaning magazine based in Rio, estimated that an astounding 60 percent of all advertising expenditures in Brazil were spent on Globo television channels.After passing through security, visitors to the grounds, located in a forested suburb of Rio de Janeiro called Jacarepagu\u00e1, are greeted by a statue of Roberto Marinho. Around him is a sprawling collection of indoor and outdoor sets, along with a medical center, banks, restaurants, 100,000 costumes, 87,000 props and 9,000 employees ferried around by a fleet of microbuses and electric cars.A daylong trip around the studio is like a tour of Brazil that ranges through time, terrain and every stratum of society. It includes a few acres of a favela \u2014 the classic Brazilian urban slum \u2014 built for a telenovela called \u201cA Regra do Jogo\u201d (\u201cThe Rule of the Game\u201d). The place was so detailed, right down to the cat\u2019s cradle of overhead electrical wires, it seemed weird that nobody lived there.A 10-minute minicar drive away, a small town from the 18th century was under construction, the setting for \u201cLiberdade, Liberdade\u201d (\u201cFreedom, Freedom\u201d). The story centers on the fictional adventures of the daughter of Tiradentes, a real-life revolutionary and martyr. The director of the show, Vinicius Coimbra, pointed out the town\u2019s architectural highlights.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a church, a tavern, a city hall, a jail,\u201d he said, pointing in different directions. \u201cOver there is a slave market.\u201dThe show sounds pretty dark, but \u201cLiberdade, Liberdade,\u201d which airs five nights a week, at 11 p.m., is what millions of Brazilians watch right before they go to sleep. Its run ends a few days before the Games begin, but Mr. Coimbra would argue that the show is more attuned to the national mood than any of the coming Olympic events.\u201cPeople here are very sad,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope with this soap opera people enjoy Brazil again.\u201d When he describes his ambition, and Globo\u2019s, it could scarcely be grander: to \u201csave Brazil, despite its politics.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the first name of a Globo dramaturge who worked to sneak social messages past Brazilian government censors in the 1970s and \u201980s. He is Silvio de Abreu, not Jos\u00e9.Anna Jean Kaiser contributed to this report.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Court Backs Rules Treating Internet as Utility, Not Luxury", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byThe decision affirmed the government\u2019s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision.The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers.The court\u2019s decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online.\u201cAfter a decade of debate and legal battles, today\u2019s ruling affirms the commission\u2019s ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections \u2014 both on fixed and mobile networks \u2014 that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future,\u201d Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement.The two judges who ruled in favor of the F.C.C. emphasized the importance of the internet as an essential communications and information platform for consumers.\u201cOver the past two decades, this content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie,\u201d wrote David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan, the judges who wrote the opinion.But the legal battle over the regulations is most likely far from over. The cable and telecom industries have signaled their intent to challenge any unfavorable decision, possibly taking the case to the Supreme Court.AT&T immediately said it would continue to fight.\u201cWe have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court and we look forward to participating in that appeal,\u201d said David McAtee II, the senior executive vice president and general counsel for AT&T.For now, the decision limits the ability of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon to shape the experience of internet users. Without net neutrality rules, the broadband providers could be inclined to deliver certain content on the web at slower speeds, for example, making the streams on Netflix or YouTube buffer or shut down. Such business decisions by broadband providers would have created fast and slow lanes on the internet, subjecting businesses and consumers to extra charges and limited access to content online, the F.C.C. has argued.\u201cThis is an enormous win for consumers,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. \u201cIt ensures the right to an open internet with no gatekeepers.\u201dGoogle and Netflix support net neutrality rules and have warned government officials that without regulatory limits, broadband providers will have an incentive to create business models that could harm consumers. They argue that broadband providers could degrade the quality of downloads and streams of online services to extract tolls from web companies or to promote unfairly their own competing services or the content of partners.The court\u2019s ruling was a certainty for the F.C.C. Two of the three judges who heard the case late last year agreed that wireless broadband services were also common carrier utility services that were subject to anti-blocking and discrimination rules, a decision protested by wireless carriers including AT&T and Verizon Wireless.In the opinion, the two judges in favor of the rules said internet users don\u2019t feel the difference between fixed-wire broadband and mobile service. To an iPad user, whose device switches automatically between Wi-Fi and wireless networks, the government\u2019s oversight of those technologies should not differ, they said.Tech firms cheered the decision, which they said would be particularly helpful to start-ups that did not have the resources to fight gatekeepers of the web.\u201cToday marks a huge victory for the millions of microbusinesses who depend on the open internet to reach consumers and compete in the global marketplace,\u201d said Althea Erickson, the senior director of global policy at the online crafts marketplace Etsy.In a statement, the cable industry\u2019s biggest lobbying group highlighted the comments of the dissenting judge, Stephen Williams, and said that its members were reviewing the opinion. The group also said broadband legislation by Congress was a better alternative to the F.C.C.\u2019s classification of internet business as a utility.\u201cWhile this is unlikely the last step in this decade-long debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers,\u201d the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said in a statement.In his lengthy dissenting opinion, Mr. Williams called the rules an \u201cunreasoned patchwork\u201d that will discourage competition in the broadband industry.The biggest threat to broadband providers is the potential of any regulations to hurt the rates they charge for the service, analysts said. The F.C.C. has promised it will not impose rate regulations on the firms like it does for phone companies.\u201cThe pendulum has today swung a bit further in the direction of long-term price regulation,\u201d said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.The F.C.C. was divided along party lines on the rules. It began its quest for net neutrality rules in 2009, with two previous attempts at creating rules overturned by the same court.In a statement, Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner who was among a minority who opposed the regulation of broadband as a utility, urged cable and telecom firms to keep going with their legal challenge.\u201cI continue to believe that these regulations are unlawful, and I hope that the parties challenging them will continue the legal fight,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement by a cable industry lobbying group. The statement was made by the National Cable & Telecommunications Association; it was not made by the group\u2019s president, Michael Powell.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix Studied Your Binge-Watching Habit. That Didn\u2019t Take Long.", "Date": "2016-06-08", "News": "Supported byAt a time with more scripted television than ever, how long does it take to finish a season of a show?According to Netflix, not much time at all.Subscribers who finish the first season of a show generally do so in a week, Netflix says. And those viewers are dedicating a significant amount of time to do it: They watch about two hours a day.These are some of the findings from a study Netflix released Wednesday after tracking its global base of subscribers and how they watched the first seasons of more than 100 television series during a recent seven-month stretch.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten past, \u2018The binge watch, it happens!\u2019 Now we\u2019re trying to distinguish that different series are consumed at different rates,\u201d Ms. Holland said.Using median figures, the findings reveal that some shows are consumed quickly, while others are viewed at a slightly slower clip. The stuff viewers lap up? Horror and thrillers. The shows that take them slightly longer? Political dramas and sophisticated comedies.Here are some of the trends Netflix identified among first-season viewers:Examples:These kinds of shows \u201cwere truly propulsive, straight-up genre stuff,\u201d Ms. Holland said. \u201cThese are the ones that people push through much faster and not necessarily have to think about the issues or unpack all the jokes or take a break from the big drama moment.\u201dExamples:Examples:When jokes from a show like \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d are being fired at a machine-gun rate, people tend to take more time between episodes to digest them, Ms. Holland said. And the company found that with political dramas like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d viewers tend to \u201ctake a breath,\u201d she said.Netflix\u2019s study included current shows (\u201cFargo\u201d) and those off the air for some time (\u201cThe West Wing\u201d). The streaming service studied only serialized shows and programs that were globally available on the service (Netflix has more than 81 million users). The study covered viewing habits from October 2015 to the beginning of May. Subscribers who did not finish the first season of a show were not included.But Ms. Holland said the study proved to the company that, yes, Netflix viewers were inclined to binge, and reinforced the company\u2019s faith in its policy of releasing all the episodes of an original series at once.And because the study is based on rookie seasons, what happens after?\u201cThe general trend we noticed is that subsequent seasons are consumed even faster than the preceding seasons,\u201d Ms. Holland said.Advertisement"}

But this season, time becomes concrete, in the form of a cardboard and foil \u201ctime machine\u201d that the mentally unsettled Lolly (Lori Petty) builds in Litchfield prison. It\u2019s a box inside a box, a hide-out and refuge.Finding Lolly sitting inside this symbol, Healy (Michael Harney), the prison counselor, gives her a well-meaning, paternalistic speech. \u201cEveryone wants to go back in time sometimes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not possible. All we can do is make the most of right now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve tried that,\u201d Lolly says. \u201cBut traveling back in time just seemed more, you know, feasible.\u201dYes, being able to change your past is a fantasy. But, argues this furious, jam-packed and (eventually) very good season, so is the homiletic idea that you can simply turn things around by focusing on the now \u2014 especially if you\u2019re spending that now in a place that encourages the worst and squashes the best.(Speaking of things that can\u2019t be undone: spoilers for the full season lie ahead. This is your last warning, inmate.)The season\u2019s story drive comes from another lyric in that theme song: \u201cThe animals\u201d \u2014 the phrase that gives the title to the 12th and best episode \u2014 \u201ctrapped, trapped, trapped \u2019til the cage is full.\u201d Prison means having all kinds of time and very little space, and there\u2019s even less of the latter to go around now.That\u2019s because Litchfield prison, run by the for-profit company MCC, is being crammed with more women, for \u201c30 grand per head in a bed,\u201d as an executive describes the government payout. It\u2019s a mercenary operation, now staffed by mercenaries \u2014 ex-military correctional officers who see themselves as an occupying force.But while the resonances are blaring, the characters are complex. The dynamic between Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning) and the corrections officer Coates (James McMenamin) is a lesson in treating rape as an act with lasting repercussions, as she decides to forgive him for her own sake and he wavers between guilt and denial. It\u2019s messy \u2014 it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable to see her kiss him \u2014 but believable for each character.The new celebrity inmate, Judy King (Blair Brown), is another \u201cOrange\u201d character who simultaneously defies and lives up to type. She\u2019s down to earth \u2014 but not so much that she\u2019ll refuse a private room. She has a racist past, yet her contrived-for-the-tabloids smooch with Black Cindy (Adrienne Moore) leads to real, if fraught, camaraderie.The show has rotated its deep bench, letting some characters recede and others step forward. Laverne Cox\u2019s Sophia has a limited, though harrowing, arc in solitary confinement this season, while Laura G\u00f3mez finds the coal-eyed intensity in the newly revolutionary Blanca.Still, the drive to service dozens of characters leaves a lot of plot to juggle. Like many Netflix series, \u201cOrange\u201d could easily stand to be cut by 25 percent \u2014 though, granted, any given viewer would probably choose a different 25 percent.But midway through, the season comes into focus as the conflict with the guards, under the harsh Officer Piscatella (Brad William Henke), becomes not just dysfunctional but terrifying. The last two of the 13 episodes are so remarkable as to raise an aesthetic question for the age of slow-build streaming shows: Do you measure the quality of a TV season as a beginning-to-end average or by how well it ends?By the first yardstick, Season 4 is ambitious but uneven; by the latter, it\u2019s the series\u2019 best. The words of the ineffectual Warden Caputo (Nick Sandow), \u201cThis place crushes anything good,\u201d come true, as the most reluctant participant in the prisoners\u2019 fateful antagonism ends up suffocated by Litchfield\u2019s meekest guard, Bayley (Alan Aisenberg), and the most vicious \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 prosper.It all leads to a riot \u2014 a sharp contrast with the hopeful chaos of Season 3\u2019s prison break at the lake \u2014 and Dayanara (Dascha Polanco) clutching a gun in the hand that used to hold her drawing pen. You see something shift in her once-daydreamy eyes, and maybe in the series itself (which has at least three seasons left). This seems to be going somewhere new, and not somewhere uplifting.For uplift, you can only look back. The time machine returns one more time in the finale, as Leanne (Emma Myles) and Angie (Julie Lake) drunkenly decide that it\u2019s bad luck and tear it to bits. Poussey, meanwhile, gets a posthumous flashback that leaves her at the end of a charmed night in New York City, smiling and full of seeming possibility. She can\u2019t travel back in time. But at least we can.Advertisement"}

And the company sending high-definition films, which use a lot of bits, can\u2019t be charged more or discriminated against by the service providers.It is clear that the Netflixes of the world, and probably most consumers, like this decision, since it means there aren\u2019t impediments on what can be shipped and seen.Equally clear is that the service providers are not happy, since this means they can\u2019t control their biggest users, whose increasingly heavy usage can force them to make expensive upgrades.Count on an appeal, and most likely a final decision by the Supreme Court, because the concept of net neutrality touches on key philosophical and pragmatic aspects of modern life.Is fast internet service now essential, since we need it to get a job or find out when the movie is on? Is broadband so essential that companies providing it must be regulated by the F.C.C. in how they treat customers?What sort of essential commodity is the delivery of bits \u2014 is it like electricity, which is often priced against periods of peak usage? Is it like water, which must be provided at all times, but has different costs around the country based on difficulty of delivery? Is it something new?On the other side, shouldn\u2019t a company developing a new product have to consider how many bits it will be using, or other constraints it is putting on a system counted on by millions of people? When companies build a network for one purpose, and the network is overwhelmed by a new digital product that uses more bandwidth, should the old pricing rules apply?The last is not an idle question. Just as high-definition video challenges a network used to, say, text-based email, the online gaming and virtual reality systems planned by the likes of Microsoft and Facebook will likely tax most existing service providers\u2019 systems.Advertisement"}

How did we start thinking Facebook performed in the same robotic manner as the toaster?As the journalist Virginia Heffernan writes in \u201cMagic and Loss: The Internet as Art,\u201d we too often conflate the internet with the worlds of commerce or science rather than with creativity. \u201cFor years technology had seemed to be the masculine form of the word culture,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf you wanted to sell men on a culture story, you did well to frame it as a tech story \u2014 a story about the plumbing or stock price of Netflix rather than a story about the pixels that constitute \u2018Bloodline.\u2019 Technology is built stuff that aims to be elegant and engaging. Apps are founded on science in the same sense that a watercolor is founded on science, where the chemistry of pigments and the physics of brush strokes are the science. But the resulting painting, if successful, hints at transcendence or at least luminous silence, something whereof we cannot speak.\u201dHeffernan is seeking an understanding of the aesthetic and animating spark of the greatest enterprise of our time. To do that she focuses on the building blocks of the internet \u2014 design, text, images, video and music \u2014 while meditating on themes of magic and loss. For every invention destined to change everything (again!), what do we lose in the fire?We follow Heffernan through the Smithsonian Natural Museum of Internet History, as she annotates the exhibits: the Kindle, with its lithe design and endless supply of books, usurper of the printed word; the MP3, compressing the rapture and idiosyncrasies of your favorite music, destroyer of the music business and the listening experience; YouTube, standing among the smoldering wreckage of the linear-minded \u00adentertainment industries, triumphant in its mesmerizing stunts, obscure clips and unboxing videos.This could be a somber exercise, examining the ashes of Pompeii rather than glimpsing the City on the Edge of Tomorrow. But Heffernan is a gleeful trickster, a semiotics fan with an unabashed sweet tooth for pop culture, who believes we shouldn\u2019t confuse grief over the passing of our favorite technology with resentment because some digital alchemy failed to preserve analog experiences: \u00ad\u201cWhether or not we admit it, the internet and its artifacts are not just like their cultural precedents. They\u2019re not even a rough translation \u2014 or a strong misreading \u2014 of those precedents.\u201dLoss means plenty to mourn \u2014 at one point Heffernan trips into a memory hole for the cord-tangling days of gabbing on the house phone. That nostalgia feels outmoded in places, dwelling on the universality of Twitter as the network\u2019s audience stagnates, or discussing YouTube as the standard for user-created video as venues like Snapchat redefine the norms of uninhibited expression.But magic brings joy. And Heffernan is enthralled by the web, always stopping short of the techno-utopianism that leads \u201cinnovators\u201d to speed past the consequences as humanity colonizes the future. In one breath she juxtaposes the socioeconomic divide between using apps or the ad-supported web with the phenomenon of \u201cwhite flight,\u201d the next she\u2019s punctuating a theory on visual literacy with an entire paragraph dedicated to the seductive wonders of each of Instagram\u2019s filters.That\u2019s what makes \u201cMagic and Loss\u201d hold together: It embraces the internet as a work in progress.

I feel honored that they chose to tell this story with me.\u201dIn separate interviews, Ms. Wiley, the Juilliard-trained daughter of Baptist pastors, and her girlfriend, Lauren Morelli, who wrote this episode, talked about ending Poussey\u2019s life and the accompanying grief. These are edited excerpts from those conversations.Did you go into Season 4 knowing that Poussey was going to die?Samira Wiley: I did know. In no other season have I found out anything before. But I think because this is such a huge story, the writers were very kind and careful and delicate in telling me about it and making sure I was O.K. You know, the hardest thing was that none of my cast knew, and I had to keep it a secret the entire year. And I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I still can\u2019t believe I did that.What was the genesis of this story? Lauren Morelli: While it\u2019s my name on the episode, last season Jenji [Kohan, the series creator] came in feeling that telling not only a Black Lives Matter story but talking about the inherent violence of prison was really, really important. We had built to this point with the overcrowding and privatization, and we felt like we wanted to see the consequences of that.Why do you think they chose Poussey?S.W.: I heard from some of the writers that they couldn\u2019t necessarily do this with every character. That it had to be a character that people really loved and people really cared about \u2014 I\u2019m sorry [starts to cry]. Poussey comes from a loving family, and people care about her, and even her queerness her father embraced. And like a lot of young kids, she just fell into the wrong thing. But her sheer potential to actually make something of herself, and to have that stripped away \u2014 it\u2019s really powerful television.L.M.: We got into some very heated debates in the writers\u2019 room about which character it should be. And ultimately Jenji made a point that has really stuck with me, and that I\u2019ve used as my centering device throughout the season \u2014 and that is, whatever character we chose, she wanted it to feel like that character had a future on the outside of prison ahead of them, so that the loss of that future would really be felt. Her point was that would be most clearly seen through Poussey, which I completely agree with.How was it collaborating on Poussey\u2019s death scene?S.W.: I felt like I could breathe a sigh of relief. The script came off very, very beautifully.L.M.: I was beyond honored when I found out that I would get to write it, not only because it was a story that I believe in telling but also because there\u2019s a lot of trust between Samira and me. And I felt privileged that I would then get to be on set and be there for the entire cast as we went through this difficult process.How did you develop that episode?L.M.: It was important to everybody that we find a way to make it as gray as possible \u2014 like when two forces of good collide, a tragedy can result, instead of there is evil in the world and good in the world, and evil will prevail. We did flashbacks for Bayley to humanize that side of the experience. I hope it\u2019s in there that racism can be a very subtle thing. And I\u2019m hoping that the viewer walks away wondering, \u201cIf that person had been white, would they still have been on the floor that long?\u201dHow did your castmates react when they read the script?S.W.: It was crazy and overwhelming, which I\u2019d anticipated. I got a lot of calls, a lot of text messages. I remember one of my castmates telling me that we should go get a drink and mourn Poussey\u2019s life, and it didn\u2019t sit well with me. And I told her: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want to mourn. I want to celebrate her life.\u201d It\u2019s so funny talking about Poussey like she\u2019s a real person but it really feels like that.How emotional was the scene to shoot?S.W.: To be honest, that was one of the things that wasn\u2019t hard, because everyone else had just found out that this was happening. So they were all dealing with this shock that I had been dealing with for months. I had already gone through so many stages: I was mad; I was happy to be embarking on something else; I was so sad; I remember sobbing. So I felt like there was part of me that had to take care of them, to let them know that it was O.K. \u2014 that I\u2019m all right \u2014 especially that day. I couldn\u2019t sit there and cry because everyone else was.L.M.: When I finished the first draft of that last scene, I burst into tears and started sobbing, which I really didn\u2019t expect because we had been talking about it for so long. But there was something in the actual writing of that paragraph that tore me apart. So when I got to set, I had done my grieving.Any regrets?S.W.: I never had a scene with Kate Mulgrew [who plays Red], and we live across the street from each other. I\u2019ve been with her from the beginning, and I think there\u2019s a part of her that feels a little motherly, a little protective. She sent me an email after she read the script and said she needed to have me over for dinner. It was me, her, Taylor [Schilling] and Uzo. We had a night and it was beautiful, and we cried and we ate amazing food and we drank wine. And I don\u2019t know who would have known I needed exactly that other than Kate.Advertisement"}

Fugit is terrific, the show\u2019s general sense of menace and despair is striking, and at least in the first few episodes \u201cOutcast\u201d appears to have something to say beyond \u201cboo.\u201d\u2026 all day, and I want to be transfixed:Watch Season 2 of \u201cFargo,\u201d Saturday, starting at 10 a.m., FX.\u201cER\u201d and \u201cHomicide: Life on the Streets\u201d are two of the shows that taught me how and why to love TV. They\u2019re shows I watched religiously in the \u201890s, ones I\u2019ve rewatched over and over since, and those which I hold not just in nostalgic but also in present high regard. \u201cSouthland\u201d reminds me a lot of both of those shows, except that it never made much of a splash. Now it\u2019s on Hulu, though, and perhaps this is its chance.The show has a jangly, aggressive rhythm, with jumpy visuals and quick editing. Everything has an urgent, often desperate vibe, and episodes open mid-moment, jump backward in time, then work forward up through and past the opening incident. That means sometimes we know more than the characters, sometimes less, and that balance changes throughout an episode, often in surprising ways.\u201cSouthland\u201d sets itself apart from many other cop shows with its format and style, but the biggest way it reminds me of \u201cHomicide\u201d is in the depth and variety of its performances. Do you like Michael Cudlitz in \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d? Man, you should see him in \u201cSouthland,\u201d where he plays the abrasive, complicated Officer John Cooper \u2014 the show\u2019s emotional center. Do you like Regina King in \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d? If this were a just world, she would have won an Emmy for \u201cSouthland,\u201d too. Lucy Liu does a one-season arc in Season 4, and that\u2019s great, too. Come for Ben McKenzie, stay for Tom Everett Scott and Kevin Alejandro.NETFLIXAMAZON PRIMEHBOAdvertisement"}

Its two-hour debut episode drew a lackluster 1.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen data measuring live viewing and three days of delayed viewing. For the week, that viewership total put it in the neighborhood of Bravo\u2019s \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce\u201d and TV Land\u2019s \u201cYounger.\u201dIn the weeks after, the audience for \u201cVinyl\u201d fell further.

Yet another lives in the same building as a brother with whom she no longer talks.Welcome to sibling rivalry, the grown-up variety. There is no law that says we have to love the ones we were raised with, or even that we must reconcile before the grand finale. But as millions of baby boomers hit Act Three, the issue is rankling a generation that grew up believing in sharing, openness and the concept of \u00e2\u0080\u009cclosure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always thought that the psychological field does not give enough attention to the huge impact of siblings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Anna Fels, a psychiatrist in private practice in New York. She is not alone in that sentiment. Dr. Roger Gould, also a New York psychiatrist, agrees: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I think about my current caseload, every one has a strained, difficult relationship with at least one of their siblings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cReaders want to recognize themselves in fiction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Anna Quindlen, author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Valley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think most have some aspect of sibling conflict. In terms of those power relationships, there is no such thing as being grown up. At some level I will be an oldest child until the day I die.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost assume the fractures have to do with money, as parents die. What to give away, what to save or how to split? But is it really that simple?\u00e2\u0080\u009cUsually these start out being about dividing up money, but underneath, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about things the siblings have avoided for decades,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Frederick Hertz, a financial mediator based in Oakland, Calif., who is writing a book with the working title, \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I Divorce My Sister?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir childhood is such an integral part of their identity, and it sometimes becomes hard to put that aside enough to engage in practical decisions. I recently met with a brother and sister during which she stormed out saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lived off our parents for 50 years!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 All that kind of stuff comes up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That \u00e2\u0080\u009cstuff\u00e2\u0080\u009d may include one sibling feeling another was favored, thinking he or she was not defended against some form of abuse, or simply being a living reminder of disappointment and distress.When in doubt, we can always blame Mom and Dad. A 70-year-old man told me he was close to his younger brother in childhood. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sort of took on the father role. There was minimal parental praise, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say I got less bad attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the boy for whom he wrote class papers and took to the orthodontist, turned into the man who one day said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used to think you were the best and now you are the worst brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They have not spoken in 10 years.Envy also can rear its ugly head after all these years. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, my arrival signaled the end of her seven-year reign on a pedestal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a 55-year-old woman told me. A few years ago, she flew from New York to Seattle for her sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lung cancer operation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe came out of recovery, saw me, and said, without the slightest sense of gratitude, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you doing here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The act was not reciprocated when the younger sister developed breast cancer. \u00c2\u00a0She recalled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy sister said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course you would get the cancer that is more treatable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dOccasionally a bar mitzvah or wedding may bring squabbling siblings together, but then the parties tend to go back to their corners. More likely, reconciliation comes when an end is in sight. Says Dr. Gould: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhenever a crisis or death occurs \u2014 even though old wounds are opened \u2014 the rawness of the experience makes old slights irrelevant and the old image of \u00e2\u0080\u0098the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vanishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSuch occasions can prompt an effort toward reconciliation. Or not. Dr. Vivian Diller, a psychologist, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing aware that we are living longer gives some a sense of new beginnings, with new choices. The byproduct can result in leaving behind poor sibling relationships or working on ones that are worth the effort.\u00e2\u0080\u009dExperts suggest that parents encourage more family togetherness and extend equal love early on. As they grow,\u00c2\u00a0siblings should acknowledge one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flaws, which can help to lower expectations. Seeking help from therapists or mediators can bring the real issues out into the open. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do see more of a willingness to get therapy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Fels said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cProfessionals can also help people to recognize \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps even accept \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that a sibling might have legitimate mental health issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.

Here is what Nielsen found:On average, American adults are watching five hours and four minutes of television per day. The bulk of that \u2014 about four and a half hours of it \u2014 is live television, which is television watched when originally broadcast. Thirty minutes more comes via DVR.So even though ratings are falling and the broadcast networks don\u2019t quite have the glamour they used to, TV is alive and well, right?Well. That five-hour figure is 19 fewer minutes, on average, than Americans were watching two years ago \u2014 and three fewer than they watched per day last year. You\u2019re watching less TV live, but the rate of decline slowed between last year and this year.Let\u2019s break this into groups. People over the age of 50 watch the most TV, somewhere in the range of 50 hours a week, according to Nielsen. In fact, people over the age of 50 are watching more TV per week this year than last.But that\u2019s where that trend ends. People 24 and under are watching, roughly, two fewer hours of live TV and DVR programming per week than last year. And 25- to 34-year-olds (roughly speaking, millennials)? They\u2019re watching an hour less per week, down from 27 and a half hours to 26 and a half hours. People between 35 and 49 mostly held steady and are watching about 22 minutes less television per week: 36 and a half hours from nearly 37 hours a week.About 50 percent of Americans now have subscription services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu in their homes, Nielsen said. That is up from 42 percent last year. And that figure of 50 percent for the paid services equals for the first time the proportion of homes with DVR players. The DVR numbers have held steady for the past year.Tablets are now in 58 percent of American homes, a jump of 17 percent from last year (for comparison, HD TVs are in 94 percent of American homes, an increase of about 4 percent). And time spent consuming media on tablets has increased 63 percent \u2014 to 31 minutes from 19 minutes a day (in 2014, the average was 12 minutes a day).Likewise, people are spending one hour and 39 minutes a day consuming media on their phones this year, versus an hour and two minutes last year \u2014 a 60 percent jump.The amount of time you spend consuming media \u2014 watching TV, surfing the web on a computer, using an app on your phone, listening to the radio and so forth \u2014 continues to go up. Nielsen said that in 2015, Americans spent about nine and a half hours each day consuming content this way. This year?

Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel attended Apple\u2019s conference keynote in San Francisco and analyzed what matters about the announcements that Apple made.Apple announced:\u25a0 Improvements in the Apple Watch operating system.\u25a0 Changes in the operating system for Apple TV, called tvOS.\u25a0 A rebranding of its Mac operating system.\u25a0 An expansion of Apple Pay.\u25a0 Opening up Siri to developers.\u25a0 Improvements in photos and maps.\u25a0 Subscriptions through Apple News.\u25a0 Opening up its messaging service to developers\u25a0 A new interface for Apple Music.Here were the main points:That segmentation suggests Apple\u2019s worldview. This is a company that still sees the tech world as defined by separate physical devices. Sure, it will integrate these devices through some cloud-based features (including some new ones it showed today), but fundamentally each Apple device is its own, and the internet is merely the glue between them.That is a startlingly different \u2014 and, really, a kind of old-fashioned \u2014 view of tech, especially compared to the view that Google presented at its recent developer conference. In Google\u2019s view, the internet is the central operating system \u2014 it\u2019s the place where all your data and tech intelligence reside. The next era of the tech industry will be defined by which of these worldviews becomes dominantFollowing the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker, Apple expanded Siri, its voice assistant, by allowing third-party app developers to take advantage of voice controls. After Google\u2019s Photos app won fanfare with its automatic organization features, Apple announced that its photos app would have some smarter organization tools, too, like the ability to stitch photos automatically into video montages called Memories. In addition, Apple added some smarts to its Maps service, like the ability to find nearby points of interest such as gas stations \u2014 a feature long supported by Google\u2019s Waze mapping service.Apple executives have repeatedly said the company doesn\u2019t strive to be first: It prides itself on coming up with better solutions later. (The iPhone, for example, came out much later than previous smartphones.) The question is, does it pay for Apple to be late in improving its online services, which only get smarter over time?Apple essentially believes the future of the television screen will be driven by apps. Third-party apps could make the big screen smarter than the interface of standard cable boxes.With its new Mac operating system, called MacOS Sierra, Apple is putting the clout of its Mac operating system behind the Apple Watch. Users wearing the Apple Watch will be able to unlock their Macs without entering a user name or password.Apple also expanded Siri, its voice assistant, to become available in the Mac operating system. The move is a response to Google, which recently said it would expand its voice-powered virtual assistant to many products, including a chat app called Allo and a smart speaker called Home.However, it may not be easy enough to use to succeed in transforming online checkouts, where other services like PayPal have failed. Buying a product using Apple Pay on a Mac still requires you to authenticate the purchase by putting your finger on your iPhone \u2014 an extra step and extra device to pull out.The move helps Apple play catch-up with Amazon, which already lets third-party developers add capabilities to its smart speaker, Echo. Google also has said it plans to allow outside developers to make their apps and services work with its smart speaker, Home, due for release this fall.(It won\u2019t hurt the appeal to users that Apple is making emoji triple their previous size and automatically suggesting emoji replacements for words in messages.)Advertisement"}

Or maybe they seem like the less-remarked-on spread of Western democratic tropes after World War II, so that even a totalitarian state like North Korea holds sham elections to declare its government the people\u2019s will.That seems to be the case, since places like Europe worry about the big computers of Google and Amazon, but not so much about similarly sized systems inside the Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent.

In the Obama era, tech companies have been revered \u2014 Google has easy access to the White House, and many Obama staff members have gone to work for the tech industry. But both Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton seem destined to view tech more skeptically. So I wonder: Is that good?Don\u2019t you think that the tech skepticism among the major candidates reflects the bloom coming off the tech rose in general, and a yearning for a pre-internet era when everyone had good jobs and the future seemed so bright?We\u2019ve long feared that technology would eat our jobs, but platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit offer a dystopian look at what a future of fragmented employment might actually look like.

At the packed \u201cWest Wing\u201d reunion filling the 1,200-seat Paramount Theater here, Mr. Sorkin marveled at the large numbers of younger fans \u201cwho would have been in kindergarten\u201d when the show ran on NBC.\u201cThe thing about television is, you never get to see the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to finally meet you.\u201dIn ATX, Ms. McFarland and Ms. Gipson sought to split the difference between industry events like the annual Upfronts, in which networks present new shows to advertisers, and sprawling fan extravaganzas like Comic-Con, but with the mingling and general summer-camp feel of many film conferences. But unlike film festivals, intended largely to build buzz and secure distribution deals for new offerings, the idea was to blend nostalgia for old series with excitement about current and future ones.Ms. McFarland, a former assistant to directors like Betty Thomas and Nora Ephron, was working in retail when she mentioned the idea to Ms. Gipson in 2011, roughly a year before the first ATX festival. (Ms. Gipson was an assistant at Discovery Communications at the time.) Soon they reached out to industry people, whose enthusiasm led to discussions with potential sponsors and a Kickstarter campaign that exceeded their $25,000 goal. Still, it wasn\u2019t until the final day of the first festival, when various attendees announced their intentions to return the following year, \u201cwhen it was like O.K., this is going to work,\u201d Ms. McFarland said. \u201cAnd oh, we\u2019re doing this again.\u201dATX\u2019s mix of fan service with more substantive discussions offers a glimpse at the deep ties viewers form with beloved shows, across the emotional spectrum. At an old football field outside Austin, where \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d was shot, former Dillon Panthers braved the heat and posed for dozens of pictures. \u201cWe have new fans finding us every year and the old fans continue to talk about it,\u201d said Scott Porter, who played the paralyzed former quarterback Jason Street.The discussion brought up the challenges of making provocative shows that viewers want while also respecting historically marginalized fans. \u201cEvery L.G.B.T. person has that character that you first saw who you were like, \u2018Oh, this is me, and this is my story,\u2019\u201d said Megan Townsend, a representative of Glaad, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group.But \u201ceven though I\u2019m a professional in the field, I\u2019m an audience member first,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience is the same at 93 that it was when I was a kid.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jerry Seinfeld famously claims that after several minutes, his fame has no influence on his act. Mr. Burnham finds that absurd, arguing that those comics are \u201cdesperately trying to act like they haven\u2019t lost that thing they love they had when they were younger \u2014 the \u2018I\u2019m still struggling.\u2019 No, it\u2019s easier for you now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge desperate impulse from a lot of famous comedians to humanize themselves.\u201dIn his show, Mr. Burnham skewers Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d celebrity lip-sync segments, which he calls the \u201cend of culture.\u201d It\u2019s an example of the internet ethos bleeding into television. \u201cIt\u2019s the tearing down of the fake edifice of these people being better than us: multimillion-dollar beautiful people performing their own humanity for us in their $10,000 dresses,\u201d Mr. Burnham said. \u201cI think comedy is destroyed when it gets in bed with celebrity.\u201dAs his argument about the corrosiveness of fame gains momentum, Mr. Burnham stands up, his thin but no longer lanky six-and-half-foot frame jittery with energy. Pointing out the hypocrisy of rich comedians talking about airport woes, when in reality they fly private, he said: \u201cI want you to leave my show skeptical about performance.\u201dIn his special, Mr. Burnham adopts a prickly persona, establishing a tense relationship with his audience members, alternating between making them laugh and baiting, even insulting them. In part, this is rooted in a personal anxiety. Three years ago, Mr. Burnham, who considers himself a writer who fell into performance, started experiencing panic attacks before shows. This is reflected in how his special portrays the audience. \u201cIn comedy specials, the audience is always smiling and well lit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, they\u2019re a mob, faceless black entity. They are intimidating, strange and creepy. \u201cAt the end of the special, he thanks the crowd then says in a blankly affectless deadpan, \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d It is wonderfully teasing, grateful on the one hand, bitter on the other.It may be the last thing a crowd will hear from him in a many years, since Mr. Burnham says he plans to take a long break from stand-up to focus on writing, get a movie about a middle schoolgirl off the ground and avoid the stage. He added that the demands on a comic these days mean that people send him tweets asking, \u201cAre you dead?\u201d after he\u2019s been working on a special for a few years. \u201cA band can take a break but a comedian?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not on \u2018@midnight\u2019 every month you\u2019re Thomas Pynchon.\u201dMr. Burnham said he rejects the expectation of an \u201cIV drip of entertainment.\u201d At the same time, he understands how his critique of online culture looks coming from him. \u201cAs someone who hugely benefited from it and maybe bears in part the guilt of what feels like an unfair advantage,\u201d he said, referring to his peculiar career path, which skipped the usual dues-paying steps, \u201cI feel I need to expose what I know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is the showrunner someone I can see being married to for six or seven years? Is he going to be my partner in crime? And I felt that right from the first meeting with Clyde Phillips.

I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give me a crash course.\u201d So we\u2019d do tastings and talk about the different regions.

I\u2019d thought I had a little knowledge about wine. Now I realize I know nothing.Is that real wine on the set?The wine is different combinations of grape and cranberry juice.

I bought it myself, because I wanted those wine freaks out there to be happy when they watched. I had to taste it, so we had to be careful.

So we\u2019re going to do a father-daughter theater camp for two weeks.\u201cFriends\u201d is hugely popular on Netflix with millennials. Are you surprised?I\u2019m amazed by it. And it makes me wonder, will \u201cFriends\u201d have legs when my daughter is of age? What is it about the show? Is it that sense of nostalgia: \u201cWow, that\u2019s what the \u201990s were like\u201d? Could it also be that it\u2019s a show before texting and social media became prevalent, so the idea that six people could sit on a couch and talk is just so foreign an idea to young adults?

The hotel once housed literal refugees, including my family.I was 5 years old in 1950 when after a voyage on a Merchant Marine ship across the Atlantic, my parents, Marcus and Rachel Berger, survivors of the Holocaust whose Polish hometowns had been destroyed; my 3-year-old brother, Josh; and I moved into a single room in the Capitol Hall, subsidized by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.We lived there for several weeks, and my memories of that time are spare \u2014 a dark, dusty, oppressive room, walks along Broadway where we encountered other war refugees living in S.R.O. hotels, and a fistfight between my father and a man who came to kick us out of the hotel after the immigrant aid payments ended. But the Capitol Hall gave us a foothold in the country and introduced us to the cosmopolitan pleasures of the West Side, a neighborhood we were to live in for most of the next five years.The Capitol Hall has also given a foothold to Ms. Saliski and Mr. Ortiz as well as to thousands of migrants from the hinterlands. According to a history provided by organizers of the celebration held on May 24, it started life in 1913 as an apartment building with four apartments per floor. By the early 1940s the building\u2019s owners found it more profitable to cut up the apartments into narrow hotel rooms that would house the vigorous young workers flocking to New York for jobs in the wartime mobilization.In the 1950s, the Capitol Hall and scores of other hotels like the Marseilles and the Whitehall housed war refugees and, later, solitary elderly men and women, disabled people and mental patients released from state psychiatric hospitals. By the 1970s, during the city\u2019s economic downturn and near-bankruptcy, the term S.R.O. had acquired a sinister overtone, with many hotels filling up with drug dealers, prostitutes and released convicts who would frighten other tenants trying to scratch out a living and would disturb their neighbors with drunken brawls. One nearby hotel, the Endicott, was the site of several murders.By the 1980s, a wave of gentrification had spread across the brownstones and apartment houses, and hotels like the Endicott were converted to luxury co-ops. But some West 87th Street residents, among them Mig Boyle, a former tenant organizer, and her late husband, Robert Hoyt, the founder of the National Catholic Reporter newspaper, and Eric and Gillian Rosenfeld, wanted to preserve the diversity they had come to prize. They also realized that throwing the hotel\u2019s tenants out would increase the neighborhood\u2019s street homelessness.In the late 1970s, the West 87th Street 100 Block Association had arranged for social services to be provided in the hotel. They invited hotel tenants to take part in the block\u2019s annual pumpkin festival and help with spring plantings. \u201cWe got to know all the people in the hotel,\u201d Ms. Boyle said. \u201cWe totally lost the idea of us and them.\u201dWhen the landlord decided to convert the building, Ms. Boyle urged her neighbors: \u201cLet\u2019s buy it.\u201d\u201cMig comes up with these big plans and often they work out,\u201d said Mr. Rosenfeld, a lawyer, chuckling.Despite opposition from some block residents, they brought in Goddard Riverside, a neighborhood social services organization, which steered them to the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit that specialized in packaging financing for low-income housing. After a complicated struggle, financing was arranged through several government agencies and donations from foundations and private individuals. One donor was the socialite Brooke Astor, who toured the building and gave $100,000.In the three decades since, the building\u2019s upkeep and oversight have sometimes been challenging, mostly because money has been hard to come by. Ms. Saliski said that when she first moved in, the building seemed dilapidated in places. There were also complaints from neighbors of loud televisions and occasional thefts.The renovation, started in 2013, was complicated because Goddard Riverside wanted to displace no more than one-third of the tenants at a time and temporarily shelter them in other subsidized housing. Among the improvements made: A courtyard used for storing garbage was converted into a community room. Along with the physical renovation, social workers were added and weekly visits by nurse practitioners started. The renovation was paid for with a combination of city bond financing and low-income housing tax credits. Most tenants receive support from the federal Section 8 rent program; while rooms rent for $900, the tenants pay no more than one-third of their income.Projects like the Capitol Hall, said Mr. Russo, provided a model for other \u201cpermanent supported housing\u201d projects.\u201cRather than saying, \u2018Not in my backyard,\u2019 they said, \u2018Yes on my block!\u2019\u201d he said of the residents of West 87th Street.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Netflix Survive in the New World It Created?", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "FeatureIt helped to develop all the new ways we watch TV \u2014 on-demand, bingeing, mobile. But the Silicon Valley company still has to keep reinventing itself.Supported byTed Sarandos, who runs Netflix\u2019s Hollywood operation and makes the company\u2019s deals with networks and studios, was up first to rehearse his lines. \u201cPilots, the fall season, summer repeats, live ratings\u201d \u2014 all hallmarks of traditional television \u2014 were falling away because of Netflix, he boasted. Unlike a network, which needs shows that are ratings \u201chome runs\u201d to maximize viewers and hence ad dollars, he continued, Netflix also values \u201csingles\u201d and \u201cdoubles\u201d that appeal to narrower segments of subscribers. Its ability to analyze vast amounts of data about its customers\u2019 viewing preferences helped it decide what content to buy and how much to pay for it.Sarandos can be an outspoken, even gleeful, critic of network practices in his zeal to promote what Netflix views as its superior model \u2014 on-demand and commercial-free streaming, on any device. That glee was on full display in these remarks. For years, he said, \u201cconsumers have been at the mercy of others when it comes to television. The shows and movies they want to watch are subject to business models they do not understand and do not care about. All they know is frustration.\u201d That, he added, \u201cis the insight Netflix is built on.\u201dWhen Sarandos was done, Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chairman and chief executive, took the stage. A pencil-thin man, he seemed swallowed up by the empty ballroom. He squinted uncomfortably under the lights. He and a number of other Netflix executives had spent the morning at a meeting in Laguna, Calif., where a rare torrential rainstorm grounded air traffic, forcing them to make the five-hour drive to Las Vegas. They arrived only a few hours earlier. To make matters worse, Hastings was feeling ill.Haggard and tired, he stumbled irritably through his presentation. But as he neared the finale, Hastings broke out into a small, satisfied smile. \u201cWhile you have been listening to me talk,\u201d he said, reading from a monitor, \u201cthe Netflix service has gone live in nearly every country in the world but China, where we also hope to be in the future.\u201d Even though this was only a practice run \u2014 and even though it would be a long time before anyone knew whether global expansion would pay off \u2014 the Netflix executives sitting in the ballroom let out a loud, sustained cheer.They had good reason to celebrate. Netflix, since its streaming service debuted in 2007, has had its annual revenue grow sixfold, to $6.8 billion from $1.2 billion. More than 81 million subscribers pay Netflix $8 to $12 a month, and slowly but unmistakably these consumers are giving up cable for internet television: Over the last five years, cable has lost 6.7 million subscribers; more than a quarter of millennials (70 percent of whom use streaming services) report having never subscribed to cable in their lives. Those still paying for cable television were watching less of it. In 2015, for instance, television viewing time was down 3 percent; and 50 percent of that drop was directly attributable to Netflix, according to a study by MoffettNathanson, an investment firm that tracks the media business.All of this has made Netflix a Wall Street favorite, with a stock price that rose 134 percent last year. Easy access to capital has allowed the company to bid aggressively on content for its service. This year Netflix will spend $5 billion, nearly three times what HBO spends, on content, which includes what it licenses, shows like AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d and original series like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Its dozens of original shows (more than 600 hours of original programming are planned for this year) often receive as much critical acclaim and popular buzz as anything available on cable. Having invented the binge-streaming phenomenon when it became the first company to put a show\u2019s entire season online at once, it then secured a place in the popular culture: \u201cNetflix and chill.\u201dBut the assembled executives also had reason to worry. Just because Netflix had essentially created this new world of internet TV was no guarantee that it could continue to dominate it. Hulu, a streaming service jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Disney and NBC Universal, had become more assertive in licensing and developing shows, vying with Netflix for deals. And there was other competition as well: small companies like Vimeo and giants like Amazon, an aggressive buyer of original series. Even the networks, which long considered Netflix an ally, had begun to fight back by developing their own streaming apps. Last fall, Time Warner hinted that it was considering withholding its shows from Netflix and other streaming services for a longer period. John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX networks \u2014 and one of the company\u2019s fiercest critics \u2014 told a reporter a few months ago, \u201cI look at Netflix as a company that\u2019s trying to take over the world.\u201dAt the moment, Netflix has a negative cash flow of almost $1 billion; it regularly needs to go to the debt market to replenish its coffers. Its $6.8 billion in revenue last year pales in comparison to the $28 billion or so at media giants like Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. And for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being.Now that future has begun to take shape. The television industry last went through this sort of turbulence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when cable television was maturing. Previously, of course, television had been mostly transmitted via the public airwaves, and the major networks made the bulk of their money from advertising. But cable provided an indisputably better picture, and the proliferation of cable networks came to offer a much greater variety of programming. In time, consumers concluded that it was worth paying for something \u2014 TV \u2014 that had previously been free. This meant that in addition to advertising dollars, each cable channel received revenue from all cable customers, even those who didn\u2019t watch that channel. By 2000, 68.5 million Americans had subscriptions, giving them access to the several hundred channels the industry took to calling \u201cthe cable bundle.\u201dHastings knew the internet would eventually compete with that bundle, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how. And so he had to be flexible. Sarandos says that in 1999, Hastings thought shows would be downloaded rather than streamed. At another point, Netflix created a dedicated device through which to access its content, only to decide that adapting its service to everything from mobile phones to TV sets made more sense. (The Netflix device was spun out into its own company, Roku.) In 2007, even as Netflix\u2019s DVD-by-mail business remained lucrative, and long before the internet was ready to deliver a streaming movie without fits and starts, Hastings directed Netflix to build a stand-alone streaming service.So the company shifted to television. Cable networks like FX and AMC were developing expensive, talked-about dramas, the kind HBO pioneered with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Wire.\u201d But these series, with their complex, season-long story arcs and hourlong format, seemed to be poor candidates for syndication, unlike self-contained, half-hour sitcoms like \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d which can be watched out of order.Hastings and Sarandos realized that Netflix could become, in effect, the syndicator for these hourlong dramas: \u201cWe found an inefficiency,\u201d is how Hastings describes this insight. One of the first such series to appear on Netflix was AMC\u2019s \u201cMad Men,\u201d which became available on the site in 2011, between its fourth and fifth seasons. Knowing from its DVD experience that customers often rented a full season of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d in one go, Netflix put the entire first four seasons of \u201cMad Men\u201d online at once. Bingeing took off.Television networks lined up to license their shows to Netflix, failing to see the threat it posed to the established order. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like \u2018Is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?\u2019\u2009\u201d Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, famously joked back in 2010. The occasional voice warned that Netflix would become too big for the industry to control, but mostly the legacy media companies viewed the fees from Netflix as found money. \u201cStreaming video on-demand\u201d rights, as they were called, hadn\u2019t even existed before Netflix asked to pay for them. And because the networks didn\u2019t understand how valuable those rights would become, Netflix got them for very little money.Everyone seemed to be a winner, including the shows themselves. In 2012, for instance, Netflix began streaming the first three seasons of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the dark drama produced by Sony that ran on AMC. Though praised by critics, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d had not yet found its audience.\u201cWhen the folks at Sony said we were going to be on Netflix, I didn\u2019t really know what that meant,\u201d Vince Gilligan, the creator of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d told me. \u201cI knew Netflix was a company that sent you DVDs in the mail. I didn\u2019t even know what streaming was.\u201d Gilligan quickly found out. \u201cIt really kicked our viewership into high gear,\u201d he says. As Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, put it to me: \u201c\u2009\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.\u201dThis was around the time that network executives started to recognize the threat that Netflix could eventually constitute to them. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d says Richard Greenfield, a media and technology analyst at BTIG who happens to be Netflix\u2019s most vocal proponent on Wall Street, \u201cwe wrote a piece saying that the networks shouldn\u2019t license to Netflix because they were going to unleash a monster that would undermine their business.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what seemed to be happening.Worse, they realized that Netflix didn\u2019t have to play by the same rules they did. It didn\u2019t care when people watched the shows it licensed. It had no vested interest in preserving the cable bundle. On the contrary, the more consumers who \u201ccut the cord,\u201d the better for Netflix. It didn\u2019t have billions of legacy profits to protect.Yet the networks couldn\u2019t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. Negotiations between a network or a studio and Netflix became fraught, as the networks, understanding the value of their streaming rights, sought much higher fees. In some cases, those negotiations broke down. The Starz deal, for example, was not renewed after it ended in 2012. (Chris Albrecht, the chief executive of Starz, would later describe the original deal as \u201cterrible.\u201d)\u201cWe could see that eventually AMC was going to be able to do its own on-demand streaming,\u201d Hastings says. \u201cOr FX. We knew there was no long-term business in being a rerun company, just as we knew there was no long-term business in being a DVD-rental company.\u201dStill, Hastings was cautious. Producing original material is a very different business from licensing someone else\u2019s shows. New content requires hefty upfront costs \u2014 one show alone would most likely cost more than the $30 million a year Netflix reportedly once paid Starz for its entire library of movies. Developing its own series would thrust it into the unfamiliar business of engaging with producers, directors and stars. Back in 2006, the company set up a way to distribute independent films, called Red Envelope Entertainment, but it failed, and Hastings shut it down. (\u201cWe would have been better off spending the money on DVDs,\u201d he told me.) Now it was going to give original content another try \u2014 with much higher stakes.Sarandos had a show he was itching to buy: \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a political drama that was being pitched by David Fincher, the well-known director, and would star Kevin Spacey. Sarandos knew that, according to Netflix\u2019s vast database, many of the company\u2019s subscribers liked the kind of drama that Fincher and Spacey wanted to make. But algorithms alone weren\u2019t the deciding factor. He and Hastings figured that Fincher, who directed films like \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d would create a critical and popular sensation.In any case, Sarandos said, the potential reward vastly outweighed whatever financial and reputational risk \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d represented. \u201cIf it is a flop, we will have overpaid for one series,\u201d he told Hastings. \u201cBut if it succeeds, we will have changed the brand.\u201dIn winning over Fincher, Sarandos faced two other obstacles: a competing offer from HBO, which also wanted \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and the fact that no one had ever made a show for a streaming service before. For decades, when movies went straight to video without a theater run, they were ipso facto failures in Hollywood\u2019s view; for a seasoned director like Fincher, picking Netflix presented the same risk of marginalization. Sarandos overcame both by offering freedom and money. \u201cThere are a thousand reasons for you not to do this with Netflix,\u201d he told Fincher. \u201cBut if you go with us, we\u2019ll commit to two seasons with no pilot and no interference.\u201d Sarandos also offered Fincher a reported $100 million for 26 episodes, at the high end for an hourlong drama.The first season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d became available in February 2013. It was an immediate hit with viewers and critics. Five months later, Netflix posted the first season of \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d which Sarandos had ordered before \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d went into production. Critics lavished praise on the new show as well. Having begun its life as a Silicon Valley tech company, Netflix had somewhat improbably become a television network.Born and raised in the Boston suburbs \u2014 his great-grandfather was the wealthy investor Alfred Lee Loomis, who played a critical role in the invention of radar \u2014 Hastings, now 55, is one of those tech executives who came to California to attend Stanford (grad school for computer science in his case) and never left. The tech company he ran before Netflix was called Pure Software, which made debugging tools for software engineers. Before Netflix, Hastings had no experience in the entertainment industry.Although news coverage now tends to focus on its shows, Netflix remains every bit as much an engineering company as it is a content company. There is a reason that its shows rarely suffer from streaming glitches, even though, at peak times, they can sometimes account for 37 percent of internet traffic: in 2011 Netflix engineers set up their own content-delivery network, with servers in more than 1,000 locations. Its user interface is relentlessly tested and tweaked to make it more appealing to users. Netflix has the ability to track what people watch, at what time of day, whether they watch all the way through or stop after 10 minutes. Netflix uses \u201cpersonalization\u201d algorithms to put shows in front of its subscribers that are likely to appeal to them. Nathanson, the analyst, says: \u201cThey are a tech company. Their strength is that they have a really good product.\u201dIt is no surprise that Hastings, given his engineering background, believes that data, above all else, yields answers \u2014 and the bigger the data set, the better. \u201cThe worst thing you can do at Netflix is say that you showed it to 12 people in a focus room and they loved it,\u201d says Todd Yellin, the company\u2019s vice president of product innovation. He likes to note that customers will at most consider only 40 to 50 shows or movies before deciding what to watch, which makes it crucial that the company puts just the right 50 titles on each subscriber\u2019s screen. (All the data Netflix collects and dissects can yield surprising correlations: For example, viewers who like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d also often like the FX comedy \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201d)There is another underappreciated aspect of Netflix that Hastings views as a competitive advantage: what he calls its \u201chigh performance\u201d culture. The company seeks out and rewards star performers while unapologetically pushing out the rest.One person who helped Hastings create that culture is a woman named Patty McCord. The former head of human resources at Pure Software, she was also Hastings\u2019s neighbor in Santa Cruz. She car-pooled to work with him and socialized with his family on weekends. \u201cI thought the idea for Netflix was kind of stupid,\u201d she told me. But she trusted Hastings\u2019s instincts and wanted to keep working with him. Her title was chief talent officer.The origins of the Netflix culture date to October 2001. The internet bubble burst the year before, and Netflix, once flush with venture capital, was running out of money. Netflix had to lay off roughly 50 employees, shrinking the staff by a third. \u201cIt was Reed\u2019s first layoffs,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was painful.\u201dThe remaining 100 or so employees, despite working harder than before, enjoyed their jobs more. McCord and Hastings concluded that the reason was that they had held onto the self-motivated employees who assumed responsibility naturally. Office politics virtually disappeared; nobody had the time or the patience. \u201cThere was unusual clarity,\u201d McCord says. \u201cIt was our survival. It was either make this work or we\u2019re dead.\u201d McCord says Hastings told her, \u201cThis is what a great company feels like.\u201dAs luck would have it, the DVD business took off right around the time of the layoffs. By May 2002, Netflix was doing well enough to go public, selling 5.5 million shares at $15 a share. With the $82.5 million Netflix reaped from the offering, Hastings started hiring aggressively again. This time, he and McCord focused on hiring \u201cfully formed adults,\u201d in their words, go-getters who put the company\u2019s interests ahead of their own egos, showed initiative without being asked and embraced accountability. Dissent and argument were encouraged, even demanded.For those who fit in, Netflix was a great place to work \u2014 empowering and rational. There are no performance reviews, no limits on vacation time or maternity leave in the first year and a one-sentence expense policy: Do what is in the company\u2019s best interest. But those who could not adapt found that their tenure at Netflix was stressful and short-lived. There was pressure on newcomers to show that they had what it took to make it at Netflix; those who didn\u2019t were let go. \u201cReed would say, \u2018Why are we coming up with performance plans for people who are not going to work out?\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. Instead, Netflix simply wrote them a check and parted ways.McCord also convinced Hastings that he should ask himself a few times a year whether he would hire the same person in the same job if it opened up that day. If the answer was no, Netflix would write a larger check and let the employee go. \u201cIf you are going to insist on high performance,\u201d McCord says, \u201cthen you have to get rid of the notion of retention. You\u2019ll have to fire some really nice, hard-working people. But you have to do it with dignity.\u201cI held the hands of people weeping, saying, \u2018I want to be here forever,\u2019\u2009\u201d McCord says. \u201cI would tell them, \u2018Nothing lasts forever.\u2019 I would say to Reed, \u2018I love them, too, but it is our job to be sure that we always have the right people.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2004, the culture was codified enough for Netflix to put it on a sequence of slides, which it posted on its corporate website five years later. It is an extraordinary document, 124 slides in all, covering everything from its salaries (it pays employees what it believes a competitor trying to poach them would) to why it rejects \u201cbrilliant jerks\u201d (\u201ccost to effective teamwork is too high\u201d). The key concept is summed up in the 23rd slide. \u201cWe\u2019re a team, not a family,\u201d it reads. \u201cNetflix leaders hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.\u201dAfter Hastings, the executive I spent the most time with at Netflix was Yellin, a former independent filmmaker who joined the company in early 2006, when he was in his early 40s. Yellin quickly distinguished himself by pushing back hard whenever he thought Hastings was wrong about something. \u201cThere was a culture of questioning, but I pushed the envelope,\u201d he says. He also helped develop a style of meeting that I\u2019d never seen before. At the one I sat in on, there were maybe 50 people in a small circular room with three tiers of seats, like a tiny coliseum, allowing everyone to easily see everyone else. The issue at hand seemed pretty small to me: They were discussing whether montages on the opening screen of the user interface would be more effective in keeping subscribers than still images or trailers. But the intensity of the discussion made it clear that the group took the matter very seriously. Various hypotheses had been tested by sending out montages to 100,000 or so subscribers and comparing the results with another 100,000 who got, say, still images. (This is classic A/B testing, as it\u2019s known.) Every person present had something to say, but while there were strong disagreements, no one\u2019s feathers seemed ruffled.One of my last interviews at Netflix was with Tawni Cranz, the company\u2019s current chief talent officer, who started under Patty McCord in 2007. Five years later, McCord, her mentor, left. When I asked her why, she visibly flinched. She wouldn\u2019t explain, but I learned later that Hastings had let her go.It happened in 2011, after he made his biggest mistake as chief executive. He split Netflix into two companies \u2014 one to manage the DVD business and the other to focus on streaming. Customers were outraged; for many, the move meant a 60 percent price increase if they kept both the DVD and the streaming service. With complaints mounting and subscribers canceling, Hastings quickly reversed course and apologized. In the three weeks following this episode, the price of Netflix shares dropped 45 percent, and Wall Street questioned the company\u2019s acumen. Hastings decided to re-evaluate everyone in the executive ranks, using the litmus test McCord taught him: Would he hire them again today? One of the people this led him to push out was McCord.\u201cIt made me sad,\u201d she said when I called to ask her about it. \u201cI had been working with Reed for 20 years.\u201d Netflix had just given the go-ahead to \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and McCord said she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to walk away in the middle of the next thing.\u201dBut she also felt a sense of pride. She was gratified that Hastings had taken her advice so thoroughly to heart.\u201cTed,\u201d Murray said, as they shook hands warmly, \u201cyou should get a promotion.\u201d He grabbed Sarandos by the lapels, pulled him close and added loudly, \u201cYou are the future!\u201d The two men laughed uproariously.From the time he arrived at Netflix in 2000, Sarandos has had the final say on both Netflix\u2019s licensing deals and its original programming. An Arizona native, Sarandos was working for a large video-retail chain when Hastings hired him to negotiate DVD deals directly with the studios. Sarandos had been in love with movies all his life: He worked his way through college by managing an independent video store. If he had chosen a different path, it\u2019s easy to imagine him having become a traditional Hollywood executive instead of an industry antagonist.At an investment conference late last year, David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, which operates the Discovery Channel, articulated the case for having networks rethink their relationship with Netflix. Streaming video-on-demand platforms \u201conly exist because of our content,\u201d Zaslav said, in an obvious reference to Netflix. \u201cTo the extent that our content doesn\u2019t exist on their platforms \u2014 not to be too pejorative \u2014 they are dumb pipes. We as an industry are supporting economic models that don\u2019t make sense.\u201dSarandos, who had spoken earlier in the day, had clearly anticipated the criticism: \u201cZaslav says that we built a great business on their content,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. We did not renew their deal when they wanted a premium. So we replaced it with other programming that got us just as many viewers for less money.\u201dThose who think Netflix will come to dominate television have a simple rationale: Netflix has exposed, and taken advantage of, the limitations of conventional TV. The more time people spend on Netflix \u2014 it\u2019s now up to nearly two hours a day \u2014 the less they watch network television. \u201cOur thesis is that bingeing drives more bingeing,\u201d says Greenfield, the Wall Street analyst. \u201cOnce people start watching shows that don\u2019t have commercials, they never want to go back. Waiting week after week for the next episode of a favorite show,\u201d he says, \u201cis not a good experience for consumers anymore.\u201dStill, despite the rise in Netflix\u2019s share price over the past few years, the company has no shortage of doubters on Wall Street. Some distrust Netflix\u2019s numbers, arguing that millions of people no longer watch the service anymore but keep their subscriptions because they are so inexpensive. Netflix has announced that it will raise prices this year, and the Netflix skeptics believe the price increase will cause subscribers to cancel in droves. Other critics note the slowdown in the growth of domestic subscribers, by far the company\u2019s most profitable segment. In addition, Netflix, between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers, is spending more than it collects in revenue. How long can that continue?Finally, the pessimists point out that Netflix makes very little profit: In the first quarter of this year, for instance, Netflix had nearly $2 billion in revenue but only $28 million in profit. Despite the significant moves by Netflix into original programming, Wall Street still values Netflix more like a platform company \u2014 a business that uses the internet to match buyers and sellers, like Uber \u2014 than a content company, like a studio or a network. Its valuation is currently $5 billion more than Sony, for example. Hastings, who has been very blunt about the company\u2019s strategy of plowing money back into the business, has promised bigger profits sometime in 2017. Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a significant test of investors\u2019 faith in him.One of the most prominent Netflix skeptics is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank. In his view, Netflix\u2019s true advantage in the beginning was that it had the entire game to itself, and the networks, not realizing how valuable streaming rights would be, practically gave them away. He had a \u201cbuy\u201d on the stock from 2007 to 2010, he told me. But, he added, referring to those years when Netflix had streaming all to itself, \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, then it will attract competition.\u201dNow, he said, the networks and studios are charging higher fees for their shows, forcing up Netflix\u2019s costs. Netflix doesn\u2019t own most of the shows that it buys or commissions, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d so it has to pay more when it renews a popular show. In addition to the money it now spends on content, it also has more than $12 billion in future obligations for shows it has ordered. The only way it can pay for all of that is to continue adding subscribers and raise subscription rates. And even then, Pachter says, the networks will extract a piece of any extra revenue Netflix generates. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to think that Netflix can raise its price by $2 a month and keep all the upside,\u201d he said. \u201cI defy you to look at any form of content where the distributor raises prices and the supplier doesn\u2019t get more. That\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever heard.\u201cNetflix,\u201d Pachter concluded, \u201cis caught in an arms race they invented.\u201d He compared Netflix to a rat racing on a wheel, staying ahead only by going faster and faster and spending more and more: As its costs continue to go up, it needs to constantly generate more subscribers to stay ahead of others.And if that doesn\u2019t happen? If subscriber growth were to stall, for instance, then Wall Street would stop treating it as a growth stock, and its price would start falling. Slower growth would also increase the cost of taking on more debt to pay for its shows. The company would be forced to either raise subscription prices even higher or cut back on those content costs or do both, which could slow subscriber growth even further. Netflix\u2019s virtuous circle \u2014 subscriber growth and content expenditures driving each other \u2014 would become a vicious circle instead.Matthew Ball, a strategist for Otter Media, who writes often about the future of television, thinks the latter is more likely. He says that today, when you have a cable subscription, you have access to hundreds of channels \u2014 in effect, they all share you as a customer. The cable bundle puts you in a television ecosystem, and you flip from one show to the other depending on what you want to watch. In the emerging on-demand world, television won\u2019t work that way: All the networks will have their own streaming service and customers will have to pay a fee for every one. The days when networks could make money from people who never watch their shows will end.One consequence is that networks will have to have one-on-one relationships with their viewers \u2014 something they have little experience with, and which Netflix, with its ability to \u201cpersonalize\u201d its interactions with its 81 million customers, has mastered. Another consequence is that as streaming becomes the primary way people watch television, they are highly unlikely to pay for more than a small handful of subscription-TV networks. What they will want, Ball believes, is a different setup: companies that offer far more programming than any one network can provide. Netflix, clearly, has already created that kind of ecosystem. \u201cNetflix is ABC, it is Discovery, it is AMC, it is USA and all the other networks,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIts subscribers don\u2019t say, \u2018I love Netflix for Westerns, but I\u2019ll go somewhere else for sci-fi.\u2019 The old model just doesn\u2019t work in an on-demand world.\u201dIn this vision of the future, Netflix\u2019s most potent competitor is likely to be Amazon, which is also developing an extensive array of content, including many of its own original shows. Early on, it, too, produced a highly praised series, \u201cTransparent.\u201d It, too, has no allegiance to the cable bundle. And it has the kind of revenue \u2014 exceeding $100 billion \u2014 that neither the networks nor Netflix can approach. Compared to the networks, Netflix may have an imposing war chest, but in a fight with Amazon, it would be outgunned.According to Ball, what Netflix is counting on to maintain its primacy and to start making big profits is \u201cunprecedented scale.\u201d That\u2019s where the effort to create a global network, the one that was announced in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, comes in. In April, when the company announced its first-quarter results, it said it had added 4.5 million international subscribers. Yet success, and profits, are still some way off, as Hastings is the first to acknowledge.YouTube, he notes, is available in more than 50 languages; Netflix can be seen in only 20 languages. Netflix was primarily attracting people in its new countries who speak English as it races to \u201clocalize\u201d its service in each country. Netflix is ordering shows with an international flavor, like \u201cNarcos,\u201d but so far it has only a handful up and running. Netflix wants to make \u201cthe best Bollywood movie that\u2019s ever been produced,\u201d Hastings told an Indian publication; it wants to make Japanese anime; it wants to make local films for every market; it wants global rights when it licenses shows \u2014 something that, once again, contravenes Hollywood\u2019s conventional business model, in which rights are sold on a country-by-country basis. The company still has much to learn about each country\u2019s quirks and tastes and customs, and it will be a while before it can hope to earn a profit from its global customers.\u201cWhen we were in the DVD business,\u201d Hastings said, \u201cit was hard to see how we would get to streaming.\u201d Then it was hard to see how to go from a domestic company to a global one. And how to go from a company that licensed shows to one that had its own original shows. Now it knew exactly where it was going. \u201cOur challenges are execution challenges,\u201d he told me.Asked what the competitive landscape would look like five years in the future, he returned to the analogy he used earlier with the evolution of the telephone. Landlines had been losing out to mobile phones for the past 15 years, he said, but it had been a gradual process. The same, he believed, would be true of television.\u201cThere won\u2019t be a dramatic tipping point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you will see is that the bundle gets used less and less.\u201d For now, even as Hulu and Amazon were emerging as rivals, he claimed that the true competition was still for users\u2019 time: not just the time they spent watching cable but the time they spent reading books, attending concerts.And Hastings was aware that even after the bundle is vanquished, the disruption of his industry will be far from complete. \u201cProspective threats?\u201d he mused when I asked him about all the competition. \u201cMovies and television could become like opera and novels, because there are so many other forms of entertainment. Someday, movies and TV shows will be historic relics. But that might not be for another 100 years.\u201dJoe Nocera is the sports-business columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charlie Cox Takes Off the \u2018Daredevil\u2019 Mask to Go \u2018Incognito\u2019", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byA man looks up and sees his wife, expresses delight.\u201cHello my love, where have you been?\u201dThe character, called Henry, is built on an amalgam of two famous patients in the history of neuropathology. For the audience, Henry\u2019s plight, and that of his desperate and finally defeated wife, is baffling and heartbreaking. But for Charlie Cox, the 33-year-old English actor who plays him, it created a particular problem. How do you portray a man with so few evident qualities?\u201cWhat is Henry\u2019s character if you take away the experience of his life thus far, and if you take away a feeling of knowing where he is and what he\u2019s striving for?\u201d Mr. Cox asked in a recent interview at City Center, where the Manhattan Theater Club production runs through July 10. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t suffer from memory loss, we\u2019re always striving for something: Buy the dream house, pay the mortgage, something. Henry doesn\u2019t live in a world where that\u2019s possible because he can\u2019t build up a catalog of memories.\u201dMr. Cox, who is making his New York theater debut, is the son of a publisher of books about Parliament. He studied at the Bristol Old Vic and has performed at the Donmar Warehouse in London. He was introduced to American television audiences as Owen Sleater, a bodyguard and criminal enforcer in the HBO series \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201dAmong the show\u2019s distinctions are its strenuously gymnastic and violent fight scenes, some of which Mr. Cox performs \u2014 rather proudly \u2014 himself.\u201cThere\u2019s a fight sequence in Episode 7 of the second season, where I get thrown across the room onto a coffee table, which then collapses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first take Chris did\u201d \u2014 Chris Brewster, his stunt double \u2014 \u201cworked wonderfully well, so they said I could do the second one, and I did it and they used that one.\u201dHenry\u2019s impaired brain aside, \u201cIncognito\u201d \u2014 which Ben Brantley of The New York Times called \u201ca lively, self-examining drama of ideas\u201d \u2014 is a considerably more cerebral challenge. Structured in tantalizingly brief scenes that skip back and forth in time over a number of decades, it uses minimal props and four actors (Mr. Cox, Geneva Carr, Heather Lind and Morgan Spector) who play a total of 21 roles to tell three stories.One is about Henry; one is about Albert Einstein, his family, and the doctor who studied his brain; and one is about a clinical neuropsychologist, her love life and an amnesiac patient. All resonate with ruminations about the relationship between character and the brain. As the neuropsychologist (Ms. Carr) explains to her much younger lover (Ms. Lind):\u201cThe brain builds a narrative to steady us from moment to moment, but it\u2019s ultimately an illusion. There is no me, there is no you, and there is certainly no self; we are divided and discontinuous and constantly being duped. The brain is a storytelling machine and it\u2019s really, really good at fooling us.\u201dIn addition to Henry, Mr. Cox\u2019s other roles include a conniving journalist, an unpleasantly macho lawyer and Hans Albert, Einstein\u2019s son.\u201cIf I\u2019m totally honest with you, I have to say it seems more impressive than it is; it\u2019s just muscle memory,\u201d he said about the difficulty of playing multiple roles. What has been much more difficult, he said, was mastering Mr. Payne\u2019s surprising writing, the leaps in logic \u2014 or illogic \u2014 that characterize his dialogue.\u201cWhen I\u2019ve done plays in the past, you get to the first performance and you\u2019ve identified three or four moments where you think, \u2018That\u2019s where I\u2019ve really got to concentrate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIn this play, there are countless moments like that.\u201dObvious examples are the moments when Henry blanks out in midconversation and, in Mr. Cox\u2019s word, \u201cresets.\u201dTo help him with the essentially incomprehensible nature of Henry\u2019s inner logic, he consulted with a neuroscientist and studied \u2014 through books and videos \u2014 the real people who inspired the character: Henry Molaison, the amnesiac known in medical literature as H. M., who died in 2008 at 82; and Clive Wearing, a British musicologist and musician, now 78, who has had severe memory problems since 1985 because of encephalitis.In Mr. Cox\u2019s performance, the moments are characterized by a blankness of expression, perhaps a faint eyelid twitch and a hiccup of silence as if the needle on a record had been lifted quickly and moved back.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want to do was always find a reason for him to look away,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s an easy way of doing it. We\u2019re having a conversation, Henry looks over there, and when he looks back he doesn\u2019t remember you. But that\u2019s not what happens to Henry \u2014 the real Henry.\u201cAnd that interested me. Because what I didn\u2019t understand is, if you\u2019re talking to someone and suddenly you have no idea what conversation you\u2019re in or who this person is, presumably that would be very frightening. If that happened to me right now, if we were talking and suddenly I had no idea who you were, I wouldn\u2019t just continue the conversation. I\u2019d be confused: \u2018How did we get into the room?\u2019 But in the play, it\u2019s not written in a way where Henry freaks out, or even wonders what\u2019s going on.\u201dHeather Lind, who plays Henry\u2019s wife, said that the problem of having to make the same line fresh several times a night is simply an intensified version of the stage actor\u2019s job, which is, performance to performance, \u201cfinding newness in repetition.\u201d\u201cFor Charlie, the challenge of playing Henry\u2019s character is realizing, as Charlie, that he said the same line 10 seconds ago, but that as Henry he\u2019s saying it for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, working on stage with him, I get to watch the mechanism at play. I get to watch him make the subtle switch. I can tell he\u2019s consciously doing it, but then some freshness comes out of him each time.\u201dPerhaps, in the end, this was simply a part Mr. Cox was destined for. As he tells the story of his career, a crucial moment occurred at the end of the first of what was to be a three-year stint at Bristol Old Vic. He had been cast as a shepherd in a Nativity play, and over the summer break was instructed to learn to play the recorder.Why hadn\u2019t he learned to play the recorder?\u201cI had forgotten,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Expensive Law Degree, and No Place to Use It", "Date": "2016-06-17", "News": "Supported byVALPARAISO, Ind. \u2014 By most measures, John Acosta is a law school success story. He graduated from Valparaiso University Law School \u2014 a well-established regional school here in northwestern Indiana \u2014 in the top third of his class this past December, a semester ahead of schedule. He passed the bar exam on his first try in February.Mr. Acosta, 39, is also a scrupulous networker who persuaded a former longtime prosecutor to join him in starting a defense and family law firm. A police officer for 11 years in Georgia, Mr. Acosta has a rare ability to get inside the head of a cop that should be of more than passing interest to would-be clients.\u201cI think John\u2019s going to do fine,\u201d said Andrew Lucas, a partner at the firm where Mr. Acosta rents office space. \u201cHe\u2019s got other life skills that are attractive to people running into problems.\u201dYet in financial terms, there is almost no way for Mr. Acosta to climb out of the crater he dug for himself in law school, when he borrowed over $200,000. The government will eventually forgive the loan \u2014 in 20 years \u2014 if he\u2019s unable to repay it, as is likely on his small-town lawyer\u2019s salary. But the Internal Revenue Service will probably treat the forgiven amount as income, leaving him what could easily be a $70,000 tax bill on the eve of retirement, and possibly much higher.Mr. Acosta is just one of tens of thousands of recent law school graduates caught up in a broad transformation of the legal profession. While demand for other white-collar jobs has grown substantially since the start of the recession, law firms and corporations are finding they can make do with far fewer in-house lawyers than before, squeezing those just starting their careers.As of this April, fewer than 70 percent of Valparaiso law school graduates from the previous spring were employed and fewer than half were in jobs that required a law license. Only three out of 131 graduates worked in large firms, which tend to pay more generous salaries.\u201cPeople are not being helped by going to these schools,\u201d Kyle McEntee, executive director of the advocacy group Law School Transparency, said of Valparaiso and other low-tier law schools. \u201cThe debt is really high, bar passage rates are horrendous, employment is horrendous.\u201dEven as employment prospects have dimmed, however, law school student debt has ballooned, rising from about $95,000 among borrowers at the average school in 2010 to about $112,000 in 2014, according to Mr. McEntee\u2019s group.Belatedly, many schools are starting to respond to this brutal reality, or at least the collapse in applications it has set off. In February, Valparaiso announced it was offering buyouts to tenured professors. As of May, 14 of 36 full-time faculty members had either accepted the package or retired. The law school plans to reduce its student body by roughly one-third over the next few years, from about 450 today.\u201cMaybe I was na\u00efve, but I didn\u2019t think it would be as stark,\u201d said Rosalie Levinson, a longtime constitutional law professor at Valparaiso who recently headed a committee on restructuring the school. \u201cThe number of tenured faculty that would be leaving \u2014 not gradually but immediately \u2014 just personally, that was difficult.\u201dBut from the perspective of the students caught up in the explosion of unrepayable law school debt, the shake-up at the school, and others like it, look rather pedestrian.Given the tectonic shifts in the legal landscape, the relevant issue may not be how much law schools like Valparaiso should shrink. Today the more important question is whether they should exist at all.If you drove west from the eastern edge of Valparaiso\u2019s campus early this spring, you would have passed a pawnshop, a discount cigarette outlet and, intriguingly, a sign announcing \u201cCaf\u00e9 available for rent,\u201d before reaching the heart of the city\u2019s downtown, which includes the county courthouse and a handful of law offices.When I met Mr. Acosta at one of the offices on an afternoon in late April, he was moving the last of his lawyer swag into the windowless space that will house his practice. He wasn\u2019t scheduled to start work for another few weeks, until after he was sworn into the state bar, but he had the giddiness of a man eager to try on his new professional identity.Mr. Acosta, who retains the erect manner and intense stare of his former colleagues in law enforcement, applied to law school planning to become a prosecutor. But he changed paths after briefly testing the local job market and finding his prospects grim.Unfortunately, the market for defense lawyers in the area was only slightly better. Although he received a few offers, none came with a salary or benefits. The firms offered him little more than a desk and a business card. Any revenue he brought in would have to be shared with the partners 50-50, and they would not be reciprocating.It was at this point that he decided to start his own firm. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to split the money and they\u2019re not doing anything, I\u2019m going to split the money with myself,\u201d he said.Actually, there are others who will be sharing in his income. Mr. Acosta recently became engaged to another Valparaiso law student, Erica Melendez, who graduated this spring and plans to open her own firm specializing in immigration work. Between them they will be nearly half a million dollars in the red while trying to run two businesses and raise Ms. Melendez\u2019s 5-year-old daughter.Still, Mr. Acosta and Ms. Melendez, who speaks fluent Spanish, are better positioned than many of their classmates, who don\u2019t have uniquely marketable skills that would allow them to set off on their own.Earlier that day, I joined five Valparaiso students for lunch at a Mexican restaurant near campus. The main topic of conversation was whether they were more concerned about passing the bar exam, which Valparaiso graduates have struggled to do in recent years, or finding employment.A student named Ethan Legg said that if he could just pass the bar, he could probably find something somewhere. To which his classmate Daria Anderson responded that she didn\u2019t see what good passing the bar would do if you were \u201cworking at Starbucks for less than $40,000 per year.\u201dMs. Anderson had been planning to buy a house for herself and her two children when she was accepted to law school. She had graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington with minimal debt thanks to scholarships, and managed to save about $10,000 working a variety of jobs over the next decade. Although she knew law school would be a financial strain, she decided she would regret not trying.\u201cI would have been sitting at some desk, in somebody\u2019s office, with some type of job, wondering, \u2018Should I have gone?\u2019\u201d she said.Today, she is over $100,000 in debt and her job search has been taxing. With few leads on a legal position, Ms. Anderson has set her sights on a so-called J.D.-advantaged job, such as vetting and negotiating a corporation\u2019s contracts with suppliers. The starting salary is likely to be in the mid-to-high five figures, but she hopes such a job could lead to a more senior position.For students like Ms. Anderson, the problem isn\u2019t just that the market for Valparaiso law graduates is saturated, although it is. Mr. Lucas, the law partner who rents space to Mr. Acosta, complained of a large \u201coversupply of lawyers\u201d in the area.It\u2019s that the market for all recent law school graduates has been relatively saturated.With big-firm jobs drying up, however, many of these graduates began competing for lower-paying spots at midsize firms, which also downsized, and certain government jobs they wouldn\u2019t have sought in an earlier era.\u201cThat takes those jobs off the table,\u201d Mr. Campos said. \u201cIt has ripple effects all the way throughout the profession, so that a small law firm in northwest Indiana can say to recent grads: \u2018We want you to work for free. We won\u2019t pay you.\u2019\u201dLaw schools, for their part, seem strangely oblivious to all this. Officially, many stress the growing availability of jobs for which a law degree is preferred rather than required \u2014 the kind of job Ms. Anderson has been searching for. But given the vagueness of the category, Mr. Campos said, discounting the number of these jobs by 50 percent is a good rule of thumb.\u201cI counsel a lot of students and try to make them realize that a J.D.-advantaged job can be extremely useful,\u201d said Del Wright Jr., a Valparaiso tax law professor who is one of the school\u2019s most popular instructors.\u201cYou see all these businesses, \u2018We Buy Liens\u2019 \u2014 what exactly is going on there?\u201d he continued, explaining that buyers of tax liens can earn hefty state-sanctioned interest rates, as well as fees to get the liens removed. \u201cIf you are entrepreneurial but not the best lawyer, you might look into it.\u201dThe law school at Valparaiso occupies two buildings at the southwest corner of campus: a sprawling brown brick structure that looks as if it might house overflow personnel from a federal bureaucracy, and a smaller, much more elegant red brick building that sits cater-corner from the main compound. I toured them recently with Bruce Berner, a longtime law professor and associate dean at Valparaiso who retired in 2014 but remains a beloved presence on campus.Strolling through the corridors, Mr. Berner could not help pointing out the offices of colleagues who had accepted the buyout and would not be back in the fall. \u201cIvan, if it hadn\u2019t been for something like this situation, wouldn\u2019t have stopped,\u201d he said of Ivan Bodensteiner, a professor who had recently served as interim dean.When Mr. Berner joined the Valparaiso faculty in 1971, he was one of nine professors, and the school focused primarily on legal instruction. But in the mid- to late 1980s, he said, the school put an increasing emphasis on legal scholarship and recruited faculty members who could produce it. Across the country, many law schools were undergoing a similar evolution.It\u2019s no coincidence that the average law school faculty began to grow quickly around this time: Each professor was teaching fewer courses to make time for research. Mr. Berner said he went from teaching 15 or 16 credit hours a year \u2014 typically five classes \u2014 to no more than 12. Every law school seemed to want to emulate Harvard and Yale. (Valparaiso said the growth of its faculty was due in part to an American Bar Association mandate to make its curriculum more comprehensive.)It\u2019s also no coincidence that law schools raised the cost of attending, which helped cover the additional expense. Against the backdrop of a healthy demand for lawyers, fast-rising tuition did not discourage students, who could borrow most (and eventually all) of the cost from the government and frequently pay it back with relative ease. Law school applications generally increased over the next two decades.For Valparaiso, the upmarket strategy had the desired effect. Although the school had long enjoyed a solid reputation in northern Indiana, producing a thick roster of judges, politicians and business leaders, it began to attract applicants from a wider geographical area. Median scores on the Law School Admission Test began to creep up, eventually moving several points above 150, roughly the median for all test-takers nationally.\u201cWhen we were in our heyday, in the late \u201980s, \u201990s,\u201d Mr. Berner said, \u201cwe could always say to the top 10 percent, you could hit something big in Chicago if you wanted. Or D.C. or New York.\u201dIn 2004, former President George H. W. Bush spoke at a gala celebrating the school\u2019s 125th anniversary. It was around this time that Valparaiso, like many law schools, approached its peak competitiveness. Law school applications topped out at just over 100,000 nationally in 2004 and gradually began to decline.For Valparaiso, the bottom fell out in two stages. Applications dropped from over 3,000 in 2007 to under 1,600 in 2009, although this was partly because of a change in recruitment strategy, then below 1,200 a few years later.After this second drop, faculty members and administrators became anxious. \u201cI was chair of the admissions committee and we\u2019re sitting there watching this,\u201d Mr. Berner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201dThe committee agonized over whether it should accept fewer students or keep its class size roughly constant and admit weaker candidates. In the end, it opted for the latter, a decision Mr. Berner admits wasn\u2019t entirely on the merits, since fewer students would have meant less revenue.\u201cThere was a lot of pressure, of course, from the central administration to keep the numbers up,\u201d he said. (Mark A. Heckler, the university president, said that admissions decisions were entirely up to the law school but that the financial model was for the school to fund itself.)By 2014, the limitations of the strategy had become apparent: The figures the school reported for the rate at which its graduates passed the Indiana bar exam, which had already been dipping, crashed to about 61 percent, from about 77 percent the year before. An enormous number of students wouldn\u2019t be able to work as lawyers in the state even if jobs were theoretically available.Andrea Lyon, who was just beginning her first semester as dean of the law school, called a mandatory meeting for all third-year students, to review the grim numbers and urge them to take a handful of remedial bar courses the school was offering. \u201cIt was a panicked meeting,\u201d said Chris Freiberg, who graduated from the law school in 2015.(\u201cI felt I had to address this right away,\u201d Dean Lyon said. \u201cSome students may have viewed it as panic, but that\u2019s not what it was.\u201d)But the following year, bar passage rates ticked up only a few points. The problem was that these rates tend to be a broadly predictable function of scores on the Law School Admission Test. With average test scores dropping as the school relaxed its entry criteria, there were limits to how much the school could improve its bar results.Valparaiso was, in effect, caught in a deflating financial bubble, one most law schools were slow to heed because of the government\u2019s role in financing legal education. Applications ultimately tumbled about 40 percent nationally between 2010 and 2015, and by a roughly similar percentage at Valparaiso.One telltale sign of the bursting bubble was that more prestigious schools began poaching the students of lower-ranked schools after their first year. \u201cWe were losing students to Indiana University,\u201d said Professor Levinson at Valparaiso. \u201cWe lose two to three a year of our honors students to Notre Dame.\u201dBy the fall of 2015, the university\u2019s central administration began to debate several options for overhauling the law school; among the more drastic alternatives were to close it or merge it with another school. In the end, the leadership decided that shrinking the school would suffice.By that point, the faculty put up little resistance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s moral to take someone\u2019s money who can\u2019t make it,\u201d Dean Lyon told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201dMr. Berner, for his part, feels a tinge of regret when he looks back on the years after the 2009 recession. \u201cEveryone had good intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we could go back, I think we should have erred a little more on the side of turning people down.\u201dOne side of the top row in Prof. Stephen Wilks\u2019s secured transactions class last semester belonged to a group of five students he named the \u201clegion of boom.\u201dIf you teach at Valparaiso Law School, it\u2019s the legion of boom that makes you believe you are on the path of righteousness. The students radiate intelligence and prepare for class scrupulously.Unusual among their classmates, four of the five had lined up jobs well before graduation, including a broad-shouldered Iowan named Jeremy Hahn, who will be joining the general counsel\u2019s office of a large corporation in Des Moines.You don\u2019t have to talk to Mr. Hahn for very long to figure out that he would succeed in just about any terrain you airlifted him into. In addition to being near the top of his class, he was president of the business law society, editor in chief of the student law journal and head of the graduation steering committee.On the day I turned up, Professor Wilks had stumped his students with an obscure question about collateral. \u201cIf you\u2019d missed this, you would have lost one-third of the available points for this essay question,\u201d he gently chided the class. When I later asked Mr. Hahn if he had known the answer, he admitted that he did, but said he preferred not to call attention to himself for validation.It\u2019s easy to assume that Valparaiso\u2019s decision to scale back its class size means that going forward, the law school will consist much more of people like Mr. Hahn and his fellow legionnaires. If that were the case, the decision might be completely rational.But in reality, that stands almost no chance of coming to pass. That\u2019s because the way Valparaiso and other lower-ranked schools lure students like Mr. Hahn is to offer sizable scholarships, and the only way they can afford these scholarships is if a large proportion of other students pay full freight.Inevitably, many of these sticker-price payers are weak students who lack better options. Research by Prof. Jerome M. Organ, an expert on law school economics at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis, shows that students with low test scores and undergraduate grade-point averages tend to subsidize the stars; this is especially true of third- and fourth-tier schools like Valparaiso. It\u2019s the marginal students who pay the bills, not students like Mr. Hahn.In such a world, schools like Valparaiso essentially face the following choice: Admit a large number of marginal students, or shut down.In the meantime, Valparaiso must keep taking risks on a lot of students, a reality the administration does not exactly hide.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should stop taking chances; I just think we need to take chances intelligently and thoughtfully,\u201d Dean Lyon said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve taught for any length of time, you know pretty quickly if someone has that hunger to do a good job. That makes up for a lot.\u201dA few hours after I spoke with Dean Lyon I drove about 75 miles east to a Meijer store in Goshen, Ind., where I met a 2015 Valparaiso Law School graduate named Sarah Tapia.As a child, Ms. Tapia had siblings who were in and out of jail. She decided in high school that she would become a lawyer to help people like them. \u201cI kind of grew up with that my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of money, because of race, they never really got a fair chance at justice.\u201dShe attended Goshen College, where she studied history, and was admitted to two law schools: Valparaiso and a for-profit school in North Carolina, Charlotte School of Law, that won full American Bar Association accreditation only in 2011.Ms. Tapia struggled her first semester at Valparaiso, but she said her grades steadily improved after that. After graduation, she took a bar prep class and threw herself into studying full time, undeterred by her \u201cmassive\u201d debt load. When she found out she failed, she took a job in the clothing department of Meijer while she prepared to take the test again this past February. But not long before I showed up, she found out that she had failed that test, too.Ms. Tapia is a small woman with long brown hair who often looks down when she speaks. But it would be a mistake to confuse this with a lack of conviction. She urged me to watch the Netflix documentary series \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d which raised questions about the murder conviction of a man named Steven Avery. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I went to law school to do,\u201d she said.From the perspective of an admissions committee looking to take a chance on a high-risk applicant, Ms. Tapia must have presented a compelling case. She had already defied long odds by graduating from college. She had an obvious passion for the law.She had that unteachable impulse to succeed that Dean Lyon said she was looking for. Even today, with two strikes against her, she is determined to keep taking the bar exam until she passes it. There is no doubt in her mind that she will one day be a practicing lawyer, and she may well be right.Still, in the meantime, she has a crushing amount of debt and a job that doesn\u2019t pay her enough to so much as dent it.\u201cWhy does Valpo have an economic structure that looks like Harvard Law School\u2019s?\u201d asked Mr. Campos, the University of Colorado expert on the prospects of recent law school graduates. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to do it. It\u2019s why they have to charge Harvardesque prices.\u201dTwo generations ago, someone like Ms. Tapia could have attended Valparaiso and still made it financially even if her legal career didn\u2019t pan out. Today, that\u2019s simply not possible.\u201cThe bottom line here is that institutions like Valparaiso clearly were fulfilling a valuable role until they were swept up in various forms of craziness in higher education,\u201d Mr. Campos continued.I asked Ms. Tapia if she ever regretted her decision to go to law school. She said she sometimes wondered if \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t have done this, maybe this isn\u2019t what I was supposed to do with my life,\u201d but those moments are pretty fleeting.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade my law degree for anything,\u201d she added. \u201cI would trade the debt.\u201dAn article last Sunday about shrinking job prospects and mounting debt for law students misstated the timetable under which the government would forgive the debt incurred by John Acosta, a graduate of Valparaiso University Law School who is setting up his own criminal law practice. It would be forgiven in 20 years, not 25 years.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the I.R.S.\u2019s treatment of the forgiven amount of Mr. Acosta\u2019s loan. It will probably treat that amount as taxable income; it is not a certainty that it will treat it as such.Advertisement"}

And when Alexander grew up, he decided to play him.\u201cMy dad is the biggest Tarzan fan ever, and we watched the old Johnny Weissmuller movies when I was a kid,\u201d Mr. Skarsgard, 39, said. \u201cSo I was super excited about the idea of playing Tarzan. And I was curious: This is a story that\u2019s been told 100 times over the past 100 years. What\u2019s their take on it?\u201dWhether critics consider this a timely critique of colonialism or another white-savior movie, Mr. Skarsgard is primarily focused on the opinion of one specific person. \u201cMy old man,\u201d he said over lunch at Caf\u00e9 Mogador in the East Village, his hard-won physique camouflaged by a crisp white shirt. \u201cHe has loved Tarzan since he was 6.\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.How did you get that incredible scenery?We shot north of London in this old Rolls-Royce airplane factory, with real trees and African bushes, a river and waterfall, a colonial town, an African village, a quarry and a lake with a steamboat. I remember Sam and I running across a patch of grass in an industrial neighborhood, [but in the movie], we\u2019re running across miles and miles of savanna with a thousand wildebeest.The animals were computer generated, but what about your abs?They\u2019re all mine. But I didn\u2019t want any muscle mass that didn\u2019t serve a purpose, because animals don\u2019t have that. So the first phase was three months of bulking up, which was 7,000 calories a day of meat and potatoes and weight lifting. I put on about 24 pounds of muscle and fat. Then we switched to a much stricter diet, six small meals a day, and I started working with the choreographer Wayne McGregor.You don\u2019t wear a loincloth. Are you comfortable with nudity?I\u2019m totally comfortable if it makes sense. And for those scenes, I felt, why would he be wearing a loincloth? That kind of prudish behavior is very human. So it wouldn\u2019t make sense for him, being raised by apes, to say, \u201cExcuse me, guys, I actually want to cover up here.\u201dWas the addition of Williams an attempt to update the racial issues in Burroughs\u2019s stories?He was a real person, an African-American who went to the Congo and exposed what King Leopold was doing. At the time, Leopold was hailed as a philanthropist. He basically tricked the United States government and Europe into giving him the Congo because he said that he would civilize these indigenous people and build out the infrastructure. But what he actually did was genocide. And Sam\u2019s character can sense that something is amiss.Is Jane modernized?Tarzan needs her as much as she needs him. A big part of his heart is still in the jungle, and she\u2019s the only one who understands that desire to return to your roots. And it was important to find a Jane that, even though the movie takes place in the 1880s, was a modern heroine. Margot is warm and strong and tough.What did you do after you wrapped?My dad was shooting a Netflix mini-series in London. So I went straight to his house and spent four days on the couch being fed. He loves to cook, so we had rich pastas, bone marrow, mozzarella, red wine. I was in heaven.Advertisement"}

(Mr. Gotti died in 2002 while serving a life sentence.) But one expert described Mr. Vel\u00e1squez as \u201can astute self-promoter\u201d who had capitalized on his infamy by claiming to have been reformed while glorifying narco-culture.\u201cBeing an assassin is not normal,\u201d he said in the interview. Now, he said, he \u201crespects life and society.\u201d\u201cI was resocialized: When I changed my way of thinking, I changed my way of being,\u201d he added.In one video, he seeks forgiveness from a relative of one of his victims.

I am going to assume responsibility because your brother was defending a country, an institution, and we were murderers paid by the cartels.\u201dIf Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, who uploads videos out of his apartment in Medell\u00edn, is troubled that his stated contriteness is at odds with the opening graphics of gunfire and bullet holes in his videos, he is not showing it. And he revels in the limelight.Some viewers have responded by welcoming him back to society. \u201cHello, Popeye,\u201d one wrote. \u201cI love all of your statements because they are full of honesty and courage. Hugs.\u201dOthers celebrate his flair and ability to talk directly to the people: \u201cYou have the personality to be able to tell the truth to the Colombian society.\u201dHe added: \u201cOf course, Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s fame is directly tied to his relationship with Pablo Escobar. The stories he can tell will keep him popular, but they might also get him killed.\u201dIf the mobsters from Mr. Gotti\u2019s day had a strict code of silence about criminal activity, Mr. Vel\u00e1squez seems unconcerned about revealing the inner workings of the cartel.In a video posted in October, he said he would always be an assassin. He boasted about his reputation on the streets, calling himself the living memory of the cartel. He said he would never speak ill of Mr. Escobar.\u201cFor me, Escobar was a terrorist, a drug dealer, a kidnapper \u2014 but he was also my friend; he treated me with kindness and respect,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the kind of man that would look you in the eyes and do what he says.

{"Headline": "YouTube Red Buys \u2018Step Up,\u2019 Its First Big-Budget TV Drama", "Date": "2016-06-23", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 YouTube Red, the Google-owned paid streaming service, has acquired its first big-budget, Hollywood-produced television drama, moving it into more direct competition with players like Netflix and traditional cable networks.\u201cBigger, bolder\u201d and an offering that will \u201cdrive subscription\u201d is how Susanne Daniels, YouTube\u2019s global head of original content, described the still-untitled series in an interview. Kevin Beggs, Lionsgate\u2019s television chairman, called it \u201ca distinctive, noisy, platform-defining series\u201d that \u201cmultiple networks wanted.\u201dMr. Tatum will be an executive producer of the drama, expected to arrive next year. It will cost several million dollars per episode to make, signaling the arrival of YouTube Red as a major-league buyer of content. The series, which will feature YouTube stars as dancers and actors, will be set at a performing arts high school and be most similar in tone to the first of the five \u201cStep Up\u201d movies.\u201cIt is hard to tell whether the effort is succeeding or will succeed,\u201d Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a client report last month. \u201cIt is possible that it might be too little too late.\u201d Notably, Mr. Kirjner cited a lack of \u201chigh-production-value content\u201d as one of YouTube Red\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going to resonate,\u201d Ms. Daniels said. \u201cYou just have to sort of jump in the water.\u201dStill, the \u201cStep Up\u201d project represents a very educated guess. \u201cDance videos on YouTube drive millions of hours of watch time every month,\u201d Ms. Daniels said, adding that dance is a popular genre for YouTube around the world. YouTube Red is available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and has plans for overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.Music videos are also enormously popular on YouTube \u2014 the \u201cStep Up\u201d movies are known for their music-backed montages \u2014 and some of the biggest traditional television hits of the last decade, including \u201cEmpire,\u201d \u201cGlee\u201d and NBC\u2019s live musicals, have been rooted in song.Mr. Beggs of Lionsgate said that Ms. Daniels was able to nab the series in part because she was willing to commit to a full season without first making a pilot episode as a test. \u201cThat got everyone\u2019s attention,\u201d he said.The deal got its start at a New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Los Angeles home of Erik Feig, co-president of Lionsgate\u2019s movie division. Ms. Daniels was among the guests. That night, \u201cErik said the studio was getting ready to talk to distributors about a \u2018Step Up\u2019 TV show, and so I immediately started my hot pursuit,\u201d she said.More than most other Hollywood studios, Lionsgate has been early to spot the promise of streaming services as buyers of high-end television shows. Lionsgate\u2019s production roster includes \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d for Netflix and \u201cCasual,\u201d which was renewed on Hulu for a third season. (The now-concluded \u201cMad Men\u201d is still Lionsgate\u2019s best-known series, however.)Will \u201cStep Up\u201d provide the studio with another television hit, the kind that mints money by running multiple seasons? It is too early to say, of course, but Mr. Feig, who has been involved with the \u201cStep Up\u201d franchise from its beginning, has high hopes.Advertisement"}

I\u2019d thought I was the main character\u2019s best friend.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI was not.\u201dFour seasons later, Poussey has become the Litchfield Penitentiary inmate everyone wants to be best friends with, and not just because of her high-octane hooch. The true crime of Poussey, a military brat whose teenage sin was falling in love with the base commander\u2019s daughter, has always been hazy. But this season, available on Netflix on Friday, June 17, promises to be a revelation when Poussey meets her idol, Judy King (Blair Brown), a Martha Stewart-inspired lifestyle guru who has landed in the clink.In an interview at The New York Times in early June, the soulful, Juilliard-trained Ms. Wiley, 29, discussed role models and the love that calls itself Pousoso. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.This is a huge season for Poussey. What can we expect?I don\u2019t know about everyone else, but I\u2019m just really wanting her to find some love. And she finds this connection with Soso [Kimiko Glenn]. I\u2019m also excited about the whole Judy King of it all. They say, \u201cNever meet your heroes,\u201d and Judy is like Beyonc\u00e9 to Poussey. You really see that Poussey\u2019s mind is leaving prison, even though her body is physically here. She\u2019s just living in that place of hope.Poussey seems like a prime example of the trouble with heavy sentences for low-level drug crimes.Her original sentence was six years for having a backpack with joints in it. When you see someone like Poussey, who has so much potential, it\u2019s sad because it really does mirror life.You recently earned great reviews for the Off Broadway play \u201cDaphne\u2019s Dive.\u201d Did you go into Juilliard for theater?I always had theater in mind. I have yet to do Broadway, but it is still my No. 1 dream. There\u2019s something about a play, in which every single night is going to be different, that makes me feel alive.Danielle Brooks, who plays Taystee on \u201cOrange,\u201d was also at Juilliard.I sometimes get a talent crush on people because I\u2019m so drawn in that I become enamored with them. And Danielle is definitely one of them. She\u2019s just so vibrant.And your girlfriend, Lauren Morelli, is a writer on the show. Do you ever find your relationship playing out onscreen?No. [Laughs.] The writers are 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles, and that\u2019s where everything happens.Your parents are pastors. Were they accepting when you came out?My parents were the first black Baptist church in D.C. doing union ceremonies before [gay] marriage was legal. And they lost probably half of their congregation. But they\u2019re strong in their convictions, and they are people I really, truly look up to.How did their experience affect you?I\u2019ve seen my parents dragged through the mud. But I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today without them. I have a responsibility as a potential role model that I take very seriously. It\u2019s one thing to live my own life and know that I\u2019m O.K. But there\u2019s another thing I want to take on, and that is letting people know that they\u2019re O.K., too.What\u2019s the moral of your story?We can climb mountains with self-love.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could a College Degree in Comedy Be Anything Other Than a Joke?", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byThere\u2019s a maxim about comedy typically attributed to Lucille Ball, although it\u2019s one whose essence you hear echoed by almost any professional comedian: \u201cPeople either have comedy or they don\u2019t,\u201d the saying goes. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach it to them.\u201dOn a Tuesday morning at Emerson College last September, Erin Schwall was trying to flout this rule. She strode around her classroom with the purposeful gait of a seasoned performer and an animation that contrasted with her students\u2019 sleepy inertia. Schwall, a faculty member in the department of performing arts, asked four undergraduates to stand before their peers. She told the group to pretend to be one botanist, collectively, then posed them a question: \u201cWho invented the sunflower?\u201d\u201cDr. \u2026 Greg \u2026 Photosynthesis \u2026 from Cambodia,\u201d the students said, stumbling through the answer awkwardly, like four children stacked inside a large overcoat pretending to be an adult.Formalizing the study of comedy into an academic degree may seem like, well, a joke. But Emerson has made strides to pre-empt criticism. The curriculum is heavy on theory and craft, with practical classes like Comedy Writing for Television, Great Screenwriters: Wilder, Allen, Kaufman and Comedy Writing for Late Night, balanced out by headier electives like Why Did the Chicken? \u2014 Fundamentals of Comedic Storytelling.At a glance there\u2019s something absurd about the respectability laundering at work here. While no serious dramatic actor would disavow the merits of acting school and few musicians the benefits of rigorous training, the whole culture of comedy is invested in the opposite. You\u2019ve either got it or you don\u2019t. Humor isn\u2019t something that can be poured into an empty vessel; it\u2019s the product of the vessel itself being cracked open. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the loner mythology that surrounds the stand-up comic, which posits that genius comes only from private pain and public humiliation, each successful comic a grinning Horatio Alger who pulled himself up by his microphone cord.Schwall\u2019s class, and others like it at Emerson, remind prospective comics that joke-making can truly be a team sport. This attitude was apparent in Schwall\u2019s policy of discouraging her students from seeking laughs. At the end of the lesson, as the students gathered their belongings and shuffled toward the exit, she offered them a word of encouragement: \u201cI don\u2019t care so much about you guys being funny at all right now. For now we\u2019re learning to inhabit the structure of one aspect of funniness. The funny is going to come.\u201dIt\u2019s difficult to quantify the extent of the current comedy boom, but a glance at the statistics provides a sketch of the field\u2019s growth. In 2005, to use one metric, there were only 10 cable and prime-time scripted comedies on air, according to numbers tallied by FX Networks Research. By 2014 that number had risen to 84, and topped out at over 90 last year. According to Nielsen, 7 percent of around 325,000 broadcast minutes were devoted to comedy programs in 2009, a number that jumped to 18 percent of almost 440,000 minutes in 2014. On cable that percentage only rose to 5 percent, from 4 percent over the same time period, but cable as a whole exploded in those years, and that one-percentage-point increase represents almost two million additional minutes of programming.At Emerson, the comedy major is the brainchild of Martie Cook, a professor in the visual and media arts department and a former writer for \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cCharles in Charge.\u201d For years, her suggestion of a comedy degree had encountered the same objection from skeptical colleagues: Can you really teach someone to be funny? She thinks that question misses the point. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t understand is that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Cook says. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of saying the most serious person on the planet is going to come to us and they\u2019re going to be funny.\u201dAfter consistently making her case and laying out the benefits of such a degree, Cook got the approval to design a comedy minor, which began in the fall of 2014, as a sort of trial run to see how the logistics might work and what interest from students would look like. Cook cobbled the minor together from a number of classes related to comedy that were already being taught as part of other majors. When 45 students declared for it this past fall semester, the college realized that the time for a comedy major had definitely come. Emerson agreed to expand the comedy program and made Cook the director.One reason Michaele Whelan, the college\u2019s chief academic officer since 2013, embraced Cook\u2019s idea was a desire to foster further interdisciplinary programs at the college. Another new major, in the business of creative enterprises, will start next year, encouraging arts-focused students to learn how to apply business skills to their artistic practice. Like the comedy major, it applies a career-oriented gloss to a degree that might otherwise be considered risky, or even frivolous. It\u2019s as if they were designed specifically to placate anxious parents. In order to sell the comedy degree to the board, Cook had to make it clear that this was a theoretically rigorous course of study, that can draw on Shakespeare and Freud and other figures of the Western canon \u2013 and just a little more Woody Allen than usual. Some courses are more clearly vocational than what you might expect, more like studio-arts courses than anything else. For example, in Comedy Writing for Television, students will enact a microcosm of a Hollywood writers\u2019 room, creating spec-scripts for existing television shows, punching up one another\u2019s work and growing accustomed to the crushing succession of indignities that make up the life of the comedic professional. The first and hardest step toward learning to be funny is coming to terms with how unfunny you are today.The courses aren\u2019t so different from most liberal-arts electives; their narrow focus gives way to more universal questions. For example, the Evolution of Comedy reaches back to antiquity on through Renaissance commedia dell\u2019arte, Elizabethan England and the golden years of Hollywood, focusing on durable comedic constants like the trickster and the fool and the tools of caricature, parody and farce. Another course has students unpacking the texts of films like Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cThe Producers\u201d or Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cThe Temptation of Dr. Antonio.\u201d It\u2019s not just an exercise in close reading, but also a means to connect earlier modes of humor into the contemporary discourse about what is, and isn\u2019t, considered funny.In old pictures and videos from the time, the group\u2019s brash confidence, all tight bell-bottoms and sideburns, stands out. Leary had clearly discovered his comedic persona already: He sports sunglasses and a scally cap, with a cigarette dangling from his lips. If the attitude seems a little put-on for a private-school student, Leary says it was necessary at the time. They had little support from Emerson, and the faculty \u2014 which preferred the dramatic arts \u2014 was actually rooting against them. Brill, a veteran comedian and longtime comedy booker for David Letterman, says that a faculty member from the drama department actually heckled them at one of their first shows.With all of the college\u2019s theater space and funding going to dramatic arts, the young group resorted to guerrilla tactics, performing one-act plays, variety shows and musical numbers wherever they could find a little space \u2014 lecture rooms, churches and pop-up theater spaces. It wasn\u2019t long before the shows all regularly sold out, 300 to 400 strong, and they soon became one of the hardest tickets to get. Much of the work focused on political themes \u2014 Jimmy Carter was a regular target \u2014 but the subject matter swung widely from place to place, befitting what Brill calls the \u201csex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d tenor of the time. The drinking age being 18, they would serve free beer at many of the shows, something that certainly couldn\u2019t have hurt attendance. The stand-up comedian Mario Cantone, also a former member of the workshop, just recently found some memorabilia from the early days while cleaning his apartment: rolling papers that read \u201cEmerson Comedy Workshop: leaves them rolling in the aisle.\u201dThis might have been a one-time fad with no effect on later cohorts of students were it not for one English professor, James Randall, a co-founder of the literary journal Ploughshares and founder of Emerson\u2019s writing program. Randall saw no reason the college should draw a distinction between serious dramatic arts and comedic performance \u2014 not merely because of the inherent entertainment value, but because he figured there was little pedagogical difference; both offer the same lessons in writing, performing and production. He helped Leary and company lobby the college to give them funding and academic credit for their productions, and he won.The effect on Emerson\u2019s student body has been unmistakable. In the years since, Emerson has become something like Princeton or Duke, but for class clowns. For an institution of its size, with roughly 3,750 undergraduates enrolled per year, Emerson has produced a disproportionate share of professionals in the comedy world. Aside from Leary and Cantone, among its graduates are the comedians Jay Leno, Henry Winkler, Bill Burr and Joe Mande; television producers like Norman Lear (\u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d), Max Mutchnick (\u201cWill & Grace\u201d) and Kevin Bright (\u201cFriends\u201d); and staff writers on nearly every comedic enterprise you can think of, from The Onion to \u201cThe Late Show\u201d to \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201dThe college leverages that extensive network of successful entertainers to help get their students into the business. While many institutions feature study-abroad exchange programs, Emerson offers a semester of study in Los Angeles in a program led by Bright, where students get a practical apprenticeship in show business. Bright has a saying about comedy of his own, one that runs counter to Ball\u2019s, and one you\u2019ll hear regularly when talking to one of Emerson\u2019s many successful alumni: \u201cEven if I can\u2019t teach them to be funny, I can teach them to work with funny.\u201dThat\u2019s a lesson Bright himself learned while a student at Emerson under the tutelage of Dan Lounsbury, the producer of numerous midcentury radio and television programs like \u201cYour Hit Parade.\u201d After graduation, Lounsbury introduced him to people in Los Angeles and helped him land his first job in the field. It\u2019s a favor Bright has tried to repay to fellow alumni every since.Max Mutchnick, who has a building named for him at Emerson, also says he gives precedence to Emerson graduates when looking to hire people in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say when I look at a bunch of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, that that degree from that school doesn\u2019t give a person I\u2019m meeting with a leg up, it just does,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my duty as an Emerson alumni to hire other Emersonians.\u201dQuinn Marcus, a 2013 graduate and star of MTV\u2019s \u201cGirl Code\u201d and mtvU\u2019s \u201cQuinnterviews\u201d agrees. \u201cEvery single meeting I\u2019ll go to in L.A., the person will tell me they wish they had gone to Emerson because they know someone who went there that they work with,\u201d she says. \u201cIn every single office there is definitely an Emersonian.\u201dStay with each other \u2014 that may be the most important lesson students pursuing a degree in comedy learn here. Comedy isn\u2019t made in a vacuum. It\u2019s a longstanding, ongoing, transformative discussion, both with the history of the form itself and with one\u2019s peers today. It\u2019s the only art we make naturally with our friends and loved ones, on a daily basis. A college education of any kind is no longer the guarantee of gainful employment it once was, and no student today thinks she\u2019s graduating into a fixed career path. But a comedy career, more so than most others, is a series of ad hoc improvisations and recoveries from repeated failure. A degree like this seems designed to ensure that when they do end up falling, there is a network in place to help students get back on their feet.In April, at a performance by Chocolate Cake City, one of the many campus sketch-comedy troupes, a group of students further along in their comedy training put that theory to the test. They had packed the Cabaret, a black-box theater in the basement of one of Emerson\u2019s many buildings lining the Boston Common, with a full house of around 60 for their final show of the semester. Loud hip-hop blared in between sketches, as the group hustled on- and offstage, setting up a relentless series of bits \u2014 a depressed Jimmy Fallon contemplating his poor career choices, a time-traveling mystery set largely in an Olive Garden turning on the availability of free breadsticks, a willfully terrible Billy Joel impersonator absolutely ruining the enjoyment of everyone in the bar with his staccato, robotic take on \u201cPiano Man\u201d and Apple-store employees treating a woman who cracked the screen on her iPhone like they were detectives investigating her for murder. Another bit featured a character called Netflix George, a guy who was capable of bringing every conversation at a party, no matter how unrelated, back around to what\u2019s currently on Netflix. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to watch a movie at the party, Netflix George!\u201d the others yelled. \u201cActually, they also have a lot of original television programming on there now,\u201d he replied.The room, mostly fellow students, howled, some so loudly that it was hard to tell if they were genuinely laughing or just trying to support their friends and classmates. But at this point in their lives, there\u2019s almost no difference.Luke O\u2019Neil is a writer-at-large for Esquire. He lives in Boston.Advertisement"}

A new prime minister with an environmentalist agenda announces that Norway will shut down its oil and gas industry in the face of global warming. The rest of Europe, afraid of the economic effects, forces him to accept a peaceful Russian occupation of his country that\u2019s initially disguised as temporary assistance with oil production.The series plays out as a thought experiment \u2014 what will the Norwegians do as they gradually come to terms with their loss of sovereignty? While Berg (Henrik Mestad), the idealistic but pragmatic prime minister, tries to keep the situation from spiraling into outright war, we see the action through the eyes of various smaller players, including one of Berg\u2019s bodyguards (Eldar Skar) and a left-wing journalist (Vegar Hoel). In wry Scandinavian fashion, both of those men have trouble convincing their wives that world-shaking events are taking place, and are ordered to pick up children and wash dishes as scheduled.\u201cOccupied\u201d goes for big dramatic strokes \u2014 assassinations, gun battles on oil platforms, escapes into the safety of the United States Embassy (where the Americans aren\u2019t very helpful). Not all of its ideas pay off, but enough do to make it at least mildly addictive.\u201cThe Bureau,\u201d while a quieter and subtler show, is no less intense. It recalls the paranoid American film thrillers of the 70s (\u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d \u201cThe Parallax View\u201d) but the obvious referent is \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that show\u2019s world-weary Gallic analogue.The film star Mathieu Kassovitz (\u201cAmelie\u201d) plays Malotru, a French spy who\u2019s brought in from the cold after serving six years undercover in Damascus. We see his adjustment to life in the office, handling agents the way he used to be handled, and to life back in Paris, where he\u2019s reunited with his understandably wary daughter. When he explains the nature of undercover work to her \u2014 befriending people, gathering information \u2014 she replies, \u201cThat\u2019s why you left for six years, to make acquaintances.\u201d She would almost prefer that he had been killing people, which would better fit her image of a spy.\u201cThe Bureau\u201d builds its tension, revolving around a key agent who goes missing in Algeria, more slowly and elliptically than many American shows. And there\u2019s a certain amount of self-consciously arty cinematography and editing. But those are small quibbles with a series this consistently smart and understated. While training a new operative, Malotru tells her: \u201cYou don\u2019t recruit. You describe.\u201d The same restrained approach works well for the show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Is Hitting the Road Again", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Gas is cheaper than it has been in over a decade, and a nation weary of cutting back is getting behind the wheel and spending to make road trip memories.Supported byON ROUTE 66 IN NEW MEXICO \u2014 Bob Pack forgot to bring his James Taylor CDs. Still, he and his brother and sister were having a blast, rolling among the sandstone mesas, ghost towns and kitschy tourist attractions.They reminisced about family trips as children back in the 1950s, Mr. Pack and his sister, Joann, said, and not even their brother\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d habits of chewing tobacco and telling dirty jokes could ruin the drive. \u201cI wanted to see West Texas one more time,\u201d he said over breakfast at the Route 66 Casino Hotel.Over in Arizona, Kay McNellen, a 23-year-old actress from San Diego, said she took to the highway almost every weekend these days, just to see how far she could drive. She has motored across the Mojave Desert, admired Sequoia National Forest and Instagrammed the Grand Canyon. \u201cThis is a better view than Netflix will give you,\u201d she said.The great American road trip is back.It\u2019s partly that gasoline this driving season is cheaper than it has been in 11 years, according to the AAA motor club, and that the reviving economy is making people more willing to part with their money. But there is more than that at play here. This may be a cultural shift, as Americans experiment with the notion that maybe money can, in fact, buy happiness, at least in the form of adventures and memories.It is a change that appears to have taken root in the years since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cPostrecession, people are focused on memories that cannot be taken away from them, as opposed to tangible goods that expire and wear out,\u201d said Sarah Quinlan, a marketing executive at MasterCard Advisors. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that you can take away my job, you can take away my home, but you can\u2019t take away my memory.\u201dWhatever their motivation, Americans last year drove a record 3.15 trillion miles, according to the Department of Transportation, beating the previous mark, set in 2007. So far this year, both travel and gasoline consumption are up again.The desire to get behind the wheel still comes as something of a surprise. The conventional wisdom was that driving mileage had probably peaked in 2007. The demographic bulge represented by the baby boomers is aging out of the driving years; people typically drive less as they hit retirement.At the same time, millennials were not sharing the passion for the open road that previous generations of young adults had. Many, in fact, preferred to live in the nation\u2019s downtowns, eschewing personal cars in favor of shared Ubers, or walking to their work and play.But it turns out that both generations are driving more than anyone expected. \u201cA lot of millennial behavior was really deferred assimilation,\u201d said Steven E. Polzin, a transportation researcher at the University of South Florida. In other words, just like Mom and Dad, they were destined for a more traditional lifestyle \u2014 the marriage, the home, the garage \u2014 they just took a little longer to get there.One such millennial is Jenna Bivone, a 29-year-old website and app designer, who two years ago left downtown Atlanta to live on the outskirts of the city with her boyfriend. \u201cWe used to walk everywhere, but the rents were too high and we wanted some land for my dog,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a more suburban area we found good schools, stuff like that for future plans.\u201dNow she has a daily commute of at least a half-hour each way, and on weekends she and her boyfriend drive around Georgia and neighboring states looking for the best hiking. Over the last three years they have taken road trips in Wyoming and Colorado to hike in the national parks.\u201cWhen we travel we want to go to places we might never see again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be young forever.\u201dMichael McNulty, a 67-year-old biotech executive from San Francisco, might not agree with the last part of her statement. Last year he bought a used Ford Airstream B-190 motor home on Craigslist for $13,000 as an experiment. He and his wife are enjoying the road trips, he said, and they are gradually extending their radius.\u201cThe kids\u2019 colleges are paid for, and they are out of the house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been all over the world, and now we are seeing the U.S.A.\u201dMr. McNulty did all the driving to the Grand Canyon for an extended weekend in April, and he prepared to drive all the way back home, 14 hours, in one day. The reason was simple, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go for it on Tuesday,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cbecause I have to get back to work on Wednesday.\u201dThe phenomenon is being further amplified by, of all things, a desire in some families for cross-generational adventures that harks back to a halcyon age of bundling everyone into the station wagon, counting license tags from faraway states, and mediating back-seat fights over who started the fight. Baby boomers, it seems, want to bond with their grandchildren on the road. Rental-car companies are reporting increased demand for bigger vehicles to accommodate the generations.Along Route 66 recently, near the parking lot of Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona, Rita Bandy, a 62-year-old widow from Philadelphia, Tenn., described having just such an experience driving cross-country with her 11-year-old grandson last summer. \u201cHe and I together, it was just so wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw him so happy, laughing and joking with me.\u201dMs. Bandy pointed out that she had plenty of toys at home \u2014 a pool, a motorcycle. \u201cI have everything,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I want now is memories with my grandchildren, and to let them see that I was fun, and not just old.\u201dLast year\u2019s trip with her grandson was so great that her older sister Vicky said she was jealous and wanted to do the same thing. So this spring \u2014 along with their third sister, Gail, and two husbands, all retired \u2014 they piled into a Toyota van to take the classic American road trip, Route 66. After visiting Branson, Mo., and a cowboy museum in Oklahoma City, they stopped at the Petrified Forest on their way to California.\u201cI always wanted to see the Pacific Ocean \u2014 and now we\u2019re doing it!\u201d Ms. Bandy said just before entering the national park.Few, perhaps, carry a sense of wanderlust as far as Anne Utech, a 36-year-old federal employee, who found herself along Route 66 one recent Friday after visiting the giant meteor crater in northern Arizona. A year ago, she gave up her Houston apartment to go on the road full time in her pearl white Nissan Altima, which she has named Pearl. A copy of the Ralph Waldo Emerson essay \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d sat on the passenger seat.\u201cI do my best thinking while driving,\u201d said Ms. Utech, who works from her laptop and stays with friends or at hotels or takes short-term rentals along the way. Most of all, she says, \u201cI like to get lost, and Pearl is my best friend.\u201dAll of this has been good news for the hotels, restaurants, theme parks and other destinations that depend on travelers\u2019 rolling up on four wheels. Attendance at national parks last year reached 300 million for the first time. The 5.5 million who visited the Grand Canyon in 2015, for example, was a 16 percent increase from the year before, and park officials project a similar increase this year. On one recent weekend, during spring break, the car line at the south entrance was two and a half miles long, a wait that local rangers said was extremely rare.Theme parks are also reporting strong business, with attendance up by about 2.5 percent in 2015, according to initial estimates. Industry experts project a 2.9 percent increase this year over last.NBC Universal just opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction at its Hollywood theme park, which was estimated to cost $500 million, and it is just one of several recent expansions of tourist destinations in California \u2014 including Disneyland in Anaheim and Legoland California in Carlsbad. Buc-ee\u2019s, a convenience store chain, just got approval from Katy, Tex., to build a gas station the size of a football field with 100 pumps along Interstate 10.Part of the driving phenomenon can be explained by the improving job market and more commuting, but far from all of it. Public transit use was down slightly last year from 2014, while every driver averaged 2.6 percent more miles on the road. Rural and highway travel was particularly up. And early indications point to an acceleration of the trends this year.Changes like these come at an inopportune moment, given the commitment by the United States to make steep reductions in carbon emissions after the Paris climate accord last year. The fact remains that coming to terms with climate change, experts say, means people must burn less petroleum in the future. With Americans driving more miles at lower cost \u2014 and in bigger S.U.V.s, recreational vehicles and trucks \u2014 that goal is going to be harder to reach, at least in the short term.According to Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, most of the increased driving can be accounted for by the steep decline in prices at the pump. Gasoline prices have fallen more than 50 percent in the last two years, he said, saving the average household with two cars as much as $1,000 a year.New models of cars and light trucks, which under federal rules must nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025 to 54.5 miles per gallon, \u201cwill more than offset the behavioral increase of more driving,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 10 years vehicles will be consuming half as much fuel as they do today.\u201dFuel prices certainly figured in Frank Claeys\u2019s decision to take a 10-day road trip with his wife and two sons during their spring break. They were originally just planning to drive to Utah for some backpacking. But with a gallon of gas cheaper than some candy bars these days, they decided to stretch the journey all the way to the Texas Panhandle.\u201cWe were less tight,\u201d said Mr. Claeys, a 40-year-old police officer from Gaylord, Mich., as his children bought ice cream and shopped for polished stones at a roadside trading post in New Mexico. \u201cAt $2 a gallon, I don\u2019t cringe at the pump.\u201dAaron Conley, the 35-year-old owner of a Cincinnati lawn landscape company, has been taking long road trips with his girlfriend, Michelle Mercer, a bartender from Burlington, Ky. This year they drove to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, then took a swing around the Gulf Coast to Port Arthur, Tex.; Lake Charles and Baton Rouge, La.; and finally the Florida Panhandle.On a recent trip they flew to Las Vegas and then drove to the Hoover Dam; the Grand Canyon; Sedona, Ariz.; and finally Death Valley, Calif. \u201cWhen gas was $4 a gallon, we didn\u2019t travel at all,\u201d he said, recalling the early years of the couple\u2019s six-year relationship.And \u2014 in one sign of how quickly things could change again \u2014 they almost didn\u2019t make it to the Grand Canyon this spring. The reason? They discovered that prices were not quite as low as they thought. \u201cWhen we saw gas was $2.25 a gallon here, that was at the tipping point,\u201d he said of the difference between prices in northern Arizona and the $1.70 he had been seeing back home.Ms. Mercer was quick to agree. \u201cI\u2019d rather not spend a lot of money on gas,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Shareholder Vote Produces Odd Results", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsFacebook shareholders sent a curious message about the social network\u2019s governance this week. More than half of Facebook owners not named Mark Zuckerberg clicked the corporate equivalent of a \u201cLike\u201d button for just three of the company\u2019s directors.Weirdly, shareholders seemed to prefer the venture capitalist Peter Thiel over top executives like Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, and Mr. Zuckerberg himself. It is a brainteaser that suggests institutional investors are more inclined to tick boxes than follow their heads.First, some background: In the weeks before Monday\u2019s annual meeting, it was revealed that Mr. Thiel had bankrolled Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker, the gossip website founded by Nick Denton. The wrester, whose real name is Terry Bollea, sued Gawker for posting a sex video that involved him. A Florida jury awarded Mr. Bollea $140 million, and Gawker has since filed for bankruptcy.Mr. Thiel\u2019s personal vendetta against Gawker, which previously revealed that he is gay, raised important questions about his First Amendment bona fides. That matters because Facebook is diving headlong into the publishing business, where constitutional protections on free speech are critical. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Facebook is paying more than $50 million to media organizations, including The New York Times, to produce videos for its live-streaming feed.So it\u2019s odd that Mr. Thiel, along with Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, received 70 percent approval from investors, after stripping out Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s 59 percent control over Facebook\u2019s shareholders, according to a Breakingviews analysis. The only other director to receive a majority of non-Zuckerberg votes was Erskine Bowles, who was deputy chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, at 51 percent.Adjusting for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s share, Ms. Sandberg and the founder of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, did not muster a majority of minority shareholders\u2019 approval, nor did their boss. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen received the least support among Facebook directors, with just 45 percent of those voting sanctioning his re-election to the board.It is impossible to know why shareholders voted this way. Big investment funds like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard own 5 percent or more of Facebook apiece. Their votes are often determined by algorithms that take into account the recommendations of proxy advisory firms, which are themselves forged by qualitative factors like the independence of a director and time served on other boards. It shows that even the most disciplined of processes can produce oddball results.Advertisement"}

As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped.Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think \u201cMuslim,\u201d the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. It\u2019s of a scary terrorist character from \u201cHomeland\u201d or some monster from the news.Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. It\u2019s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family.

There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else.I understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, it\u2019s usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think I\u2019m a terrorist.But I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. 11, I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled: \u201cTerrorist!\u201d To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but I\u2019m not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history.One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear: Keep military-grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists. But, despite sit-ins and filibusters, our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association. Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles, but we\u2019re still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport. If we\u2019re going to use the \u201cthey\u2019ll just find another way\u201d argument, let\u2019s use that to let us keep our shoes on.The haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head. My building was close enough that it shook upon impact. I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan. My family, unable to reach me on my cellphone, was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse. There was absolutely no cheering.

{"Headline": "In Hollywood, a Focus on Manson and His Women", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byThis scene raises the question of what might have been had this man not been cast off at such a young age and had not spent more than half his life in prison, even before the heinous Tate-LaBianca murders sealed his infamy.\u201cJust villains are boring,\u201d the \u201cAquarius\u201d creator John McNamara said. \u201cWe live in a culture that really uses villains the way bowling uses 10 pins \u2014 to just knock them down and do it again.\u201dLike a recurring nightmare, the menace of Charles Manson continues to both haunt and fascinate us. The man who in 1969 orchestrated killings in Southern California, including the murder of the pregnant actress Sharon Tate, has inspired a spate of recent and forthcoming independent features and television projects. (Mr. Manson remains in prison.) And the focus seems to be shifting to his female disciples \u2014 known as the Manson family \u2014 with women handling the directing reins.Amid the competition, two projects have been shelved: a limited series for Fox from Brett Easton Ellis and the horror meister Rob Zombie, and a planned biopic with James Franco as another Manson victim, Jay Sebring, a hairstylist to the stars.\u201cHe\u2019s part of the American psyche now,\u201d said Sera Gamble, an \u201cAquarius\u201d writer and executive producer. \u201cI think he pushes different buttons for different people depending on what creeps you out or what frightens you.\u201d\u201cManson is unique and terrifying because he convinced other people to do things,\u201d Mr. McNamara said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t convince hardened criminals or Mafia members; he convinced suburban kids.\u201dOver 12 episodes last summer, \u201cCharles Manson\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d a series in Karina Longworth\u2019s podcast \u201cYou Must Remember This,\u201d explored Mr. Manson\u2019s complex relationship with entertainment figures and his obsession with fame. She said she was fascinated by the climate of paranoia that enveloped Hollywood after the murders, and how that affected cinema.Ms. Longworth said by phone from London that many films from that era were \u201cdirectly related to this sense that none of us are safe; people who look like us can do harm to us.\u201dHollywood\u2019s fixation on Manson comes at a time when cult leaders and serial killers have joined doctors and lawyers as the television protagonists du jour. \u201cI think in this era of \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 and \u2018The Jinx,\u2019 people are just especially fascinated by serial murder,\u201d said Jeremy Rosen, a producer on Ms. Harron\u2019s film \u201cThe Family.\u201d \u201cAnd I think in this time where safety is no longer a given,\u201d he said, referring to terrorism, \u201cI think people are just so intrigued and horrified at the same time. And for whatever reason, over 45 years later, Manson still embodies that intrigue and horror.\u201d\u201cThe Family,\u201d which is scheduled to start shooting in early fall, centers on three women who were tried with Mr. Manson: Ms. Van Houten, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel. The film is based on two books, \u201cThe Family\u201d by Ed Sanders and \u201cThe Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten\u201d by Karlene Faith. Mr. Rosen, the producer, called it \u201cthe needle in the haystack\u201d that led to a new perspective on the subject. Ms. Faith was \u201cthe prison-appointed social worker who actually deprogrammed the women and still maintains a strong relationship with them,\u201d Mr. Rosen said.Viewers will decide how much Manson and his deeds are relevant today. Of all these projects going forward, Mr. Rosen said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to live and die by the originality \u2014 something that will allow people to have some kind of closure or understanding instead of the expected.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about recent and coming portrayals of Charles Manson in television and film misstated the title of Karina Longworth\u2019s podcast about Hollywood. It is \u201cYou Must Remember This\u201d \u2014 not \u201cCharles Manson\u2019s Hollywood,\u201d which was the name of a 12-part series on the podcast. The article also misquoted Jeremy Rosen, a producer of the film \u201cThe Family.\u201d He cited \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d not \u201cMaking a Murder,\u201d when talking about a recent surge in interest in shows about cult leaders and serial killers.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m lucky that most of what I\u2019ve done holds up for a 55-year-old.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou want it to sound like you don\u2019t really know when it came out.\u201dCommercially, although the radio format known as urban adult contemporary \u2014 Maxwell\u2019s bread and butter \u2014 remains a force, audiences have also turned in droves since his previous album to services like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, where artists with a fire hose of fresh content, such as Drake and the Weeknd, tend to thrive.\u201cThe biggest challenge is that the last record came out when there was physical retail,\u201d said Rob Stringer, the chairman of Columbia Records, Maxwell\u2019s label since his debut in 1996. \u201cA streaming audience will not be as easy to find.\u201dYet Maxwell\u2019s target demographic \u2014 adult women \u2014 makes him one of the few artists (like Adele) who can still potentially succeed in selling CDs at big-box stores like Walmart. \u201cThere are five records a year now that will be able to find that physical audience,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just gotta hope that Maxwell is one of those.\u201dAlong with the consistent musical quality \u2014 \u201cThe body of work he put out in his formative years justifies why the fan base is so loyal and fervent,\u201d Mr. Stringer said \u2014 the wait between releases might also heighten demand. \u201cMystique has as much to do with why an artist remains special as exposure.\u201dMaxwell, who speaks in an intimate, low murmur and maintains a movie-star aura, has come to terms with his drawn-out process, including playing hard to get with fame and renown.\u201cI\u2019m so happy that my success has never been like 15 or 25 million records,\u201d he said, as if he were sharing a deep secret. \u201cThat\u2019s everybody in the world liking you. Justin Bieber, being as famous as he is, where do you go? It\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s tough \u2014 the guy put himself out there, and he\u2019s making millions of dollars \u2014 but can he just not be bothered? You\u2019re not seen as a person.\u201dStill, Maxwell is knowing about the optics of his \u201cchampagne problems\u201d and enjoys the comforts his success has afforded him, including the relatively low-key, jet-set lifestyle that took him to Miami, Dubai and a few islands between albums.For a traditionalist, he is also active on social media, especially Snapchat, which he uses constantly, and he gets a rush of energy \u2014 but always remains diplomatic \u2014 when gossiping about the unnamed Hollywood actor he shared romantic drama with, or the career arcs of artists hungrier for the spotlight than he claims to be.Aside from concern about his public profile, there is Maxwell\u2019s artistic diligence, an intense allergy to repeating himself and others. He eschews the studio trickery of Auto-Tune and will wait \u2014 sometimes years \u2014 until the right mood strikes him to lay down vocals. When the feeling hits, it works: He recorded the new songs \u201cListen Hear\u201d and \u201cLost\u201d in one take each.Starting out, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have ideals about \u2018this is how things have to sound,\u2019\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cMost people are business people. They\u2019re like, \u2018O.K. cool, I\u2019ll go work with Fetty Wap and Rihanna,\u2019 and they buy their little penthouses, and they\u2019re feeling sexy like that.\u201cI don\u2019t do it like that.\u201dInstead, Maxwell has kept the same small team of collaborators and business associates since he first hit it big alongside neo-soul artists including Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and D\u2019Angelo.\u201cThey were really down with the black managers and the black producers,\u201d Maxwell said of his peers. \u201cI was a little bit of a surprise to everyone. I walked alone with the odd guys,\u201d he said, playfully referring to his Jewish songwriting partner, Hod David, and white manager, John Dee Hammond.That outsider status was compounded by rough memories of his upbringing in Brooklyn as the half-Haitian, half-Puerto Rican son of a teenage mother. \u201cI just never felt like I had the D\u2019Angelo story\u201d \u2014 Southern, raised singing in churches \u2014 \u201cwhich is so perfect,\u201d Maxwell said.Maxwell, though, has stuck to songs of love and heartbreak. He says he keeps up with current events and even watches C-Span for fun. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a guy who\u2019s caught up in color and race and creed and gender and sexuality,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fight-the-power guy.\u201cIf Trump doesn\u2019t get elected, I\u2019ll probably make a ballad album of love songs. But if he gets elected, I\u2019m going to have to be a political guy all of a sudden.\u201dThe closest Maxwell comes to politics on \u201cBlackSUMMERS\u2019night\u201d is on the funky \u201cIII,\u201d when he sings, \u201cI just want a Michelle Obama lady/To hold me down when the world\u2019s crazy.\u201dThe reference \u2014 a rare topical mention in Maxwell\u2019s lyrics \u2014 came from the same place as most of his writing: an intense longing, and lingering anxiety, about finding that forever love. Such unions have long been on his mind: His debut album, \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Urban Hang Suite,\u201d climaxes with \u201cSuitelady (The Proposal Jam),\u201d in which he implores a partner, \u201cI only wanna understand you baby/So will you marry me?\u201d He was 20 when he wrote the lyrics.Unmarried, Maxwell said he struggles to \u201cknow how to receive love,\u201d which is complicated by the adoration (and thrown lingerie) he receives from female fans.\u201cI feel really good when I\u2019m by the water, reading a pretty good book and when I\u2019m really sure of the love that I have in my life,\u201d he said, adding that such bliss can be \u201cvery difficult to find because I\u2019m a little screwed up, because I\u2019m supposed to be, because then I write good songs.\u201cBut then at the same time, the music is so overwhelming that nothing beats it. It wakes you up in the morning and says: \u2018Write this.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Devices That Deserve to Go Along on Vacation", "Date": "2016-06-22", "News": "Supported byTech FixCHILDREN are usually forced to pick just one or two of their beloved stuffed animals to take with them on summer vacation. Adults should consider doing the same with their electronic devices.You don\u2019t want to weigh down your travel bag with gear you will barely use. And you probably should leave your more expensive gadgets at home, unless you want to become a target for muggers.What to do? My personal packing starts with devices that are compact and lightweight. The price tag should not exceed $500, and if my smartphone can capably perform a task, I don\u2019t bother with something that does the same thing.This happens too often: After cramming into your airplane seat, you shut your eyes to relax and a baby starts screaming behind you. You need a media device to drown out the noise with music or a movie.As for earphones, I will skip recommending a fancy pair of earbuds \u2014 just another small, valuable item to lose on a trip. The earbuds that came with your smartphone, like the Apple EarPods, should sufficiently drown out the noise.Most hotels include cable television, but after channel surfing for a few hours, you will realize that the only movies that ever seem to air are \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201dThe most annoying part of renting a car is all the upsells, particularly the extra fee for a GPS device and a mount \u2014 as if your smartphone did not provide maps already.When renting a house on Airbnb or a similar site like HomeAway, the situation may be different from a hotel if a large group and a kitchen are involved.This may sound odd, but I have found it extremely useful to pack a sous vide precision cooker on Airbnb trips. First, a primer: A sous vide cooker heats water to a precise temperature; you seal food like steaks and salmon into plastic bags and immerse them in the water to cook them evenly at that temperature.The benefit of bringing along a sous vide cooker is the amount of time it frees up for you to enjoy other activities instead of paying attention to your food. Imagine going hiking for three hours and returning to a perfectly cooked medium-rare beef roast. It beats going to a restaurant.When you\u2019re outside, you don\u2019t need much technology other than a camera. Assuming you bought a smartphone in the last few years, don\u2019t bother packing an extra camera like a GoPro \u2014 that\u2019s just extra space and another power cable to carry around.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A \u2018Honeymoon Tour\u2019 of Laughs From Natasha Leggero and Moshe Kasher", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byDuring that fateful assignation, Ms. Leggero was searching Mr. Kasher\u2019s car for a lost cigarette when she instead found a pair of women\u2019s underwear \u2014 not hers.Mr. Kasher, who acknowledged that they belonged to a previous paramour, said that he could still remember his panicked reaction.\u201cAll of my focus was on going, like: \u2018What? I don\u2019t know what those are,\u2019\u201d he said over a recent dinner with Ms. Leggero here. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know what objects are. I don\u2019t know what fabric is.\u2019\u201dMs. Leggero, who was not especially angry then or now, laughed at Mr. Kasher\u2019s recollection. \u201cThat\u2019s a good joke \u2014 you should do that in your act,\u201d she said.Though they had a proper honeymoon after their Oct. 11 nuptials, they have spent the past weeks on what they are calling their \u201cHoneymoon Tour.\u201d At these comedy shows in comfortable destinations, they perform their individual routines, then appear together. (The tour started on May 22 in Honolulu and continues through Monday in Los Angeles.)Yes, this tour, which offers the sufficiently rare sight of husband-and-wife stand-ups on the same bill, allows them to earn money while vacationing at luxury resorts (like the San Ysidro Ranch, where they were now dining).It is also an opportunity for them to bond as a couple, and to stave off feelings of isolation that many comedians experience.\u201cIt is the ideal way to tour,\u201d Mr. Kasher said. \u201cExcept for having to split the money, this couldn\u2019t be better.\u201dOver dinner, the two spoke with more tenderness for each other. Before they began dating, Ms. Leggero said, she was \u201ca serial monogamist\u201d; Mr. Kasher said he was \u201cbusy, romantically\u201d (by which, he added, he meant \u201cvery promiscuous\u201d).But, from afar, they appreciated each other\u2019s work, and Mr. Kasher said he considered Ms. Leggero the type of friend \u201cthat you\u2019ll text every six months to remind them that you\u2019re around, if they\u2019re ever single.\u201dChelsea Peretti, the \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star and a longtime friend of the couple, said that they were compatible because they were both \u201cblunt hippies.\u201d\u201cThey have this weird common ground,\u201d Ms. Peretti said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey both have this spiritual side and this side that likes to be indulgent. Moshe does Burning Man, and Natasha will do spa baths that I don\u2019t venture into. But then they both can be cutting and outspoken.\u201dMs. Leggero, who grew up in Rockford, Ill., was more guarded about her upbringing but agreed with Mr. Kasher\u2019s assessment that her parents were also volatile. (\u201cNext question,\u201d she said softly.)Mr. Kasher compared his hesitation to his fear, earlier in his career, of moving from the Bay Area to Los Angeles, where they now live.\u201cSomebody said to me, \u2018You know, you can just move back,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cI was like: \u2018Huh. Yeah.\u2019 The same thing with marriage. Why not give it a whirl? And if you fail, you can just get a divorce.\u201dThe wedding was a traditional Jewish ceremony \u2014 Ms. Leggero converted from Roman Catholicism \u2014 and took place at the couple\u2019s house in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.\u201cBecause we\u2019re comedians, we agreed: No bits at the wedding,\u201d Mr. Kasher said.But, Ms. Leggero added, \u201cHe let me have just one.\u201d After their vows, the couple momentarily disappeared, then reappeared to mock a post-consummation rite by holding up a sheet that said, \u201cShe\u2019s a virgin!\u201d\u201cIt was bittersweet, going to a fun wedding,\u201d Ms. Peretti said. \u201cYou go, \u2018Ugh, are we missing out on family and friends?\u2019 And then ultimately, we decided, \u2018Nah.\u2019\u201dAs professional partners, Ms. Leggero and Mr. Kasher said they did not compete over material or industry stature, though Mr. Kasher, who also works on \u201cAnother Period,\u201d said wryly that he can sometimes feel \u201ca power imbalance\u201d there.\u201cI make her scream \u2018executive producer\u2019 when we\u2019re making love,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a constant reassurance that I\u2019m valued and it wasn\u2019t nepotism.\u201dLooking back on a New Year\u2019s Eve when he was performing solo in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mr. Kasher said: \u201cAt 12:05, I was in the lobby of a Courtyard Marriott with some Doritos and a Diet Coke, headed to my room to watch Netflix. It\u2019s nice to be on the road and do these shows.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s so sad,\u201d Ms. Leggero said.If there is any downside to marital bliss, they say, it is the fear that happiness will take away the tension and the skepticism that shape their comedic perspectives.\u201cWhen you become happy, and your life is becoming more solid and stable, it is a little harder,\u201d Ms. Leggero said. \u201cI felt like I was much funnier when I had, like, $30 in my account.\u201dOf course, if they need to make their lives complicated again, they can have a baby.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely people in comedy that have had children for material,\u201d Mr. Kasher said.Her routine notwithstanding, Ms. Leggero said she was ready to embrace having a child, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not having it for material.\u201dMr. Kasher replied, \u201cWe\u2019re naming it Material.\u201dAdvertisement"}
