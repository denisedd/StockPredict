{"Headline": "U.S. Subpoenas Huawei Over Its Dealings in Iran and North Korea", "Date": "2016-06-02", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Huawei Technologies has become China\u2019s most successful international technology company, in part by tapping markets as varied as Britain, India and Kenya.The United States Commerce Department is demanding that the company, based in the south China city of Shenzhen, turn over all information regarding the export or re-export of American technology to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, according to a subpoena sent to Huawei and viewed by The New York Times. The subpoena is part of an investigation into whether Huawei broke United States export controls.Sent to Huawei\u2019s American headquarters in the Dallas suburb of Plano, the subpoena called for Huawei to turn over information related to shipments to those countries over the past five years. It also sought evidence of shipments to the countries indirectly through front or shell companies. The subpoena directed company officials to testify last month in Irving, Tex., or to provide information before then; it was not clear whether the meeting took place.Huawei has not been accused of wrongdoing. In a statement, the company said it was committed to complying with laws and regulations where it operated. The document, which was issued by the Commerce Department office that investigates export violations, is an administrative subpoena, meaning it does not indicate a criminal investigation.Still, the scrutiny over Huawei\u2019s dealings with those countries is emblematic of growing discord between the United States and China over control of global communications technology. It also illustrates how technology companies from both countries have been pulled into the high-stakes geopolitical contest over cybersecurity and the global management of the internet.If the investigation finds that Huawei was acting counter to United States national security or foreign policy interests, it could limit the company\u2019s access to crucial American-made components and other tech products. Given Huawei\u2019s size and reach, that could affect the development of cellular networks and other large-scale technology infrastructure projects across the world.\u201cWe do not comment with regard to ongoing investigations,\u201d a Commerce Department spokesman said.With the new investigation into Huawei, the United States is going after a much larger target. In 2014, Huawei reported revenue of about $60 billion, about four times that of ZTE. Depending on the measure, it ranks with Ericsson of Sweden as the world\u2019s largest supplier of the base stations and other equipment that make mobile telecommunications systems run.Though the subpoena did not indicate whether any actions would be taken against Huawei, any major United States step to block the sales of American tech equipment to Huawei would have major implications for telecom networks across the world. Many of Huawei\u2019s products use American components or work with American technology.Huawei has long benefited from access to easy credit from China\u2019s state-run lenders as it has expanded into areas where China seeks influence. But the company has drawn skepticism in the United States, where officials have put an effective block on selling its telecom infrastructure equipment. China has used the move as a justification to push back against the market dominance of American companies like Cisco, IBM and Qualcomm in China.Disclosures by the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed that as the United States publicly raised concerns about the security of Huawei products, the United States National Security Agency was busy working to tunnel its own backdoor access into Huawei equipment and to snoop on Huawei\u2019s communications to look for links to the Chinese military.Huawei has not shied from agreements that could draw criticism. In September, it signed a deal with Syria\u2019s Communications and Technology Ministry to help the country develop its communications networks.Huawei\u2019s business in Iran has fallen under American criticism in the past. In 2011, Huawei said in a statement that it would voluntarily restrict the growth of its business in Iran. A year later, six American lawmakers wrote a letter to the State Department, calling for an investigation into whether Huawei was violating sanctions on Iran. Recently, the Congressional Research Service released a report that said that companies like Huawei appeared to have fulfilled pledges not to sell technology for blocking telecommunications in 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei Draws Attention of U.S. Regulators", "Date": "2016-06-03", "News": "Supported byBitsOne of China\u2019s biggest threats to an American technology leader just found life a lot tougher.These countries are, in American eyes, outlaw states or places where the United States restricts exports of American gear, and the subpoena was issued at Huawei\u2019s headquarters in Texas. It deals with exports of United States gear, which could mean things that Huawei made even in part in the United States.It couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for Huawei. The Chinese company has 170,000 employees and annual sales of $60 billion, an increase of 50 percent in the last three years. Almost none of that comes from the American market, where Cisco Systems dominates sales of the computer switches and internet routers both companies sell.Huawei has worked hard to be a good citizen since then, boasting about its business practices and respect for intellectual property. Last week, it took the extraordinary step of suing Samsung of China for stealing Huawei\u2019s inventions in wireless technology.That amounted to a coming-out party for the company as a normal international technology player. Now the attention will turn to the Chinese habit of selling things to the enemies of the United States.The borderless world, it turns out, still has some very powerful guard posts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Enduring Heroin Market Shapes an Enforcer\u2019s Rise and Fall", "Date": "2016-06-27", "News": "Murder in the 4-0Tit-for-tat killings between rival crews preceded the death of Francisco Perez, whose life on a South Bronx drug corner spanned nearly three decades.Supported byUp the block came three young men, shoelaces lapping at the sidewalk, faces half-hidden in hoods, to pay their respects to a fallen street soldier.They stopped at a mural splashed with rubber-banded rolls of $100 bills, next to calligraphy spelling out \u201cHeart of the Hood\u201d and \u201cMoney come & go but Legends Live Forever.\u201d The face of Francisco Perez, six feet high and sun-dappled, stared out coolly over his old haunts. A red die showing five sat on a discarded bureau nearby.\u201cCisco, 12-26-78 \u2014 4-4-16,\u201d the mural read, referring to Mr. Perez\u2019s street name.Over nearly three decades, Mr. Perez held court on this block of East 157th Street off Melrose Avenue in the South Bronx. It was here that he climbed the rungs of the street heroin trade, wooed women, muscled out drug rivals from nearby public housing projects and, as he got closer to middle age, counseled young men to save themselves and to get honest work.By turns brutal and vain, comedic and exacting, Mr. Perez survived police raids, stickups, territorial incursions and a transformation of the city\u2019s drug trade as it came to rely less than it once had on hand-to-hand street sales.All the while, his crew and a former dealer shot at each other and tallied the hits. The bad blood led to the 2005 murder of a female bystander and, Mr. Perez\u2019s friends said, spawned a round of tit-for-tat shootings in the months before his death. As he turned the corner toward home on a cold March morning, an assailant hiding behind a row of cars popped out and pounded him with .40-caliber bullets. It was the fifth of nine murders recorded this year in the 40th Precinct, the second-deadliest precinct in New York City after the 75th in East New York. The homicide figure already equals the total for all of last year.Drug violence has plummeted since the early 1990s, when the neighborhoods of Mott Haven and Melrose and the rest of the precinct could see nine killings in a month. But some men still battle, though less conspicuously, over customers, turf and debts on the same corners, little touched by tides of economic change and opportunity.By the time of his death, at 37, Mr. Perez was a balding father running with men half his age, a throwback whose taste for Biggie Smalls, Air Jordans and knife fights harked back to the \u201990s. He promised to start coming home earlier and get a real job, but his past always stayed with him.\u201cHe had beef in a lot of places,\u201d said Nicolas Mendez, 23, a close friend. And Mr. Perez sometimes fanned the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s crazy a little bit,\u201d Mr. Mendez added. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bugged out.\u201dThe recent visit by his younger friends to the mural was brief. The most deliberate of the three, a coiled spring of a man with dark eyes and an angular face, bent over and lit a $2.50 votive candle dedicated to Our Lady of Altagracia.Then he announced, \u201cWe out,\u201d and they swiveled and strode down 157th Street to their corner.The mural celebrated the outer layer of Mr. Perez. This was the man of fur-trimmed coats and new Nikes, bottles of Hennessy and talk of accepting a long prison sentence to spare his friends from the same. A cousin, Maddie, said that persona hid a deep well of pain and an insatiable longing for family.Born to a mother addicted to heroin and a father whose name and whereabouts were always a mystery, Mr. Perez used to wake up on weekends at 6 a.m. to go door to door in the projects selling The Daily News.\u201cPapers, Sunday newspapers!\u201d he shouted in the hallways as he and Maddie, both about 9, banged on doors.They made 50 cents per sale. Mr. Perez supplemented that with a job bagging groceries at a C-Town supermarket, collecting tips in a small bowl.Once, half-jokingly, he loaded his and Maddie\u2019s socks into the dishwasher because her mother had no washing machine; he added dish detergent, ran the machine and split them between an oven and a microwave to dry.A crack epidemic and poverty were ravaging the South Bronx in the 1980s, and debris became children\u2019s playthings. They roamed a junkyard where people went for secondhand parts, sitting in stripped-down cars and mimicking an engine\u2019s roar.Crack vials covered the project\u2019s sidewalks \u201clike pigeon poop,\u201d said Maddie, sitting on her stoop in a city hundreds of miles from the Bronx where she had moved in her 20s. Out of fear for her safety, she asked that neither her city nor her surname be identified. She and Mr. Perez used to shout, \u201cDon\u2019t step on the crack, you break your mother\u2019s back!\u201dIn Mr. Perez\u2019s vast family, women were the anchors; the only male mentors he had were steeped in the aggressive ways of the street, Maddie said.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what a man is, because the only man that society showed you was the one on the corner,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty much that\u2019s what the Bronx shows you: the man on the corner.\u201dBy the early \u201990s, the corner of East 157th Street and Melrose Avenue was beckoning local children looking for easy cash, along with middle-class workers, like teachers and mail carriers, who were falling under heroin\u2019s sway.The intersection was among the Bronx\u2019s busier drug markets, just far enough from the hubbub of the projects and the police stationed there, and a quick hop from several thoroughfares. Arson and demolitions had left a single five-story building on the south side of 157th Street, with a few squatters inside. Heroin changed hands in the lobby and on a second-floor landing.\u201cWe used to call it the Well \u2014 you could sit a block off it and just pick off guys who were buying,\u201d said Charles McLiverty, a retired New York police detective who worked in Bronx Narcotics from 1993 to 1997. \u201cPeople would drive up in cars \u2014 New Jersey, Connecticut, upstate New York \u2014 and they knew this was the place to go.\u201dMr. Perez was in his early teens at the time, watching his mother sink into heroin addiction. The drug was making a comeback across the city as it became cheaper and purer, the first wave in a resurgence of heroin that is now swallowing many middle-class communities.\u201cShe would use heroin as a way to cope with physical and emotional pain, and Mr. Perez learned those habits from her,\u201d a federal defender, Annalisa Mir\u00f3n, wrote in court papers in 2014 after Mr. Perez was accused of selling the drug.When he was 13, his mother died from complications of H.I.V. His grandmother took him in, but then she died, too. He lived with an aunt until she moved away. A second aunt, Maddie\u2019s mother, took over raising him; about a year later she also died from complications of H.I.V.\u201cThat\u2019s how it started: death,\u201d Maddie said of her cousin\u2019s street life. \u201cYou feel like, \u2018Everyone I love is dead.\u2019\u201dMaddie and Mr. Perez, both around 17, took her mother\u2019s life-insurance check and moved into a one-bedroom public housing apartment in the northern Bronx.To cover the $550 rent, Maddie took a job folding clothes at a Dr. Jay\u2019s store; Mr. Perez studied for a high school equivalency diploma. He chopped onions and peppers for spaghetti, the only dinner they knew how to make, and pleaded in vain for Maddie to iron his pants before dates.Home life was weighted with loss and obligation. The corner at 157th and Melrose pulled him back. He told Maddie that the money he earned there would pay for studio time to record rap music, and that he would leave the streets once he became successful.\u201cI don\u2019t want a girl with extensions in her hair / bamboo sneakers, at least nine pairs,\u201d Maddie said, recalling an early rap, an admiring take, it would appear, on \u201cAround the Way Girl,\u201d the 1990 track by LL Cool J. \u201cA C-Town bag and a bad attitude / That\u2019s all I need to mess up my good mood!\u201dSix-foot-one and strapping, with a deep, easy laugh and a biting sense of humor, Mr. Perez had the personality and the physique to command a corner. He seesawed between being the block\u2019s Robin Hood and his crew\u2019s unforgiving enforcer.An older woman recalled him paying for her Pepsi, unprompted, at a deli counter. Young children ran up to him, yelled \u201cCisco!\u201d and jumped into his arms, drawn by gifts of candy. In summertime, he would drag a grill onto the corner and cook steaks, chicken and hot dogs, as Tupac and Slick Rick played on borrowed speakers.But Mr. Perez was also the first to jump out of his car and start swinging when an argument bubbled over. He often carried around a mound of marijuana, friends said, and took PCP for a time. He was known to have access to guns. When a friend once cracked wise about his fitted hat, Mr. Perez returned a withering look \u2014 and then never wore the hat again.\u201cHe had a temper and a half,\u201d Lydia Rosado, who lives in the neighborhood, said. \u201cThey would argue about stupid little things \u2014 music, girls.\u201d But, she added, \u201call the guys respected him.\u201dHe was a street-level dealer in a heroin ring besieged by competitors.The drug landed on 157th and Melrose by way of a dark, beat-up minivan driven from Florida every week by a man in his 40s, whom the police were tracking. Mr. Perez\u2019s crew stashed packages in apartments in private buildings on the north side of 157th Street. Runners as young as 9 picked them up and carried them to the street for resupply, where detectives watched the ballet of signals and handoffs in plain view.But crack cocaine dealers from the Melrose and Jackson housing projects a block west coveted Mr. Perez\u2019s crew\u2019s more lucrative turf and sometimes tried to steal their drugs or money. The rivalry was stoked by race and class, too. Mr. Perez\u2019s friends, many of them living in private walk-ups, disdained dealers from the projects, whom they saw as more wanton in their violence. The project crew was mostly black; Mr. Perez\u2019s was Latino.As his crew\u2019s muscle, Mr. Perez was targeted for robberies and beatings, friends said. Going to the police was akin to self-imposed exile. He built a reputation on responding with startling force.\u201cIn the streets you just don\u2019t make money, and then get power and respect,\u201d said a friend who worked with Mr. Perez, and who like many people interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid unwanted attention from rivals or the police. \u201cHell no. You\u2019ve got to put in some type of work, meaning violence.\u201dThe police arrested dealers in buy-and-bust operations only to find most of them quickly back on the street, whisked through the revolving door of an overburdened court system. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s crackdown on so-called quality-of-life crimes, especially on blocks considered in need of new development, intensified the pressure to make arrests, despite detectives\u2019 knowledge that younger dealers were waiting in the wings.Mr. Perez was arrested in December 1997, at 18, for selling heroin on 157th and Melrose. Two days after he was released and referred to drug rehabilitation, in February 1998, an undercover officer told him \u201ctwo\u201d and put $20 in his hand, according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Perez was accused of giving the officer two glassine envelopes of heroin.After he was sent to state prison for three years, the arrests picked up again: five in the next three years, on gun and drug charges. Being a felon made it hard to get a job, his family said. And staying in the drug trade for so long saddled him with a growing cast of jealous enemies.\u201cHe\u2019d tell me, \u2018Watch the projects,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mendez, his friend, said. \u201cIt was probably beef over who want the block since, like, the \u201990s.\u201dThreats to the crew\u2019s reputation from the inside took a bigger toll. Mr. Perez played a central role in tit-for-tat shootings in 2005 directed at a dealer who owed him and his friends money, court papers show.Drug bosses often worry that one late payment will embolden other addict dealers to default on their own debts. So the leader of Mr. Perez\u2019s crew went in search of the dealer on a brisk March night in a friend\u2019s Mitsubishi Galant.The rival dealer struck first. He raked the Mitsubishi with bullets, wounding the leader, Eric Martinez, and killing a neighborhood resident, Yvette Salamanca, who had agreed to drive him as a favor. Sitting in the car were 10 bloodied envelopes for heroin, stamped \u201cLucky Charms\u201d and \u201cAmerican Dreams.\u201dThe homicide investigation languished, without an arrest. Officers caught the dealer less than a block from the shooting and matched him with witness descriptions. He had been smoking so much PCP, though, that detectives could not get anything coherent from him and let him go. The wounded victims \u2014 Mr. Martinez and another heroin dealer \u2014 would not cooperate, either.\u201cI see them walking around all the time, and it pisses me off,\u201d Annabelle Olmeda, Ms. Salamanca\u2019s younger sister, said of the witnesses. \u201cI\u2019m sure they know who did it and they\u2019re just not saying anything. I doubt it\u2019s because of fear. I guess it\u2019s the code they have.\u201dInstead, Mr. Perez sought revenge on behalf of his crew. Three days after Ms. Salamanca was killed, he fired at the dealer. He missed, but the police retrieved 12 9-millimeter bullet casings as evidence. Court papers say he tried again four days later, wounding an associate of the dealer, though his family contends that the police confused him with another gunman in that case.Mr. Perez\u2019s jailing on gun charges weeks later did little to slow the bloodshed. The unsolved killing festered; without justice from the system, retaliatory violence spread like an infection.Mr. Martinez\u2019s brother, Christian Irizarry, shot and wounded the dealer and another man in the back on June 24, court papers say.The detectives investigating Ms. Salamanca\u2019s killing stopped showing up at her family\u2019s doorstep after a few weeks, her sister said. They shifted their attention to building a drug case against her old friends. Even decades after the peak of the drug war, targets like Mr. Perez\u2019s crew carried valuable currency in the Police Department. The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York charged Mr. Irizarry, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Perez with running a violent narcotics conspiracy.The case hung on the kind of unsavory alliance the police often stitch together to secure cooperation in drug and gang investigations: A central witness against Mr. Perez and his crew was the same dealer who the police were certain killed Ms. Salamanca.\u201cI think he feared for his life,\u201d Mr. McLiverty, who had transferred to Bronx Homicide and investigated the killing of Ms. Salamanca, said of the witness. \u201cHe figures: \u2018If I rat these guys out, they\u2019ll be away. At least I\u2019ll be safe.\u2019 It\u2019s like a survival mode.\u201dDetectives hoped that Mr. Perez\u2019s crew, too, would break down and inform on one another or on more senior drug leaders. But none of them spoke.\u201cCisco had an opportunity to work for the government at the time,\u201d Mr. Perez\u2019s lawyer in the case, Richard Herman, said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do it.\u201dSo prosecutors came down on him hard, threatening to bring his four prior felony convictions before the court, potentially doubling some of the mandatory minimum sentences he would face to a total of at least 30 years. At his lawyers\u2019 urging, he pleaded guilty to ammunition charges and was sentenced to six and a half years.The crew\u2019s leader, Mr. Martinez, and his brother had their charges dropped after the evidence against them crumbled \u2014 an example of how drug investigations often lock up street soldiers and let their bosses walk free.Sharon McCarthy, the chief of the violent crimes unit in the United States attorney\u2019s office at the time and a defense lawyer now, said that multiplying mandatory minimum sentences, as the government sought to do against Mr. Perez, cheated people out of a fair chance to defend themselves at trial.\u201cI think it was used a lot of times by the government as a sort of threat that would be hanging over a defendant\u2019s head, to essentially bludgeon them into taking a plea,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s coercive.\u201dAfter Mr. Perez got home in 2011, he and his longtime partner, Tara Sullivan, went to two counseling sessions together before she let him continue on his own, so he could \u201cexpress himself more and be open and honest with the therapist,\u201d she later wrote to a judge. He also completed a job training course.\u201cI think it was being out of prison that allowed him to see, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to go back there; I don\u2019t want to live that life anymore,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mir\u00f3n, Mr. Perez\u2019s federal defender, said in an interview.His chief source of encouragement was his daughter, born three months before he was locked up in 2005. He took her to school when Ms. Sullivan had to work, along with her boy from a previous relationship. He brought them to run on the track at Van Cortlandt Park.\u201cHis thing was, he was going to be here till she got older,\u201d his cousin, Maddie, said. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t have parents. He wanted to be here for her because his mother, everybody else, was gone.\u201dBut prison had also introduced Mr. Perez to more powerful drug distributors who, once he was back on the street, started supplying him with large quantities to resell, said the friend who worked with Mr. Perez. He encountered resistance when he tried to expand his crew\u2019s footprint by selling farther north.Men his age often become more cautious about selling drugs, or at least move off the streets into less visible roles. In the time he was locked up, many criminals had gone on to less violent, more lucrative schemes, like identity theft.Mr. Perez, though, had no second act. \u201cFive-seven is sweet,\u201d a woman who knew him from around the block said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that brings them back.\u201dAt the top of the drug trade, money was becoming concentrated in fewer hands; lower down, dealers like Mr. Perez were struggling to make as much as they used to, said William Cook, chief investigator for the city\u2019s Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor. His crew was just eking out a living.But in recent months he had showed signs of worry. He owed money to his distributors and to his friends. He kept a steak knife hidden in his car, friends said. He told people about gunmen coming to 157th and Melrose, but was evasive about why. He was shot at, but not hit, by a man angry at him over a romance.In a rap, he wrote of his enemies, \u201cThey wish my day would come.\u201dInvestigators are exploring whether drug associates thought that Mr. Perez had been \u201cskimming,\u201d stealing drugs he was supposed to sell. Detectives believe he had recently tried to buy a big cache of guns. A man questioned in a separate case offered a different lead: that Mr. Perez\u2019s killer had shot him over a continuing dispute and then fled to Miami.His friends, though, are fixated on how the feud with the indebted dealer in 2005 had roared back recently, possibly snaring Mr. Perez. The rivalry reignited last year, the friends said, when an ally of the dealer wounded a friend of Mr. Perez\u2019s in a spat over women. As they tell it, a 20-year-old man from the dealer\u2019s circle was then killed.Mr. Perez\u2019s friends concede that others might have wanted Mr. Perez dead. But talk on the street, true or not, has turned to how the dealer wanted to avenge the 20-year-old\u2019s killing by gunning for the strongest, most intimidating man on 157th and Melrose: Mr. Perez.He was staring down a 1 a.m. curfew, set by his partner. They often fought over his girlfriends and his late nights; he had promised her he would return home early on March 18. But 1 a.m. came and went, and Mr. Perez stayed in an apartment around the corner from his crew\u2019s drug spot and drank from a gallon bottle of Hennessy.\u201cHe was like, \u2018You know, she\u2019s already mad at me, we was arguing, so I\u2019ll be home later on tonight to make it up to her,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mendez, his friend, said.Mr. Perez sometimes joked about how he was old enough to be his friends\u2019 father. But their youth also gave him an escape, and he trusted them easily.Around 2 a.m., after waffling a bit over going to a music studio for the night, Mr. Perez settled on driving Mr. Mendez and his girlfriend home and then facing his partner at their new apartment on Union Avenue, in a pocket of the 40th Precinct that was quieter than his favorite corner, but still only a short trip away.Mr. Perez was \u201cdrunk talking\u201d as he drove, Mr. Mendez recalled, and he urged Mr. Mendez\u2019s girlfriend \u201cto take care of him tonight.\u201d He peeked at the side mirrors of his white Nissan Altima, as he often did, looking for the police or rivals.After dropping them off, surveillance video showed Mr. Perez zigzagging through the maze of streets around his apartment building, parking and then grabbing a bag of Doritos from the car. There was a bounce in his step as he neared his building door.Two gunmen waited about a dozen steps away, crouched behind several parked S.U.V.s. Two other assailants were positioned at the other end of the block. The ones closer to him slinked between the cars and the green plywood boards of a construction site.Then one of the gunmen, slightly built and quick, lifted a .40-caliber pistol chest-high and squeezed off seven shots, shuffling like a boxer as he fired. He and the other gunman, who was trailing behind, took off running for a maroon van, got in and drove off.Bullets tore through Mr. Perez\u2019s groin area and left arm. Another pierced his forehead. Blood emptied onto the sidewalk. Somehow, he wriggled on the ground and screamed for help.\u201cHe said, \u2018I fell, I fell,\u2019\u201d said a woman who had rushed to his side. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, you got shot.\u2019\u201dSeven brass bullet casings lay beside him. The woman said it seemed as if he were being deliberately vague.\u201cI think he knew who his shooter was and didn\u2019t want to say,\u201d she said.Mr. Perez, his brain swelling, was put on life support at the hospital.Detectives collected ballistic evidence, but never matched the casings to another crime. They cataloged Mr. Perez\u2019s final calls on his cellphone. They found two unused cigars wrapped in foil that the second gunman had dropped.Surveillance video showed the maroon van and a second, smaller car following it away from the crime scene, and detectives pulled video from nearby businesses to trace the getaway. But the video trail dried up past a Con Edison substation near an expressway.Sergeant Michael J. LoPuzzo, commander of the 40th Precinct Detective Squad, worried about having to parse street talk that was sending him in several directions.\u201cThe more time goes by, the more stories you hear, and stories go from one guy to the next guy and facts change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like everything\u2019s different from what it really is.\u201dIn the weeks after the March 18 shooting, Mr. Perez\u2019s friends streamed to his hospital bed. They held smartphones to his ear and played his favorite song, \u201cLockjaw,\u201d by French Montana, a veiled boast about not snitching to the police. His body flinched, and his eyelids twitched. But he never spoke again. He died on April 4.Almost two months later, the sidewalk was still nicked where bullets had hit. A dark blood stain was fading. Two police posters, unchanged since his death, hung on the ground floor of his apartment building. Titled \u201cA NON FATAL SHOOTING,\u201d they offered $2,500 for clues about the wounding on March 18 of an unnamed man.Nate Schweber contributed reporting. Susan C.
