{"Headline": "MSCI Delays Adding China Stock to Emerging Markets Benchmark", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese stocks had seemed poised to join an important global benchmark, paving the way for overseas money to pour into the country\u2019s markets.But the provider of the index, MSCI, decided that China was not yet ready, again holding off on adding mainland stocks to its influential emerging-markets benchmark.The decision, announced on Tuesday, was a blow not only to despondent local investors but for the Chinese government more broadly. For several years, China had been pushing hard to increase its sway in global financial markets, an effort that recently resulted in having its currency, the renminbi, included in the exclusive club of currencies at the International Monetary Fund.A year ago, China seemed close to having won over MSCI, whose remaining major concern was the difficulty for foreigners to buy and sell stocks in China, where the government has significant influence over markets.One stock market crash later, however, the government\u2019s grip has grown tighter.The extra money flowing into mainland stocks, or A shares, would have provided a much-needed boost. Despite the government intervention, Chinese stocks have been in a deep slump, off about 40 percent in the last 12 months.\u201cInternational institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A shares market before its inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,\u201d Remy Briand, the global head of research at MSCI, said in a statement on Tuesday.MSCI said it would reconsider A shares for inclusion in 2017.The index provider\u2019s decision to delay for another year highlights persistent concerns among global investors about government meddling in local markets as well as the quality of regulation and company accounts.\u201cAccounting in China is a state secret,\u201d said Hugh Young, who oversees investments in Asia for Aberdeen, one of the world\u2019s largest emerging markets investors. \u201cOur money goes into companies, and we have had trouble finding the right ones to invest in.\u201dMost large investors get their China equity exposure by investing in large companies listed in Hong Kong or other overseas markets \u2014 like the internet giants Tencent and Alibaba \u2014 where companies must adhere to globally accepted financial rules and regulations. MSCI\u2019s weighing toward China was already 25 percent, the largest of all the countries it tracks; analysts were guessing that China\u2019s inclusion would add another 1 percent of Chinese exposure.MSCI said investors were also bothered by the stiff limits imposed on foreign investors withdrawing their funds from China.The verdict will do little to lift the mood in China\u2019s once bustling brokerage halls.On a recent afternoon inside a poorly lit trading hall near People\u2019s Park in Shanghai, a dozen or so elderly investors were chatting among themselves as the final minutes of another trading day ticked away.As the stock prices flashing on a bank of 21 LCD screens attested, the main Shanghai share index had staged a modest rally to recover from its earlier losses. But once again, the index had slumped back down into negative turf by the 3 p.m. close.\u201cIt\u2019s not about waiting it out, because if you try you will probably get wiped out,\u201d said Mr. Ye, a 62-year-old retiree who declined to give his full name when speaking critically about the government\u2019s stock market rescue efforts.\u201cIt is really painful,\u201d he added, estimating that most of the investors at the Shanghai trading hall had lost money over the past year. \u201cThis market isn\u2019t really regulated.\u201dThe MSCI decision speaks to the caution signs in the market.When the index company delayed its decision a year ago, mainland stocks were at their frothiest. They had more than doubled over the previous 12 months.At the time, the company said it was concerned about a number of restrictions in China. Certain rules made it challenging for global investors to move money in and out of the country, or even to prove with certainty their ownership of shares.Global investors also fretted about the curious ability of Chinese companies to stop trading in their stock whenever it seemed to suit their own needs. The practice stopped shares under pressure from falling further, but it did so by preventing investors from cashing out.With an eye on making the cut at MSCI, China sought to address these concerns in recent months.Last week, China said it would grant an initial renminbi-denominated investment quota to the United States, allowing American funds to purchase stocks worth as much as 250 billion renminbi, or $38 billion. American investors could previously buy into Chinese stocks through other methods, but the new quota provided significant direct access and ranked as the second-biggest of its kind under the renminbi program, after Hong Kong\u2019s.Still, efforts to improve market regulations may be cold comfort for ordinary Chinese investors who are still nursing losses from last year\u2019s stock market fallout.Mr. Tao, a 63-year-old retiree at the Shanghai brokerage who declined to give his first name because he spoke critically of the government\u2019s actions, said he used a bit of his monthly pension of 1,600 renminbi, or $243, to dabble in the stock market.Taking a break outside the brokerage to chat over a red Double Happiness cigarette, Mr. Tao said he was sitting on tidy profits until the market turned downward last June.Since then, his investments have given back more than 70 percent of those gains.\u201cIn investing, one misstep and you\u2019re nabbed,\u201d Mr. Tao said.He added that it could take years to recover his lost profits. \u201cNow I just want to wait it out,\u201d he said.Neil Gough reported from Shanghai and Landon Thomas Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank President Nikesh Arora Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2016-06-21", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 A former Google executive and Silicon Valley star was on course to be the next chief executive of SoftBank of Japan, one of the world\u2019s most prominent technology conglomerates. Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank\u2019s global ambitions.When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google\u2019s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent.Mr. Arora was vaunted for his deal-making prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son\u2019s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise.The honeymoon did not last.Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank\u2019s overseas deals. Investments in start-ups like DramaFever and Housing.com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered.And the carefully orchestrated succession plan \u2014 or what appeared to be \u2014 has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon.Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to \u201cwork on a few more crazy ideas\u201d at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer.\u201cThis will require me to be C.E.O. for at least another five to 10 years \u2014 this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,\u201d Mr. Son said.Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. \u201cMasa and I are still in love with each other,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cI will support everyone I invested in, and they know that.\u201dMr. Arora\u2019s legacy \u2014 good or bad \u2014 will ultimately be determined by his investment record.After joining SoftBank, Mr. Arora was put in charge of picking takeover targets around the world. His mandate was to diversify a company that, despite the Sprint acquisition and others, still makes about 70 percent of its operating profits in its home market. It owns a major mobile phone network and a controlling interest in Yahoo Japan, among other domestic assets.Expectations for Mr. Arora had been high. Besides his Google pedigree, he had been unusually well paid.In his first six months at SoftBank, Mr. Arora earned 16.6 billion yen, or $159 million at current exchange rates, including a signing bonus, according to company disclosures. That made him one of the best compensated executives in the world during that period, and one of the highest paid executives in Japan, a country known for relatively low pay at the upper echelon.He earned about 8 billion yen last year. Mr. Arora made a huge personal financial commitment to SoftBank in 2015, buying 60 billion yen of the company\u2019s shares.But some of his bets haven\u2019t panned out. DramaFever, a Korean video site, shed traffic months after SoftBank invested in the business, prompting the Japanese company to find buyers for some of its stake.This year, SoftBank has defended Mr. Arora against criticism from a group of mostly anonymous international shareholders, who laid out their case against Mr. Arora in a letter to the company\u2019s board in April. They said a number of start-ups he backed have fizzled. They also questioned his decision to remain an adviser to an American investment firm, Silver Lake, that could potentially compete with SoftBank for deals.\u201cMr. Arora\u2019s investment strategy as the C.E.O. of SIMI appears to be nothing more than throwing a dart at a dart board,\u201d a lawyer representing the investors wrote in the letter, referring to SoftBank\u2019s internet and media operations as SIMI. \u201cHow many more millions of dollars of shareholder value must be wasted before the board realizes something must be done?\u201dA representative for Silver Lake declined to comment. Advisers like Mr. Arora generally receive limited insight into the private equity firm\u2019s deliberations and spend only a few hours a month with Silver Lake.SoftBank said on Monday that an internal panel set up to investigate the investors\u2019 claims had found no evidence of conflict of interest or other misconduct. Still, the episode may have shaken Mr. Son\u2019s trust in Mr. Arora, soured Mr. Arora on SoftBank, or both.\u201cClean chit from board after through review. Time for me to move on,\u201d Mr. Arora said in another tweet on Tuesday.And it was always an open question whether Mr. Son would readily give up control.Mr. Arora was one of only a small number of non-Japanese to have attained a top management position at a major Japanese company. He faced fewer bureaucratic and cultural obstacles than most, in part because SoftBank\u2019s power structure is simple. SoftBanks starts and ends with Mr. Son, who founded the company in the 1980s and runs it with unquestioned authority.\u201cI feel my work is not done,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement on Tuesday.An article on Wednesday about the abrupt departure of Nikesh Arora, who was in line to be chief executive of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, referred incorrectly in some editions to the Chinese company Alibaba\u2019s main line of business. It is e-commerce, not search.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Global Stakes of a Saudi Aramco I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorIt\u2019s hard to get one\u2019s head around it: An initial public offering that would value a company in the trillions of dollars. That\u2019s trillions, with a T.It\u2019s so big that the company\u2019s valuation is estimated at $1 trillion to $2 trillion; some put the figure as high as $10 trillion.A sale of a 5 percent stake would be the largest I.P.O. ever, with proceeds most likely approaching $100 billion. The investment banker fees may exceed $1 billion, which has prompted a feeding frenzy at this once-in-a-lifetime sale.Even so, the real eye-opening development may not be the amount of money involved, but where the Saudi government chooses to list the shares.If it decides to list only on the home country exchange, it will be a conservative choice with minimal impact. But if it seeks a listing in New York, London or Hong Kong, it could be revolutionary.The choice matters so much because this can really be thought of as an I.P.O. of the whole country.If Aramco lists only on the Saudi exchange, the I.P.O. will swamp the current market capitalization of the exchange, which is $300 billion to $400 billion, and dominate trading. In this environment where the company is the dominant one and is a creature of the state, Aramco can set its own rules on disclosure and other regulation, providing little comfort to foreign shareholders.If Aramco goes to New York, it will be subjecting itself to the full array of United States securities laws applicable to foreign companies. This will require extensive disclosure and will subject the company to the scrutiny of the public market.It would also mean that American investors, both big and small, could easily invest. A New York listing would be a way of bringing the company \u2014 and by implication, the country \u2014 into the full financial sphere.This may be why the Saudis are considering such a move. The kingdom knows that its century\u2019s worth of oil reserves may very likely never be used as the world shifts to greener, carbon-free energy. So it is selling now to reap some money while the going is good. Moreover, given the state of the Saudi budget and its current budget deficit \u2014 $98 billion last year \u2014 a successful I.P.O. will help ease local economic woes.Nonetheless, an offering is a step in transitioning the kingdom toward a more sustainable and more open post-oil economy.Having Aramco subject to United States financial reporting will itself be something of a shock to the Saudi system. It would be as if an entire country suddenly became listed and regulated by outside capital markets.That New York is even being considered for the offering highlights the continued strength of American capital markets in the years after the financial crisis.When issuers choose to list abroad these days, for the most part they go to New York. The only other real competitor is London. And when these global I.P.O.s happen, it is American banks that largely organize them. In this case, the lead adviser for Aramco is JPMorgan Chase, which has worked with the kingdom for decades. It stands first in line for what could be more than $1 billion in fees.This is a remarkable turn of events. After the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002, there was a loud outcry that the United States was losing its stock listings.And these were listings by prominent companies like Alibaba, Manchester United and Ferrari.This is where it gets interesting for the Aramco I.P.O. If it does decide to list to the United States, a difficult task awaits. Audited financial statements for a public company would need to be prepared, work that could take years. Aramco would have to decide which assets to keep and which would remain private.The state\u2019s control will have to be formalized, including whether the offering will include an interest in the kingdom\u2019s oil reserves or be confined to other assets.Aramco, which is generally regarded as well run for a state enterprise, will have to adopt a board that may have outside members and to prepare for the criticism of the market. Some trimming of fat will also be needed. In recent years, the company has invested far afield in chemical and solar assets.Because of this, I am skeptical that an I.P.O. will happen soon. But I am also optimistic that if it does, and it goes to list in New York or London or Hong Kong, this can be a game changer for a country that is seeking to diversify its economy. (And yes, like all emerging market offerings, this is a risky one \u2014 perhaps even more so given the state of the Middle East and world oil \u2014 so retail buyers should beware.)I may be overstating the potential for Saudi Arabia, which is still very much a closed regime and will probably remain one for some time. But the attraction of the United States stock market \u2014 and the disclosures and changes the Saudis would have to make to take part \u2014 show the transformative power of global capital. An Aramco I.P.O. could be a victory for New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Rival\u2019s $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of China\u2019s Ride-Sharing Market", "Date": "2016-06-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 With more internet users than any other country and a fast-rising middle class, China is one of the most sought-after markets in the world.Recent fund-raising rounds in the ride-sharing market show it is also one of the most expensive.The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising.That Didi\u2019s valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the market\u2019s difficulties.In part because of China\u2019s widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business.In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting America\u2019s biggest tech company against America\u2019s best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth.The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China.Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials.Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given China\u2019s unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.Although both companies have said they plan to dial back spending, the new war chests accumulated by each may make that hard. Didi has said it is profitable in half of the 400 cities it operates in, while Uber has said it is spending a quarter what it was spending per ride in China last year and providing four times as many rides.Uber continues to press Didi in smaller cities. Uber said in a recent news release it is now in 60 Chinese cities, and in Zhengzhou, a provincial capital in central China, Uber said it hit a million trips less than a month after it entered in late May.In its statement Didi said it had procured $4.5 billion in equity investment from Apple, China Life, Ant Financial and other existing shareholders like SoftBank, Tencent and Alibaba. China Merchants Bank offered a syndicated loan of up to $2.5 billion as a part of the fund-raising, and China Life offered $300 million as a long-term debt investment.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank to Sell a Stake in Alibaba", "Date": "2016-05-31", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When the Alibaba Group was barely a year old in 2000, the fledgling Chinese e-commerce company gained an early believer and investor in Masayoshi Son, the outspoken Japanese telecommunications mogul.Sixteen years later, Mr. Son and his telecommunications company, SoftBank, are finally selling a portion of that stake after its value has mushroomed to billions of dollars.SoftBank said it would remain one of Alibaba\u2019s biggest shareholders, with a stake of about 28 percent after the share sale.The move comes as the Japanese telecom concern tries to cut costs and focus on turning around Sprint, the American cellphone service provider it controls. Though the rest of SoftBank, including its expansive Japanese wireless network and the Yahoo Japan business that it runs, is performing well, Sprint remains far behind its United States counterparts in customers and sales.That has prompted SoftBank, under its president, Nikesh Arora, to focus on cutting costs and shedding debt in its \u201cSoftBank 2.0\u201d strategy. The company reported holding about 8.5 trillion yen, or just under $77 billion, worth of long-term debt as of March 31, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ, a research service.Alibaba has become one of the most valuable assets in SoftBank\u2019s portfolio of businesses. The Chinese e-commerce giant made its debut as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 and now holds a market value of about $209 billion.The share sale, which has been in the works for months, has not been driven by concern over Alibaba\u2019s financial prospects, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The Chinese e-commerce giant disclosed recently that the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States had been looking into its accounting practices, and the company has said that it is cooperating.Under the terms of SoftBank\u2019s plan, approximately $5 billion of the stake sale would be packaged into a financial security that would convert into shares of Alibaba after three years.Alibaba itself will buy back about $2 billion worth of shares from SoftBank. The Chinese company\u2019s partnership, a group that essentially controls it through its ability to nominate a majority of directors, plans to buy an additional $400 million worth of shares.SoftBank will sell another $500 million shares to an unnamed government\u2019s investment fund.Even after the sale, however, the two companies said that they would retain significant ties to each other. Mr. Son, Softbank\u2019s chairman and chief executive, will remain on Alibaba\u2019s board. Mr. Ma will still be a director of SoftBank.\u201cThis investment has been phenomenally successful and, over the past 16 years, we have built a close relationship, working together on many exciting projects,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement. \u201cIn that time, we have not sold any Alibaba shares. There are huge opportunities ahead for Alibaba and SBG looks forward to the continued partnership.\u201dShares of Alibaba fell nearly 2.4 percent in after-hours trading, to $79.61.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tencent Nears Deal to Buy Supercell, Maker of Clash of Clans", "Date": "2016-06-15", "News": "Supported byOne of China\u2019s internet giants, Tencent, is near a deal to buy control of Supercell, the maker of the popular Clash of Clans game, in a transaction that would value the Finnish game company at more than $9 billion, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.If completed, the deal would show the growing might of China\u2019s online behemoths. Tencent, along with Alibaba and Baidu, has become a sprawling empire of internet businesses. With a market value of about $211 billion, Tencent controls WeChat, the popular messaging service in China, as well as a number of online multiplayer games hosted through its QQ portal.A deal for Supercell would be the biggest takeover by any of China\u2019s so-called BAT trio of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, according to data from Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.Buying Supercell, which has produced a string of mobile game hits with Clash of Clans, Hay Day and Clash Royale, would further bolster Tencent\u2019s presence in the mobile game market. Tencent is already China\u2019s dominant online game company, accounting for about 32 percent of revenue from the country\u2019s online game market in 2015, according to Niko Partners, a research firm. The company also owns Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends, a blockbuster PC battle game with an estimated 98.4 million players and $150 million a month in revenue, according to SuperData Research.Supercell is one of a handful of standout successes in the mobile game business, where it has proved difficult for many companies to make money \u2014 or at least to hold on to their prosperity. Clash of Clans, Supercell\u2019s best-known game, was introduced nearly four years ago and has remained one of the most popular apps for smartphones and tablets.On Apple\u2019s App Store, Clash of Clans is currently the fourth-highest-grossing app in the United States, while Clash Royale is No. 7. Both games are free, but like nearly all of the most lucrative mobile titles today, they generate revenue through microtransactions \u2014 purchases of virtual currency that help players advance more quickly.And players buy a lot of virtual goodies from Supercell. In March, the company reported revenue of $2.33 billion for 2015, up from $1.78 billion the previous year, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $964 million, up from $592 million. It said at the time that it had only 180 employees, relatively few for a company of its financial scale.In April, Supercell was making just under $4 million a day in revenue from Clash of Clans, SuperData Research estimates. In 2015, Supercell introduced Clash of Clans in China.Under terms of the proposed deal, Tencent would buy the roughly 73 percent stake in Supercell that is currently held by SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications provider, said the person who was briefed and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Supercell\u2019s founders would remain at the company.A representative for Supercell declined to comment.

{"Headline": "How China Won the Keys to Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byChina Rules10 PhotosSHANGHAI \u2014 Disney had pushed China too hard, putting the company\u2019s plans for a new theme park here in limbo. Now, Robert A. Iger wanted to kick the yearslong negotiations into high gear.Mr. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, took a corporate jet to Shanghai in February 2008 to meet with the city\u2019s new Communist Party boss, Yu Zhengsheng. Over dinner at a state guesthouse, Mr. Iger offered a more conciliatory approach, setting the tone for the next phase of talks.After that, Disney substantially dialed back its demands. In addition to handing over a large piece of the profit, the control-obsessed company would give the government a role in running the park. Disney was also prepared to drop its longstanding insistence on a television channel.For Disney, such moves were once unthinkable. Giving up on the Disney Channel meant abandoning the company\u2019s proven brand-building strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we\u2019re going to get everything we want,\u201d Mr. Iger recalled saying at the time.Mr. Iger\u2019s trip and the new attitude in the talks that followed appeased Chinese officials. Before long, they had struck a landmark deal to build the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, opening China to a singularly American brand and setting the pace for multinational companies to do business in the country.But Disney is sharing the keys to the Magic Kingdom with the Communist Party. While that partnership has made it easier to get things done in China, it has also given the government influence over everything from the price of admission to the types of rides at the park.Worried that importing classic rides would reek of cultural imperialism, Disney left out stalwarts such as Space Mountain, the Jungle Cruise and It\u2019s a Small World. Instead, 80 percent of the Shanghai rides, like the \u201cTron\u201d lightcycle roller coaster, are unique, a move that pleased executives at the company\u2019s Chinese partner, the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group, who made multiple trips to Disney headquarters in California to hash out blueprint details.Disney then ran with the idea, infusing the park with Chinese elements. The Shanghai resort\u2019s signature restaurant, the Wandering Moon Teahouse, has rooms designed to represent different areas of the country. The restaurant is billed as honoring the \u201crestless, creative spirit\u201d of Chinese poets.Such accommodation is becoming increasingly common. A growing number of multinationals have agreed to cooperate with the Chinese state through alliances, joint ventures or partnerships, all in the hopes of garnering more favorable treatment and gaining access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States.\u201cThis is part of the China trade-off,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cIf your market is so big, we\u2019ll accept rules and regulations we wouldn\u2019t in other parts of the world.\u201dFor Disney, if all goes as planned, the Shanghai park will create an ecosystem of demand in China for movies, toys, clothes, video games, books and TV programs. Mr. Iger has called Shanghai the \u201cgreatest opportunity the company has had since Walt Disney himself bought land in Central Florida\u201d in the 1960s.That site, of course, became Walt Disney World, a group of four theme parks that attracts roughly 40 million visitors annually. About 11 million visitors are expected next year at the Shanghai park, with annual attendance estimated to reach 20 million within a few years, according to Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.If all doesn\u2019t go as planned, Disney will suffer the wrath of Wall Street, which expects the resort to offset slower growth at ESPN, the company\u2019s longtime profit engine, and some of its other theme parks. The last thing Disney wants is another Disneyland Paris, a money pit that suffered from cultural miscues and, after 24 years, is still struggling to turn a profit. Hong Kong Disneyland, which is relatively small, has had mixed financial results since opening in 2005.While he delegated certain duties to lieutenants, Mr. Iger has been the guiding force. He pre-tasted the food, which will include items like pork knuckles and Donald Duck-shaped waffles, and decided which characters would appear in the parade. He has held face-to-face talks with Chinese presidents, prime ministers and propaganda officials.Mr. Iger, 65, has sought a personal relationship with China\u2019s paramount leader, President Xi Jinping. After Mr. Iger learned that Mr. Xi\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader, had visited Disneyland in 1980, he pressed his staff to find a photograph. A color photograph shows the president\u2019s father, who died in 2002, wearing a Mao suit, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Mr. Iger presented it to the Chinese leader as a gift and a symbol of their partnership.When Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle last September, Mr. Iger was among the American executives on hand to welcome him. At the White House state dinner a few days later, Mr. Iger was seated at Mr. Xi\u2019s table. Just last month, Mr. Iger flew to Beijing to meet the president at the Communist Party\u2019s leadership compound.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see the fruits of efforts over the years,\u201d a smiling Mr. Xi told Mr. Iger at a public meeting between the men at the Great Hall of the People in early May. \u201cAnd I believe the new cooperation will continue to yield new outcomes.\u201dIt may be all smiles now, but Mickey Mouse knows all too well what can happen when the Middle Kingdom gets mad.The year was 1997, and Disney had finally found a bit of success in China. \u201cThe Dragon Club,\u201d a Disney cartoon series, was popular in Chinese homes, and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d had given Disney its first big hit in Chinese cinemas. But then came \u201cKundun.\u201dAs part of a now-defunct effort to make films for more sophisticated audiences, Disney agreed to back the director Martin Scorsese, who wanted to make \u201cKundun,\u201d about China\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Chinese government, which considers the Dalai Lama a separatist, denounced the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.In the end, Disney decided that it could not let an overseas government influence its decision to distribute a movie in the United States. \u201cKundun\u201d was released, and China retaliated by banning Disney films and pulling \u201cThe Dragon Club.\u201d\u201cAll of our business in China stopped overnight,\u201d Disney\u2019s chief executive at the time, Michael D. Eisner, recalled.Although \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was screened in Shanghai in the 1930s, Disney really had no measurable business in China until decades later, when Mr. Eisner secured Sunday evening placement for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck cartoons on the country\u2019s biggest state-run broadcaster. That led to Mickey\u2019s Corner kiosks that sold consumer goods like Minnie Mouse-branded shampoo, and to more television shows.By the time of the \u201cKundun\u201d debacle, the demand was clearly there. Mr. Eisner just needed to undo the damage.Disney hired former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and mounted an intense lobbying effort. In October 1998, Mr. Eisner met Zhu Rongji, who had just been named prime minister, at China\u2019s leadership compound in Beijing. Mr. Eisner apologized for \u201cKundun,\u201d calling it a \u201cstupid mistake,\u201d according to a transcript of the meeting.\u201cThis film was a form of insult to our friends, but other than journalists, very few people in the world ever saw it,\u201d Mr. Eisner said during the meeting. (\u201cKundun\u201d bombed, taking in just $5.7 million against a production budget of about $30 million.)Mr. Eisner said the company had learned a lesson. And he introduced Mr. Iger, then Disney\u2019s international president, as the person who would carry on negotiations for a theme park. The Chinese prime minister responded favorably. Land in Shanghai, he said, had already been set aside.And just like that, the door to China started to reopen.The negotiations that followed were slow and painful. Disney had to navigate a thicket of agencies, bureaucrats and officials. At one point, Disney essentially had to start over in Shanghai, after a senior Chinese official was abruptly arrested on corruption charges unrelated to the park.There were sticking points large and small. Who would control the park? What kind of transportation infrastructure would support it? How were Disney\u2019s nightly fireworks shows going to work in smoggy Shanghai? There was also the not-so-minor matter of introducing Disney characters to a country whose icon, since the Communists took power in 1949, was Mao.\u201cDisney had to educate the Chinese government on how they operate, and the government wanted to persuade Disney that they needed a local partner to make this thing work,\u201d said Tang Jun, one of Mr. Iger\u2019s former lieutenants in China.By 2009, the Chinese government was finally on board. It took a 57 percent stake in the Shanghai resort, which includes revenue from hotels, restaurants and merchandise sold on the grounds. Disney also gave the government a 30 percent piece of the Disney management company that runs the property.It was in stark contrast to the deal with Hong Kong. Desperate to end a tourism slump, Hong Kong had given Disney breathtaking terms, including providing a majority of the construction funds. Disney gave up no management control.Confetti was blasted into the air. A 50-member children\u2019s choir sang as Chinese dancers and drummers paraded onstage. Mickey and Minnie Mouse frolicked in traditional Chinese costumes.\u201cThis is a defining moment in our company\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cAlong with our partner, the Shanghai Shendi Group, today I am very proud to announce the official launch of the Shanghai Disney Resort.\u201dWhen the Communist Party first invited overseas companies into the country in 1979, global businesses had to team up with the state. It wasn\u2019t pretty.As commercial interests clashed with socialist principles, there were wage disputes, allegations of intellectual property theft and conflicts over corporate strategy. To put it in the parlance of a Chinese proverb, it was like two people sleeping in the \u201csame bed, dreaming different dreams.\u201dPepsi found itself managing a tanning factory, as part of its Chinese partnership. McDonnell Douglas claimed that some machine tools had been diverted to a factory that made missiles, in violation of United States rules. The American and Chinese partners in Beijing Jeep disagreed over quality control.\u201cI now tell people, \u2018If you don\u2019t have to do a joint venture, don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Don St. Pierre Sr., an American businessman who worked for Beijing Jeep.After the blowups, China started to allow some companies to go it alone. But Disney didn\u2019t have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the park\u2019s front gate.The partnership is \u201cstructured so that it will work,\u201d said Mr. Iger. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount riding on it.\u201dBut Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade China\u2019s economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the city\u2019s easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disney\u2019s site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises \u201cperformances\u201d by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.\u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201dThe partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disney\u2019s new resort.The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the world\u2019s largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the park\u2019s television and advertising budget, since it controls the city\u2019s biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.\u201cThe more partners you have, the more potential conflicts,\u201d said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.\u201cEach of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations,\u201d he added. A multinational must then \u201ccontend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.\u201dWhen Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesn\u2019t require a ticket.\u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wang\u2019s criticism as \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. \u201cWe made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and there\u2019s a cost to that,\u201d he said.Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of China\u2019s political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disney\u2019s expansion and growth.\u201cI suggest that we shouldn\u2019t allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built\u201d in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. \u201cIf children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.\u201dDisney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with China\u2019s propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the company\u2019s global platform to \u201cintroduce more about China to the world.\u201d And he has done just that.\u201cWhen global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China,\u201d said John A. Quelch, who teaches at Harvard Business School and has extensive experience in China. \u201cThey need to demonstrate that they are willing to promote things the government is interested in.\u201dMr. Iger is trying especially to give Shanghai Disney some Chinese flair. He instructed park designers to infuse as many Chinese elements as possible.Builders collected indigenous trees from all around China, including a 59-foot chestnut oak from Zhejiang Province, to adorn the grounds. A \u201cTarzan\u201d show was directed by Li Xining, an acrobatics expert who once worked for the Chengdu Military Area Command under the People\u2019s Liberation Army. The Broadway version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will be performed entirely in Mandarin \u2014 a first.Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.\u201cWhat are we doing here that will make this park successful in China?\u201d Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. \u201cOne of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that it\u2019s theirs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3.5 Billion Cash Infusion", "Date": "2016-06-01", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor.Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom\u2019s main investment fund, in one of the largest-ever investments into a privately held start-up.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known for venture capital investing, though some members of its royal family have made some deals. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, for instance, has invested in Lyft, a competitor of Uber.\u201cWe appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,\u201d Travis Kalanick, one of Uber\u2019s founders and its chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cOur experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.\u201dThe investment came together after David Plouffe, an Uber board member, traveled to the Middle East in March and was invited to the Saudi fund for a briefing. The discussions heated up thereafter, culminating in the deal.Uber has drawn capital from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds, like that of Qatar, have also invested.Other tech darlings have been busy raising money from private investors as well, pushing back any need to join the public stock markets.Uber has been spending not only to expand but also to defend its territory \u2014 which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries \u2014 against incumbents in regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country.The Middle East is among Uber\u2019s increasingly important overseas markets; the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million there. Uber has rolled out its service in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.The start-up said that it now has over 395,000 active riders in the Middle East, up fivefold from a year ago, and 19,000 drivers.Uber said expanding its service may be a boon for Saudi Arabia, a country where women are not allowed to drive because of fatwas, or religious edicts, issued by conservative Muslim clerics that uphold a distinct segregation between the sexes. There is no formal law prohibiting women from driving in the region.\u201cOf course we think women should be allowed to drive,\u201d said Jill Hazelbaker, an Uber spokeswoman. \u201cIn the absence of that, we have been able to provide extraordinary mobility that didn\u2019t exist before \u2014 and we\u2019re incredibly proud of that.\u201dStill, Uber did not say that it planned to hire women drivers in the country, unlike in most other regions where the company operates.Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, who sits on Uber\u2019s public policy advisory board, has worked with Uber to usher the service into the country and has the support of female users of the service, said in an interview that the investment was a clear sign of change coming to the region.Saudi Arabia has looked for ways to expand its economy beyond oil, with the Public Investment Fund \u2014 which is expected to grow to $2 trillion under management after the country\u2019s state-owned oil company goes public \u2014 serving as a crucial part of that strategy. The $3.5 billion investment in Uber is out of the Saudi fund\u2019s roughly $750 billion in total United States assets.Part of Uber\u2019s possible attraction in bringing in a sovereign wealth fund like Saudi Arabia\u2019s is that such investors have far longer investment horizons than venture capitalists, who generally seek to cash out their investments after seven to 10 years.As part of the investment, the managing director at the Public Investment Fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, will take a seat on Uber\u2019s board, joining Mr. Kalanick and other directors, including Arianna Huffington.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand how this company has improved urban mobility around the world, and we\u2019re looking forward to being part of that progress,\u201d Mr. Al Rumayyan said in a statement.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Unspoken Reason Behind the Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal", "Date": "2016-06-13", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cLet me explain why.\u201dJeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn \u201cto control our own destiny.\u201dBut there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn\u2019s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201dIn its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft announced that it would buy the social networking site Linkedin for $26.2 billion in cash. LinkedIn\u2019s share value rose nearly 50 percent on the news.Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201dBut investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year. Stock-based compensation, he said, \u201cis the most egregious example. The very name says it all: \u2018compensation.\u2019 If compensation isn\u2019t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don\u2019t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?\u201dMr. Buffett also criticized analysts who \u201cplay their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring \u2018earnings\u2019 figures fed them by managements.\u201dIn April, Facebook, which also used to steer investors to use adjusted-Ebitda earnings numbers that also excluded the cost of stock-based compensation, announced that it was changing its policy. \u201cStock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense for the business,\u201d David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.Facebook\u2019s decision to change its practice was seen as a shot across the bow at companies like LinkedIn. Other companies, like Amazon and Intel, also account for stock compensation as an expense.It is not hard to believe that LinkedIn, barring this deal with Microsoft, would have soon been using the more realistic version of its earnings \u2014 and, in so doing, reporting more losses. The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice. In other words, from now on, LinkedIn employees will no longer enjoy results that looked rosier because their stock-based compensation was not figured in. (Though as a unit of Microsoft, it is unclear whether their results will even be broken out for investors to see).A spokeswoman for LinkedIn declined to comment, pointing to comments Mr. Weiner made in a memo he sent to employees.In that memo and in conversations with employees on Monday, Mr. Weiner said that the impetus for the deal was not about the stock, but was more about a larger trend that he and LinkedIn\u2019s founder, Mr. Hoffman, had noticed late last year: The biggest companies in the Valley \u2014 Facebook, Google and a few others \u2014 had pulled way ahead of the pack by increasing and earning the largest valuations, making it harder for smaller tech companies to attract top talent. Ultimately, they decided that LinkedIn was in a better competitive position if it, ahem, linked in with Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Tries to Shore Up Investors\u2019 Confidence", "Date": "2016-06-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group of China has disappointed investors since its record-breaking American stock listing nearly two years ago, as volatile financial results and regulatory run-ins have driven the price of its shares down almost to where they began.Now the e-commerce giant is trying to reassure.For the first time, Alibaba on Tuesday offered investors financial guidance for the coming year, saying that it expected revenue growth to accelerate from last year\u2019s pace. At a meeting at its Hangzhou headquarters, Alibaba cited strength in its core business, despite China\u2019s slowing economic growth, as well as benefits from new ventures that have raised eyebrows among some investors.The forecast comes as Alibaba seeks to demonstrate that its strategy, which has long focused on growth, is good for business.In China, Alibaba operates online sales platforms that connect consumers with mom-and-pop stores, as well as with global brands like Burberry and Zara. It has been showing sales growth on its platforms using a measure called gross merchandise volume, a yardstick for transactions across its platforms.Alibaba said on Tuesday that it would de-emphasize that figure, saying it would no longer report it quarterly. It will continue to report an annual figure, and offered a target for 2020.It had provided the measure at the request of investors, \u201cbut actually, in our heart, we know this is not exactly the only index,\u201d said Jack Ma, the company\u2019s executive chairman, who spoke at the investor event.Mr. Ma\u2019s decision to attend and speak at the meeting \u2014 he rarely speaks publicly on behalf of the company these days \u2014 appeared to be aimed at soothing investors. Mr. Ma, who founded Alibaba, has concentrated in recent years more on philanthropy than on the day-to-day operations of the company.In a wide-ranging speech, Mr. Ma recalled anecdotes from the history of the company, said he was confident about the growth of Alibaba\u2019s main businesses, and mused about its push into health and entertainment.Mr. Ma also defended Alibaba\u2019s efforts to fight the trade in counterfeit goods, which he said was not easy \u2014 partly because fakes have become much better.\u201cThe problem is that the fake products today, they make better quality, better prices than the real products, than the real names,\u201d he said, adding that many of the factories tapped by foreign brands had turned to websites like Alibaba\u2019s to distribute fakes and sometimes their own brands.Mr. Ma said it was not fake products but the business model of selling those products online that was the real threat to major foreign brands.\u201cWe also have to think about one thing: The way of doing business has changed,\u201d he said.If he seemed to be giving credit to the factories that churn out fakes, he quickly changed tone, making a fist over his heart as he vowed that Alibaba would win the war against counterfeiters.\u201cWe cannot solve the problem 100 percent, because it\u2019s the fight against human instinct,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can solve the problem better than any government, than any organizations, than any people in the world.\u201dIn recent years, some counterfeiters have become more sophisticated, making products so similar to the originals that only experts familiar with details like stitching can tell the difference between the real and the fake.Ms. Wu, the chief financial officer, said on Tuesday that the company expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which runs through next March, to rise 48 percent from the year before, which is more than analysts had estimated. Excluding some new businesses now rolled into its operations, Alibaba said it expected revenue to rise 36 percent, compared with 33 percent the year before.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of a letter from Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma. The letter was distributed last year, not on Tuesday.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Cao Li from Hangzhou, China.Advertisement"}
